00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:08.840
2640 lumens. 1 foot.
2.3 kilograms. 9 volts. Aaah!

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.980
I just closed the circuit with my tongue and
I felt all 9 of the volts.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.040
So what do all these things have in common?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.060
They're units. Yes, but they're also absolutely,
completely arbitrary.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:29.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.280
You know who decides how much a kilogram weighs?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.399
A hunk of platinum and iridium known as the
International Prototype Kilogram or IPK.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.259
The IPK isn't just how much a kilogram weighs.
In a very real sense the IPK is the kilogram.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.600
Every other kilogram is exactly the same as
the IPK,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.180
and the IPK is the lump of metal that decides
what that mass is.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.440
A kilogram is defined as being the same mass
as the IPK.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.819
We made kilograms up just like we made up
seconds and weeks and volts and newtons.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.639
There's nothing about these things that makes
them them.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.219
Someone just decided one day that that was
a kilogram.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.180
Now the fact that I find units fascinating probably says more about me then it does about units,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.820
but I can talk about them all day.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.200
For example, did you know that the International
System of Units only includes seven base units

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950
and every other unit is derived from those
units?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.830
Speed is length divided by time.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.950
Acceleration is speed divided by time again,
so meters per second per second.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.060
Force is that acceleration multiplied by mass,
cause F=ma remember?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.320
Work done in joules is force multiplied by
distance.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.579
And power is work divided by time, so how much work can be done per unit of time. Makes sense.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.120
It goes pretty deep, and it's absolutely correct to say that there are an infinite number of possible derived units,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.220
just most of them aren't useful enough to
name.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.679
But here's a bit of trivia for you. When I say watts or hertz, those things are just regular words.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.520
No special capitalization necessary.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.899
But Hertz and Watt, they were real people
with like last names that were capitalized.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.480
So what's up with that? Well, getting a unit
named after you is kind of the holy grail of science.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.900
To quote Richard Hamming:

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.030
"True greatness is when your name - like hertz
and watt - is spelled with a lowercase letter."

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.920
Of course when these geniuses were first piecing
together how the world works

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.240
they had no idea that there were fundamental
basic units beneath it all.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.910
They were basing all of their units on arbitrary
values because, well,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.930
how could there possibly be a fundamental
amount of mass or distance.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.560
Interestingly, one of the standard base units is derived from an actual value though not a universal one.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.880
The second is 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of the time it takes for the Earth to rotate a single time.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.210
That's something, at least but it also illustrates
an interesting point.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.420
As fundamental as that seems, when you get down to the dirty details things start to get kind of cloudy.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.480
The Earth's rotation for example is slowing
down.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.420
Does that mean that seconds should also slow
down?

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.270
No. That would mess up every calculation ever.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.310
So seconds are slowly becoming less and less
based on reality.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.780
Now don't worry. It's gonna take forever for
the Earth to slow down noticeably.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.250
And when it does we'll just keep adding leap
seconds to keep things balanced.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.590
But units are extremely important in chemistry
and in sciences in general,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.360
as we learned when the Mars Climate Orbiter
crashed into Mars

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.340
because instructions were inputted in the
wrong units.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.420
Next time you get a B instead of an A because
you didn't keep track of your units,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.220
just remember at least you didn't destroy
a 300 million dollar mission to Mars.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.060
But what do I mean when I say keep track of
your units?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.980
Well. I mean watch them. Do not let them do anything you didn't tell them to do because they're sneaky.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.780
And a lot of chemistry is just converting
between units.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.180
So say you are in a car, and the car is going
60 miles per hour.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.070
Now right now everyone who doesn't live in
America is like:

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.630
"Boo, miles are terrible. Convert to kilometers
Hank!"

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.190
Well I'll do you one better. From a scientific
perspective, kilometers are terrible too.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.470
They're just as arbitrary. We should use something
more universal.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.390
Like lightyears. The amount of distance light can travel in a year. And hours, hours is no fun.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.690
So let's convert to lightyears per second.
60 miles per hour.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.340
When you say it it sounds like a whole number
with a single unit.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.550
But it's not. It's actually a fraction. 60
miles over 1 hour.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.350
Let's start with the easy part. Getting to
the seconds.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.930
So first we've got to get to minutes. So there's 60 minutes per hour. And also 1 hour per 60 minutes.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.540
That fraction once we have it can flip either
way.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.500
We want it with the hours on the top, on the
numerator. Why?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.280
Because we want the units to cancel. We want
to destroy the hours.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.580
We don't want them in our units when we're
done.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.680
And then the same thing happens again with
1 minute per 60 seconds. Now we go to lightyears.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.560
I asked Google, and there's 1 light-year in
every 5.9 * 10^12 miles.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.780
Looking at this we see that the hours cancel
and the minutes cancel and the miles cancel.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.820
Leaving us with lightyears per second. That's
really what matters.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.620
We've come out with the correct units.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.340
The rest is just hammering at the calculator
to discover that a car going 60 mph is also going

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.320
9.3 * 10^-12 lightyears per second.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.840
Now we perform an important test. The "does
this make sense?" test.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.620
And yes indeed it does because 9.3 * 10^-12
is a very, very, very, very small number.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.460
Which makes sense because when you're traveling
in a car you're going

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.360
a very, very, very, very, very, very, very
tiny fraction of a light-year every second.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.720
Now there are probably gonna be fifty to a
hundred thousand people that watch this video.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.080
And I'm gonna guess that maybe a solid seven of you did the math along with me with your calculator out.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.380
Now I'm not giving you a hard time. That's
just my guess.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.060
If you want to follow along with your calculator
in the future that might be helpful.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.840
It would at very least be very nerdy.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.440
But if you have been following along with your calculator, you might maybe have noticed something interesting.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.520
I said 9.3 * 10^-12. When your calculator...

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:53.020
Your calculator probably said something like
9.3487658140029 * 10^-12.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.380
So why, when I had so many more numbers to give, did I only give two? Was I trying to save time?

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.980
Well obviously not, because now I appear to
be wasting time talking about it.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.580
Do you think that it would be too hard for
me to remember all those numbers?

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.830
Well obviously not, because I just did it.
So I will tell you why.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.600
When you're doing experimental calculations, there's two kinds of numbers. There's exact and measured.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.960
Exact numbers are like the number of seconds
in a minute or the number of eggs in a dozen.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.880
They're defined that way and thus we know them in effect all the way out to an infinite number of decimal places.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:31.320
If I say that there are a dozen eggs you
know that that's 12. It's not 12.0000000001

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.220
or 11.9999999. It's 12.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.640
But that's not true for the number of miles
per hour my car was going.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.580
That car wasn't going 60.0000-out into infinity
mph.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.220
I only know the speed of my car to two decimal
places because that's all I get from the speedometer.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:57.080
So the car could have been going 59.87390039 mph or 60.49321289 mph; the speedometer would still say 60.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.640
And no matter how well I measure the car's
speed,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.020
I will never know it at the same level of precision that I know the number of eggs in a dozen.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.640
So that's the second type of number, measured
numbers.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.360
Now the cool thing about measured numbers,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.280
because you never ever know them exactly,
is that they tell you two things at once.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.960
First, they tell you the number that was measured.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.960
And second, they tell you the precision at
which that number was measured.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.919
People often get their heads all tangled up
about this,

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.739
but with a measured number you just have to remember that the actual number goes out to infinite decimal places,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.350
you just never know all of them. You can't.
It's impossible,.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:37.640
So when my scale says 175 lbs, that doesn't mean 175.000000 lbs. It means 175.something lbs.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.400
And all those numbers after the five? We don't
know them.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.640
And here's the thing, a measured number can
be pretty unhelpful if you don't have knowledge

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.560
of the precision of the measurement.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.620
So you have to conserve the precision through
your calculations

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.070
or else you might end up killing someone with
an imprecise dose of insulin or something.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.800
So we have a set of rules for what are called
significant figures:

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.210
these are the digits in your number that you
actually know.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.260
With my speedometer there are two: 6 and 0.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.940
But 0 is weird, because sometimes it's just
used as a placeholder.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.680
Like if I said that the fastest plane can
go 13,000 mph, which it can by the way.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.680
An unmanned military test glider did it in
2011.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.780
That's not an exact number, those zeroes are
just placeholders.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.860
So when a number ends in a zero, or two or three zeroes, it's hard to tell if those zeroes are significant.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.800
But this all gets so much simpler when you use scientific notation, which since it's science we should.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:34.060
So 60 mph would instead be 6.0 * 10^1. We
get that zero is significant because we wrote it.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.880
Otherwise it would just be 6 * 10^1. We keep
that zero around because we actually know it.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.559
Scientific notation is awesome by the way,
once you get the hang of it.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.459
If you're having trouble you can always just
type it into Google or your calculator to

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.470
see exactly what number we're talking about,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.410
but the number of the exponent just tells
you how many places to move the decimal point.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.220
So to the 1st power you move it one to the
right and you get 60.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.860
To the negative 1st power you move the decimal
point one place to the left and you get 0.60.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.580
To the fifth power, one, two, three, four, five, and you get six with five zeroes or 600,000.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:12.160
Of course your significant figures get preserved,
so 2.4590 * 10^-4 is 0.00024590 and you still

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.780
get the same five sig figs.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.890
Now to the magic of figuring out how many
sig figs your answer should have.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.579
There are two simple rules for this.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.740
If it's addition or subtraction it's only the number of figures after the decimal point that matters.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.749
The number with the fewest figures after the
decimal point

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:29.189
decides how many figures you can have after
the decimal in your answer.

00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:34.169
So 1,495.2+1.9903 you do the math.

00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:39.769
First you get 1,497.1903 and then you round
to the first decimal,

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:45.420
because that first number only had one figure
after the decimal. So you get 1,497.2.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.320
And for multiplication just make sure the answer has the same sig figs as your least precise measurement.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:57.640
So 60 x 5.0839 = 305.034,
but we only know two sig figs,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.399
so everything after those
first two numbers is zeroes: 300.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:05.339
Of course then we'd have to point out to everyone that the second zero but not the third is significant,

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:10.599
so we'd write it out with scientific notation:
3.0 * 10^2. Because science!

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.340
Now I know it feels counterintuitive not to show all of the numbers that you have at your fingertips,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.500
but you've got to realize: all of those numbers beyond the number of sig figs you have? They're lies.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.499
They're big lying numbers. You don't know
those numbers.

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:26.339
And if you write them down people will assume
that you do know those numbers.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.020
And you will have lied to them. And do you know what we do with liars in chemistry? We kill them!

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.360
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:36.449
Today you learned some keys to understanding
the mathematics of chemistry,

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:40.209
and you want to remember this episode in case
you get caught up later down the road:

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:44.929
How to convert between units is a skill that
you'll use even when you're not doing chemistry.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:49.100
Scientific notation will always make you look
like you know what you're talking about.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.529
Being able to chastise people for using the
wrong number of significant digits is basically

00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:54.809
math's equivalent of being a grammar Nazi.

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:58.769
