00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.780
We're looking for people who just want
to get out there and explore and learn

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.600
and have an adventure, you know.  They're
gonna be riding alongside experts in the field.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.380
I wanted to give that kind of visceral
sense of how climate change is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.820
affecting people and ecosystems in California.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.140
and the bike ride seemed like the perfect way to do that.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.220
The name OnePulse shows how we are all
together in this you know and how we can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.880
all come together to solve global issues.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.060
Climate change is a big one and that's
 something that we need to address.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.760
We also would like to see how communities

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.360
are coping with climate change and what
steps they're taking to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.740
reduce their carbon footprint.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.540
So, it's just a really unique way to experience California

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.060
and the impacts of climate change on California.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.600
And I think that that actually might shape the
research that we end up doing.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.680
Becoming a rider with OnePulse is a once in a lifetime experience.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.700
You know,  you'll get to understand
the effects of climate change

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.660
You'll actually be supporting the 
research by raising funds.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.180
And the views aren't bad.
