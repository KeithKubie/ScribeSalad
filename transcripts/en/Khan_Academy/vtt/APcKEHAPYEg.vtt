00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:01.799
- [Instructor] This is a great excerpt

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:04.375
from Federalist 51 by James Madison.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.511
And just as a reminder,
the the Federalist Papers,

00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.008
which were written by
Hamilton, Madison, John Jay,

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.344
were an attempt to get
the Constitution passed,

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:14.423
to get it ratified.

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:16.304
So these were really kind of op-eds

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.439
that they were publishing
to convince people.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.319
But this is a great passage.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.368
If men were angels, no
government would be necessary.

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:26.641
If angels were to govern men,

00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.864
neither external nor internal
controls on government

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.495
would be necessary.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.039
In framing a government

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.760
which is to be administered
by men over men,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.464
the great difficulty lies in this:

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:42.343
you must first enable the government

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:44.368
to control the governed;

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:48.535
and in the next place
oblige it to control itself.

00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:51.896
And it goes on to talk about
how we can keep government

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:54.096
from becoming too powerful

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:58.511
by so contriving the interior
structure of the government

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:02.039
as that its several constituent parts may,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.176
by their mutual relations,

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:08.343
be the means of keeping each
other in their proper places.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.903
And so remember, this was in
defense of the Constitution,

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:13.824
so arguably this was in place,

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.920
that somehow this
Constitution had contrived

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.103
an interior structure

00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:20.743
so that the several constituent
parts of government,

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:22.311
by their mutual relations,

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:25.063
would keep each other
in their proper places,

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:27.687
or you could even say
keep each other in check.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.551
So in line with this passage,

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.943
there's really two big ideas
embedded in the Constitution

00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:35.752
as to how our government is structured.

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:39.831
The first is this notion
of separation of powers.

00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:41.879
We have three branches of government.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.119
You have your executive,
headed by the president.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.288
You have your legislative
branch, which is Congress.

00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:49.288
Legislative.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.320
And you have your judicial branch,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.820
which is the US Supreme Court.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:00.159
And this notion of separation of powers

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.623
is that you have these

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:04.224
fairly independent branches of government,

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.215
and the idea was to make
them reasonably independent

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.383
so that one group, one branch,

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:11.327
could not take over the others.

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:13.496
The legislative branch, Congress,

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:15.352
they're charged with budget,

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:18.671
and they're charged with
creating and passing laws.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.263
The executive branch,
headed by the president,

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:23.575
is supposed to execute,
run the government,

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:25.880
based on the laws that Congress passes.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.528
And you have the judicial branch

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.743
that would decide whether things,

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:31.639
say laws that Congress is passing,

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.161
or actions that the executive's taking,

00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.200
they say, "Hey, is that constitutional?"

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.303
Or they can interpret laws.

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:40.767
So these different powers

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.296
are put into these different branches.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.368
The powers are separate.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:48.408
Now related to that is
another very powerful idea,

00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:51.709
and this is keeping each
other in their proper places,

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.851
and so this is the idea
of checks and balances.

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.420
Each of these can't do whatever they want.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.852
They're all balancing each other.

00:02:59.852 --> 00:03:01.716
They all have checks on each other.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:05.883
For example, the executive can
veto the legislative branch,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.375
can veto a law passed by Congress,

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.223
but then the legislative
branch can override that veto.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:16.103
The legislative branch,
they control the budget,

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.215
so it's not like the
president or the executive

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.639
can do whatever they want,

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.255
or that they can just spend
as much money as they want,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:26.567
and the judicial branch, in
both cases, can be a check,

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:27.999
and they're saying, "Hey,
you're doing something

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.055
"that is unconstitutional," or,

00:03:30.055 --> 00:03:32.207
"We're going to interpret the laws

00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:34.479
"that the legislature has passed."

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.663
The executive appoints the judicial,

00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:40.127
but even there, you have to
get congressional buy-in.

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:40.960
So once again,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.911
you have these independent
branches of government,

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.495
all the power isn't in one,
and they are interdependent.

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:48.703
They provide checks and
balances on each other,

00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:51.751
and this is all about what
Federalist 51 is talking about,

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.951
so that by their mutual relations,

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.143
they are the means of keeping each other

00:03:56.143 --> 00:03:58.060
in their proper places.
