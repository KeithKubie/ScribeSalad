00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.040
In the last video, we saw that
China had increased its M1

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.050
money supply from November
of 2009 to November of 2010

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.920
by roughly $700 billion.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.090
What I want to do in
this videos compare that

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.450
to it's increase
in foreign assets.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.190
So if we move up here, and
once again, all of this data

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.930
is straight from the website
of the Peoples Bank of China.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929
And this is the URL
right over here.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.720
And so you could get
it for multiple years.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.761
and actually they have a
ton of other statistics.

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.020
And so this chart tells
us their foreign assets

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.970
and foreign exchange.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.440
And I'm actually going to
focus on foreign assets,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.550
because when they
print currency,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.920
and that's to say with
their printed Yuan

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
they go buy dollars.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.780
With that dollar they
could buy-- well,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.030
they could keep it in dollars.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520
They could buy treasury bonds.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.380
Or they could just
go buy US assets.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.040
So assets are the best
measure of what they're

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.430
holding that is denominated
in other currencies.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.170
So let's look at their
growth from November of 2009

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.760
to November of 2010.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.230
And this is why I
picked November,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.830
because we didn't have
December of 2010 in this chart.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.480
So foreign assets,
and once again,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.696
this is in hundred million Yuan.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:16.410
Foreign assets in November,
2009 183,651, and that's

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.970
in 100 million Yuan.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.600
And then you fast forward to
November, 2010 it is 212,733.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.619
So let's, once again,
put that in terms

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.410
that make a little bit
more sense, at least

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.820
for someone who's
used to dollars.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.400
And I used a very
rough approximation

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.200
for the US Yuan exchange
rate in the last video.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.870
It's actually
closer to 6.58 now.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.050
But it gets us to about
$700 billion increase

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.157
in money supply that we
got in the last video.

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:43.240
Now, let's check this out.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.960
So we end up at 212,733
hundred million Yuan

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.700
in foreign assets, November,
2010 minus 183,651.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.250
So that's the difference.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.200
Now this is in
hundred million Yuan.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.330
So let's multiply by 100.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.199
And so this will
be in million Yuan.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:13.720
Now if we divide this by 1,000
this will give us billion Yuan.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.490
So it's actually close to--
its 2,900 billion Yuan.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.406
So it's almost
three trillion Yuan.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.280
And if we want to convert
this into dollars--

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.820
I'll just use the same 6.5.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.100
I could use 6.58.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.030
Oh, let me just do 6.58.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.310
So divided by 6.58, to put it
into billions of US dollars.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.070
So you see that there
is a $440 billion

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.280
increase in foreign assets
when denominated in dollars.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720
So let's think about that.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.930
So let's think about this.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:54.550
M1, so from November,
2009 to November, 2010 M1

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.490
was up by approximately
$700 billion.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.659
And the foreign assets
were up by approximately,

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.450
what was that number
that I just had there?

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.395
Approximately $440 billion.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.230
So most of the expansion
of their monetary base,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.200
of their M1 base, was to go
out and buy foreign assets

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.480
over the course of 2010.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.890
And the balance is really
just to kind of support

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.140
the growth of the
actual Chinese economy.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.050
But most of it is to go out
there, buy foreign assets

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.050
in other currencies,
and actually help

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.460
keep the Yuan devalued.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.530

the Khan Academy for CNBC.
