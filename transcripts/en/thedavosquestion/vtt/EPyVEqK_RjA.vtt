[Background voices] DR. ARTHUR MUTAMBARA &gt;&gt; Hi,
YouTube. My name is Arthur Mutambara, one

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.540
of the opposing leaders from Zimbabwe. I am
here in Davos attending the world economic

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.590
forum about the young global leaders.
On thing that companies, countries and individuals

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.890
have to do differently is the way they understand
the nature of global challenges and the way

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.680
they develop and construct solutions to those
challenges. We live in a very interdependent

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:43.390
world where global challenges are interconnected.
Climate change, globalization, poverty, human

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.399
rights, HIV Aids-they're interconnected and
hence we need their wholistic and inclusive

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.620
understanding of those global challenges,
such that you can't serve the globe around

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.690
climate change for America. We're done addressing
poverty, HIV Aids and governance issuesin

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.450
Africa. As you address climate change, as
you try to address terrorism, you must address

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.340
the grievances of the poor. You must address
challenges of HIV Aids in a wholistic and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.530
inclusive approach to creating solutions to
global challenges.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.009
For example, more specifically, the world
must take a vested interest approach for the

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.310
crisis in Zimbabwe. Because an injustice any
way is an injustice every way.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.810
There will be only one kind of victory-global
victory-for the human race in one planet.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.630
We are in this fight and this trouble together.
