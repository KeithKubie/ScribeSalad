00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.170
- [Instructor] A cart of
mass, m, moving rightward

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.850
at speed two v,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.170
hits a slower moving cart

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.600
of mass, m,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
moving rightward at speed v.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.490
When the carts collide,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.210
they hook together.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.130
There is friction between
the track and carts

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.180
and between the moving parts of the carts.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.470
Which of the following best
represents the momentum

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.290
of the left-side cart
as a function of time

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.310
before and after the collision?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.480
So before we even look at the choices,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.090
let's see if we can
sketch it out ourselves.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.140
So pause this video

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900
and see if you can make a sketch

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.120
of what the momentum of the left-side cart

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.600
would look like as a function of time.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.340
And actually try to do it
for the right-side cart

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.980
while you're at it.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.450
All right now let's do this together.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.790
So just to make sure we
understand what's going on,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.060
this cart is moving,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.510
they have the same mass.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.500
This left cart is moving to the right

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.090
with a velocity of two v,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.340
the cart on the right has the same mass

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.470
and it's moving to the right
with half the velocity.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.040
And since momentum is mass times velocity,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.780
this will also have half the momentum.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.490
So one way to think about it is,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.810
if on our vertical axis,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.620
let me draw a straighter line.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.580
If on our vertical axis,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.990
we have momentum.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.030
Momentum.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.400
And on our horizontal axis,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.033
we have time.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.720
So this is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.710
time,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.400
right over there.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.080
So this left cart will
start with some momentum

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.730
but since there's friction in the system,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.840
especially in the mechanics of this cart,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.310
you're going to see it slow down.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.143
The force of friction

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:41.770
is going against the direction of motion

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.270
so it's going to decelerate it.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.530
And then its going to hit
the other slower moving cart

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.210
and that other slower,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.480
and one way to think about it is

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.490
some of the momentum will get transferred

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.110
to the slower moving cart

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.300
because then they're going
to be moving together

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.780
at the same velocity.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.350
And so, you could imagine,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.120
and then at that slower velocity

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.300
will continue to decelerate

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.800
because of the friction.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.870
And so the graph of momentum
over time of the left cart

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.400
might look something like that.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.290
Now, just for kicks,

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.123
if you wanna think about,

00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:12.900
what about the right cart?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.170
Well, the right cart has the same mass

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.890
but half the velocity.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.450
So it's going to have
half the initial momentum.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.480
And so it would also degrade,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.620
it would look something like this.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.710
But then right at the collision,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.800
the right cart would gain momentum.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.270
And then they should
go together like that.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.480
So these are the lines
for each individual one.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.870
And if you wanted the combined system,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.000
well, then you would add these momentums

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.050
and you would have something
that just would be a line

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.020
that degrades.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.270
But anyway, they asked
us about the left cart.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.170
And so we said hey, something

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.500
something that looks like
this should work out.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.493
So let's look at the choices.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.750
So,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.120
this first choice has
two problems with it.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.900
First, it shows a world in
which you have no friction.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080
It's just, the momentum stays constant,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.130
and so that means its
velocity to the right

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.020
is staying constant.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.570
And then when its trying
to show the collision,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.600
it makes the momentum negative.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.090
And this would imply that all of a sudden,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.350
that cart would be moving to the left.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.500
Where the convention that we typically use

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.720
is right is positive and left is negative.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.320
And so we can rule this one out.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.590
This second one looks a little bit better.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.510
But once again, it's assuming
a world without friction.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.540
Where the velocity stays constant

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.940
and so the momentum stays constant.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.010
And still you have the collision,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.280
and then you still have
it after the collision

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.490
the momentum stays constant.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.480
So we can rule that out.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.890
If they said it was frictionless,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.900
this is what we would have picked.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.510
Choice D, it's looking
good in the beginning

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.790
but then it shows that
the momentum goes to zero.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.070
Implying that the left cart
just comes to a standstill.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.100
And once again, we would not expect that.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.710
And so we would rule that out.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.373
And so this is very close
to what we drew, choice B.
