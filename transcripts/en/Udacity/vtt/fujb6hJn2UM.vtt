00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.540
Now that we've seen an alternative
way of representing polynomials,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.260
let's turn back to the problem
of multiplying them.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.910
Multiplying via the convolution equation
takes order nm time, as we've seen.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.620
If the polynomials are represented as
values, however, we can just multiply

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.390
the corresponding values to
obtain the values of the product.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.810
Note that I did have to start with
a number of points that was equal to

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.670
the order of the product here.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.130
Not the order of the polynomials
that we were multiplying.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.409
The fact that multiplying in the value
representation is so much faster

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.720
than in the coefficient representation
suggests that it might make sense

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.170
to convert to the value representation,
do the multiplication there, and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.150
then interpolate back to
the coefficient representation.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.670
We'll visualize the process like this.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.880
First we convert from
the coefficient representation

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.900
to the value representation.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.900
Then we multiply the corresponding
values to get the values of the product

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.450
polynomial, C.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.590
And then we interpolate back to get the
coefficients of the product polynomial.
