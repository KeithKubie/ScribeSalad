00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:04.082
- It is Super Bowl this
weekend, (bleep) yeah, America!

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:05.965
(cheering)

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.664
The superest bowl, the
athletes competing on this,

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:09.881
the grandest of stages have worked

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:11.460
their entire lives for a chance to compete

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.307
at the highest level known to the sport.

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:15.334
That being said, which
of the following tweets

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:18.175
about Peyton Manning's forehead
received the most re-tweets?

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:19.877
(laughs)

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:21.258
A, Peyton Manning's forehead longer

00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:22.914
than Taylor Swift's relationships.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:24.593
(laughs)

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:25.426
- Ah, yes.

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:29.196
- If we talk about it too much,
does it become self-aware?

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.113
- [Man] It really does.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.277
- Peyton Manning's forehead
is bigger than my entire face.

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:38.274
C, fun fact, in the
off-season, Peyton Manning

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:40.012
rents out his forehead as screen three

00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:41.615
at the drive-in movie theater.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.534
(ding)
- [Host] Yes.

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:47.993
- You know, I wanna say
C, but I think it's A.

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:49.371
- [Host] The Taylor Swift one, well...

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:52.075
- Only because, I feel like
Peyton Manning's forehead,

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:54.221
wasn't he in Megamind, that's my question.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.741
(laughs)

00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:57.154
- I actually think his
neck is getting so long

00:00:57.154 --> 00:00:59.577
he's turning into the
Broncos' logo, he is like...

00:00:59.577 --> 00:01:00.760
(laughs)

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.247
- [Host] That's what he's
ultimately morphing into.

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:03.970
- He's just a horse selling Papa John's.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.468
(laughs)

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:10.199
- I don't, I've got a big forehead myself

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:14.099
and the attacks on Peyton,
I'm a quarterback also.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.551
Yeah, I could throw a football 75 yards.

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.648
- [Host] Good to know, good to know.

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.225
- Does anybody here have a moist nerf?

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.247
(laughs)

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:24.115
- I actually thought "Does
anyone have a moist nerf"

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.212
would have been a great Taylor Swift song.

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:27.878
(laughs)

00:01:27.878 --> 00:01:29.542
- Okay, by the way, we have
to get to the correct answer

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:33.650
which in fact is A, Taylor
Swift's relationships.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.567
(laughs, applause)
