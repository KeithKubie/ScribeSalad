00:00:01.307 --> 00:00:03.356
- [Voiceover] In this
video we're going to go

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.356
through an example reaction

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:07.893
that uses Le Chatelier's principle.

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:09.457
So what we're gonna do is,

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:11.788
we're gonna apply Le Chatelier's principle

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.444
to look at various
changes to this reaction

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:18.365
when we perturb our
reaction from equilibrium.

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:20.029
Just as a reminder,

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.470
what do I mean when I say,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.484
This reaction is at equilibrium.?

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:28.715
So what that means is we
have a reversible reaction.

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.978
We have the forward reaction
which has some rate K forward.

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:35.728
The reverse reaction
has some rate K backward

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.042
and a dynamic equilibrium.

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:42.724
These rate are equal to each other,

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:45.828
so all of the concentrations
are going to stay constant,

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:49.672
and then what we do is we
decide to see what happens

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:52.672
when we add some carbon dioxide gas.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.005
If we add carbon dioxide gas,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.858
the concentration of carbon
dioxide gas will go up,

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.483
or you can think about it
as a partial pressure going up.

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:03.389
And Le Chatelier's principle tells us,

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.457
that if we had a reaction at equilibrium

00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:07.733
and then we perturbed
it by adding more CO2,

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.900
it will shift to try to reduce
the effect of that change.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.527
It will favor the reverse
reaction, so if we add CO2,

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:21.770
what happens is, we favor our reactants.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.766
Another way we can see this

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.841
is by looking at the equilibrium
constant for this reaction.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.553
We can write our equilibrium constant K,

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.387
where this is a capital K.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.053
It's kind of confusing,

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:40.953
but I will try to make
this look like a capital K.

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:43.036
(laughs)

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.502
We can write it in two ways,

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:49.628
we can write it in terms
of the molar concentration,

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:51.456
and if we write Kc,

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.613
the expression will be
the product concentration,

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.094
our CO2 gas concentration.

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:00.494
And that's it, because
when we write out Kc,

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.788
we write out concentrations of gases

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.633
and we write out
concentrations of solutions,

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:07.672
but we don't include solids.

00:02:07.672 --> 00:02:11.395
Kc is just the concentration
of CO2 at equilibrium.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:13.123
I'm going to write an eq there

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:15.294
just to show that's the
equilibrium concentration.

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:17.091
I said that you can also write it

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.148
in terms of partial pressures,

00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:24.979
so there's our fancy capital
K with a p subscript,

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.487
which means that instead
of concentrations,

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:29.375
we're writing everything for gases

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:31.294
in terms of partial pressures.

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:34.298
We have the partial
pressure of CO2 and again,

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:36.747
that's it, because
everything else is a solid,

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:40.096
so we don't include those in
our equilibrium expression.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.910
Writing these expressions
out will be really helpful

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.667
for our second condition.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.434
We're going to think about what happens,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.113
when you increase

00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:52.190
the volume of our container.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.720
We can rewrite the partial pressure,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.215
actually, in terms of the volume,

00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.289
so if you use the ideal gas law,

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.289
the partial pressure of CO2 is equal to

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.805
the moles of CO2

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.938
times RT

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:08.771
divided by the volume.

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:12.800
Similarly, we can rewrite
molar concentration in terms

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.386
of moles divided by volume.

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:16.836
If we increase the
volume of our container,

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:19.735
increasing the volume, since
it's in the denominator,

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:21.776
will make our pressure go down,

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:24.306
so our partial pressure
of CO2 will go down

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:26.592
and we won't be at equilibrium anymore

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:28.716
and the same for the concentration,

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:30.104
since our perturbation

00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:33.005
is decreasing the carbon
dioxide concentrations,

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:34.883
Le Chatelier's principle says,

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:38.722
that our reaction will try
to counteract that change.

00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:40.965
It will try to get back to equilibrium

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:43.616
and try to get the CO2
concentration back up,

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:46.449
so it will have to favor products.

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:52.441
Our reaction will favor
the products to try to get

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.073
the moles of CO2 back up,

00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:58.581
so that we get back to the
equilibrium concentration of CO2

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:00.508
and the equilibrium partial pressure.

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:01.847
The third change we're gonna look at

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:05.097
is what happens when you add argon gas.

00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:09.811
Argon gas is an inert gas.

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:13.778
We don't expect it to react to anything.

00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:18.280
One thing that will happen
when you add the argon gas is

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.447
it will increase the overall
pressure of your container,

00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:26.774
so it will increase the total pressure.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.842
But that actually doesn't tell us

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:32.885
what it does to our equilibrium.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:37.341
Let's look back at our
equilibrium expressions Kc and Kp.

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:41.382
We can see that the partial
pressure for Kp only depends

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:44.653
on the moles of our CO2 and our volume.

00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:47.306
Since we didn't change the moles of CO2

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:49.506
and we also didn't change the volume.

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.424
Even though we increased P-total,

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.976
the partial pressure
of CO2 stayed the same.

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:59.143
That means we didn't perturb
our reaction from equilibrium

00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:02.903
and since we didn't perturb
it from equilibrium,

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.948
there'll be no shift.

00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:07.276
We are still at equilibrium.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:10.338
The concentrations will
still stay the same.

00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:14.338
What happens when we add
more calcium carbonate?

00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:19.482
That's our starting
material and it is a solid.

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:21.733
Our equilibrium expressions are determined

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.261
by our CO2 concentrations,

00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:24.973
so adding more calcium carbonate,

00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:26.197
which is a solid,

00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:28.366
isn't actually going
to perturb our reaction

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:29.346
from equilibrium.

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:31.636
Our reaction is still
going to be at equilibrium

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.219
and we will get no
shift in concentrations.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.155
We're actually gonna
look at one more thing.

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:41.483
We're going to think about what happens

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:43.483
when you add a catalyst.

00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:48.306
Let's say we want to
speed up this reaction.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.515
We can envision what's going on here

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:54.682
when we add the catalyst
by using an energy diagram.

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:59.093
If we have an energy diagram.

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:01.744
We have energy on the Y axis

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.605
and we're looking at
the difference in energy

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:08.936
between our reactants,
or starting materials,

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:10.353
with our products

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.432
and I just sort of made up
these relative energies.

00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:17.269
The way that I have this drawn here,

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:19.024
we can see that our product

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:21.760
is lower energy than our starting material

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.967
and our forward rate,
Kf, which is is up here,

00:06:25.967 --> 00:06:29.296
is determined by the size
of this activation barrier

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:32.078
between our starting material
and our transition state.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:33.911
Our backward rate, Kb,

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.120
is determined by the size

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.491
of this energy barrier,

00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.125
so the difference in energy

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.819
between the product and
our transition state.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.191
If we add a catalyst to our reaction,

00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:51.234
we can think about it as
lowering the activation energy

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:52.567
for our reaction

00:06:54.505 --> 00:06:57.812
and that means we have
a lower energy barrier

00:06:57.812 --> 00:06:59.448
for our forward reaction,

00:06:59.448 --> 00:07:02.714
so our forward reaction
is gonna get faster,

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.468
but it's also gonna lower the
rate of our backward reaction.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.801
K backward, or Kb, is also gonna speedup

00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:13.228
and since it speeds up both the forward

00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:14.862
and the backward reactions

00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:17.723
adding a catalyst also
won't perturb your reaction

00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:19.140
from equilibrium.

00:07:20.094 --> 00:07:24.261
Adding a catalyst will result
in no shift in concentrations.

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:30.441
So the main things to remember
from this problem, I think.

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.895
the things I find most tricky anyway,

00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:35.387
are that adding an inert gas,

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:37.467
it'll increase your total pressure,

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.204
but it won't actually change
any of your partial pressures.

00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:42.980
It won't shift your
reaction from equilibrium

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.147
and the same thing is true
for solids and catalysts.

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.671
All of those three things: inert gases,

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:53.286
solids, and catalysts,

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:56.771
will not shift your
reaction from equilibrium.
