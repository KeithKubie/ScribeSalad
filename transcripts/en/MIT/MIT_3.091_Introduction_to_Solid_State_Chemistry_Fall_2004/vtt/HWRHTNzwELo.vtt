00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.440
OK, let's get started.
Settle down. A couple of

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.880
announcements to make: it is with
great sadness that I announced that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.330
there will be no lecture on Monday.
Yeah, I know. With all the Kleenex

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.770
consumed, Kimberly-Clark went up two
points on the New York Stock

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.220
Exchange yesterday,
which is incredible.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.660
And, in view of the timing of where
we are on the lectures versus the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.100
homework, and no opportunity to
interact with the recitation

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.550
instructors on Monday,
what we are doing just this one time,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:14.633
we're going to slide the weekly quiz
over to Thursday.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:05.330
And, that gives more time for people
to contact their recitation

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.660
instructors. Well,
let's get on with the lesson.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.990
Perhaps some of you haven't figured
out that the lecture has started.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.330
And I still hear talking. And I
will invite people to leave if they

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.860
insist on talking.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:37.660
So, last day, we talked about
secondary bonding,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.330
and we looked at various forms of
secondary bonding.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.990
Here's the cartoons,
dipole-dipole interactions,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.660
dipole induced, dipole in solutions,
a little bit of a diversion, induced

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.330
dipole, induced dipole,
which was the London dispersion

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:12.460
forces, or van der Waals bonds,
and also hydrogen bonding.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:59.330
And, all of these helped us answer
the question, what's the state of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.660
aggregation? The reason we want to
know the state of aggregation is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.990
that this is solid-state chemistry.
And we want to know when something

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.330
is a solid. So,
this helps us get to that conclusion.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.660
And, then we came to the point
where we realized that three

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.990
quarters of the periodic table
wasn't covered by either ionic

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.330
bonding, covalent bonding,
or van der Waals bonding as a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.830
primary form of bonding.
So, we had to come up with something

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.490
else. And that something else was
metallic bonding.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.160
We saw Paul Drude's early attempt
in 1900 to model metals as a gas of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.830
free electrons moving about ion
cores, where the ion core,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.490
in fact, is a mix of the nucleus
plus all the inner shell electrons.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.160
And, we recognize that that didn't
take us very far.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.830
So, what we want to do is continue
the discussion.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.490
And today we're going to look at
the next installments,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.160
which took place about 30 years
later as part of the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.910
quantum revolution,
And, there's really two benchmarks

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.740
here. The first one is by Felix
Bloch, and this came out in 1928.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.580
This was his Ph.D. thesis. What he
did for his Ph.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.410
. thesis, which was done under the
supervision of Heisenberg at Leipzig,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.240
took on an interesting problem.
So far, you've seen quantum theory

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.080
applied to gases,
right? Bohr talked about atomic

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.750
hydrogen.
And, you know the complexities of

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.250
condensed matter.
Bloch's Ph.D. thesis: quantum

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.750
theory of solids.
Let's take quantum theory and apply

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.250
it to solids, not bad for an opener.
Quantum theory of solids was his Ph.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.780
. thesis.
And, here's what he did.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.350
You can follow. I'm not going to
give you the derivations,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.920
but it's quite simple. First,
he recognizes that atoms in a metal

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.490
are arranged in periodic positions.
There is an array. It's not just

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.070
thrown together in some jumble.
So, atoms in solid set in regular

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.640
patterns. We're going to learn
these patterns next week,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.210
arrays, and such solids where the
atoms are found in regular patterns

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.660
are called crystals.
So, he took that as one benchmark.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.990
The second thing: he says that,
remember, Drude says that the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.330
valence electrons are free to move
around. And, he says,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.660
well, if these valence electrons are
free to move around,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.990
what would they be subjected to?
They would be subjected to a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.330
potential. This is how we derived
the energy levels in even a single

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.660
hydrogen atom.
We've got the positive charge of

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:11.986
the core; we've got the negative
charge of the electron.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:05:01.220
So, now I've got an electron,
and it sees the net positive charge

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.440
of the atomic core.
But, it sees an array.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.660
It sees periodic variation in
potential. So,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.880
that's the second thing he says:
periodic potential acts on

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.270
the valence electrons.
And then, he invokes wave mechanics.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.810
Remember, Schršdinger's equation
was only enunciated a couple years

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.360
earlier, in 1926.
There's a Ph.D. student who hears

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.900
about the Schršdinger equation as
applied to a gaseous atom.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.450
And, he's applying it to condensed
matter. And so,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:06:02.766
he solves the Schršdinger equation
with these constraints.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:57.460
And, what does he get?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.380
He gets a set of solutions.
He gets a family of solutions.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.300
And, these give rise to a set of
wavelengths of the electron that

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.220
could move quickly through the
crystal, they could propagate.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.150
In other words, by invoking the
wavelength properties of the

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.070
electron, he can rationalize how
these valence electrons can move

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:40.606
through barriers that classical
physics would impose.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:31.760
And so, pretty soon,
out falls electronic conductivity.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.530
So, this is pretty good for an
opening volley,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.300
not bad for a Ph.
. And, he eventually took on some

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.070
faculty positions,
and then in the 1930's,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.840
when the Nazis came to power,
Bloch, as did many of the scientists

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.610
from Europe left and came to the
United States. And, he

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:14.820
settled at Stanford.
And, eventually he won a Nobel Prize,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.600
but not for this work.
This was OK, but he got a Nobel

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.000
Prize in 1952 for work he started in
1945 that had to do with magnetic

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.400
moments in the nucleus.
So, he had more than one good idea.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.800
So, that's the first thing we need
to take into account

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.500
in the band theory.
The second was a pair of gentlemen:

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.500
Walter Heitler,
and same man as from last lecture,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
Fritz London. This was before he
came up with the dispersion idea.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
Dispersion bonding was 1930. But
he and Heitler decided to go in 1927

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.500
to Zurich, and spend a year
postdocing with Schršdinger.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.500
Little did they know that
Schršdinger had negotiated

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.000
a position at Berlin.
And, they no sooner arrived than

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Schršdinger left.
But anyways, that's what brought

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
them to Zurich.
And they decided,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
let's take this idea of linear
combination of atomic orbitals,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and instead of asking rinky-dink
questions like,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is lithium-2 stable?
Is helium-2 stable? And looking at

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
bonding versus anti-bonding,
he said let's ask, if we take

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Avogadro's number of wave functions
and blend them in something like

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
copper, can we make sense
of what's going on?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:29.330
So, this is what their contribution
was. It was linear combination of

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.660
atomic orbitals into molecular
orbitals for large ensembles.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.990
And so, here's how that goes.
Let's take a look at the cartoon.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.330
You recall last day we looked at
something like if we wanted to ask

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.660
whether A blends with another A to
make A2, we can start at some level.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:09:08.453
I'm going to just look at the
valence shell, OK?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:09:00.310
So, I look at the valence orbitals.
This is atomic orbitals. And, when

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.630
these two come close together,
when these two atoms become close

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.940
enough that they're operating as one
system in order not to violate the

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.260
Pauli exclusion principle these
energies have to shift a little bit.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.570
Otherwise we run the risk of having
more than one electron with the same

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.890
set of quantum numbers.
So, these will rearrange themselves

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.210
into what we call anti-bonding and
bonding orbitals,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.520
where anti-bonding are at slightly
higher energy than the parent atomic

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.840
orbital, and bonding are at slightly
lower energy than the

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.110
parent orbital.
So, this is A2.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.330
Now, suppose I do this one more
time. Suppose I take A plus A2,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.550
and I want to make A3. What would
happen if I took A plus A2?

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.770
Well, again, not to violate the
Pauli exclusion principle,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:10:12.206
this initial, whatever this orbital
is, let's call it ns, I don't know.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:10:00.720
Maybe it's 3s,
whatever, it's going to have to

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.450
allow for that number of states.
And, I think you can see by analogy,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.180
this is what Heitler and London did.
They kept going until they got An,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.900
where n is large.
How large? Oh, a crystal about the

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.630
size of your thumb,
on the order of a cubic centimeter,

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.330
in other words, a block of metal.
So, when n is large,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.990
what happens? So, this thing keeps
going. There's a little bit of a

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.660
broadening. But,
this is what happens.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.330
We have many, many levels here
starting at the highest anti-bonding

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.990
down to the lowest bonding.
But now, the space, the energy

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.660
difference between successive levels
is getting vanishingly small.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.720
And in fact, you can think about it.
How many atoms would there be in a

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.180
cubic centimeter of copper?
Well, let's think about that.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.630
If I've got a cubic centimeter of
copper, I can look on the periodic

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:09.080
table. If you look on the periodic
table, the molar volume,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.540
they call it atomic volume,
but the molar volume of copper is 7.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:33.280
1 cubic centimeters. So, there's
Avogadro's number there, right?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:26.180
Who is buried in Grant's tomb?
Grant. How many atoms in a molar

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:32.360
volume? One mole.
So, this contains N Avogadro atoms.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.540
So, divide in. So, N Avogadro
atoms, you can divide through and

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.720
pretty soon, you figure out how many
states there are.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.900
If I go 1 cubic centimeter,
it's roughly 10 to the 23 atoms per

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.720
centimeter cubed.
So, that means I'm going to have 10

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.160
to the 23 states here.
And, what's this energy difference?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.610
It's on the order of some tens of
electron volts.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.050
So, suppose I put in here.
I'll even give you 1,000 electron

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.490
volts because I've got a lot of
protons in the nucleus.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.940
Suppose this is on the order of ten
to the third eV,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.380
but it's divided by 10 to the 23rd
contributors. So,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.830
what's the delta in here?
It's about ten to the minus 20

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.270
electron volts,
which is about ten to the minus 40

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:41.906
joules.
I mean, this is less energy than the

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.500
movement of the eyeball of the
mosquito. There's nothing here.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.500
There's nothing. So, from a
distance, if I get up really close,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.500
this is still Aufbau principle. So,
the electrons come in two by two

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.500
just as Noah's ark,
from the bottom up to the top.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.500
These are all distinct quantum
states. But from a distance,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.500
they are so close together that this
appears to be a band, almost

00:12:37.500 --> 00:13:02.880
a continuum, a band.
So, the band is a set of very

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.660
closely spaced orbitals.
And now, you see how to populate,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:14.440
and for something like copper, we
know copper is argon 3d104s1.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.220
So, copper is two by two coming in.
And, they'll fill up to the halfway

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:37.840
point of the band because I can put
two per orbital.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But, I only have one per copper.
So, if I blow this up, what do I

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
have? I've got this band that's
half filled. This is the S band,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and it's half filled. And then, the
next level is a vanishingly small

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
energy difference.
And so, if then I apply a potential,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
let's say I make this side of the
crystal negative,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and I make the side of the crystal
positive, it takes a tiny bit of

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
energy to pull an electron out of
the topmost orbital,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
put it up here, and now it's free to
move about the crystal.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So, this accounts for the high
degree of metallic nature of

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
materials because the energy levels
are so close together.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
In the past, we saw for classical
gas phase atoms,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
it took a substantial amount of
energy to move something out of its

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
ground state. In this case,
to move out of ground state takes a

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
trivial amount of energy.
And, I think I've got some cartoons

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:26.060
that indicate this.
This goes back to Drude with his

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.180
cation. Some books will actually
call the atomic core as cations.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.310
But, they're being sloppy with the
terminology because it's the ionic

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.430
core consisting of the protons of
the nucleus plus the inner shell

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.550
electrons. But,
in electrical engineering,

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.680
they'll refer to this as cations and
then the sea of valence electrons.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.810
So, here's a cartoon showing what's
happening as you progressively add

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.930
larger and larger numbers,
and not to violate the Pauli

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.780
exclusion principle.
You have to keep shifting the

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.350
energies. And,
since you only have one electron

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.920
here, as you move out in this case,
sodium, you will find you are

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.490
filling two by two,
and all of the bonding orbitals are

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.060
filled with a tiny energy difference.
And, this is out of the reading.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.640
This is the same idea, only it's
done in the case of lithium.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.210
And lastly, this is the idea I was
just trying to get across that

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.920
here's the metal sitting at rest.
And now, there is an electrical

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.780
potential put across it,
which wants to move electrons,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.640
and even with a modest potential,
that's enough to disrupt the bonding

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.490
here in the uppermost levels,
and cause electrons to rise, and

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.350
then move along the anti-bonding
orbitals quite freely.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.210
So, that gives us a sense of what's
going on in the conductivity of

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.070
something like copper or sodium.
But, now let's think about

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.310
something like magnesium.
Magnesium is a metal.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.930
But let's think about what's going
on with magnesium.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.560
Magnesium has 3s, but it has 3s2 in
the case of magnesium.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.180
Magnesium is 3s2. So,
if we start filling magnesium s-band,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.800
we're going to fill two by two all
the way up to the top.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.430
If this is s, and the p's are up
here, what happens when the p's

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.060
split into the bands?
That's the real issue.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.680
And, mercifully, what happens in
the case of magnesium is

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:41.326
this is the s-band.
But for magnesium,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.500
the p-band, the bottom of the p-band
lies below the top of the s-band.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.500
So, in the case of magnesium, this
is now the p-band.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.500
And, the p-band energy levels are
available so that when we fill the

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.500
top of the s-band,
we can continue to move into a range

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.500
of energy that allows for motion.
So, we are able to account for both

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.500
unpaired electron atoms,
and paired electron atoms by this

00:16:38.500 --> 00:17:03.330
overlap of energies.
And, I think there's a cartoon in

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.990
your reading that indicates that.
Yeah, this shows what happens with

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:12.660
the energy levels as a function of
distance. And,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.330
you can see that the p-band is now
dropping below the top of the s-band,

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:36.393
and so it allows for continuous
filling into more states.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And so, this now accounts for not
only such things as electrical

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
conductivity, but reflectivity.
Metals have luster because the

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
photons of visible light have the
capacity to excite electrons,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
which immediately cascade down and
reflect back. So,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
band theory became widespread in
popularity. In the 20s,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
it was known only about a few
physicists. In the 30s,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the scientific community knew it.
In the 40s, it infected the popular

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
culture. If you talk to your
grandparents, they'll refer to the

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
40s as the big band era
because of this.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:18:02.880
Maybe you thought that the reason
the big band era was named the big

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.770
band era was due to people like
Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.660
Tommy Dorsey. No, it was due to
Felix Bloch, Walter Heitler,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.550
and Fritz London. So, I don't want
you thinking about those bandleaders

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.420
anymore. This is the band.
This is the big band right here.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.280
All right, so now let's go on to
something a little more interesting.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.140
One of the other shortcomings that
was not addressed by Drude was the

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.990
ability to distinguish between
metals and insulators.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.850
So, let's see if this theory can do
that. So, let's go to something

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.710
like diamond. So,
if we start with diamond,

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.570
here's carbon as a single gas
molecule, and we start

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.730
off with 2s and 2p.
And we know that this,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.190
then, hybridizes to maximize bonding
capability. So this is now sp3.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.660
And, I'm going to put a two here
for reasons that will become

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.130
apparent in a minute.
So, this is now carbon in the

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.590
diamond configuration has a single
gas molecule. Now,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.060
I know this is sort of the sound of
one hand clapping,

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.530
but this is the lone carbon that is
waiting to form diamond.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:37.126
And I'm going to skip over the
di-diamond and the tri-diamond.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:24.570
That's just go to diamond crystal.
So, what will happen is these

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.140
levels will divide,
and in accordance with Pauli

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.710
exclusion principle,
will start up here with the

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.280
anti-bonding, and we'll start out
here with the bonding.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.850
And, what happens in the case of
diamond is that when the population

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.420
of anti-bonding descends,
there is energy gap between the

00:19:47.420 --> 00:20:07.573
bottom of the anti-bonding orbitals
and the top of the bonding orbitals.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:56.800
So, we have two bands here.
Before, we simply had a single band.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.600
This would have given us an s band.
This would all come from sp3

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.400
forming sigma bonds.
But, in this case, there is a big

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:24.200
divide here. So,
this is the energy gap.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.000
Or, some people call it the band
gap. And, the energy here is given

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:20.800
a symbol, E sub g,
the band gap energy.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.590
And, in the case of diamond,
the band gap energy is 5.4 electron

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:31.250
volts in diamond.
So, what happens now?

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:37.750
Now, let's fill this,
one, two, three, four, and if we

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:44.250
count this properly,
see, we've got single occupancy.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:50.750
We fill to the top of the valence
band. This is known as valence band

00:20:50.750 --> 00:21:10.100
because these were bonding orbitals.
We fill to the top of the valence

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
band, and now if we want to apply an
electrical potential to cause these

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
electrons to come out of the bonds
and move up and down the crystal,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
we've got to come up with 5.4 eV,
which is a substantial amount of

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
energy, and doesn't happen.
So, as a result, this is an

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
insulator. So,
we now have the capacity to

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
distinguish between metals
and insulators.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:25.370
Insulators have high band gaps,
typically on the order of about

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.740
three electron volts.
Metals have no band gap,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:36.120
continuous availability of these
closely spaced orbitals.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.490
And, while we're in the
neighborhood, this upper band that

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.870
consists of all of the anti-bonding
orbitals is called the conduction

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.240
band because this doesn't involve
bonding. So, if an electron is in

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.620
this upper band,
it's free to move,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:16.373
and under the influence of
electrical potential, it will do so.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:22:07.880
So, we have valence band,
conduction band, band gap.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.770
Now, let's look at one other one.
Let's look at silicon. Let's look

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:17.660
at silicon. Silicon is in the same
family. It's group four,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.550
sp3 hybridized, only in the case of
silicon, we're going to start with

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:28.420
3s atomic orbital.
And, the 3p atomic orbitals,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:35.280
which hybridize to give us sp3,
but now n equals three. And, if we

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.140
bring a large number of silicons
together, we will form,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:59.480
as in the case of diamond,
a valence band and a conduction band.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:57.780
The difference here is that - let's

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.350
think about the strength of these
bonds. The bonds are down here in

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.920
the valence band.
Electrons in pairs,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.490
these are covalent bonds all the way
up to the top of the valence band.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.070
This is n equals three in contrast
to n equals two.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.640
So, what do we know about the
relative strength of a bond in n

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.210
equals three versus n equals two?
Is it going to be stronger or

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.430
weaker?
Expected to be weaker.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.310
It's farther from the nucleus.
And, indeed, this is manifest by

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.180
the fact that the separation between
anti-bonding and bonding is not as

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.050
great because we know that when
something moves from atomic orbital

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.930
to molecular orbital,
this is the change in energy,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.800
going from the atomic orbital to the
molecular orbital.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.680
So, if I have a stronger bond,
doesn't it stand to reason that the

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.560
energy difference between an atomic
orbital and the molecular orbital

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.090
will be greater for a stronger bond/
This is weaker.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.290
So, therefore, this separation
isn't as great as it is in diamond,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.490
and indeed, the band gap in silicon
is on the order of 1.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.690
electron volts. And,
1.1 electron volts is on a special

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.890
range. What else do we know that's
on the order of several

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:24.330
electron volts?
That's really critical here.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:30.990
Critical here is visible light.
Visible light is on the order of

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:37.660
two to three electron volts.
So, what happens in this case with

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:44.330
respect to visible light?
If visible light shines on diamond,

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:50.990
it's transparent because the energy
gap is 5.4 electron volts.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:57.660
If visible light shines on silicon,
it's absorbed because visible light

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.550
has greater than 1.1 eV.
And, this is an 800 millimeter

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:08.660
silicon crystal.
This has been cut and polished from

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.770
a giant single crystal salami,
cut, and this is down to one atom

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.880
fidelity. But,
you can see it appears black because

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:36.760
the visible light that reaches
it is absorbed.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:28.130
And you say, well,
what's the reflectivity from?

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.260
Well, there is a thin oxide film,
and that's the topic of another

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.390
lecture. But,
the material itself is dark because

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.530
the energy level here is less than
anything that you'll find in visible

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.660
light. You know,
that got me thinking.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.790
If a photon comes in like this,
a photon of visible light, what will

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.930
happen? Photon of visible light
will hit an electron sitting here,

00:25:52.930 --> 00:26:12.826
and excite the electron, won't it?
But that electron is going to be the

00:25:37.700 --> 00:26:03.100
same thing that happened in Ballmer
and Angstrom's gas tube.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:21.433
This is a one shot deal.
The electron rises, but it's not

00:25:48.500 --> 00:26:13.900
sustained. So,
what happens immediately thereafter?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:31.966
The electron falls back down and
reemits. So, this is

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:23.840
photo-excitation.
And, if this energy,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.520
if this E incident, if this is
greater than 1.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.210
eV, suppose it's 1.
eV, things get more complicated.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.890
We're not going to go into all the
quantum mechanics,

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.570
just suffice it to say,
that excess energy will go up into

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.260
the crystal and will be dissipated
as heat. And,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.940
as far as 3.091 is concerned,
if the incident energy is greater

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.630
than the band gap energy.
Expect excitation, loss of excess

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.310
energy, and then this electron will
fall back down and give us an

00:26:53.310 --> 00:27:13.486
emitted photon at exactly equal the
band gap energy, right?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:27:01.830
This would be hc over lambda
directly band gap.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.660
You know, there's something here
that's intriguing.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.490
You've got this electron up here.
Wouldn't it be cool if you could

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:16.330
take the backside of the silicon,
and connect it to an external

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:21.160
circuit, and shine light on the
silicon, and then cause the photons

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:39.853
to excite electrons,
which could then power something?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:31.190
That would be photovoltaics,
wouldn't it? That would be how a

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.390
solar cell works,
wouldn't it? If you wanted a sensor

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.590
that took visible light,
that strikes it, and then captures

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.790
that electron,
and then sends it to a detector,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.990
and maybe if you made an array of
these, and so that light that comes

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:57.190
at different intensities on
different pixels sends currents at

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:02.390
different intensities,
that would be interesting too,

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:19.513
wouldn't it?
Can you see why the band gap,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
being 1.1 eV versus visible light is
really important?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
How about this? What if instead of
having light coming in,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
what if I connected this to a power
supply, and I pumped the electrons

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
out of the valence band into the
conduction band from which they

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.500
would fall, and then emit photons?
So, I could make a light emitting

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.500
device by pumping things up and
having them fall down.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.500
This is why this class of materials
is dominating the modern world.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.500
Materials with a band gap around
the value of the energy in visible

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.500
light are called semiconductors,
for reasons you'll see shortly in

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.500
terms of their conductivity.
Their electrical conductivity is the

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.500
least appealing of their properties.
It's their ability to interact with

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:52.500
radiation that makes them so
exciting. And,

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.500
actually, you know,
we could actually do a test.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.500
We could actually measure what
these band gaps are by tuning the

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:27.530
value of the incident radiation.
So, for example,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:32.610
if we did this with long wave
radiation, keep moving,

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:37.690
moving, moving until we get to a
value of photon energy that causes

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:42.760
excitation, we could have a sensor
that detects when the incident

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.840
radiation is being absorbed.
And, we could plot that energy as

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.920
follows. We could have this as,
say, the lambda of the incident

00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:12.506
energy, lambda the incident energy,
and this as the percent absorption.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.500
This is the percent absorption by
the crystal. And,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:49.000
this would go from zero to 100.
So, energy moves from right to left.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.500
It goes inversely with lambda.
So, high wavelength is low energy.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.000
So, at low energy, we expect
materials to be transparent.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:25.810
At high energy,
they will absorb,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:31.630
and at some critical value of energy,
absorption begins.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:37.450
And this value here is called the
absorption edge.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:43.270
So, out here at very,
very high wavelengths, or low

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:49.090
energies, the material appears
transparent because E incident is

00:30:49.090 --> 00:31:06.713
less than E of the band gap.
And, at high energies,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:31:00.390
the material appears opaque.
Its absorbing because here E

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.990
incident is greater than E of the
band gap. And,

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:11.590
this roundedness here is due to
defects. It's not a perfectly sharp

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:17.190
edge. And so,
what I did is I said,

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:35.846
OK, well let's do the calculation.
Soy compared silicon and diamond.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
So, the band gaps in electron volts,
for silicon it's 1.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
. For diamond it's 5.
. And then, all I did is just said,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
well, band gap energy is now
converted to photon energy.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So, just do hc over lambda.
So, lambda of the absorption edge,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
this is equal to, band gap is equal
to hc over lambda of

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:58.450
the absorption edge.
For silicon, it's way out in the

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.360
infrared. It's 1,
25, I'm going to use these ugly

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.270
units, nanometers,
and diamond is down at 229 nm.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:13.170
And, where is visible light?
Visible light is,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.080
round numbers, 400-700 nm.
So, you can see that this is out in

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:37.560
the IR. And, this is down in the UV.
So, we could make a plot here.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:28.380
If this is 400 nm,
this is 700 nm. So,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.760
this is visible light.
Then, this would be silicon out

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.150
here at 1,125 nm,
And diamond over here at 229

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:44.530
nanometers, and visible light right
in between. And I thought,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:49.920
well, there's probably another
chemistry lesson here.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.300
So, first of all, just to summarize,
we've seen here that the

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:14.333
metal has no band gap.
So, there's no gap between the top

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
of the bonding and the bottom of the
anti-bonding orbitals.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
In an insulator, there's a huge
band gap, and in the semiconductor

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
there is a moderate band gap,
where moderate is defined literally

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
in reference to visible light.
Now, this was an interesting thing.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Here's your group 14, or group four
off the periodic table.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:24.610
And, these are the values of band
gap energy. I've already showed you

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:29.220
that diamond is 5.
, and silicon is 1.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.840
. And, again, now germanium is
going out to n equals four so that

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.460
sp3 hybridizes.
This is 4s2, 4p2 forms four sp3

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.070
hybrid orbitals,
0.72. Tin: it may surprise you.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.690
Tin has two different
crystallographic forms.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:52.560
They are called allotropes.
One of them is metallic,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.680
and the other one is sp3 hybridized.
So, tin actually has a

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.810
semiconducting form.
It's a tiny, tiny band gap,

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.930
but it's nonzero. And then, lastly,
lead has got so many electrons, the

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:13.050
valence electrons are so weakly held
that there's no propensity for

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.180
covalency, and so it exists only in
metallic form.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:23.310
But you can see the trends very
nicely scaling with the intensity of

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:28.430
the bonding as exemplified by the
pull on the nucleus on the

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:32.900
outer shell electrons.
OK, well, I talked about

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.700
photoexcitation.
There is another way to excite

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.490
electrons, and that's by thermal
excitation. Just the energy in the

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:44.290
environment could lead to promotion
of the electrons from the valence

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.090
band to the conduction band.
So, I'd like to look at that

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.530
process.
Let's look at thermal excitation.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:57.590
So, again, I'm going to simplify
this. The upper anti-bonding

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:02.660
orbitals represented here as the
conduction band,

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.730
and the lower filled bonding
orbitals are represented as the

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.790
valence band. There is fine
structure in here.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:17.860
These are electrons,
two by two, all the way up through

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.930
here, all right?
So, let's suppose we have enough

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:42.126
thermal energy so that E thermal is
greater than band gap energy.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:31.660
If the thermal energy of the system
were greater than the band gap

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.330
energy, we would have the ability to
break these bonds and promote

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.990
electrons across the band gap.
So, what happens? Let's look at

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.660
that process. So,
I'm going to rip an electron out of

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.330
an orbital here,
rip an electron out of an orbital,

00:35:46.330 --> 00:36:05.126
and send it up to the conduction
band.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:55.810
So, one electron is now moved from
the valence band to the conduction

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:01.630
band leaving behind a half filled
orbital so it's pretty clear that we

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:07.450
now have a new carrier in the
conduction band.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:13.270
So we have a negative carrier in
the conduction band.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:19.090
But, what's interesting is what's
happening down here in

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:36.446
the valence band.
This broken bond,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
this single electron in a bonding
orbital is like a hot potato.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Nobody wants this thing. It's
highly unstable.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And so, what will happen is if we
put this crystal between two

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
electrodes, and so let's say we
polarize the right electrode

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
negative, and the left electrode
positive, it doesn't surprise you

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
that the electron will be repelled
by the negative electrode and drawn

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:52.750
to the positive electrode.
It will move from right to left.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:58.250
This broken bond, I'm drawing it
here as in energy space,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:03.750
but you can imagine a lattice full
of silicons. This broken bond will

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:09.250
actually propagate.
And since the broken bond is a zero

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:14.750
in a land of minus one,
it has an apparent charge of plus.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:20.250
And, this represents essentially a
vacancy in a bonding orbital,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:25.900
and is termed a hole.
This is termed a hole.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:31.720
It's designated lowercase h,
and it has charge plus one. We've

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.540
got minus one in the conduction band.
We've got plus one in the valence

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:43.360
band. And so,
under this same influence of

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.180
electric field,
the hole will move from left to

00:37:49.180 --> 00:38:07.160
right. So, one promotion thermally
generates two carriers.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:59.720
We get an electron in the conduction
band, and a hole in the valence band.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.450
So, now we have some conductivity
that is quite different from what

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:09.170
we're used to.
And in fact, the numbers are equal,

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:13.900
right? The number of electrons that
we generate is equal to the number

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.630
of holes that we generate.
Electrical engineers will represent

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.700
this in a more compact notation.
They don't want to know the

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.110
chemistry. Electrical engineers
historically were afraid of

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.520
chemistry. They just classify these
things on the basis of their

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.930
functionality.
Electrons are negative carriers.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.350
Holes are positive carriers, so in
electrical engineering parlance,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.760
you'll see this equation, n equals p,
meaning the number of negative

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.170
carriers is equal to the number of
positive carriers.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.580
So, this comes out of thermal
excitation. And,

00:38:46.580 --> 00:39:07.226
so now, we could say something
intelligent about conductivity.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:54.610
We can say that electrical
conductivity must be related to this.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:59.220
So, I know I was using sigma over
there for bonds.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.840
We are running out of characters.
We've burned the Latin alphabet.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.460
We've burned through the Greek
alphabet. But here we are.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:13.070
So, sigma now represents electrical
conductivity of the specimen.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:17.690
And, we know the electrical
conductivity of the specimen must be

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:23.580
related to the number of carriers.
Population of carriers,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:30.740
all right, and it must be related to
the charge on the carriers.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:37.910
In other words, if I had plus one,
all other things being equal, plus

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:45.080
two, all other things being equal,
the plus twos will get me double the

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:52.240
conductivity of the plus ones.
So, charge or, let's say, charge on

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:59.410
unit carrier, and then lastly there
is a term called mobility

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:05.180
of the carrier.
What's the mobility?

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.540
The mobility is the ease with which
the carrier can move through the

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.900
crystal. You can define mobility as
the velocity per unit electric field.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.270
So, if I have two carriers,
one is in copper. It moves very

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.630
quickly. One is in silicon,
moves very slowly. I apply the same

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:40.793
voltage across equally
sized specimens.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:31.420
I find one moves more quickly than
the other. The concept that

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.850
captures that is called mobility.
So, if I take the product of the

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:40.280
population, the charge,
and the mobility, I end up with

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.710
something that gives me conductivity.
And, what I'm going to do is I'm

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.140
going to sum this over all of my
carriers because each carrier

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.570
contributes. A negative current
going from right to left will

00:40:53.570 --> 00:41:12.940
contribute to a positive current
going from left to right.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:41:02.610
OK, so we can now write this.
We can write in the case of this

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.220
crystal here, we only have two
carriers. We've got electrons,

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.840
and we've got holes. So, we can say
it's the number of electrons times

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.460
the charge on the electron -
absolute value - is the unit charge

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.070
times the mobility of the electron
plus the number of holes times the

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.690
charge on a hole,
which is the unit charge,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:30.190
and the mobility of the hole.
So, we also know that the number of

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:34.590
electrons equals the number of holes
in thermal excitation.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.990
So then, that allows us to write,
this is n sub E. It's the same,

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.390
times the elementary charge times
the sum of the mobilities.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:47.790
And, those mobilities in many
instances in this crystal

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:52.370
are roughly the same.
So, we can get a measure of what the

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.120
conductivity is from this.
Now, I'm going to show you an

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.870
equation that we're not going to
derive from first principles,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:06.620
but from the more elaborate form of
quantum mechanics,

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.370
allows us to estimate the number of
electrons that have been thermally

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:16.120
excited in a crystal,
and it looks like this.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.870
It's got a pre-factor times
absolute temperature to the three

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.620
halves, and an equation that has a
ratio of the binding energy and the

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.840
disruptive energy.
And that's done through an

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.530
exponential where we put the band
gap energy in the numerator,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.230
and some measure of thermal energy
in the denominator.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:40.920
And, the way we characterize
thermal energy is the product of the

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.610
Boltzmann constant,
and absolute temperature.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:48.300
So, this is a measure of the
binding energy,

00:42:48.300 --> 00:43:08.400
all right, and this is a measure of
the disruptive energy.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:57.530
And, we've seen that notion before
and we're going to see it again

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:03.070
where we make an exponential.
There's going to be a minus here.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:08.610
And, because we get two carriers
for excitation,

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:14.150
there will be a two here.
And now we are ready to elaborate.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:19.690
This kB, just to be clear, is the
Boltzmann constant.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:25.230
And, the Boltzmann constant is 1.
8 times ten to the minus 23 joules

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:31.190
per Kelvin.
It's the amount of energy per degree

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:37.590
rise times temperature will give us
an energy term.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:43.990
We know the band gap energy,
and so by evaluating this, it turns

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:50.390
out for silicon at room temperature,
the value is ne for silicon at room

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:56.790
temperature is equal to 1.
times ten to the tenth carriers per

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:14.013
centimeter cubed.
1.3 times ten to the tenth,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:47.500
you say, well, that's 10 billion.
Well, how many carriers are there

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.500
in copper per cubic centimeter?
In copper, per cubic centimeter,

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.500
we did the calculation. For copper,
we have one carrier per copper

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:22.160
atom.
And we said for copper,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.490
we've got roughly Avogadro's number
of copper atoms per cubic centimeter.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.830
So, in copper,
that analogous quantity is going to

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:35.160
be on the order of ten to the 23rd
per centimeter cubed.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.490
So, what's the difference?
The difference is that silicon,

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:43.830
native silicon, pure undoped silicon
has a value of carrier

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:48.420
concentration.
Ne of copper to ne of silicon at

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.280
room temperature is at the order of
about 10 trillion.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.140
And so, you can see the power of
band theory because it's now

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.990
allowing you to make sense of the
various values in conductivity.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.850
I showed you last day, copper is up
at 5.9 times ten to the seventh

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.710
Siemens per meter.
So, if we take now the conductivity

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:17.570
of pure silicon in the same units,
we're down here at ten to the minus

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.770
four.
And if you take the ratio of ten to

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:25.330
the plus seven over ten to the minus
four, it's about ten to the 11th.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.880
And, this is giving us ten to the
13th. And, all I've done is look at

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.440
this first term,
population of carriers.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.990
We're talking about the same
carrier, same charge.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.550
Clearly there's something here
that's in the mobility.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:43.100
Where do you think you're going to
have much higher mobility of

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.660
electrons, in a metallically bonded
structure, or in a covalently bonded

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:50.220
structure? I think you can see that
the mobility of electrons in silicon

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.150
is going to be much lower.
Whether it's 100 times or not is

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:58.460
something to be seen,
but I think you can see that the

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.760
band theory is helping us make sense
of what's going on.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.070
So, I think this is probably a good
place to stop.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:11.380
I just want to give you one thing
to ponder over the Columbus Day

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.690
weekend. I told you that the
measure of thermal energy is the

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:34.780
product of the Boltzmann constant
times temperature.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.570
And, if you take room temperature
and you multiply it times the

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.140
Boltzmann constant,
this value at room temperature is

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:33.710
about one 40th of an electron volt.
Yet the band gap energy is 1.1,

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:38.280
which is much,
much higher than the thermal energy,

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.850
how is it that we get any thermal
excitation? That's what I'm going

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.420
to answer next day.
Before you go, I wanted to go back

00:46:47.420 --> 00:47:05.906
to Siemens and show one
of his many inventions.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
I've shown you silicon,
high purity silicon. Where do we

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
get silicon from?
This is the silicon age.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
We live in the silicon age.
So, silicon starts on the beach.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
You start with sand, Quartzite.
And, we take silica,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
and we feed it into this furnace,
which was invented by Siemens. It's

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
an electric arc furnace.
It has three carbon electrodes,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
and these are fed by AC power. And,
we put the sand in here with a few

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
other ingredients,
and the action of electric current

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
passing between the electrodes
actually melts the charge.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:31.840
So, you have this liquid honey-like
goo of silica and some other

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.690
ingredients, and then the reaction
proceeds. The carbon reduces the

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.530
silica to elemental silicon and
generates carbon monoxide.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.380
And, the carbon comes from the
electrodes themselves so,

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.230
you consume the electrode.
See, the electrodes are constantly

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.070
being fed like giant drafting
pencils into the charge while they

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.900
are passing current.
And now we make silicon.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.700
And the silicon is full of
impurities because sand has iron in

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.490
it. It's got aluminum in it.
It's got Lord knows what else in it.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.290
And that's not going to make high
purity silicon for microelectronic

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:10.090
devices. So, you might say,
how are we going to make high purity

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.890
silicon? We're talking about 99.
99999 times. People talk about six

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:17.690
nines, seven nines purity.
One part per million, one part per

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:21.490
billion, how are you going to get
from this glop here that's full of

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:25.290
iron, aluminum,
and also saturated with carbon?

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.090
What are you going to do? Somebody
might say, why don't we

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:32.690
distill the silicon?
Well, silicon melts at 1,

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.070
18 degrees centigrade. It boils at
a temperature above 2,

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.460
00 C at atmospheric pressure.
What are you going to contain this

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.840
stuff in? How are you going to
ensure purity?

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.220
And, how much energy are you going
to consume? That won't work.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.610
So, what happens instead is people
get smart and use some chemistry.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:49:10.220
So, they take this impure silicon
and chlorinate it with HCl.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.500
See, we've met silicon,
it's sp3 hybridized. We've met HCl

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.000
and it's polar.
And, it forms this molecule,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.500
trichlorosilane. And guess what?
The inter-atomic, right, secondary

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.000
bonding is weak in this material.
And it boils at 33¡ C. That's

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.500
below body temperature.
You hold this in your hand,

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.000
and the stuff will start boiling.
So, what can you do? Well, what

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.500
happens to the iron?
What happens to the aluminum?

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.000
What happens to all the other crud?
It doesn't form this.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:25.140
So, now, you can selectively
transfer with minimal energy.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:29.280
The trichlorosilane, fractionally
distill it to get very,

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.420
very high purity, trichlorosilane.
Then you go back and you convert to

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.560
silicon. And,
how do you do that?

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.710
You pass it over a hot wire at high
temperature, this is unstable.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.850
So, see, we are playing with
chemistry. We are playing with

00:49:45.850 --> 00:50:05.366
temperature. These are the tricks.
This is the playbook.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:53.750
So, now, we've got a high
temperature. We've got a hot wire.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:50:14.000
How do we make a wire hot? With a
flame? No. We pass electric

00:49:37.500 --> 00:50:01.250
current through it.
And, the molecules of

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:21.500
trichlorosilane hit the hot wire in
the presence of hydrogen,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:50:08.750
back react to form HCl, silicon
tetrachloride,

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:28.466
and silicon. And,
it's this silicon that comes out of

00:49:52.500 --> 00:50:16.250
that first operation that then goes
for subsequent zone melting to make

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:36.766
the giant single crystal from which
we cut this piece right here.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:23.750
And, all this goes back to the 1800s.
By about 1870,

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:44.466
Siemens was running furnaces like
this. There is one other important

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:31.250
application for this furnace that's
used to this day.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:51.033
It's recycling steel.
Steel is the number one recycled

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:38.750
metal by far, not the aluminum
beverage can, steel.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:59.466
In this country, there's about 12
million tons of steel consumed for

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:46.250
automobile industry,
and about 12 million tons of steel

00:50:46.250 --> 00:51:05.966
go back into recirculation.
And, this is the furnace.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.500
You take scrap metal,
electric arc furnace, slag on top,

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.000
remelt, purify, and then it goes
back into the marketplace.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.600
OK, have a nice weekend.
