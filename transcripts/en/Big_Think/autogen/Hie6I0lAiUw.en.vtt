on the other hand visual information is

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
on the other hand visual information is
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.540
on the other hand visual information is
much richer in conveying the spatial

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
much richer in conveying the spatial

spatial resolution and there are good

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419
spatial resolution and there are good
 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.469
spatial resolution and there are good
physical reasons for those things sound

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479
physical reasons for those things sound
 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.950
physical reasons for those things sound
waves are relatively slow relatively

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960
waves are relatively slow relatively
 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.129
waves are relatively slow relatively
slowly so that mechanical vibrations

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139

inside our ear and electrical processes

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349
inside our ear and electrical processes
 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.680
inside our ear and electrical processes
inside our brain can keep up with them

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690
inside our brain can keep up with them
 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.020
inside our brain can keep up with them
and so we can keep that kind of time

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030
and so we can keep that kind of time
 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.089
and so we can keep that kind of time
structure we can keep track of it that's

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099
structure we can keep track of it that's
 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.520
structure we can keep track of it that's
why we do a good job with chords whereas

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530
why we do a good job with chords whereas
 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.110
why we do a good job with chords whereas
the oscillations in electromagnetic

the oscillations in electromagnetic
 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.980
the oscillations in electromagnetic
radiation are very very fast much faster

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990
radiation are very very fast much faster
 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.200

than any mechanical system can keep up

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210
than any mechanical system can keep up
 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.570

up with so the way we process that is

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449
up with so the way we process that is
 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.029

process where photons get absorbed and

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
process where photons get absorbed and
 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.370
process where photons get absorbed and
trigger changes in the structure of

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380
trigger changes in the structure of
 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.189
trigger changes in the structure of
proteins and we have three kinds of

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199
proteins and we have three kinds of
 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.990
proteins and we have three kinds of
proteins in three different kinds of

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000
proteins in three different kinds of
 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.360

cone cells that give us three kinds of
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.060
cone cells that give us three kinds of
average responses and that's why you can

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070
average responses and that's why you can
 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.879
average responses and that's why you can
synthesize any perceived color with just

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889
synthesize any perceived color with just
 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.460
