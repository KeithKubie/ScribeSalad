00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.510
- [Instructor] In this video
we are going to introduce

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.900
ourselves to the idea of permutations,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.220
which is a fancy word for a
pretty straight forward concept,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.120
which is what are the number of ways

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.740
that we can arrange things?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.960
How many different
possibilities are there?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.200
And to make that a little bit tangible,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.630
let's have an example with say a sofa.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.700
My sofa can seat exactly three people.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.140
I have seat number one
on the left of the sofa,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.180
seat number two in the middle of the sofa,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.420
and seat number three on
the right of the sofa.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.570
And let's say we're going
to have three people

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.350
who are going to sit in these three seats,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.750
person A, person B, and person C.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.300
How many different ways
can these three people

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.760
sit in these three seats?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.440
Pause this video and see if you can

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.853
figure it out on your own.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.550
Well, there's several
ways to approach this.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.010
One way is just try to think

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.040
through all of the possibilities.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.670
You could do it systematically.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.320
You could say alright,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.630
if I have person A in seat number one,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.960
then I could have person
B in seat number two,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.790
and person C in seat number three.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.770
And I could think of another situation.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.650
If I have person A in seat number one,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.430
I could then swap B and C.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.320
So it could look like that.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.700
And that's all of the situations,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.610
all of the permutations where
I have A in seat number one.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.880
So now let's put someone
else in seat number one.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.150
So now let's put B in seat number one,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.940
and I could put A in the
middle and C on the right.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.870
Or I could put B in seat number one,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.180
and then swap A and C.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.310
So C and then A.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.040
And then if I put C in seat number one,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.660
well I could put A in the
middle and B on the right.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.680
Or with C in seat number one,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
I could put B in the
middle and A on the right.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.980
And these are actually
all of the permutations

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.500
and you can see that there are

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.470
one, two, three,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.860
four, five, six.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.620
Now this wasn't too bad.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.950
And in general, if you're thinking about

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.097
permutations of six things

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:01.720
or three things in three spaces,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.430
you can do it by hand.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.240
But it could get very
complicated if I said,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.040
hey, I have 100 seats
and I have 100 people

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.930
that are going to sit in them.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.690
How do I figure it out mathematically?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.070
Well the way that you would do it,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.850
and this is going to be a
technique that you can use

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.960
for really any number of
people and any number of seats

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.020
is to really just build off
of what we just did here.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.720
What we did here is we
started with seat number one

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.100
and we said alright, how many
different possibilities are,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.090
how many different people
could sit in seat number one

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.960
assuming no one has sat down before.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.950
Well, three different people
could sit in seat number one.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.950
You could see it right over here.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.540
This is where A is sitting
in seat number one,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750
this is where B is sitting
in seat number one,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.130
and this is where C is
sitting in seat number one.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.410
Now for each of those three possibilities,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.300
how many people can
sit in seat number two?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.840
Well, we saw when A
sits in seat number one,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.500
there's two different
possibilities for seat number two.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.120
When B sits in seat number one,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.850
there's two different
possibilities for seat number two.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.380
When C sits in seat number
one, this is a tongue-twister,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.310
there's two different
possibilities for seat number two.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.200
And so, you're gonna have two
different possibilities here.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.770
Another way to think about it is,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.470
one person has already sat down here,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.030
there's three different
ways of getting that,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.240
and so there's two
people left who could sit

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.420
in the second seat and we
saw that right over here,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.030
where we really wrote
out the permutations.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.330
And so how many different
permutations are there

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.880
for seat number one and seat number two?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.920
Well, you would multiply.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.960
For each of these three you have two,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.500
for each of these three
in seat number one,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.600
you have two in seat number two.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.570
And then what about seat number three?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.480
Well, if you know who's in seat number one

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.300
and seat number two,
there's only one person who

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.180
can be in seat number three.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.570
And another way to think about it,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.190
if two people have already sat down,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.790
there's only one person who
could be in seat number three.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.530
And so mathematically, what
we could do is just say

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.660
three times two times one.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.890
And you might recognize the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.240
mathematical operation factorial,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.980
which literally just means
hey, start with that number,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.700
and then keep multiplying
it by the numbers

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.760
one less than that and
then one less than that

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.840
all the way until you get to one.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.460
And this is three factorial,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.360
which is going to be equal to six,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.200
which is exactly what we got here.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.960
And to appreciate the power of this,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.270
let's extend our example.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.940
Let's say that we have five seats.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.480
One, two, three,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.210
four, five.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.160
And we have five people,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.780
person A, B, C,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.590
D, and E.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.570
How many different ways
can these five people

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.700
sit in these five seats?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.450
Pause this video and figure it out.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.610
Well, you might immediately say

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.530
well that's going to be five factorial,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.690
which is going to be equal to

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.500
five times four times three

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.690
times two times one.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.130
Five times four is 20.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.450
20 times three is 60.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.080
And then 60 times two is 120.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.340
And then 120 times one is equal to 120.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.869
And once again, that makes a lot of sense.

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.340
If no one's sat down, there's five

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.480
different possibilities
for seat number one.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.830
And then for each of those possibilities,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.120
there's four people who
could sit in seat number two.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.580
And then for each of
those 20 possibilities

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.560
in seat numbers one and two,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.480
well there's gonna be
three people who could

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.110
sit in seat number three.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.620
And for each of these 60 possibilities,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.430
there's two people who can
sit in seat number four.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.590
And then once you know who's
in the first four seats,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.490
you know who has to
sit in that fifth seat.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.563
And that's where we got that 120 from.
