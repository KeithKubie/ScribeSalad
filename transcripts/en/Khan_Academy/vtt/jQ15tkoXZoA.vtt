00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.390
Dominique from Dominique's
Pizza bakes the same amount

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.640
of pizza every day.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.810
She used to spend $8 each
day on using the oven,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.790
and $1.50 on ingredients
for each pizza.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.840
So $8 each day on
using the oven,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.190
and $1.50 on ingredients
for each pizza.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.350
One day the price for the
ingredients increased from

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.300
$1.50 to $2 per pizza.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.150
Dominique made some
calculations and found

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.200
that she should bake
8 pizzas more each day

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.710
so the expenses for a single
pizza would remain the same.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.800
And assume they're
saying the total expenses

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.350
for a single pizza, because
clearly the ingredients

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.330
cost is not the same.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.080
We're talking about
the total ingredients.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.240
So if we were to spread
the cost of the oven

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.640
across all of the pizzas.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.850
Write an equation to
find-- or the total cost

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.130
for the oven per day, to spread
that across all the pizzas.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.030
Write an equation to find out
how many pizzas Dominique baked

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.590
each day before the
change in price.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.720
Use p to represent
the number of pizzas.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.730
So let's just think about her
total cost per pizza before

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.360
and then her total
cost per pizza

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.260
after if she bakes
8 more pizzas.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.470
So before, we're
going to use p to say

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.080
that's the number
of pizzas she baked

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.560
per day before the
change in price.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.850
So before the change in
price, on a given day,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.070
she would spend $8 on the oven
and then $1.50 on ingredients

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.970
for each pizza.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.760
So 1.5, or $1.50, times
the number of pizzas.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.810
This would be her total cost
on all the pizzas in that day.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.350
It's the oven cost plus
it's the ingredients cost.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.510
So if you wanted this
on a per pizza basis,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.580
you would just divide
by the number of pizzas.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.460
Now let's think
about what happens

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.570
after the change in price.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.150
After the change in price,
her cost per day for the oven

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.290
is still $8.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
But now she has to spend $2
per pizza on ingredients.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.250
So $2 per pizza.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.610
And instead of saying that
she's baking p pizzas,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.770
let's say that she's now
baking 8 more pizzas each day.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.604
So it's going to be p plus 8.

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:11.645
And so this is going to
be her total cost for all

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.840
of the pizzas she's now baking.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.830
And so if you want it on
a per pizza basis, well,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890
she's now making
p plus 8 pizzas,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.220
you would divide by p plus 8.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.230
And the problem tells
us that these two things

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.820
are equivalent.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.180
Here you had a higher cost
in ingredients per pizzas,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.850
but since you are now
baking more pizzas,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.670
you're spreading the oven cost
amongst more and more pizzas.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.340
So let's think about
what p has to be.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.490
p has to be some number,
some number of pizzas,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.100
so that these two
expressions are equal.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.660
Her total cost per pizza
before, when she only made p,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.380
is going to be the same as
her total cost per pizza

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.760
when she's making
p plus 8 pizzas.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.787
So these two things
need to be equal.

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:00.120
So we did that first part,
or we did what they asked us.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320
We wrote an equation to find out
how many pizzas Dominique baked

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.150
each day before the
change in price.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.430
And we used p to represent
the number of pizzas.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.330
But now for fun, let's
actually just solve for p.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.780
So let's just simplify
things a little bit.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.870
So this part right over here.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.860
Actually, let's just cross
multiply this on both sides.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.710
Or another way of thinking
is multiply both sides times

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.150
p plus 8 and multiply
both sides times p.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.430
So if we multiply by p plus
8, and we multiply by p,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.870
we multiply by p plus
8, and we multiply

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.656
by p, that cancels with that.

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:40.260
That cancels with that.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.140
On the left-hand
side-- so let's see.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.230
We have to just do the
distributive property

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.610
twice right over here.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.450
What is p times 8 plus 1.5p?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.090
Well, that's going to be 8p.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.290
I'm just multiplying the
p times this stuff first.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.820
Plus 1.5p squared.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.930
And now let's multiply the
8 times both of these terms.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:14.180
So plus 64 plus-- 8 times
1.5, that is 12-- plus 12p.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.660
And that's going to be equal
to-- let's see, let's multiply

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.800
p times all of this business.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.740
So that's going to be equal
to 8p-- 8 times p is 8p--

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.810
and let's see, I could
distribute these terms

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.620
and then multiply by p.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.000
So 2 times p is 2p, times p is
2p squared, plus 2p squared.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.880
And then 2 times 8
is 16 times p is 16p.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.380
So now we have--
well, we essentially

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.244
end up with a
quadratic equation,

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.660
but let's simplify
it a little bit

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.340
so that we can either factor it
or apply the quadratic formula.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:00.410
So let's see, let's subtract
1.5p squared from both sides.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.020
So subtract 1.5p squared.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.450
Actually, let me
just put everything

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.120
on the left-hand side
just because that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.690
might be a little
bit more intuitive.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.485
So let's subtract 2p
squared from both sides.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.626
Let's subtract 16p
from both sides.

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:23.250
We have an 8p and a
12p, and then we're

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.050
going to subtract a
16p from both sides.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.224
And then, actually, let's
subtract an 8p as well

00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:29.890
from both sides.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.920
We have a 16p and an 8p, so that
actually works out quite well.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.240
So now we've subtracted
8p from both sides, 16p

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.910
from both sides.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.951
So we've essentially
subtracted all of this stuff

00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:41.930
from both sides.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.910
And we are left with--
let's see, I'll do it

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.830
in degree order.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:58.280
1.5p squared minus 2p squared
is negative 0.5p squared.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.090
Now let's see, these cancel out.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.420
12p minus 16p is minus 4p.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.220
And then we have plus 64.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.525
And then that is going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.400
And just to simplify
this a little bit,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.149
or just to make this
a little bit cleaner,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:26.560
let's multiply both sides of
this equation by negative 2.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.840
I want the coefficient
over here to be 1.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.102
So then we get p
squared plus 8p.

00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:40.630
p squared plus 8p is going
to be equal to-- let's

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.980
see, negative times negative 2.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.430
So minus 128-- is
going to be equal to 0.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.960
So let's see if we
can factor this.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.030
Can we think of two numbers
where if we take their product,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.640
we get negative 128?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.214
And if we were to add them
together, we get positive 8.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.880
So they're going to
have different signs

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.970
right over here.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:12.070
So let's see, if we say 12
times-- well, let's see.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.430
What numbers could this be?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:21.800
So if we were to think about
128 is the same thing as-- 16,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.880
let's see, 16 goes into 128.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.090
Let me work through this.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.750
16 goes into 128,
does it go 8 times?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:37.290
8 times 6 is 48.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.860
8 times 10 is 80,
plus 40 is 128.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.760
Yep, it goes 8 times.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.930
So 16 and 8 seem to work.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.420
So if you have positive
16 and negative 8,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.870
their product would
be negative 128.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:57.980
So we can factor this out
as p plus 16 times p minus 8

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.890
is equal to 0.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.740
Now, this is going to be equal
to 0 if at least one of these

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.655
is going to be equal to 0.

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:08.120
So we have two solutions.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.880
Either p plus 16 is going to
be equal to 0, or p minus 8

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.580
is equal to 0.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.830
This one right over here,
subtract 16 from both sides,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.600
you get p is equal
to negative 16.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.720
Here, you get p is equal to
8, if you add 8 to both sides.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.690
Now, we're talking about
a number of pizzas made.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.400
So this one doesn't apply.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.220
This would be like
Dominique eating 16 pizzas,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.070
or somehow destroying
16 pizzas a day.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.950
We're not interested
in that solution.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.610
So if we want the solution
to the original question,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.820
the number of pizzas she made
before the increase in price,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.790
she made 8 pizzas per day.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.680
So p right over here
needs to be equal to 8.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.610
So before the change in price,
she made 8 pizzas a day.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.100
After the change in price,
she made 8 more pizzas a day,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.370
or 16 pizzas per day.
