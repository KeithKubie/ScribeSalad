00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.620
and Herbert Hoover's here, which is never a good sign.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.460
Today we're gonna return to two of my favorite topics:

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.740
economics and inaccurate naming conventions.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.480
That's right, we're gonna be talking about the Great Depression,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.960
which was only great
if you enjoy, like, being a hobo or selling pencils.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.180
Now some of you might get a bit frustrated today because there's no real consensus
about the Great Depression,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.880
and simple, declarative statements about it really say much more about
you than they do about history.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.100
Why are you looking at me, Mr Green? I didn't
say anything. I thought it.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.360
Because, Me From the Past, you always want
things to fit into this simplistic narrative:

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.580
she loves me, she loves me not, the Great
Depression was caused by x or was caused by y.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.580
It's complicated!

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.760
(Intro Music)

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.020
Many people tell you that the Great Depression
started with the stock market crash in October 1929,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.820
but a) that isn't true and b) it leads
people to mistake correlation with cause.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.240
What we think of as the Great Depression did
begin AFTER the stock market crash,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.540
but not because of it.
Like, as we saw last week, the underlying

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.650
economic conditions in the U.S. before the
stock market crash weren't all moonshine

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.470
and rainbows. The 1920s featured large-scale
domestic consumption of relatively new consumer

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.340
products, which was good for American industry.
But much of this consumption was fueled by

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540
credit and installment buying which, it turned
out, was totally unsustainable.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.240
The thing about credit is that it works fine
unless and until economic uncertainty increases

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.680
at which point POW. That's a technical historian
term, by the way.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.730
Meanwhile the agricultural sector suffered
throughout the 1920s and farm prices kept

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.990
dropping for two reasons. First, American
farms had expanded enormously during World

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.060
War I to provide food for all those soldiers,
and second, the expansion led many farmers

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.150
to mechanize their operations.
As you'll know if you've ever bought a

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.450
tractor, that mechanization was expensive,
and so many farmers went into debt to finance

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.050
their expansion. And then a combination of
overproduction and low prices meant that often

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.400
their farms were foreclosed upon .
And other signs of economic weakness appeared

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.490
throughout the decade. Like by 1925, the growth
of car manufacturing slowed, along with residential

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.790
construction.
And, worst of all was what noted left wing

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.310
radical Herbert Hoover labeled "an orgy
of mad speculation" in the stock markets

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.840
that began in 1927. By the way I'm kidding
about him being a left wing radical. Just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.770
look at him.
According to historian David Kennedy, "By

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.980
1929, commercial bankers were in the unusual
position of loaning more money for stock market

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.060
and real estate investments than for commercial
ventures."[1]

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.400
I wonder if we would ever find ourselves in
that position again. Oh right we did in 2008.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.540
Anyway, it's tempting to see the stock market
crash as the cause of the depression, possibly

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.819
because it turns American economic history
into morality play, but the truth is that

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.709
the stock market crash and the depression
were not the same thing. A lot of rich people

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.980
lost money in the market, but what made the
Great Depression the Great Depression was

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.630
massive unemployment and accompanying hardship,
and this didn't actually begin until, like,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.620
1930 or 1931.
The end of 1929 was actually okay. Unless

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.819
you were a farmer. Or a stockbroker obviously.
So what did actually cause the Depression?

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.900
Well that's a big question and it's one
that economists have struggled with ever since.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.160
They want to find out so they can keep it
from ever happening again. No pressure, economists.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.959
Only 3% of Americans actually owned stock,
and the markets recovered a lot of their value

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.959
by 1930, although they did then go down again
because, you know, there was a depression

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.760
on.
And even though big banks and corporations

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
were buying a lot of stock, much of it was
with borrowed money, known as margin buying,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.739
and all of that still was not nearly a big
enough iceberg to sink the world's economy.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.489
But if I had to name a single cause of the
Great Depression, it might be America's

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.989
weak banking system. Alright. Let's go to
the ThoughtBubble.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.440
Although the Federal Reserve system had been
created in 1913, the vast majority of America's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.000
banks were small, individual institutions
that had to rely on their own resources. When

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.540
there was a panic and depositors rushed to
take the money out of the bank -- like they

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.790
do in the obscure arthouse movie Mary Poppins
-- the bank went under if it didn't have

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.640
enough money on reserve.
So in 1930, a wave of bank failures began

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.900
in Louisville that then spread to Indiana,
Illinois, Missouri, and eventually Arkansas

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.540
and North Carolina. As depositors lined up
to take their money out before the banks went

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.260
belly up, banks called in loans and sold assets.
Ultimately this meant that credit froze up,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.470
which was what really destroyed the economy.
A frozen credit system meant that less money

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.489
was in circulation, and that led to deflation.
Now you're probably thinking, "Big deal,

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.040
deflation, can't be as bad as inflation
right?" No. Deflation is much worse, as

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.560
anyone who has ever slept on an air mattress
knows.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.760
When prices drop, businesses cut costs, mainly
by laying off workers. These workers then

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.360
can't buy anything so inventories continue
to build up and prices drop further. Banks

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.440
weren't lending money, so employers couldn't
borrow it to make payroll to pay their workers

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.010
and more and more businesses went bankrupt
leaving more and more workers unable to purchase

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.180
the goods and services that would keep the
businesses open.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.389
So if we have to lay the blame for the Great
Depression on someone we can blame the banks,

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.580
which isn't completely wrong, and it gives
us a chance to shake our fists at Andrew Jackson

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.770
whose distrust of central banking got us into
this mess in the first place. That's probably

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.090
too simple, but the Federal Reserve does deserve
a good chunk of the blame for not rescuing

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.060
the banks and not infusing money into the
economy to combat this deflationary cycle.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.410
Thanks, Thoughtbubble. So, economics fans
out there might be saying, "Why didn't

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.330
the Hoover administration engage in some good
old fashioned Keynesian pump priming?"

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.770
The thinking there is that if governments
do large-scale economic stimulus and a bunch

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.139
of infrastructure projects, it can kind of
create a bottom that stops the deflationary

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.540
cycle.
And that does often work, but unfortunately

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.760
the Hoover Administration did not have a TARDIS.
John Maynard Keynes' great work The General

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.830
Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (he
wasn't very good at titles) wasn't published

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.990
until 1936, when the Depression was well under
way.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.699
Venturing into the green nightmare of not-America
for a moment, Herbert Hoover offered a global

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.699
explanation in his memoirs for the global
phenomenon that was the Great Depression.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.830
He claimed that its primary cause was World
War One. And to be fair, the war did set the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.300
stage for a global economic disaster because
of the web of debts and reparations that it

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.889
created.
Like, under the Versailles Treaty, Germany

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.490
had to pay $33 billion in reparations mostly
to France and Britain, which it couldn't

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.210
pay without borrowing money from ... American
banks. In addition the U.S. itself was owed

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.949
$10 billion by Britain and France, some of
which those countries paid back with German

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.820
reparations.
But then once American credit dried up, as

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.979
it did in the wake of the stock market crash
and the American bank failures, the economies

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.830
of Germany, France, and Britain also fell
off a cliff.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.880
And then with the largest non-U.S. industrial
economies in total turmoil, fewer people abroad

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.910
could buy American products, or French wine,
or Brazilian coffee, and world trade came

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.530
to a halt.
And then when what the world really needed

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.830
was more trade, America responded by raising
tariffs to their highest levels ever with

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.430
the Hawley Smoot tariff, a law that was as
bad as it sounds.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.680
The idea of the high tariff was to protect
American industry, but since Europe responded

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.680
with their own high tariffs, that just meant
that there were fewer buyers for American

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.479
goods, less trade, fewer sales, and ultimately
fewer jobs.

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.919
So what did Hoover do? Not enough. It's
important to remember that the American government

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.090
is not just the President. Hoover couldn't
always get Congress to do what he wanted but

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.000
his political ineptitude was not particularly
surprising because the first elected office

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.729
that he ever held in his life was President
of the United States.

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.460
Like, let's take the foreign debt issue.
Hoover proposed a moratorium on intergovernmental

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.860
debt payments and he actually got Congress
to go along with it, but it wasn't enough,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.180
mainly because the central bankers in Europe
and America refused to let go of the gold

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.580
standard, which would have allowed the governments
to devalue their currency and pump needed

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.889
money into their economies.
And when Britain, rather heroically I might

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.650
add, did abandon the gold standard in 1931
and stopped payments in gold, the U.S. did

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.600
not follow suit, which meant that world financial
markets froze up even further.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.020
Like this is a little bit complicated, but
if you and I have always used Cheetos as currency

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.380
to exchange goods and services and one day
I announce that we can't do that anymore

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.889
because it doesn't give us the flexibility
that we need to pull ourselves out of this

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.780
deflationary spiral.
If I don't also agree to abandon Cheetos,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.780
then it's going to be a total disaster,
which it was.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.819
And then, even worse, the Fed raised its discount
rate, making credit even harder to come by.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:12.060
By the end of 1931, 2,294 American banks had
failed, double the number that had gone under

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.600
in 1930.
Now, it's easy to criticize poor Herbert

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.710
Hoover for not doing enough to stop the Great
Depression, and he probably didn't do enough,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.240
but part of that is down to our knowledge
of what happened afterward: the New Deal.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.460
That FDR at least tried to do something about
the Depression makes us forget that when Hoover

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.719
was president, orthodox political and economic
theory counseled in favor of doing nothing.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:37.450
And at least Hoover didn't follow the advice
of his treasury secretary who, according to

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.089
Hoover anyway, argued that that the solution
was to "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks,

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:46.430
liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate,"
which sounds like the worst milkshake ever.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.580
Instead, Hoover believed that the best course
of action was to "use the powers of government

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.820
to cushion the situation"[2] and in a White
House meeting he persuaded a large number

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.140
of industrialists to agree to maintain wage
rates.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.980
He also got the Federal Farm Board to support
agricultural production, and got Congressional

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.680
approval for $140 million in new public works.
Overall, he nearly doubled the federal public

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.230
works expenditures between 1929 and 1931.
It just wasn't nearly enough.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.540
Because what Hoover didn't allow was for
the federal government to take over the situation

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.130
completely.
He relied primarily on private businesses

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.730
and state and local governments to stimulate
the economy, and that was insufficient. It's

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.010
not surprising when you consider that in 1929
Federal expenditures accounted for 3% of our

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.720
gross domestic product. Today it's more
like 20%.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.410
So, it was just really hard to imagine the
Federal government doing anything on such

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.350
a large scale to address a national problem
because it had never really done that much

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.270
before.
Hoover also hiked taxes as part of a plan

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.610
to stabilize the banks by balancing the federal
budget, providing confidence for foreign creditors,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.110
and stopping them from buying American gold.
This would support bonds and also keep the

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.740
federal government out of competition with
private borrowers. The Revenue Act of 1932

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.860
passed Congress, but it didn't do much to
stop the Depression. In fact, arguably it

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.720
made it worse.
Though ultimately, this dire situation forced

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.980
Hoover into a truly radical move. In January
1932 he and Congress created the Reconstruction

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.550
Finance Corporation, which was basically a
federal bailout program that borrowed money

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.940
to provide emergency loans to banks, building-and-loan
societies, railroads, and agricultural corporations.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.899
The problem was that by 1932 bailing out the
banks wasn't enough and the Great Depression

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:34.480
started to take shape. By early 1932 well
over 10 million people were out of work, 20%

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.920
of the labor force. And in big cities the
numbers were even worse, especially for people

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.470
of color. Like, in Chicago, 4% of the population
was African American, but they made up more

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.470
than 16% of the unemployed.
Although Hoover famously claimed that no one

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.910
starved, which was a little bit let-them-eat-cake-y,
people did search trash cans for food. And

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.029
many Americans were forced to ask for relief.
Hoover's response was to try to encourage

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:02.959
private charity through the unfortunately
acronymed President's Organization on Unemployment

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:06.240
Relief. Or "POUR."
New York City's government relief programs

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.580
rose from $9 million in 1930 to $58 million
in 1932, and private charitable giving did

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.740
increase from $4.5 million to $21 million,
and that sounds great until you realize that

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.920
the total of $79 million that New York City
spent on relief in 1932 was less than ONE

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.080
MONTH's lost wages for the 800,000 people
who were unemployed.[3]

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.180
Oh, it's time for the Mystery Document?
I hope it's a break from the unrelenting

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.980
misery. Probably not.
The rules here are simple. I guess the author

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.779
of the Mystery Document and then usually fail
and get shocked with the shock pen, which

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:42.140
is a real shock pen no matter what you people
say.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.690
Alright, what do we got here?

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.810
"We sit looking at the floor. No one dares
think of the coming winter. There are only

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.079
a few more days of summer. Everyone is anxious
to get work to lay up something for that long

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:56.950
siege of bitter cold. But there is no work.
Sitting in the room we all know it. This is

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.649
why we don't talk; much. We look at the
floor dreading to see that knowledge in each

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:06.510
other's eyes. There is a kind of humiliation
in it. We look away from each other. We look

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:11.399
at the floor. It's too terrible to see this
animal terror in each other's eyes."

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:16.850
I mean, Stan, unemployment was 25% and this
could be literally any of those people. I'm

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.700
gonna guess that it's a woman, because men
were usually on the road trying to find work

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:27.700
while women would go to these offices to look.
I - I mean it could be many - I have no idea.

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:33.970
Ummm Janet Smith.
Meridel Le Sueur? She's a good writer. Maybe

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.110
we should hire her. AH!
So, often at Crash Course we try to show how

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.519
conventional wisdom about history isn't
always correct. But in the case of the hardships

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.140
experienced during the Great Depression, it
really is.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.570
The pictures of Dorothea Lange and Walker
Evans, and Steinbeck's description in Grapes

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:54.110
of Wrath of Okies leaving the dust bowl in
the usually vain hope of a better life in

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.760
California, they tell the story better than
I can.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.510
Thousands of Americans took to the road in
search of work and thousands more stood in

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.779
breadlines. There were shantytowns for the
homeless called Hoovervilles, and there were

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:08.940
protests, like the Bonus March on Washington
by veterans seeking an early payment of a

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.870
bonus due to them in 1945.
A lot of the debate around the Great Depression

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.540
revolves around the causes, while still more
concerns the degree to which the federal government's

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.870
eventual response, the New Deal, actually
helped to end the Depression.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.329
Those questions are controversial because
they're still relevant. We're still talking

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:27.360
about how to regulate banking.
We're still talking about what the government's

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.660
role in economic policy should be and whether
a strong federal government is ultimately

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.970
good for an economy or bad for it.
And how you feel about the government's

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.089
role in the Great Depression is going to depend
on how you feel about government in general.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:43.790
That said, we shouldn't let our ideological
feelings about markets and governments and

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.279
economics obscure the suffering that millions
of Americans experienced during the Great

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.680
Depression.
For generations of Americans, it was one of

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.269
the defining experiences of their lives. Thanks
for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:59.050
