gastronomy was a term coined by
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.120
gastronomy was a term coined by
scientists to describe the work that

can't weigh on whether or not that's
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.560
can't weigh on whether or not that's
true because I don't know how much we

true because I don't know how much we
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.950
true because I don't know how much we
know about about either but uh I I think

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
know about about either but uh I I think
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.779

we cook it in an effort I think to be
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.530
we cook it in an effort I think to be
better cooks

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.730
well we have learned a lot i would i

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
well we have learned a lot i would i
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550

15 years you know plus or minus five
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889

we've learned more about cooking than we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
we've learned more about cooking than we
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.680
we've learned more about cooking than we
have in the 15,000 prior 15,000 years

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
have in the 15,000 prior 15,000 years
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.720
have in the 15,000 prior 15,000 years
prior to that and i think that that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
prior to that and i think that that
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.720
prior to that and i think that that
makes that's exciting to me and i think

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
makes that's exciting to me and i think
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.610
makes that's exciting to me and i think
that makes for an exciting time to be

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
that makes for an exciting time to be
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.729
that makes for an exciting time to be
cooking for anyone for any curious cook

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
cooking for anyone for any curious cook
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.710
cooking for anyone for any curious cook
for anyone who desires to understand

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720

more what's happening to a chicken when

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
more what's happening to a chicken when
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.479
more what's happening to a chicken when
you roast it or a vegetable when you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
you roast it or a vegetable when you
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.600
you roast it or a vegetable when you
blanch or a fish when you poach it in an

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
blanch or a fish when you poach it in an
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400
blanch or a fish when you poach it in an
effort to cook it better and to cook it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
effort to cook it better and to cook it
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.350
effort to cook it better and to cook it
in a more informed way because again uh

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
in a more informed way because again uh
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.930
in a more informed way because again uh
like taste their subjectivity in cooking

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
like taste their subjectivity in cooking
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.090
like taste their subjectivity in cooking
as well and I think that that's good

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
as well and I think that that's good
 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.280
as well and I think that that's good
because there's no right way necessarily

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
because there's no right way necessarily
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.130
because there's no right way necessarily
to cook something but understanding

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
to cook something but understanding
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.650
to cook something but understanding
what's happening to it up any given

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
what's happening to it up any given
 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.229
what's happening to it up any given
object while you're cooking it allows

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
object while you're cooking it allows
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.729
object while you're cooking it allows
you to make an informed decision about

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
you to make an informed decision about
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.830
you to make an informed decision about
how to cook it and again I like the fact

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
how to cook it and again I like the fact
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.150
how to cook it and again I like the fact
that there's no right or wrong way to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
that there's no right or wrong way to
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370
that there's no right or wrong way to
poach an egg but knowing what's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
poach an egg but knowing what's
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.310
poach an egg but knowing what's
happening to an egg as it goes from 60

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320
happening to an egg as it goes from 60
 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.410
happening to an egg as it goes from 60
degrees Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
degrees Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.900
degrees Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius
helps you make the decisions about at

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
helps you make the decisions about at
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.880
helps you make the decisions about at
what point you want to start or stop the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
what point you want to start or stop the
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.300
what point you want to start or stop the
cooking and and that I find really

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
cooking and and that I find really
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.229
cooking and and that I find really
really very fascinating because to me

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239
really very fascinating because to me
 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.210
really very fascinating because to me
knowing mechanically how to how to poach

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
knowing mechanically how to how to poach
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220
knowing mechanically how to how to poach
an egg but not not what's happening to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
an egg but not not what's happening to
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.810
an egg but not not what's happening to
it while it's poaching is almost an

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820
it while it's poaching is almost an
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.090
it while it's poaching is almost an
empty knowledge it's not it's not as

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
empty knowledge it's not it's not as
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.030
empty knowledge it's not it's not as
useful as as knowing okay the egg white

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
useful as as knowing okay the egg white
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.500
useful as as knowing okay the egg white
proteins are coagulating at this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
proteins are coagulating at this
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.210
proteins are coagulating at this
temperature and the yolks are our

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
temperature and the yolks are our
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.979
temperature and the yolks are our
coagulating that temperature and so I

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
coagulating that temperature and so I
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.750
coagulating that temperature and so I
can control this in that and knowing the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
can control this in that and knowing the
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.670
can control this in that and knowing the
variables and understanding the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
variables and understanding the
 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.770
variables and understanding the
variables I think it makes anybody a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
variables I think it makes anybody a
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.350
variables I think it makes anybody a
better cook
