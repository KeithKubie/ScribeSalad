1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,100
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radiolab.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,310
Very good to actually be back here talking
to you. Yes, it's been awhile. Yes.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,450
Where have you killed?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,790
Tell those people who might
have missed what you been doing,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,630
what you've been doing. Well,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,680
we just said we just finished our first
mini season of our first spinoff called

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,170
more perfect. When are you
going to have part two?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,370
I believe part two is a coming soon.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,860
I don't know now. Not Tomorrow. Okay.
But, but net but not long because we,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,530
yeah, there's there, there are
definitely stories to tell for sure.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,260
And you know, and uh, if you,
if you haven't checked it out,

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,680
check it out at radiolab.org/more.
Perfect. We're really proud of it.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Let me rescue you from this
awkward situation by being
back to radio lab where I

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:49,980
will, I'd like to begin
by building a call,

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,040
dark green forest makin
towering trees to your left.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,470
Okay. Right. And I,
yeah, I need, I'm a bird.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,740
[inaudible] a lot of birds
actually and a little [inaudible].

18
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,960
So just give me some background
sound. Yeah, birds please.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,110
Birds. Why do like we haven't even
started this, this is what you do.

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,480
You give me w like I want
wind birds. I'm not sure.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,390
I'm not like your sound puppet
here, but I can't, how do I,

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,710
all right, nevermind this story. You'll
get your sound at some point begins

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,760
with a woman or at the time actually,

24
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,500
she was a very little girl who loved
the outdoors. And I mean really,

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,840
I love the outdoors.
When I was a little kid,

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,720
I would be in the forest and
I just eat the forest floor.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,070
And I know lots of kids do that.

28
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,670
But I was [inaudible] you mean you
got down on all fours and just, yeah,

29
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:45,430
I would just eat the dirt.
This is Suzanne Simard.

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,810
And so my mom always talks about how
she had to constantly be giving me warm

31
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,430
medicine because I was,
I always had worms.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,750
She's a forestry professor
at the University of British
Columbia and might as

33
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:59,410
well start the story you back when she
was a little girl. Well when I was a kid,

34
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,770
I grew up in the rainforest of British
Columbia and my family spent every

35
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,460
summer, um, in the forest

36
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,060
and her family included a dog named Jigs.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,780
And so in this particular summer when
the event with jigs happened, um,

38
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,640
what kind of jog is jigs by the way?

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,960
He was a not a wiener dog. He was a,

40
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:26,380
what was he a, you don't
know what your dog,

41
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,660
not a basset hound, but um,
he was a Beagle Beagle. Yeah,

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,530
he was a curious dog. And
on this particular day,

43
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,410
she's with the whole family.
They're all out in the forest.

44
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:43,090
It was summertime and Jigs at some
point just runs off into the woods,

45
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:45,550
just maybe to chase a rabbit, whatever.

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Couple of minutes go by and all of a
sudden we could hear this barking and

47
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:57,830
yelping and we were all like, oh
my goodness, jigs is in trouble.

48
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,270
And so the whole family and
uncles and aunts and cousins,

49
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,630
we all rush up there. Do they
follow the sound of the barking?

50
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,200
And it leads them to an outer,

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,740
and when they go in and there is jigs at
the bottom of the road was probably six

52
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:19,980
feet down at the bottom of the outhouse
pit. Yeah. Where we've all been,

53
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,090
you know, doing our daily
business. Yeah. Fallen in,

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,350
he's looking up at us,

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,400
quite scared and very unhappy
that he was covered in um

56
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,190
oh and toilet paper. And of course
we had to get jigs out. I mean,

57
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:39,090
jigs was part of the family and Jen,

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,560
she was so deep down in there,

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,390
we had to dig from the sides
to Sorta like widen the hole,

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,620
basically expanding it from a kind of a
column of a pit to something that's we

61
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:52,590
could actually grab onto his
front legs and pull them out.

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,530
And so we're digging away and jigs was,

63
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,730
you know, looking up
with his paws, you know,

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,950
and looking at us waiting and they're
digging and digging and digging them in.

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,010
All of a sudden she says she looks down
into the ground and she notices all

66
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:11,600
around them where the soil
has been cleared away.

67
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,430
There are roots upon roots
upon root in this thick,

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,590
crazy tangle. We're sitting on the
exposed root system, which has like,

69
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,800
it is like a mat. It's like, um,

70
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,930
it's just a mass of matter of intertwining
exposed roots that you could walk

71
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:32,720
across to never fall through. She says,

72
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,780
it was like this moment where
she realizes, oh my God,

73
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:39,650
there's this whole other
world right beneath my feet.

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,990
Jakes had provided this incredible
window for me, you know,

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,500
and this digging exculpate to see
how many different colors they were,

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,250
how many different shapes there
were, that they were so intertwined,

77
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,160
as abundant, as what was
going on above ground.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,530
It was magic for me. Well, what's
so what's the end of the story?

79
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:04,480
Did jigs, um, did jigs emerge, emerge?

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,240
We pulled cigs out and we threw them in
the lake with a great deal of yelping

81
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,150
and cursing and swearing
and cigs was cleaned off.

82
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,800
But that day with the roots is the day
that she began thinking about the forest

83
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,290
that exists underneath the florist.

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,440
And now if you fast
forward roughly 30 years,

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,400
she then makes a discovery
that I find kind of amazing.

86
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,360
She's working in the timber industry
at the time. This is by the way,

87
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:33,900
what her entire family had done,
her dad and her grandparents.

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,010
And when I came on the scene in
19 the neat 1980s as a forester,

89
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,390
we were into industrial, large scale,
clear cutting in western Canada,

90
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,090
huge machines, loaders and cats.

91
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,750
She says a timber company
would move in and clear,

92
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:52,560
cut an entire patch of forest and then
plant some new trees and you know,

93
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:57,561
my job was to track how these new
plantations would grow and she says she

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,460
began to notice things that, you
know, one wouldn't really expect,

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,760
like trees of different species are
supposed to fight each other for sunshine.

96
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,360
Right. When you've heard
that. Yeah, absolutely.

97
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,120
I may have to shade each other out. They
shout and they fear, you know, they,

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,850
they push each other away
so they can get to the sky.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,630
But she was noticing that in a little
patch of fires that she was studying.

100
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,411
If she had,

101
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,300
say a birch tree next to a first
tree and she took out the birch,

102
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,640
the Douglas for became
diseased and, and died.

103
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,730
There was some kind of benefit
from the birch to the fur.

104
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,640
There was a healthier
community when they were mixed.

105
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,790
And I wanted to figure out why. Well
of course there could be a home,

106
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,150
any number of reasons why, you know,
one tree is affected by another,

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,400
but she had a kind of maybe call
it a a gypsy in recollection.

108
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,360
Flashback. Yes.

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,870
Cause she knew that scientists
had proposed years before
that maybe there's an

110
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,370
underground economy that exists
among trees that we can't see.

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,670
And she wondered whether
that was true. And so

112
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,330
I designed this experiment
to figure that out.

113
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,820
It was a simple little
experiment. Here's what she did.

114
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:06,240
She went into the forest, got some
trees, Douglas for Birch and Cedar,

115
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,960
and then I would cover
them in plastic bags.

116
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,170
So I'd feel the plant,
the tree in a plastic bag.

117
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,670
And then I would inject
gas. So tagged with a,

118
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,620
with an isotope, which is radioactive.

119
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,070
So these trees were basically covered
with bags that were then filled with

120
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:24,410
radioactive gas. Yeah.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,110
Which the trees would just
suck up through photosynthesis.

122
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,100
So now they had the radioactive particles
inside their trunks in their branches.

123
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,730
We had a Geiger counter out
there. As soon as we labeled them,

124
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,480
we use the Geiger counter to in ran it
up and down the trees and we could tell

125
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,730
that they were hot. They
were booboo poopoo right.

126
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,260
And the idea was she wanted to know like
once the radioactive particles were in

127
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,150
the tree, what happens next?

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,870
Where they stay in the tree or would
they go down to the roots and then what

129
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,030
happens? And what she discovered is

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,280
it all these trees, all these trees
that were of totally different species,

131
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,660
we're sharing their food underground.

132
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:07,270
Like if you put a food
into one treat over here,

133
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,590
it would end up in another tree,
maybe 30 feet away over there.

134
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,570
And then a third tree over here and then
a fourth tree over there and a fifth

135
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:21,720
tree over there. Sixth,
seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th,

136
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:26,721
11th all in all turns out one tree was
connected to 47 other trees all around

137
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,434
it. It was like,

138
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,220
it was like a huge network and we were
able to map the network and what we found

139
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:39,150
was that the trees that were the biggest
and the oldest were the most highly

140
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,040
connected. And so we, you know,

141
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,480
we've identified these as kind of like
hubs in the network and when you look at

142
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:45,990
the map,

143
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,230
would you see your circles sprouting
lines and connecting to other circles?

144
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,890
Also sprouting lines. And it begins to
look a lot like an airline flight map,

145
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,190
but even more, it's just this

146
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,750
incredible communications
network that you know,

147
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,720
people had no idea about in
the past because we couldn't,

148
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,260
didn't know how to look. It's
definitely crazy. I mean,

149
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,220
you're out there in the forest and you
see all these trees and you think they're

150
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,880
individuals just like
animals, right? But no,

151
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,670
they're all linked to each
other. This is Jennifer Frazier.

152
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:22,050
She's a science writer and I write a blog
called the artful Amoeba at scientific

153
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,030
American. I like your title. Thank you.

154
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,900
I spoke to her with our producer letters,
Nasser and she told us that this,

155
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,700
this network has developed a kind
of a nice, plenty sort sorta name,

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,910
the Wood Wide Web, the the worldwide web.

157
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,540
I mean like the worldwide man,
but it's now the wood wide web.

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,370
It sounds a little bit younger.
Fid It would wade with. Yeah,

159
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,830
so this would wind. Is
this just like the roots,

160
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,650
like what she saw in the
outhouse? Oh No, no, no, no, no.

161
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:53,340
It's far more exciting than that and
sophisticated and interesting and

162
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,050
astonishing. I mean it is,

163
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,300
it involves a completely separate
organism. I haven't mentioned yet.

164
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:02,250
I mean this is going places.

165
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,520
What creature? Where are we
going? I'm not going to tell you.

166
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm going to just go there. I on where
we went and looked for ourselves.

167
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,620
I don't know where you were that
day. Annie McEwin. Stephanie Tam,

168
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,380
our intern and he's our producer.

169
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,170
We'd decided all to go to to
check it out for ourselves.

170
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,790
This thing I'm not telling you about.

171
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,390
We went to the Bronx to the botanical
gardens because we can get so far you have

172
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,970
to travel here in New York to get
to actual green rates. Actually,

173
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:29,930
there was a beautiful green sward New
York has. And when we went up there, we,

174
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,430
there was this tall man waiting
for us. An expert. Is that right?

175
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,060
That is his name is Roy
Howling at Roy. By the way.

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,440
It comes out with the
strange, it's like a rake,

177
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,780
but it has like an expandable, uh, it's
a truffle rake. Bullish an extent. Oh,

178
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,610
listen to that. Oh, that
sounds dangerous. And so wet.

179
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,290
So we're up there in this, in
his old fires with this guy.

180
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,990
So there's an oak tree right
there. It should have some.

181
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,590
And he starts digging with his
rake at the base of the street.

182
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,430
He shoves away the leaves,
he shoves away the top soil.

183
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,380
[inaudible] feel you ripping the reason
I like that. And so now we're down here,

184
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,130
pulled out of route of some
story. It's just getting started.

185
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,150
They're called feeder routes.

186
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,320
We're carefully examining the roots of
this oak tree on our knees with our noses

187
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:22,130
in the ground. We can't see anything.
I don't, I mean I see the dirt Rod.

188
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:26,420
You shooting him white yet? You see
anything? I say it's early in the season,

189
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,910
so he says something about that's
the wrong season. I thought, okay,

190
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,900
so this is just stupid.

191
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,240
But then finally you have the Lens.
She gives us a magnifying glass,

192
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,400
you know one of those little
jeweler's glasses handheld.

193
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,840
Have a look here and he hands
it to hand. Wow. You see again,

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,880
wait, let me [inaudible]. Oh my gosh.

195
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,760
I do see them. What do you say?

196
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,870
Little white threads
attached to the roots.

197
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,150
Smaller than an eyelash.

198
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,940
Maybe just a 10th the
width of your eyelash,

199
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,400
but white translucent and hairy sort of.

200
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,950
And while it took us a while to see it,

201
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,940
apparently these little threads
in the soil, they're everywhere.

202
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,590
And when you measure them,

203
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,180
like one study we saw found up to seven
miles of this little threading and a

204
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,014
pinch of dirt.

205
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,140
What a pinch. What is thing?
Is it like, is it a plant?

206
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,590
What is it? What kind of creature
is this thing? Yes. What is it? This

207
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,790
is the fungus,

208
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,080
which by the way is
definitely not a plant.

209
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,330
There are some other kind of category,

210
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,300
and for a long time they
were thought of as plants,

211
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,750
but now we know after
having looked at their DNA,

212
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,220
the fungi are actually very
closely related to animals.

213
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,300
They're one of our closest relatives.
Actually now, back in the day,

214
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,670
this all has a history. Of course,

215
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,770
when people first began
thinking about these things,

216
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:01,090
we're talking in the 16 hundreds they
had no idea what they were or what they

217
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:05,410
did, but ultimately they figured out
that these things were very ancient.

218
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:10,330
Because if you look at 400 million year
old fossils of some of the very first

219
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,164
plants,

220
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,080
you can see even in the
roots of these earliest land,

221
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,280
Clinton's see those threads. This
is a really ancient association.

222
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,020
And then later,

223
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,650
scientists finally looked at these things
under much more powerful microscopes

224
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,710
and realized the threads
weren't threads really.

225
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:31,190
They were actually tubes hollow.

226
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,690
These little tubes to
tubes and the tubes branch,

227
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,550
and sometimes they reconnect.

228
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,630
So there's [inaudible] seem
to be under the ground,

229
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,410
this fungal freeway system
connecting one tree to the next,

230
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:46,290
to the next to the next.
People speculated about this,

231
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:51,090
but no one had actually
proved it in nature in the
woods until Suzanne shows up.

232
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,120
And there was a lot of stuff,

233
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,990
skepticism at the time. But
over the next two decades,

234
00:13:55,991 --> 00:14:00,991
we did experiment after experiment after
experiment that verified that story.

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,530
And what you're saying, what is this?
Why is this network even? They're like,

236
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:09,490
why would the trees need a freeway system
underneath the ground to connect and

237
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,760
why would, why would the fungi
want to make this network?

238
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,990
Why are they going to this trouble
of creating this big network? Well,

239
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,630
they do it because the tree has something,

240
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:23,110
the fungus needs and the fungus
has something that tree needs.

241
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,190
Let me just back up for a second
so that you could, you can,

242
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:30,640
to set the scene for me. Yeah. When
you go into a forest, you see a tree,

243
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,030
a tall tree. So what is the tree
do? What's his job? What's his job?

244
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,050
It's soaks in. Sunshine takes the
CO2 out of the air. Carbon dioxide,

245
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:41,440
which has of course carbon
C in it. Yeah, oxygen. Yeah,

246
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,240
and it keeps the sea carbon,

247
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,290
which is science speak for food
that turns that carbon into sugar,

248
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,170
which it uses to make its
trunk and its branches.

249
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:54,230
Anything thick you on a tree is just
basically a are made into stuff.

250
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,920
Carbon and sugar, the same thing. Yeah.

251
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:58,650
You can think of the carbon is basically
the sugar that builds the tree.

252
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,990
However, if that's all they had was
carbon, it would only be this tall.

253
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,160
Oh, that's Roy. Again.
He's holding his hand.

254
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,290
Maybe a foot off the ground would be
a teeny tree. It would be smaller.

255
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,560
So if all a tree could do
is get carbon from the air,

256
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,890
you'd have a tree the size of
a tulip. A Floppy Tulip, Huh?

257
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,560
A tree needs something else. And
what a tree needs are mineral

258
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,260
minerals from the soil.

259
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,710
Very similar to the sorts of vitamins
and minerals that humans need.

260
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,300
What kind of minerals does a tree need?
Like nitrogen and phosphorus, magnesium,

261
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,900
potassium and calcium and copper.
Why? What do these do for the tree?

262
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,590
I can a tree stand up straight
without minerals or can it can't? No.

263
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,443
So for example,

264
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,500
Lignin is important for making a tree
stand up straight and Lignin is full of

265
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,360
nitrogen but also compounds like
nitrogen is important in DNA, right?

266
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:57,540
It's an integral part
of DNA, like crucial.

267
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,720
If I want to be a healthy tree and
reach for the sky, then I need,

268
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,480
I need rocks in me somehow.
Liquid rock you do,

269
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:08,481
you need the nutrients that are in the
soil and that's where the fungus comes

270
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:08,910
in.

271
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,910
The fungus has this incredible network
of tubes that's it's able to send out

272
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:19,371
through the soil and drop water and
mineral nutrients that the tree needs.

273
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,080
I thought I thought tree roots just sort
of did like I thought I always imagined

274
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,460
tree roots were kind of like straws,

275
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:30,720
like the tree was like already doing that
stuff by itself, but it's the fungus.

276
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,000
It's doing that stuff. Yes.

277
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,810
In a lot of cases it is the fungus because
tree roots and a lot of plant roots

278
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:41,250
are not actually very good at
doing what you think they're doing.

279
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,900
She says the tree can only suck up
what it needs. Do these, you know,

280
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,430
mostly through the teeny
tips of its roots. And that's
not enough bandwidth. So,

281
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,340
okay, so the fungus is given
the tree, the minerals.

282
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
What is the tree given back to the fungus?

283
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,680
Remember I told you how
trees make sugar? Yeah.

284
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,120
So that's what the tree
gives the fungus sugar.

285
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,590
The fungi need sugar to build their bodies
the same way that we use our food to

286
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:05,760
build our body. So you can't
photosynthesize, they can't take up CO2.

287
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,510
And so they have this trading
system with trees. She says,

288
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:13,410
what'll happen under the ground is that
the fungal tubes will stretch up toward

289
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,730
the tree roots and then they'll tell
the tree with their chemical language,

290
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,180
I'm in the neighborhood. Um, can you,

291
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,270
will you soften your roots so that
I can invade your root system?

292
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,920
And the tree gets the message and it
sends a message back and says, yeah,

293
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:33,620
I can do that. Like I can start
softening up my cell walls and uh,

294
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,680
and make room for you.

295
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,130
And then those little tubes
will wrap themselves into place.

296
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,470
The little white thread, you can see
it, the white stuff is the fungus.

297
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,030
And we saw this in the Bronx.

298
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,950
The little threads just
wrapping themselves around
the tree roots and the kind

299
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,040
of

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,430
part of the root intertangled
just around the edge. Okay.

301
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,420
And it's in that little space between
them that they make the exchange.

302
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,230
What exchange would that be, Robert?
That would be sugar, mineral sugar,

303
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,830
literally sugar, minerals, minerals,
sugar, minerals, mineral sugar, minerals,

304
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:11,720
sugar, minerals. And so on. What? I
forgot to ask you something. Pardon?

305
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,020
Yes. Um, if the, if the tube system
is giving the trees the minerals,

306
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,660
how is it getting it? The
minerals? How's it getting them?

307
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:23,160
Is it just pulling it from the soil?
Well, that's a miracle. That's like,

308
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,190
that is I got to say doing this story.

309
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,550
This is the part that knocked me silly.

310
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,900
We'll be right back. Hello. This
is Ricardo from beautiful Monroe,

311
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:36,734
New York.

315
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,810
hi, I'm Bessie music. I have a new show
remade in America, presented by cafe.

316
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,050
I'm exploring what it's like to
be an outsider in this country.

317
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm talking to people
from all walks of life.

318
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,560
People like me who came here from other
countries and people who were born here

319
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,400
but never felt like they totally
fit in like our recent guests,

320
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,310
Cameron Esposito. When
I realized I was gay,

321
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,030
I was at a college where you could be
kicked out of school for being gay.

322
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,930
Join us as we talk about the America
from a totally different perspective.

323
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm Jabil run. I'm Robert Krulwich.
This is radio lab. And uh, so wait,

324
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,761
what was the,

325
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,460
what was the answer to my question about
how does the fungus get the minerals?

326
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, it's, it's a three pronged
answer. What a fungus does,

327
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,730
is it [inaudible] it hunts it mines,

328
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,920
it fishes and it strangles. What,

329
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,130
how the hell I'm not making this up.

330
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,800
In 1997 a couple of
scientists wrote a paper,

331
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:54,300
which describes how fun guy have
developed a system for mining.

332
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:59,301
Jennifer says that what the tubes do
is they work their way back and forth

333
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:04,020
through the soil until they
bump into some pebbles,

334
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,730
these little soil particles,
packets of minerals, and then

335
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,700
they secrete acid and these acids come
out and they start to dissolve the rock

336
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,550
like you're drilling and the fungus
actually builds a tunnel inside the rock

337
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,910
and it can reach these little
packets of minerals and mined them.

338
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,840
Why? If you look at these
particles under the microscope,

339
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:29,230
you can see the little tunnels
they curve. Sometimes they branch,

340
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:31,000
they look just like mining tunnels.

341
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,630
This is very like if you had a
little helmet with a light on it,

342
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:37,910
like I'm a human. Yeah. Maybe not
with a helmet, but yeah, no whiteness.

343
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,950
Seven tubes or something. Yeah.
Wow. And that's just the beginning.

344
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,940
Jennifer told a lot of an eye about
another role that these fungi play and

345
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:48,070
that's hunter hunter. What
do you like? The plant is

346
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,750
hunting for water or I mean the fungus,

347
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,540
the fungus is hunting the fungus on tap.
Well, how do you meet? How do you mean?

348
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,400
So they're the little insects
that lives in the soil.

349
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,390
He's just adorable little
creatures called springtails.

350
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,840
They're sort of flea sized and they
spend lots of time munching leaves on the

351
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:05,680
forest floor.

352
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,980
They're called springtails cause a lot
of them have a little organ on the back

353
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:13,981
that they actually can kind of like deploy
and suddenly they spring way a pie in

354
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:14,920
the air

355
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,830
in the David Attenborough version.
And if you want to look on Youtube,

356
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,250
he actually takes in nail.
This pin will give you an idea,

357
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,120
hooks it at this little sprinkle and the
sprinkles, and I don't see it anywhere.

358
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,890
It's gone into the air. Then of
course, because it's the BBC,

359
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:30,611
they take a picture of it.

360
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:34,090
It's doing like a triple double axle
back flip or something into the sky.

361
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,410
It's the equivalent of a human
being jumping over the Eiffel Tower.

362
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,610
Anyhow, one of the things
they eat is fungus,

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,080
but then scientists did an experiment
where they gave some springtails some

364
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:47,861
fungus to eat.

365
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,790
They sorta put them all together in a
dish and then they walked away and then

366
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,440
they came back and they found that

367
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,020
most of the springtails were dead.
Instead of eating the fungus,

368
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,310
it turns out the fungus ate them
in the little spring tail bodies.

369
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,450
There were little tubes
growing inside those hoods,

370
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,770
and this is what makes
it even more gruesome.

371
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,270
They somehow have a die and don't ask me
how they know this or how they figured

372
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:13,481
it out,

373
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:16,600
but they have a little stain that they
can put on the spring tells to tell if

374
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,870
they're alive or dead. When they did this,

375
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,050
they saw that a lot of the springtails
that had the tubes inside them were still

376
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:29,530
alive. Oh, that's cool. Yes.

377
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,070
The fungus were literally sucking the
nitrogen out of the Springdale springtails

378
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:37,160
and it was too late to get
away. Nope pulling cake anymore

379
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,200
and then they did experiments with the
same fungus that I'm telling you about

380
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:46,201
that was capturing the springtails and
they hooked it up to a tree to try to

381
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:50,260
calculate how much spring kill
nitrogen is traveling back to the tree.

382
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,290
Well 25% of it ended up in the trees
so they figured out who paid for the

383
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,890
murder, right trees.

384
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,560
Is there anyone whose job it is to
draw a little chalk outlines around the

385
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,250
spring inspected

386
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,510
tail is is the,

387
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,100
is the only spring town with a trench
coat and the head of the door? Yeah,

388
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,420
I have even I can go better
than even that. Huh? There is,

389
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,450
they have found salmon in tree rings like
the as in the fish in the tree in the

390
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,770
tree. Well in a way,

391
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,830
how would the hell apparently bears park
themselves in places and grab fish out

392
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:31,610
of the water and then you know,

393
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,420
take a bite and then throw the carcass
down on the ground. The phone guy,

394
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,471
you don't have to.

395
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:39,590
It's rained and snowed and the carcass
is seeped down into the soil a bit.

396
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,031
The fung,

397
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:44,510
I then go and they drink the salmon
carcass down and then send it off to the

398
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:46,180
tree. [inaudible]

399
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,720
sets evidence of it now, salmon
consumption. I was like, wow,

400
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,340
that's insane. Salmon rings
in trees. That's, it's insane.

401
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,320
I look and beyond that,

402
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,810
there are forests that we are trees
that the scientists have found.

403
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,780
We're up to 75% of the
nitrogen in the tree.

404
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,740
Turns out to be fish food from just
bears throwing fish on the ground. Yeah.

405
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,690
So the you, if you would
take away the fish, the,

406
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,350
the trees would be like
blitzed, hobbled really.

407
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,910
And is it as dramatic in
the opposite direction?

408
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,280
Like the fungus seem to
be given the, the trees,

409
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:24,050
a lot of minerals at like from the truth
for sake of how much of their sugar are

410
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,740
they giving to the fungus. Ah, well
I asked Suzanne about that like 2% or

411
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,210
0.001% or no. Um, well,

412
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:35,480
people have been measuring
this in different forests
and ecosystems around the

413
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:40,481
world and the estimate is anywhere from
20 to 80% will go into the [inaudible].

414
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,590
What? Yeah, 20 to 80% I'll
go into the below ground,

415
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,420
goes down to the mushroom team,

416
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,480
into the roots and then into
the microbial community,

417
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,130
which includes the mushroom team. Yeah.

418
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,800
The point here is that the scale of
this is so vast and we didn't know this

419
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:01,060
until very, very recently. You have
a forest, you have mushrooms now.

420
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,080
It turns out the bear network and together
they're capable of doing things of

421
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:09,490
behaviors, forest, real
behaviors that are deeply knew.

422
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,020
We just learning about
them now and they're so

423
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,903
interesting.

424
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,093
[inaudible]

425
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,200
let's say it's times are good.
The tree has a lot of sugar.

426
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:24,310
I don't really need it all right now.

427
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,690
I'll put it down in my fungi
and then when times are hard,

428
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,290
the fungi will give me my sugar
back and I can start growing again.

429
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,090
What do you mean? Look, fungi will
give me my sugar. It's like a,

430
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,590
it's like it is a cute, it
is like a bank. She says,

431
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:42,460
we now know the trees give each
other loans. Oh yeah. Back and forth.

432
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,330
Seasonally. They can also send warning
signals through the fungus. Yeah.

433
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:51,460
So we've done experiments and other
people in different labs around the world.

434
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,980
They had been able to figure
out that if a tree is injured,

435
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,110
it'll cry out in a kind of chemical way,

436
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,640
and those chemicals will then move through
the network in warn neighboring trees

437
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:05,890
or seedlings.

438
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,710
That's something bad is
happening. I'm, I'm under attack.

439
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,520
There is an enemy in the midst. So if
a beetle were to invade the forest,

440
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:17,380
the trees tell the next tree over,
here come the Paul revere sort of. Yes.

441
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,660
That seems to be what's
what happens. So you can,

442
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,790
you can see this as like a game
of telephone. One tree goes, oh,

443
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,210
the next one goes, oh, oh,
oh. And then they do snuff.

444
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,150
They start producing chemicals
that taste really bad.

445
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,080
So the beetles don't want to eat
them. We'll go, eh, I don't want that.

446
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,830
What are the spookiest examples
of this, as Suzanne mentioned,

447
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,160
is an experiment that she and her team
did where they discovered that a forest

448
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:47,580
is warming up, but is it happening all
over the world? Temperatures are rising.

449
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,520
You have trees in this
forest that are hurting.

450
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:54,120
They don't do well in warm temperatures
and their needles Turnell sickly yellow,

451
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,750
they will send out, oh no, this is not
so good signal through the network.

452
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,370
But also the other important thing we
figured out is that as those trees are

453
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:07,050
injured and dying, they'll dump their
carbon into their neighbors. So,

454
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,790
so carbon will move from that dying
tree. So its resources, its legacy.

455
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,960
We'll move into the microrisal
network into neighboring trees. Oh,

456
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,250
so it says to the newer, the healthier
trees, here's my food, take it,

457
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:24,390
it's yours. Or it could be like, okay,

458
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm not doing so all, so I'm going to
hide this down here and my, my seal.

459
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,150
I don't know if you're
a bank or if you're in.

460
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,040
So it's not necessarily saying give
it to the new guy. Well we don't know.

461
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:39,300
I mean again it's a tree. It doesn't,
right. No, I know. I'm just trying to say,

462
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:40,140
make sure I understand.

463
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,900
I realized that none of these
conversations are actually spoken.

464
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,980
Give it to the new guy. Give it to the
new. But that's what she's saying. Yes.

465
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,903
Yes.

466
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,540
Suzanne says she's not sure if the tree
is running the show and saying like,

467
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,660
you know, give it to the new guy, or
maybe it's the fungus under the ground.

468
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,300
It's kind of like a broker and
decide who gets what. You know,

469
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,400
I don't completely understand. She says,

470
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:04,020
one of the weirdest parts of this though
is when sick trees give up their food,

471
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:08,820
the food doesn't usually go to their kids
or even to trees of the same species.

472
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,820
What the team found is the food ends up
very often with trees that are new in

473
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,680
the forest and better at
surviving global warming.

474
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,890
It's as if the individual trees were
somehow thinking ahead to the needs of the

475
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:27,120
whole forest. So we know that Douglas
Herb will take a dying Douglas for,

476
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:30,480
we'll send carbon to the
neighboring ponderosa pine. Um,

477
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,010
and so why is that? Like so and I
think that, you know, the whole forest,

478
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,670
then there's an intelligence there
that's beyond just the species.

479
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,740
Wait a second. Wait a second. You
just used a very interesting word.

480
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:48,330
I know Robert. I have, you know
what? It's 10 o'clock off to go.

481
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,320
Oh, all writing. So interesting. But
I unfortunately right at that point,

482
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:56,970
Suzanne basically ran off to
another meeting, but hello,

483
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,560
Suzanne speaking. Oh, there
you are. Hi Robert. Hi.

484
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,540
We did catch up with her a few
weeks later when we last left off.

485
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm just saying, you just said
intelligence isn't, doesn't,

486
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,880
don't professors begin to start falling
out of chairs when that word gets used

487
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,800
regarding plants? Yes.

488
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,690
We don't normally ascribe intelligence
to plants and plants are not thought to

489
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:22,800
have brains, but when we look
at the below ground structure,

490
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,480
it looks so much like a brain physically
and now that we're starting to

491
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,810
understand how it works, we're going,
wow, there's so many parallels.

492
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,600
I do find it magical.

493
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,310
I think there is something
like a nervous system

494
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,310
in the forest because it's the same
sort of large network of nodes sending

495
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,150
signals to one another.

496
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,330
It's almost as if the forest is
acting as an organism itself.

497
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,583
[inaudible]

498
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,670
you know th they talk about how honeybee
colonies are sort of super organisms

499
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:11,311
because each individual bee is sort of
acting like it's a cell in a larger body.

500
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,030
Once you understand that the trees
are all connected to each other,

501
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,000
they're all signaling each other,
sending food and resources to each other.

502
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,420
It has the feel, the flavor
of something very similar.

503
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,530
[inaudible] [inaudible]

504
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,160
special thanks to Dr. Theresa Ryan of
the University of British Columbia, uh,

Stevenson Swanson there into any mcewen
and Ben a feral who both produces peace.

508
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,590
Thank you. Alright.
College. Okay. It's time.

509
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,810
Time for us to go and,

510
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,010
and lie down on the
soft forest floor. Yeah.

511
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,490
And may hopefully not be liquified
by the fungus and beneath us.

512
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,960
Yes.

513
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Nice final thought. Bye everybody.
Bye. I'm Robert Krulwich.
