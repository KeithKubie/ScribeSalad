00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.210
 I'm the case of the Brazilian cartoonist tuf 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.790
 The account of a cartoon I made 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.140
 showing a prime minister netanyahu 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.910
 from israel 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.610
 twisting a child's corpse 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.119
 where the vote came from in an 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:25.340
 I was rated the third highest index 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:27.950
 the most representative key 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.310
 of the Arab Spring in the Egypt Area was 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.920
 that of a young man who had been 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.860
 who was tortured and killed by the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 Egyptian policeman holding with his a 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.650
 a bar here I usually say that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.800
 mike brown was killed twice 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.010
 he died by the bullet of the policeman and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.650
 died by the decision of the jury court 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.460
 in Ferguson that cleared the policeman who 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.280
 killed him 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.610
 so you have a black mother hugged 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.149
 with the son also in school uniform 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.010
 shot 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.940
 in the background a favela and the police 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.780
 smiling 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.520
 this demonstrates well through the image 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.320
 this situation of extermination of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.710
 black and poor population that people 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.930
 verified in the works in Brazil is the state 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.740
 it's a state policy 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.690
 So when you have a police officer that 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.470
 has as a preferred target the black and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.720
 poor 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.170
 he is actually instituting a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.170
 official racism an institutional racism
