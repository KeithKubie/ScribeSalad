00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.380
We saw several videos ago that
we can parameterize a torus or

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.670
a doughnut shape as a position
vector-valued function

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.980
of two parameters.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.820
And this is the
outcome that we had.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.000
I think I did it over
several videos because

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.050
it was a bit hairy.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.500
And I'll write our position
vector-valued function first.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.220
So we have r as a function of
our two parameters s and t.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.080
And then I'll review a little
bit of what all the terms--

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.430
what the s, the t, and the
a's and the b's represent.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.550
But it's equal to b
plus a cosine of s.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.980
And once again, we saw
this several videos ago.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
So you might want to watch the
videos on parameterizing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
surfaces with two parameters to
figure out how we got here.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.660
Times the sine of t.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.070
I'm going to put the s
terms and the t terms

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.440
in different colors.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.860
Times our i unit vector.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.960
I'll put the vectors,
or the unit vectors

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.640
in this orange color.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.470
Plus-- I'll do it in
the same yellow.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:16.490
Plus b plus a cosine of s times
cosine of t times the j unit

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.270
vector-- the unit factor
in the y direction.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.970
Plus a sine of s times the
k unit vector or the unit

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.940
vector in the z direction.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.570
And in order to generate the
torus or the doughnut shape,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.320
this is true for our
parameters-- so we don't wrap

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.820
multiple times around the
torus-- for s being between 0

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.940
and 2 pi and for t being
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.680
And just as a bit of review,
we're all of this came from--

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.030
and I'm going to have to do
what my plan is for this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.280
video over several videos.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.510
But let's review where
all of this came from.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.640
Let me draw a doughnut.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.360
My best effort at a
doughnut right here.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.850
That looks like a
doughnut or a torus.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.720
And you can imagine a torus, or
this doughnut shape is kind of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.130
the product of two circles.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.790
You have the circle that's
kind of the cross section of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.900
the doughnut at any point.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.040
You could take it there.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.370
You could take it over there.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.320
And then you have the circle
that kind of wraps around all

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.930
of these other circles or these
other circles wrap around it.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.030
And so, when we derived this
formula up here or this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.790
parameterization, a was the
radius of these cross

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.230
sectional circles.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.510
That's a.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.890
That's what these a terms were.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.340
And b was the distance from the
center of our torus out to the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.520
center of these cross sections.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.080
So this was b.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.530
So you can imagine that b is
kind of the radius of the big

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.170
circle up to the midpoint of
the, I guess, cross section.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.760
And a is the radius of the
cross sectional circles.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.410
And when we parameterized it,
the parameter s was essentially

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.810
telling us how far-- s was
telling us how far or where are

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.570
we wrapping around this circle.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.450
So it's an angle from 0
to 2 pi to say where

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.620
we are on that circle.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.680
And t tells us how much
we've rotated around

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.475
the larger circle.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.650
So if you think about it, you
can specify any point on this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.210
doughnut or on this surface or
on this torus by telling

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.390
you an s or a t.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.870
And so that's why we picked
that as the parameterization.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.470
Now, the whole reason why I'm
even revisiting this stuff that

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.500
we saw several videos ago is
we're going to actually use it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.900
to compute an actual
surface integral.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.480
And the surface integral we're
going to compute will tell us

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.140
the surface area of this torus.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.340
So this surface right here is
sigma, like that and it's being

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.435
represented by this position
vector-valued function.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.200
That is parameterized by these
two parameters right there.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.540
And if we wanted to figure out
the surface area, if we just

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.270
kind of set it as the surface
integral we saw in, I think,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.670
the last video at least the
last vector calculus video I

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.380
did that this is a surface
integral over the surface.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.460
Here this capital Sigma does
not represent a sum, it

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.270
represents a surface of a bunch
of the little d sigmas--

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270
a bunch of the little
chunks of the surface.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.240
And just as a review, you
can imagine each d sigma

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.880
is a little patch of the
surface right there.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.290
That is a d sigma.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.400
It's a double integral here
because we want to add up

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.830
all of the d sigmas
in 2 directions.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.000
You can imagine one kind of
rotating this way around the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.190
torus and then the other
direction is going in the other

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.440
direction around the torus.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.050
So that's why it's
a double integral.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.230
And this is just going to give
you the surface area, which is

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.310
the whole point of this video
and probably the next

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.580
one or two videos.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.150
But if you wanted to also
multiply these sigmas times

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.550
some other value-- there's some
scalar field that this is in

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.500
that you cared about-- you
could put that other

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.560
value right there.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.330
But here we're just
multiplying it by 1.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.060
And we saw in the last video
that it's a way of expressing

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.100
an idea, but you really can't
do much computation with this.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.750
But a way that you can express
this so that you can actually

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.290
take the integral, you say this
is the same thing-- and we saw

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.510
this in the last
several videos.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.080
This is the same thing as the
double integral over the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.610
region over which our
parameters are defined.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.690
So it's this region over here
where s and t go from 0 to 2 pi

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.790
of whatever function this is.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.760
We just have a 1 here, so we
could just write a 1 if we

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.530
like; it doesn't change much.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.490
Times-- and this is
what we learned.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.150
Times the magnitude of the
partial derivative of

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.310
r with respect to s.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.010
The magnitude of that crossed
with the partial derivative

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.370
of r with respect to t ds.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.250
You could take it in
either order, but ds dt.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.460
So we saw this in
the last video.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.570
What we're going to do now
is actually compute this.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.060
That's the whole
point of this video.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.340
We're going to take the cross
product of these two vectors.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.580
So let's figure out
these vectors.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.020
Then in the next video
we're going to take

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.780
the cross product.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.520
And then the video after that
we'll actually evaluate

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.570
this double integral.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.900
And you're going to see it's a
pretty hairy problem and this

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.745
is probably the reason that
very few people ever see an

00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:42.330
actual surface integral
get computed.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.470
But let's do it anyway.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.940
So the partial derivative of
r with respect to s-- so

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.040
this term right here.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.180
We'll do the cross product
in the next video.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.030
This term is what?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.240
We just want to hold t
constant and took the partial

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.440
with respect to just s.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.060
So this up here, if you
distributed the sine of t times

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.940
b-- that's just going to be a
constant in terms of s,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.160
so we can ignore that.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.350
Then you have sine of t
times this over here.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.570
So sine of t and
a is a constant.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.680
And you take the derivative
of cosine of s.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.330
That's negative sine of s.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.210
So the derivative of this with
respect to s or the partial

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.580
with respect to s is going to
be minus a-- I'll write in

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.526
green the sine of t, so you
know that's where it came from.

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:32.870
Sine of t and then sine of s.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.800
The derivative of this
is negative sine of s.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.070
That's where that
negative came from.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.790
And then I'll write the
sine of s right there.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.180
Times the unit vector i.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.310
That's the partial of just this
x term with respect to s.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.050
And then we'll do the
same thing with the y

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.270
term or the j term.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.230
So plus-- same logic-- b times
cosine of t with respect to s.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.240
When you take the
partial [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.750
becomes 0 so you're left with
a-- well, it's going to be a

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.460
minus a again because when you
take the derivative of the

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.110
cosine of s it's going to
be negative sine of s.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.890
Let me do it.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.660
You're going to have a minus a.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.810
This cosine of t.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.960
Minus a cosine of t.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.490
That's the constant terms.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.260
Sine of s.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.470
Just taking partial
derivatives.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.945
Sine of s j.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.790
And then finally, we take
the derivative of this

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.810
with respect to s.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.980
And that's pretty
straightforward.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.000
It's just going to
be a cosine of s.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.362
So plus a cosine of s k.

00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:49.490
Now hopefully you didn't
find this confusing.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.810
The negative sines because
the derivative of cosines

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.090
are negative sines.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.690
So negative sine of s.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.290
That's why it's negative sine
of s times the constant.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.290
Negative sine of s times the
constant-- the constant

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.163
cosine of t sine of t.

00:09:01.163 --> 00:09:03.140
So hopefully this makes some
sense just as a review of

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.710
taking a partial derivative.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.795
Now let's do the same
thing with respect to t.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.240
And I'll do that in
a different color.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.750
So we're now going to take the
partial of r with respect to t.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.530
So the partial of r with
respect to t is equal to-- so

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.690
now this whole term over here
is a constant, and so it's

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.630
going to be that whole term
times the derivative of this

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.120
with respect to t, which
is just cosine of t.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:35.910
So it's going to be b
plus a cosine of s

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:43.130
times cosine of t i.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.980
And then, plus-- and it's
actually going to be a minus

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.400
because when you take the
derivative of this with

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.670
respect to t it's going
to be minus sine of t.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.590
So it's going to be negative
and then let me leave some

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.810
space for this term right here.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.150
Negative sine of t.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.340
And you're going to have
this constant out there.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.790
That's a constant in t.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.230
b plus a cosine of s.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.730
That's just that
term right there.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:15.780
Derivative of cosine t is
negative sine of t times j.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.150
And then the partial of this
with respect to t-- this

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.340
is just a constant in t.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.910
So the partial's going to be 0.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.195
So I'll write plus 0k.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.130
Let me do all my vectors
in that same color.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.290
Plus 0 times the unit vector k.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.240
So that gives us our
partial derivatives.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.770
Now we have to take their cross
product, then find the

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.930
magnitude of the cross product,
and then evaluate this

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.930
double integral.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.460
And I'll do that in the
next couple of videos.
