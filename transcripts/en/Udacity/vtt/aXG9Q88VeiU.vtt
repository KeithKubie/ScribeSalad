00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.740
In this case, there is only one correct answer, which

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.939
is keeping the old and new state on the routers

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.650
and switches. This is the two-phase commit approach that we

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.630
talked about. Running different controllers

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.400
for different switches could obviously

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.630
result in an inconsistent state, since each of those controllers

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.630
maybe making independent decisions. Keeping a hot spare replica does

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.340
no good if the replica also writes state inconsistently to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.460
the network. And resolving conflicts on the routers also doesn't work

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.380
because no router has a complete view of the network state.
