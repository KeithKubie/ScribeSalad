00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:07.837
Beauty is a very interesting form of intelligence

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.860
that contributes to our
ability to make sense of life.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.040
It's not necessarily the visually pleasing that is beautiful.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
That's why I think color is so important

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.540
because it gets to you right
away.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.660
It kind of gets into your senses before you know

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.860
that you're dealing with it.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.801
I have always been interested in different

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.410
scales, even when I was a kid I can
remember that I put like 10 different

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.270
sheets together and tried to paint a large
painting, so going big scale or small

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.953
scale they're all different formats that
I really like. When I work outside, I have

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:04.678
a totally different question that is
brought to my work, which is scale

00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:12.160
basically and not how often or how many
layers you put on top. It's more about the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.390
extension, the relatioship to other sizes,
like in this case, the sky and the sea and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.971
the beach which are
spatially so unlimited.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.360
I was painting white, white layers on top
first so that the red would really sit on

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.520
the surface and really glow and not sink
into the given materials. I chose three

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.370
different reds that are building up a
certain depth and kind of fuse together. I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.150
chose to use orangey-red, I wanted a very
artificial color to be really popping out

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.470
of the whole given color scheme here, like
the blue sky or the sandy dunes and then I

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:19.890
used a magenta. I wanted something that
didn't exist in nature per se. The most

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.250
interesting thing about spraying from a industrial gun is it makes

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.040
you so much bigger. It really gives you a
totally different body, your reach is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.630
multiplied. You become like superwoman
with it. I could allow the movements more

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.650
range and by doing so, I got a far more
unruly and less schematic painting in the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.197
end which I think is more intimate in a
sense.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.360
On the fourth day I think I came to a very

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.240
dense red kind of amalgamation of
the house and the painting. So it was

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.450
nearly like a one to one proportion and I
thought it was very strong the red and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:25.520
very saturated. It was a very interesting
collaboration between Klaus and I. He made

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.320
me rethink the relationship of the house
to the environment and what that painting

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.640
was in relation to the painting I've done
so far. I realized it did not connect to

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.480
the sand or to the environment anymore at all. The next day I was able to understand

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.270
that I had to go further away from the
house and really paint in the air in a sense

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.870
and to have this spray that is
actually something that is moving in the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.060
air. It's not just coming from a fixed
stick in your hand. So I had to unleash

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.247
that even more and that really made a big
difference.

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.520
I don't really think of the completion of

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.810
a work at the start. I don't have a look
in my head that I think that's how it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.130
should be executed. But I have at the
start a certain set of premises or

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.504
thoughts that kind of make me behave in a certain way with my painting.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.920
It felt very extraordinary to paint here

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.190
to have a relationship with landscape that
has gone through a lot of different

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.440
stages. I had a great time working outside
here, I mean what an amazing location.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.822
To be on the beach but have something really great to do is not so bad.
