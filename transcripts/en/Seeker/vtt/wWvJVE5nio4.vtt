00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.800
Nebulas to nebulas, dust to dust.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.430
What happens when a galaxy goes bust?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.730
Hello aspiring galactic overlords and their
bumbling henchmen, Trace here.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.210
This is DNews.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.470
Galaxies are collections of millions and billions
of stars, the Milky Way probably has 100 to

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.250
400 billion or so (we don’t really know).

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.730
Andromeda, our closest neighbor galaxy, probably
has 400 billion stars (but could have a trillion!).

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.990
The thing is, Andromeda is likely dead.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.609
Probably has been for a few billion years.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.609
Just like stars, planets, you, me, and our
hopes and dreams -- galaxies can die, or ‘quench’

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:39.809
as astronomers call it.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.872
In fact, half the galaxies in the universe
are dead, and thanks to a recent study, we

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:47.399
are starting to figure out exactly how they
died.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.609
Gasses like hydrogen are used by galaxies
to make new stars; as the gasses fuse, the

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.469
hydrogen is fused into helium, and then the
helium into more elements like carbon, oxygen,

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.739
iron, and so on.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.049
As long as stars are being created, a galaxy
is deemed “alive,” but when galaxies stop

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.880
making new stars… they’re considered “dead.”

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (which has been
routinely observing the sky since 2000) has

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.579
found nearly 50 million galaxies so far, and
through all this data scientists recently

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.659
found one way galaxies can die…

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.369
Galaxy Strangulation.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.450
Basically, the hydrogen gas that the galaxy
needs to make stars is slowly cut off, and,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.869
four billion years later, according to this
recent paper in Nature, GALACTIC DEATH.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.079
There are a number of things that can strangle
galaxies.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.320
If the victim galaxy ventures near a massive
body like a black hole, another galaxy, or

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.920
galactic cluster, gravity can pulls gas from
the interloper, suppressing star formation

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.610
-- and starting it on a path to death.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.229
This is called Galaxy Harassment.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.140
Or, if that weren’t bad enough, there’s
Ram Pressure Stripping, when victim galaxy

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.049
gets too close to a hot x-ray-emitting cluster,
and the “wind” from the hot cluster “blows”

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.259
the star-forming gas out of the victim!

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.700
Space is pretty insane.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.290
They finally figured out galactic strangulation
by looking at all those metals the galaxies

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.429
make while alive, and determined: that by
looking at the shape and color of a galaxy

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.430
you can see it’s life cycle, and how it
died.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.349
Galaxies have color and shape, collectively
called morphology.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.190
They can be lots of shapes, but their colors
are a bit simpler to grasp.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.930
New, young stars make galaxies blue; they’re
burning their fuel fast and loose, being reckless

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.320
and staying out late.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.519
Inside those galaxies are patches of red and
pink -- called HII (H-two) regions.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.011
These are the star-forming regions, and they’re
mostly visible in ultraviolet (which is one

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:39.070
of many reasons why we need lots of telescopes
to see all the things going on in the night

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.070
sky).

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.129
As they age, galaxies lose the HII regions,
the young stars within them swell and cool…

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.510
and the galaxy turns red...

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.439
damn, too real.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.960
As they get old, they tend to collapse onto
themselves forming elliptical little sad reddish

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.120
blobs.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.690
On the shift from young blue galaxies to old
red ones, they are thought to move through

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.590
what astronomers call the “green valley,”
-- a joke about the color of light in-between

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.800
blue and red.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.250
Without new stars coming up, the amount of
metal we can see increases.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.760
Supernovas fuse more heavy elements, and the
now-dead galaxy cools and cools… eventually

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.250
become an infrared corpse galaxy.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.250
InfraRIP.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.590
So, I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but the Milky Way?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.239
We just might be in the green valley.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.370
We’re still making stars, but according
to a 2011 paper in the Astrophysical Journal,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.069
we’re definitely in the mid-life stretch.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.440
Don’t worry, y’all.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.970
For now, our good old Milky Way is just fine.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.970
For now...

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.530
If astronomers are right, we’ve got billions
of years of galactic life left.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.650
And just because it’s not forming new stars,
doesn’t mean a galaxy is entirely dead.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.160
There’s still a chance it can save itself.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.549
Sometimes, “dead” galaxies, become zombie
galaxies…

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.260
Like our friend Andromeda.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.810
Andromeda is dead, but still on the move,
and it’s heading this way.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
Andromeda should collide with the Milky Way
in about 4 billion years, forming a new, massive

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.430
galaxy!

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.340
(FYI: our solar system will see this happen.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.450
Our sun will have expanded and roasted earth,
but it will still be here.)

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.650
In true Báthorian fashion, old galaxies can
sometimes consume younger, star-forming galaxies

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.500
to extend their lives!

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.110
Maybe the merged Andromedy will be able to
reinvigorate its formation furnaces, and kick

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.420
some more life out of our galactic tires...

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.440
Even if we don’t, we’ll eventually merge
with more and more galaxies forming a massive

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.330
elliptical galaxy, filled with metal, and
burning near infrared.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.410
We can’t do episodes like this without our
sponsors.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.410
No domain extension will help you tell your

by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.830
We talked a lot about colors and ages of galaxies
but what about their shapes?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.170
How do they get those shapes?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.420
