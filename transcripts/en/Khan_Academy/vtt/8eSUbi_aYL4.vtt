00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:00.857
- [Voiceover] All right,

00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.434
we're told that the
arithmetic sequence a-sub-i

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.869
is defined by the formula where
the ith term in the sequence

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:10.330
is going to be 4 plus 3

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.698
times i minus 1.

00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:14.788
What is a-sub-20?

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:17.226
And so a-sub-20 is the
20th term in the sequence

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.642
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.568
and figure out what is the 20th term?

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:23.356
Well, we can just think
about it like this.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.930
A-sub-20, we just use this
definition of the ith term.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.368
Everywhere we see an i,
we would put a 20 in,

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:35.368
so it's going to be 4 plus 3 times 20

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.148
minus 1,

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:40.933
so once again, just to be clear, a-sub-20,

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.742
where instead of a-sub-i,
wherever we saw an i,

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.460
we put a 20,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.620
and now we can just compute
what this is going to be

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.641
equal to.

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:50.453
This is going to be equal to

00:00:50.453 --> 00:00:54.377
4 plus 3 times 20 minus 1

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:56.095
is 19.

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:57.975
3 times 19,

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.482
let's see, 3 times 19 is 57, right?

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.107
It's 30 plus 27, yep.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:05.684
This is 57,

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:10.467
and 4 plus 57 is equal to 61,

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.718
so the 20th term in
this arithmetic sequence

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.597
is going to be 61.

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:18.826
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.777
And here, they've told us
the arithmetic sequence

00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:23.168
a-sub-i is defined by the formula

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:24.050
a-sub-1,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.560
they gave us the first term,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.231
and they say, every other term,

00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:30.691
so a-sub-i, they're defining
it in terms of the previous

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.290
terms, so a-sub-i is going
to be a-sub-i minus 1

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.055
minus 2,

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:38.516
so this is actually a
recursive definition of

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:39.886
our arithmetic sequence.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:41.558
Let's see what we can make of this,

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.903
so a-sub-5,

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.364
a-sub-5 is going to be equal to,

00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:48.941
we'll use this second line right here,

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.542
a-sub-5 is going to be equal to

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.746
a-sub-4 minus 2.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.998
Well, we don't know what
a-sub-4 is just yet,

00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:59.111
so let's try to figure that out.

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:02.640
So we could say that a-sub-4 is equal to,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.614
well if we use the second line again,

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.841
it's going to be a-sub-3, minus 2.

00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.233
We still don't know what a-sub-3 is.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.601
I'll keep switching colors
'cause it looks nice.

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.829
A-sub-3 is going to be equal to

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.802
a-sub-3 minus 1,

00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:20.774
so a-sub-2 minus 2.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.352
We still don't know what a-sub-2 is,

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.883
and so, we could write,

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:29.064
a-sub-2 is equal to

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:30.643
a-sub-2 minus 1,

00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:33.684
so that's a-sub-1 minus 2.

00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:35.983
Now, luckily we know what a-sub-1 is.

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:38.885
A-sub-1 is negative 7.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:41.207
A-sub-1 is negative 7,

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:44.969
so if this is negative 7,

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.103
then a-sub-2 is negative 7 minus 2,

00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:50.448
which is equal to negative 9.

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:51.888
Well that starts helping us out

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:54.163
because if a-sub-2 is negative 9,

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:55.649
if this is negative 9,

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.646
then a-sub-3 is negative 9

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:58.877
minus 2,

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.524
which is equal to negative 11.

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:04.937
Well now that we know that
a-sub-3 is negative 11,

00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:06.864
so this is negative 11,

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:09.047
we could figure out a-sub-4 is negative 11

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:10.347
minus 2,

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:13.644
which is equal to negative 13.

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:14.875
And we're almost there.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:16.082
We know a-sub-4,

00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:17.893
the fourth term in this
arithmetic sequence

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:19.518
is negative 13,

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:20.633
so,

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.376
we can now,

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:23.257
so if this is negative 13,

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:25.393
a-sub-5 is going to be a-sub-4,

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.367
which is negative 13 minus 2,

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.594
which is equal to negative 15,

00:03:30.594 --> 00:03:32.080
so the fifth term in the sequence

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.145
is negative 15.

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.579
And we're all done.
