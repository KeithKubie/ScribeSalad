00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.090
Blockbusters have become the dominant form
of film in the 21st century, telling fantastical

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.430
tales full of stuff people can only dream
of.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.620
It’s no secret why they’re so popular;
they provide audiences with escapism and are

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.100
usually prime illustrations of movie magic.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.790
As great as many of these works are, there’s
no denying that trends that frequently pop

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.020
up in them have started to wear out their
welcome.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.160
As the studios look for ways to push the creative
envelope in new and creative ways, hopefully

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.460
they find some solutions to 10 blockbuster
movie clichés you are definitely tired of.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Fake-Out Deaths

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.659
A surefire way to generate an emotional response
from the viewer is to tragically kill off

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.110
a fan-favorite character.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.980
Not only is it a tear jerking moment, but
it can also underscore the high stakes and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.539
illustrate that nobody is safe when the action
ramps up.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
Unfortunately, with multi-picture contracts
becoming the norm, characters that “die”

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.649
on screen rarely stay dead.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.790
This twist was effective when it first began,
but it’s been so overplayed now that deaths

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.790
have lost their meaning.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.230
Now, it’s more of a surprise when a person
never returns, and that shouldn’t be.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.489
If you want moviegoers to care, they have
to feel that the heroes are in some sort of

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.499
danger and can’t just come back whenever.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.170
Final Installments Broken Up

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.060
Studio executives are always looking for ways
to make a quick buck, and one of the most

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.050
frustrating ways is to split the final installment
of a popular series into multiple parts, forcing

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.660
audiences to pay twice – or even three times
– to get the full story.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.530
Starting with Harry Potter, this trend is
most prevalent in YA adaptations, but with

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.970
The Hunger Games and Divergent seeing diminishing
returns using this strategy, it seems that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.410
audiences have voiced their displeasure with
their wallets.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.510
Sequels are fine, but they want each entry
to tell a complete narrative with a clear

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.530
beginning, middle, and end.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.050
Money Grabbing Sequels

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.670
If a studio strikes gold with a film, either
by design or surprise, their inclination is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.230
to start working on the next one.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.690
Since large crowds turned up once, they’ll
be eager to see another, right?

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.380
Turns out, modern audiences are becoming smarter
about which sequels they support.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.970
As demonstrated by the recent disappointment
of Alice Through the Looking Glass, it seems

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.510
like the follow-up actually needs to have
high demand if it is to be a hit.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.060
People nowadays can tell when the filmmakers
have an interesting story worth telling, or

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.750
when they’re just shamelessly trying to
cash in on a recognizable brand.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.750
Trailers Spoiling Movies

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.280
For the most anticipated tentpoles, the premiere
of the trailer can become just as big an event

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.019
as the final film.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.920
Fans can’t wait to get a look at the next
chapter of their favorite franchise, but frequently

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.800
are disappointed when the preview reveals
a bit too much about what the story entails.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.270
Several trailers in recent years have spoiled
interesting plot developments and secrets

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.740
months before the movie comes out, ruining
what could have been a compelling moment for

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.530
the sake of hooking casual audiences.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.400
With Star Wars setting records after The Force
Awakens remained shrouded in secrecy until

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.770
its release, hopefully the other studios learn
an important lesson in marketing.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530
Overreliance on CGI

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.390
Thanks to digital technology, anything is
possible and directors can see their wildest

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.390
dreams come to life.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.490
But CGI has a tendency to be too much of a
good thing.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.890
When a blockbuster is too reliant on splashy
visual effects, it loses something tangible

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.569
and real, which can hurt its connection with
the audience.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.770
Film buffs enjoy seeing practical effects
because they make everything grounded and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.150
relatable, even when it’s a galaxy far,
far away.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.170
CGI certainly has its place in modern Hollywood,
but it should be used to compliment real world

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.880
materials and not just be a crutch for the
filmmakers to lean on.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880
Generic Villains

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.270
They say a story is only as good as its villain,
and that means a lot of blockbusters these

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.210
days are sort of mediocre.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.460
Many heroes in recent years haven’t had
memorable foils to go up against, with the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.520
Joker, Loki, and Kylo Ren serving as exceptions
to the rule.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.130
Evildoers are frequently short changed by
the script and become plot devices instead

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.060
of compelling characters in their own right,
failing to leave a lasting impression.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.760
It’s true that not everyone can be Darth
Vader, but with just a little more effort,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.310
filmmakers can elevate villains from generic
to worthy opponent.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.110
The bad guys can be more interesting than
the hero at times, so this one is really disappointing.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.310
Lack of Diversity

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.099
If you look around the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
all of their films are led by white, male

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.099
actors.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.431
This obviously hasn’t had a negative impact
on the brand’s popularity, but the movies

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.209
are hardly a reflection of the world they’re
released to.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.890
Audiences are more diverse than ever, and
each demographic wants to be served equally.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.810
This means it’s important to mix things
up a bit in terms of casting.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.230
Star Wars made strides here by having John
Boyega and Daisy Ridley headline The Force

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.510
Awakens, and both Marvel and DC are giving
the spotlight to characters like Black Panther,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.210
Wonder Woman, and others soon.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.910
Looks like a new, more inclusive trend is
about to emerge.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.099
Women as Eye Candy

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.220
In the old school of thinking, the hero saves
the day and then he gets the girl.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.820
Several blockbusters depict female characters
as little more than objects of desire for

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.500
the male protagonist, at times exploiting
them for their good looks.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.449
Even the strong Princess Leia had to wear
a golden bikini.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.460
This understandably upsets some audience members,
who know that women are capable of being much

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.130
more than just a girlfriend.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.380
Between Black Widow, Rey, and Wonder Woman,
the tide is beginning to change as more actresses

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.120
are given the chance to play well-rounded
characters that earn several fans.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.120
Dark, Realistic Blockbusters

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.410
It worked for Christopher Nolan’s Batman,
but not every franchise is designed for a

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.500
dark, gritty tone.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.370
Most titles are created differently, and need
a film that best conveys its intended feel.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.150
Superman is meant to be a beacon of light
and hope, but Man of Steel provided a more

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.730
serious spin on the material.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.210
The Fantastic Four are supposed to be fun
and light-hearted, which is why the po-faced

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.560
2015 reboot failed miserably.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.910
Trying something different is always welcomed,
but the approach needs to be a fit for the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.150
source material.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.400
Several of these stories aren’t meant to
be “realistic” in that sense of the word,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.490
so filmmakers need to learn to lighten up
a bit.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.220
Subplots That Set Up Sequels

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.350
The dawn of the shared universe has essentially
turned franchise filmmaking into big screen

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.660
TV, and that hasn’t sat well with some.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.740
Many viewers go into a movie expecting a complete
story and want everything introduced to have

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.930
some kind of payoff.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.680
With multiple installments planned out years
in advance, studios have begun to introduce

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.680
certain elements and story beats in the current
film that won’t be explored until much later

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.350
on, giving them a disjointed feel.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.740
There has to be a reason for why something
is included in a movie, or it’s going to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.040
leave certain audiences confused.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.130
There’s a reason why the best Marvel movies
tend to be the ones separate from the connected

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.130
storyline.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.120
Those are our picks for blockbuster trends
audiences are tired of.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.300
Are there any we missed?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.660
Which ones do you want to see eliminated from
Hollywood?
