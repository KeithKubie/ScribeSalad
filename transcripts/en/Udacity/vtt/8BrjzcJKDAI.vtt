00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.400
So we're sitting here with Urs HÃ¶lzle, Senior

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.220
Vice President of Infrastructure here at Google. Urs, could

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.580
you briefly describe your role here at Google

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.510
and why Google has all of these data centers?

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.219
&gt;&gt; I am responsible for technical infrastructure at Google

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.370
and that's the team that builds all the data

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.250
centers, network servers, software systems that runs our internal

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.490
cloud and we built that a long time ago

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.220
for our own needs. And we have very large

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.820
scale applications and so we needed a very capable cloud.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.130
And now we're making that cloud available to everyone

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.070
through App Engine, Compute Engine, and our Cloud Platform overall.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.358
&gt;&gt; Urs, so what excites you about Google Cloud Platform and

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:47.570
App Engine in particular, which is the focus of this course?

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.392
&gt;&gt; What's great about the Google Cloud Platform

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:52.060
is, is really, one, that we can make our

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.430
great internal infrastructure accessible to every developer out there.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.170
And then, in the Cloud Platform, App Engine is

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.220
really the, that, that one system that makes it

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.379
really easier for you to start very small. And then

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.560
scale to a very large user base. So that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.990
if you have a game that suddenly becomes popular,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.970
our back-end and our front-end is going to scale with

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.190
you. And you don't really have to change your application

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.080
very much. And that's rare to see in infrastructure. Usually

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.310
you have to do the hard work up front. Now, with

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.440
App Engine, you kind of don't really have to do the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.660
hard work at all because we can do it for you.
