 The Guardian has achieved great success from which it turned from a British newspaper to 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.840
 One of the largest news sources in English in the world. 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.760
 Guardian products are spread all over the world but we are really keen on 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.800
 Reach beyond. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.390
 We have a great interest in the progress of space travel and space tourism 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.490
 So the members of the engineering and design team are now testing how to develop great experiences 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.240
 Which they receive on the planet and activate it anywhere you go to it even if in orbit, for example, 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 Or on the moon, or on a trip to Mars. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.030
 While testing our designs on the ground, we developed a system called Astro UI and implemented this system 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.909
 Through all of our products we provide user experiences. The gloves in the additional vehicle mobility unit are very large 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.780
 So we needed to design some new icons, specifically floating action buttons 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.390
 We also used multidimensional design guidelines for this. 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.640
 The other challenge we face in space is gravity, or lack of gravity. Using the principles of movement 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.299
 We have created a system called Fixed Point View which leads to automatic alignment 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.909
 For each of your articles, videos, and photos with the viewer no matter what your phone's status. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.689
 There are regular Android APIs that are very useful in space travel, 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 Especially the Text-to-Speech API. In space, you will sometimes be unable to look at the screen, 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.210
 Therefore, the "Read it to me" feature is very useful. The astronauts can then 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.170
 Listen to an article read through the helmet while they are on the moon, for example. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.249
 The test is really important because we need to identify the appropriate features and inappropriate features in space. 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.320
 On Google Play Developer Console, there's a new feature called 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.030
 hangout with expert. 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.719
 Welcome, I'm Captain Mark Kelly how are you? Do you hear me? 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.479
 This allows us to communicate face-to-face at any time with those who test the beta version in space 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.159
 Whether on Earth or in space. 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.289
 Travel to space is like going down fairly underground. Sometimes data charges are too high, 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.149
 Sometimes data can not be obtained at all. The APK files we use are of a very small size 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.180
 So they can be installed easily, and while these files are running we can cache as much content as possible. 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.599
 Innovation is at the heart of the Guardian's work groups 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.569
 All for the purpose of making our press service accessible to readers. 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.260
 Now these experiments are no longer confined to the Earth, but extend beyond the earth as well. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.040
 Both Android and Google Play are key to achieving this goal.
