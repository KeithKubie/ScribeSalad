00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.980
You are graphing polygon
ABCD in the coordinate plane.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.800
The length of segment
AB must be the same

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.530
as the length of segment
DC, and both segments

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.820
are horizontal segments.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.710
The following are three of
the vertices of the polygon.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.730
Vertex A is at the point 1, 1.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.950
It puts us right over there.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.100
That is the vertex A. Vertex
C is at the point 4.5 comma

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.990
4, so 4.5 along the
horizontal axis comma 4.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.920
So we go all the way up to 4.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.710
That right over
there is point C.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.430
Point D is at negative 1.5
comma 4, so negative 1.5

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.750
along the horizontal or
the x-axis, we could say,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.604
negative 1.5 comma 4, so 4 along
the vertical or the y-axis.

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:07.890
We go right over there.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.590
That's close enough.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.250
So that, of course,
is our y-axis.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.230
This is point D.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.990
And we need to figure out what
are the coordinates of point B

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.860
if B must be in quadrant
I. And they tell us

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.290
that the distance
from A to B must

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.960
be the same as the
length of segment

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.190
D to C in both our horizontals.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.200
So let's draw what
we know to draw.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.110
So DC, segment DC is this
segment right over here.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.500
And we see it's horizontal.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.880
Both of the vertical coordinates
are 4 at both vertex D

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.389
and vertex C. So both of the
vertical coordinates are 4.

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:48.680
Now what is the length of this?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.013
Because we're going to have
to construct another segment

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:52.180
that has the same length.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.040
Well, along the
horizontal direction,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.790
we went from
negative 1.5 to 4.5.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.940
So how far did we go?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.630
Well, to go from negative
1.5 to 0, you go 1.5,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.410
and then you have
to go another 4.5.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.340
So this is going to be 4.5
plus 1.5, which is equal to 4

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.470
plus 1 is 5, 0.5 plus 0.5
is 1, so 5 plus 1 is 6.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.865
So this distance right over
here is 6 of our units.

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:28.740
Actually, let me put
the coordinates in here,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.080
just so it becomes a
little bit clearer.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.476
Let me do that in
something easier to see.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:35.850
This right over
here is the point

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:46.750
4.5, 4, and this right over here
is the point negative 1.5, 4.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.690
Another way of thinking
about this distance

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.277
is you could take
the end point--

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.110
and we're really thinking
about the distance

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.619
just along its horizontal line,
so the y-value does not change.

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.660
It doesn't change in the
vertical direction, only

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.020
the horizontal.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.600
So you really want to say,
if you start at negative 1.5

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.530
and you get to 4.5,
how far have you gone?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.300
So you can just take your end
point, your end value, your end

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.550
horizontal value or
your end x-value,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.790
and from that, you can
subtract your starting x-value.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.670
So you subtract negative 1.5.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.850
And this, of course, is equal
to 4.5 plus positive 1.5,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.700
which, once again,
is equal to 6.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.220
Fair enough.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.320
And let me draw some of
the rest of the polygon,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.624
just so that we see it
is indeed a polygon.

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:36.040
We have this side
right over here.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.620
It looks like it's going
to be a parallelogram.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.300
We have this side
right over here.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.340
And we have to replace point B.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.550
Now, point B is going to
be someplace out here.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.460
It's going to have the
same vertical value

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.950
or the same y-value as
point A. So its y-coordinate

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.680
is going to be 1.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.320
So point B is going to
be out here someplace.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.735
Let me do this in a new color.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.790
I haven't used this orange yet.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.350
Actually, I have
used the orange yet.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.749
I haven't use the yellow.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:07.790
No, I've used the yellow.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.620
Let's see.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.820
I haven't used this green.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.630
Point B is going to
be someplace out here.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.538
We already know what
its y-coordinate is.

00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:19.079
It's a horizontal
line, so it's going

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.370
to have to have the same exact
y-coordinate as point A. Point

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.890
A's y-coordinate
was 1, so this is

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.040
going to have to have
a y-coordinate of 1.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.691
Now the big question is, what
is its x-coordinate going to be?

00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:37.190
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.370
It's going to have to be
whatever A's x-coordinate was.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.020
We see that A's
x-coordinate was 1.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.505
And it's going to have
to be that plus 6,

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:50.380
because we're going to
move the same distance

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.546
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:53.240
This thing has to be 6.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.150
So if we start at 1,
we add 6, we get to 7.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.130
So what are the coordinates
of point B, especially

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.050
if point B must
be in quadrant I?

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.440
And notice we are definitely in
quadrant I. This is quadrant I,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.030
this is quadrant II,
this is quadrant III,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.990
and this is quadrant IV.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.662
The coordinate for
point B is 7 comma 1.
