00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:10.138
The king's advisor, Arbegla, is watching all of this discourse between you, the king, the bird. And he's starting to feel a little bit jealous

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:14.354
'cause he's supposed to be the wise man in the kingdom, the king's closest advisor.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:17.221
So he steps in and says, "okay, so if you and this bird"

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.904
"are so smart, how about you tackle the Riddle of the Fruit Prices?"

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:27.838
And the king says, "Yes, that is something that we haven't been able to figure out."

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:32.521
"The fruit prices. Arbegla, tell them the riddle of the fruit prices."

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.739
And so Arbegla says, "Well,"

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.221
"we wanna keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot"

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:45.622
"to actually log how much it costs when we went to the market but we know how much in total we spent"

00:00:45.622 --> 00:00:50.238
"we know much we got. We know that one week ago, when we went to"

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:55.987
"the fruit market, we bought two, two, pounds of"

00:00:55.987 --> 00:01:01.387
"apples, we bought two pounds of apples, and one pound of bananas."

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:09.087
"one pound, I guess, of bananans, bananas. And the total cost"

00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:15.254
"that, time, was three dollars, so there was three dollars, three dollars"

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:21.636
in total cost. And then when we went the time before that we went the time before that

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:26.321
we bought six pounds of bananas or six pounds of apples I should say

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:32.487
Six pounds of apples. And three pounds three pounds of

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:36.954
bananas. Ba-nanas. And

00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:42.705
the total cost at that point was fifteen dollars. So

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:46.271
what is the cost of apples and bananas?

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:48.353
So you look at the bird:

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:51.654
The bird looks at you, the bird whispers into the king's ear, and the king says

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:56.671
Well the bird says we'll just start defining some variables here, so we'll start expressing this thing algebraically

00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.955
So you go about doing that. What we want to figure out is the cost of apples and the cost of bananas.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:06.688
Per pound. So we set some variables. So let's...

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:17.405
let a= the cost cost of apples, apple per pound. Per pound

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:23.054
And let's let b = the cost of bananas.

00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:29.072
Ba-nanas. Bananas per pound. So how could we interpret

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:34.138
this first information right here? Two pounds of apples and a pound of bananas cost

00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:43.054
$3. So how much are the apples going to cost? Well it's going to cost 2, two pounds times

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:48.338
the cost per pound, times a, that's going to be the total cost of apples

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:53.820
in this scenarios, and what's the total cost of the banana? Well it's one pound times the cost

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.639
per pound. So, you're just going to have b, that's the total cost

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.404
of the bananas, cause we know we bought one the total cost of the apples and bananas

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:07.304
are going to be 2a+b and we know what that total cost is

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:14.938
it is, it is $3. Now let's do the same thing for the other time we went to the market. Simply

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:20.137
Six pounds of apple, the total cost is going to be six pounds times A dollars

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:23.605
per pound and the total cost of banas is going to be

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:25.570
well we bought three poiund of bananas.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.938
and the cost per pound is b

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:31.488
and so the total cost of apples and bananas

00:03:31.488 --> 00:03:35.936
this scenario is going to be = to 15

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.721
is going to be = to $15

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:41.204
so let's think about how we might want to solve it

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:44.053
we could use elimination we could use substitution

00:03:44.053 --> 00:03:45.753
whatever we want, we might do it graphically

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:47.754
let's try it first with elimination.

00:03:47.754 --> 00:03:50.804
so the first thing I might want to do is

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:54.338
is maybe I want to eliminate let's say I want to eliminate

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:57.656
the a variable right over here so I have two

00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:00.039
a over here, I have six a over here

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.838
so if I multiply this entire right equation by

00:04:03.838 --> 00:04:09.088
-3 then this 2a would become a -6a and then it might

00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:10.504
be able to cancel out with that

00:04:10.504 --> 00:04:11.421
so let me do that

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:13.589
let me multiply this entire equation

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.638
times -3

00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:19.337
times negative three

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:23.071
so -3 * 2a is -6a

00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:27.256
-3 * b is -3b

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:30.555
and then -3 * 3 is -9

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.821
is -9

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.888
and now we can essentially add the two equations

00:04:35.888 --> 00:04:38.071
or essentially add the left side of this to the left side of that

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:40.372
or the right side of this equation to the right side of that

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:44.188
we're essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this equation

00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:46.054
because we know this is equal to that

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:47.288
So let's do that

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:48.888
let's do it

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.671
So on the left hand side, 6a and 6a cancel out.

00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:57.320
But something else interesting happens, the 3b and the 3b cancels out as well.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.771
So we're just left with 0 on the left hand side.

00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.654
And on the right hand side, what do we have?

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:07.987
15 - 9 = 6.

00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:12.271
So we get this bizarre statement! All of our variables have gone away

00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.738
And we're left with this bizarre nonsensical statement that

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:22.289
0 = 6, which we know is definitely not the case.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.472
So what's going on over here? What's going on?

00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:29.455
And then, you you you say, what's going on and you look at the bird

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:32.188
'cause the bird seems to be the most knowledgeable person in the room

00:05:32.188 --> 00:05:34.455
or at least the most knowledgeable vertebrate

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:37.236
in the room. And so the bird whispers into the king's ear

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:42.471
and the king says, "Well, he says that there's no solution

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.088
and you should at least try to graph it to see why."

00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:47.822
And you say, well, the bird seems to know what he's talking about

00:05:47.822 --> 00:05:51.604
So let me attempt to graph these two equations and see

00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:52.621
what's going on.

00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:57.238
And so what you do is, you take each of the equation

00:05:57.238 --> 00:05:59.321
and you like, when you graph it, you like to put

00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:02.671
it in kind of the y-intercept form or slope intercept form

00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:05.488
and so you do that, so you say, well let me

00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.290
solve both of these for b

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.904
so if you want to solve this first equation for b

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:12.304
you just subtract 2a from both sides

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.887
if you subtract 2a from both sides of this first equation

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:18.354
you get b is = to -2a

00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:23.204
+ 3. Now solve this second equation for b.

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:27.770
So the first thing you might wanna do is subtract 6a from both sides.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.271
So you would get, you would get, I'll do it right over, let me do it right over here.

00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:38.955
You would get 3b, 3b is = to -6a plus 15

00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:41.638
and then you can divide both sides by 3

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:44.122
you get b is = to -2a

00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:49.688
plus, plus 5. So the second equation, let me revert back

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:53.471
to that other shade of green, is b is = to -2a

00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:57.504
plus 5. And we haven't even graphed it yet, but it looks like

00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:59.253
something interesting is going on.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.938
They both have the exact same slope

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:04.921
when you solve in terms, when you solve for b

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:08.404
but they seem to have different, let's call them, b-intercepts

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:10.539
let's graph it to actually see what's going on

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:16.804
so let me get, draw some axes over here, let's call that my b-axis

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:20.372
and then this could be my, a axis

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:24.504
And this first equation has a b-intercept of positive 3

00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:28.104
so let's see, one, two, three four five

00:07:28.104 --> 00:07:31.354
the first one has a b-intercept of positive three

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:33.755
and it has a slope of negative 2

00:07:33.755 --> 00:07:36.455
So you go down or you go to the right one

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:39.504
you go down two. Go to the right one, you go down two.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.054
So the line looks something like this.

00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:44.071
I'm trying my best to draw it straight. So it looks

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:47.804
it looks something something like that

00:07:47.804 --> 00:07:49.603
And I'll just draw this green one.

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:52.904
This green one, our b-intercept is 5

00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:55.671
so it's right over here. but we have the exact same slope

00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.154
the slope of -2, so it looks

00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:04.123
it looks something something like that right over there

00:08:04.123 --> 00:08:07.421
and you immediately see now that the bird was right

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.805
There is no solution because these two constraints

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:14.622
represent or can be represented by lines that

00:08:14.622 --> 00:08:20.004
don't intersect. So the lines don't, don't intersect.

00:08:20.004 --> 00:08:22.254
In-ter-sect.

00:08:22.254 --> 00:08:25.588
They don't intersect, and so the bird is right

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.138
there's no solution, there's no x and y that can make this statement equal true!

00:08:30.138 --> 00:08:35.171
Or that can make 0 = 6, there is no possible, there is no overlap between these two

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.855
things. And so something gets into your brain.

00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:40.938
You realize that Arbegla is trying to stump you.

00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:43.421
And you say, Arbegla, you have given me

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:45.871
in-con-sistent information!

00:08:45.871 --> 00:08:48.904
This is an in-con-sistent system of equations!

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:53.138
In. In...con...sistent. Which happens to be the word

00:08:53.138 --> 00:08:55.220
that is sometimes used to refer to a system

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.304
that has no solutions, where the lines do not

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.720
intersect. And there fore this information is incorrect

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.939
We cannot assume that the apple or banana

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:08.687
Either you are lying, which is possible, or you accounted for it wrong

00:09:08.687 --> 00:09:12.304
Or maybe the prices of apples and bananas actually changed

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:14.789
between the two visits of the market.

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:18.539
At which point the bird whispered into the King's ear,

00:09:18.539 --> 99:59:59.999
and says, oh, this character isn't so bad at this algebra stuff.
