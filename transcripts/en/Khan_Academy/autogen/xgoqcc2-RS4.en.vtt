00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:09.757
 We need to deduct -2x ^ 2 + 4x - 1 from 6x ^ 2 + 3x - 9. 

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:13.797
 I recommend that you pause the video and see if you can solve it. 

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.096
 Okay, now let's do it together. 

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:18.563
 I can write it like 

00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:23.514
 6x ^ 2 + 3x - 9 

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:28.321
 minus this expression here, 

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.905
 so I'll put it in brackets, 

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:38.920
 minus (-2x ^ 2 + 4x - 1). 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 What can we do here? 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.263
 Well we can uncover brackets, 

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:45.562
 being careful with this negative sign. 

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.141
 Once we do, 

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.184
 we will get 6x ^ 2 + 3x - 9, 

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.774
 this will not change, so it's still the same. 

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:56.464
 6x ^ 2 + 3x - 9. 

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.064
 But after I uncover the braces here, 

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:01.445
 the negative of -2x ^ 2 

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.730
 is plus 2x2. 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.841
 So this will be plus 2 ... 

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.304
 I will leave a little more space. 

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:13.274
 Plus 2x2 and then subtract, 

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.875
 and then we have the negative of plus 4x f ... 

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.221
 Now I'll get 4x. 

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:20.692
 And then the negative to minus 1, 

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.513
 or the opposite to minus 1, which is plus one. 

00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:26.114
 I just unveiled the brackets here. 

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:28.554
 Now I can bring together the members who 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.740
 have the same degree of h ... 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.337
 So I have a member x ^ of the second degree, 

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:38.945
 here it is 6x12, 

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:41.290
 here I have a member 2x ^ 2, 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.660
 so I can put them together. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.401
 6x2 + plus 2x2. 

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.600
 If I have 6x 2 and then I have 2 x 2, 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.869
 how many squares do I have? 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.048
 Now I will have 8x ^ 2, 

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.169
 or 6x per square plus 2x square. 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:58.433
 We collect the coefficients 6 and 2, 

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:00.824
 to get 8x ^ 2. 

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:04.324
 Then we can collect members with x. 

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.212
 You can look at these as first-degree members, 

00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:08.120
 3x ... 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.615
 We have 3x 

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.135
 and then we have -4x, 

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.189
 so that 3x - 4x, 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.244
 if we have three of something and get 4, 

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.891
 now I will have one of these things minus 

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.470
 or could you say that the odds, 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.339
 3 - 4 makes -1. 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.730
 So now I have -1h. 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.739
 I can write it like -1x, 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.784
 but I can also write it just like -h. 

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.858
 This is the same as -1x. 

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:36.679
 Finally, I can go to free members. 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.603
 Draw 9 and then add 1. 

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.447
 You can ask, "How much is -9 plus 1?" 

00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:45.340
 Well this will be -8. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.535
 This will be -8 and we're ready. 

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.514
 Something that might seem interesting to you, 

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:56.519
 is that I had a lot here too 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.322
 I pulled another one. 

00:02:58.322 --> 00:03:00.957
 And I notice that I received a multi- 

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:04.062
 and this will always be the case. 

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:07.354
 If you think of the multitude of all the many, 

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.550
 if you just think about the crowd ... 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.536
 Let me write it in neutral color. 

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:12.022
 So if we look at the crowd here 

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.495
 of all the many 

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.329
 and if you take a multi- 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.452
 you can imagine that this is the purple multipurpose, for example. 

00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:21.193
 So this is a multi-faceted, 

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:24.322
 let us call it p from x. 

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:27.299
 This is p from x, 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.305
 p of x and then you got another multiplayer, 

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:34.929
 this one here, let's call it, 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.203
 I do not know, we can call it q of x, 

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.443
 q of x, just to be interesting. 

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:43.833
 That's q of x, that's right. 

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.586
 And if you apply ... 

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:48.693
 in this case we applied the subtraction action. 

00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:50.450
 If we apply subtraction ... 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.097
 you take these two, you take these two ... 

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:55.395
 Let's see how I can draw it nicely. 

00:03:55.395 --> 00:04:00.132
 So, we take p from x and pull out of it q from x. 

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:02.561
 Again we get a lot, 

00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.106
 so this will give us ... 

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:06.995
 We remain in the multitude of the multitudes. 

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:09.479
 You have a lot of things at any time 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.267
 and you may be more used to talking about it 

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:13.100
 with respect to integers 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.944
 or a number of numbers, but you can talk about it in general. 

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:18.685
 Here we are talking about the multitude of the multitudes 

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.123
 and we have just seen that if we start with two multi- 

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:23.117
 two members of the multitude of the ... 

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.316
 Let me be clear, these are multifaceted, 

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:28.245
 many, those here. 

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:29.844
 You take two members of the crowd 

00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:32.534
 and perform the subtraction action 

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:35.695
 and you will again get a member of the crowd. 

00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.871
 And when you have a situation like this, 

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.411
 I could call this one, 

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:40.467
 I do not know, the letters have ended. 

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.394
 Ok, let's just call it f from x, 

00:04:42.394 --> 00:04:44.437
 so here we get f from x. 

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:45.746
 When you have such a situation you take 

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:48.280
 two members of one set, apply action on them 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.451
 or you take a certain number of members from one set, 

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:51.391
 apply action on them 

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.842
 and again you get a member of the crowd, 

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:57.649
 we would say that this set is closed in this action. 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.297
 We could say that the crowd 

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:04.325
 of polynomials, the plurality of polynomials, 

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:08.662
 is closed, 

00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:11.094
 closed ... 

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:12.188
 I will not even put it in quotes. 

00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:16.288
 Closed on subtraction. 

00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:19.244
 And I did not prove it here, I just made an example, 

00:05:19.244 --> 00:05:21.520
 in which I pulled out two multiples 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.586
 and I got another. 

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:25.464
 Clearly, there is more accurate evidence you can do. 

00:05:25.464 --> 00:05:27.043
 But this is actually the case, if you have 

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.985
 two multiples, apply subtraction 

00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:32.236
 and you will get another multiplier. 

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:35.289
 And the modern way to say it is that the plurality of polynomials 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.123
 is closed at subtraction. 

00:05:37.123 --> 00:05:39.352
 This concept of closing something looks like this 

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:42.464
 very modern mathematical idea, but it is not too modern. 

00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:43.822
 It's just taking two members from one set, 

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:45.018
 to apply an action 

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.515
 and if you still get a member of this crowd 

00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:49.543
 after the action, then this set is closed 

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:51.538
 in this action.
