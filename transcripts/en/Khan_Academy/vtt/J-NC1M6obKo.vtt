00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.540
We're faced with the indefinite
integral of x plus 3,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.970
times x minus 1 to the fifth dx.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.870
Now, we could solve this by
literally multiplying out

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.430
what x minus 1 to the fifth is.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.980
Maybe using the
binomial theorem,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.980
that would take a while.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.920
And then we'd multiply
that times x plus 3,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.820
and we'd end up with
some polynomial.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.150
And we could take the
antiderivative that way.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.780
Or we could maybe make
a substitution here

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.840
that could simplify
this expression here.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.810
Make it something that's
a little bit easier

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.020
to take the antiderivative of.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.439
And this isn't going to be
kind of the more traditional u

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.620
substitution, where we just
set u equal to something

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.280
and see if its
derivative is there.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.490
But it's a kind of a form
of u substitution, where

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.420
we do set u equal to something
and see if it simplifies

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.560
our expression in a way
that, I guess, simplifies it.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.550
So let's try things out.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.960
So we have this x
minus 1 to the fifth.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.680
That would be a
pain to expand out.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.560
It would be nice if this
was just a u to the fifth.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.390
So let's just set this, let's
just set this to be equal to u.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.370
So let's set u as
equal to x minus 1.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.850
And in that case,
du is equal to dx.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.590
We could write
du/dx is equal to 1,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890
derivative of x, derivative
of negative 1 is just 0.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.320
And these two are completely
equivalent statements.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.810
And so if we did
that, how could we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440
rewrite this entire expression?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.140
Well, it would be equal
to the integral of-- well,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.633
we have x plus 3 right over
here, this is neither just u

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.940
nor is it du.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.300
So let's think about
how, what we can do here.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.720
Well, we could say, if
u is equal to x minus 1,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.140
we could add 1 to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.230
And we could say u
plus 1 is equal to x.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.310
And so for x, we can
substitute that with u plus 1.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.500
So let's do that.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.010
So we're kind of back
substituting in for x.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.800
So x is equal to u plus 1.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
And I'm just trying to
see if I can do something

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.230
to simplify this expression.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.620
So x is u plus 1, then
we have our plus 3 there,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.200
times x minus 1 to the fifth.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.650
x minus 1 was u, that's
the simplification

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.770
we wanted to make.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.250
So times u to the fifth power.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.750
And dx is the same thing as du.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.450
So du.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.250
Now did this get us anywhere?

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.350
Can we simplify this
to a form that it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.890
easy to take the
antiderivative of?

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.370
Well, it looks like it did.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.940
Let's see.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.850
We can rewrite this as this
expression right over here

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.040
is just u plus 4.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.730
Times u to the fifth-- I'll do
it all in one color, now-- du.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.980
And the reason why this
simplified things-- the way

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.700
this simplified things
is taking x minus one

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.950
to the fifth, that'd be a
really hard thing to expand.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.230
But u to the fifth is
just u to the fifth.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.040
And then it just
changed this x plus 3

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.460
into a u plus 4, which is
still a pretty straightforward

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.320
expression.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.580
And now we can just
distribute the u to the fifth.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.250
So we are left with u to
the sixth power plus 4,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.670
u to the fifth du.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.440
And this is a pretty
straightforward thing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.846
to take the antiderivative of.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:22.220
Now you might be
saying, hey Sal,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.630
this was-- how did you know
to set u equal to be that.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.230
And oftentimes with
integration, it's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.146
going to take a little
bit of trial and error.

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:30.740
There's a certain
bit of an art to it.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.327
But here the realization was
well, x minus 1 to the fifth

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:34.410
can be really complicated.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.743
Maybe u to the fifth might
make it a little bit simpler.

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:38.590
And that did just
happen to work.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.704
You could have tried u
is equal to x plus 3.

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:42.120
But it wouldn't
have simplified it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.560
as nicely as u equal
to x minus 1 did.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.940
But let's finish with this
integral right over here.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.730
So this is going to be equal
to the antiderivative of u

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.780
to the sixth.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.970
Well, that's just u to
the seventh over seven.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.530
Plus the antiderivative
of u to the fifth, that's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.160
u to the sixth over six.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.980
But we have the 4
out here, so it's

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.650
4 times u to the sixth over six.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.180
And then we have a plus
C. And this, the 4u 6

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.790
is the same thing as 2/3, so we
can rewrite this whole thing as

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.899
equal to u to the seventh over
seven, plus 2/3 u to the sixth,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.020
plus C.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.910
And now we just have to
undo our u substitution.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.160
u is equal to x minus 1.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.330
So this is going to be equal to
x minus 1 to the seventh over 7

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:43.110
plus 2/3 times x minus
1 to the sixth, plus C.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.600
And we're all done.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.450
We were able to take a
fairly hairy-- or what

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.200
could have been a hairy thing
if we had to expand this out--

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.730
and we were able to take
the antiderivative by doing

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.110
a little bit of
this u substitution

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.600
and u back substitution.
