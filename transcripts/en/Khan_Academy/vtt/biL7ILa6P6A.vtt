00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.500
A recipe for oatmeal cookies
calls for 2 cups of flour for

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.670
every 3 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.180
How much flour is needed for a
big batch of cookies that uses

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.270
9 cups of oatmeal?

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.810
So they tell us that we
have 2 cups of flour.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.060
Let me write that down.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.775
You need 2 cups of flour for
every 3 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.810
Now, what we need to figure
out is how much flour is

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.290
needed for a big batch that
uses 9 cups of oatmeal.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.700
We need to figure
out how much.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.910
So let's just call that amount
of flour we need for this

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.510
larger batch, let's call it x.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:07.875
That's equal to x cups of flour
for 9 cups of oatmeal.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.830
All we're saying, look, we need
2 cups of flour for every

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.810
3 cups of oatmeal.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.800
That has to be the same
as x for every 9 cups.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.630
The proportion has to hold.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.010
These ratios have to simplify
to the same fraction.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.550
Now, the easiest way to do this,
we can just get rid of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.090
the cups of flour and the cups
of oatmeal for now, and we can

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.930
just view this as a simple
proportion problem where it's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
2/3 is equal to x/9.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.010
And the simplest way to solve
this is to multiply both sides

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.770
of this equation by 9, and the
reason why we're multiplying

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.730
by 9 is so it cancels out with
this 9 in the denominator.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.680
You can view it as multiplying
both sides of

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.390
the equation by 9/1.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.050
So if you multiply both sides
by 9/1, the left-hand side,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.680
you'll have a 9 in the
numerator, 3 in the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.300
denominator.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.090
You can divide them both by 3.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.640
So 9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.810
3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.700
So your left side of the
equation is 3 times

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.525
2/1, so it's 6/1.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.650
Well, this 9 in the numerator
and this 9 in the denominator,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.500
they cancel out.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.870
They can both be divided by 9.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.120
So they cancel out, so
that is equal to x/1.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.550
6/1 is the same thing as 6. x/1
is the same thing as x.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680
So we get x is equal to 6.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.610
So we've just figured out, if
the recipe calls for 2 cups of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.870
flour for every 3 cups of
oatmeal, that means that we

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.700
need 6 cups of flour for every
9 cups of oatmeal.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.050
So we figured out that
x is equal to 6.
