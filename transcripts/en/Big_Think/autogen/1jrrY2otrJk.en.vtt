to go now we can all use a GPS device in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
to go now we can all use a GPS device in
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.590
to go now we can all use a GPS device in
a lot of places and this is the idea of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
a lot of places and this is the idea of
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080
a lot of places and this is the idea of
libertarian paternalism so if you get a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
libertarian paternalism so if you get a
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.480
libertarian paternalism so if you get a
credit card bill and it has some

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
credit card bill and it has some
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210
credit card bill and it has some
information about what happens if you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
information about what happens if you
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550
information about what happens if you
don't pay the full amount meaning you're

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
don't pay the full amount meaning you're
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530
don't pay the full amount meaning you're
gonna start getting charged interest or

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
gonna start getting charged interest or
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240
gonna start getting charged interest or
if it has information that tells you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.240
if it has information that tells you
something about the cost of late fees

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
something about the cost of late fees

something about the cost of late fees
that is like a GPS device in the sense

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
that is like a GPS device in the sense
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130
that is like a GPS device in the sense
that it doesn't force you to do anything

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
that it doesn't force you to do anything
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.760
that it doesn't force you to do anything
but it tells you a little bit

the world are using automatic enrollment
in something so that if people don't

that once you are working in many places
 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.800

you're just in a savings plan if you
don't want to be you can opt out but the

result of automatic enrollment has been
 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.330
result of automatic enrollment has been
to increase massively participation

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
