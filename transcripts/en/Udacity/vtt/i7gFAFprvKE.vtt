00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.170
The human genome is made up of many sequences

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.710
of letters of DNA that make us unique. In

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.190
double stranded form, theoretically, we could count all the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.650
base pairs of the entire human genome. In fact,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.720
if you had to guess, how many base pairs do you think it takes to store all the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.610
information necessary to make an entire human being? Now

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.770
obviously, I don't expect you to get this answer

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.130
right if you don't know it, but go ahead and give it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.710
your best shot. Even taking a wild guess can help your brain

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.450
to process the information so that when we finally do learn exactly

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.890
how many base pairs it takes, it will be that much more meaningful.
