and then I took my calibrations and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750
and then I took my calibrations and
 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.360
and then I took my calibrations and
applied them to the stars that I had

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370
applied them to the stars that I had
 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.630
applied them to the stars that I had
surveyed even though these are some of

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640
surveyed even though these are some of
 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.420
surveyed even though these are some of
the most nearby stars to us for many of

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
the most nearby stars to us for many of
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.070
the most nearby stars to us for many of
them it was the first time we learned

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080
them it was the first time we learned
 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.930
them it was the first time we learned
about their properties with accuracy

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940
about their properties with accuracy
 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.330
about their properties with accuracy
I also took my calibrations and applied

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340
I also took my calibrations and applied
 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.070
I also took my calibrations and applied
them to stars already known to have

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080
them to stars already known to have
 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.120
them to stars already known to have
planets around them

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130
planets around them
 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.810
planets around them
one example is kepler 372 a red dwarf

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820
one example is kepler 372 a red dwarf
 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.020
one example is kepler 372 a red dwarf
star with three planets using my

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030
star with three planets using my
 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.330
star with three planets using my
technique I showed that the star is

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340
technique I showed that the star is
 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.430
technique I showed that the star is
actually 15% bigger than we had

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440
actually 15% bigger than we had
 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.920
actually 15% bigger than we had
previously thought and because we

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930
previously thought and because we
 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.450
previously thought and because we
measure the properties of the planets

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460
measure the properties of the planets
 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.640
measure the properties of the planets
only relative to the properties of the

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650
only relative to the properties of the
 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.000
only relative to the properties of the
star this means that the planets are 15%

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010
star this means that the planets are 15%
 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.620
star this means that the planets are 15%
bigger to this change in size can be the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
bigger to this change in size can be the
 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.210
bigger to this change in size can be the
difference between a rocky earth-like

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220
difference between a rocky earth-like
 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.790
difference between a rocky earth-like
planet and one was significantly more

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800
planet and one was significantly more
 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.160
planet and one was significantly more
gas like Uranus or Neptune we lived in

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170
gas like Uranus or Neptune we lived in
 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.620
gas like Uranus or Neptune we lived in
an era where it is possible to point to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630
an era where it is possible to point to
 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.230
an era where it is possible to point to
a star at night and say this star has a

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
a star at night and say this star has a
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.140
a star at night and say this star has a
planet around it but it is around the

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150
planet around it but it is around the
 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.660
planet around it but it is around the
red dwarf stars that can't be seen that

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670
red dwarf stars that can't be seen that
 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.760
red dwarf stars that can't be seen that
we have the best prospects for finding

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.510
we have the best prospects for finding
and studying habitable rocky worlds it's

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520
and studying habitable rocky worlds it's
 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.000
and studying habitable rocky worlds it's
the planets orbiting these stars whose

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010
the planets orbiting these stars whose
 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.680
the planets orbiting these stars whose

and on which we will first have the
 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.580
and on which we will first have the
capability of finding signs of life by

capability of finding signs of life by
 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.140
