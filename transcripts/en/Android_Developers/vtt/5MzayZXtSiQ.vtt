COLT MCANLIS: Hello, everyone,

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.610
[CHEERING]

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.450
Round of applause,
who's hung over?

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.930
[CHEERING]

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.940
Round of applause, who
needs more caffeine?

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.700
[CHEERING]

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.227
Round of applause, who's
ready for some barbecue?

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.598
[CHEERING]

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.092
There you go.

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:22.800
Hello, everybody.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.290
My name is Colt McAnlis and I
am your final speaker for today,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.670
thank god.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.405
Sorry.

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:29.682
No.

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.140
AUDIENCE: We have
one more session.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.750
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, that is true.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.291
That is true.

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:32.830
Yes, sorry.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.746
And today what we're
going to be talking about

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:37.970
is something near and
dear to my heart--

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.360
continuous integration
for Android performance.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.675
Asleep yet, anybody?

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.175
COLT MCANLIS: Nobody?

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:43.754
[CHEERING]

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:44.420
We'll get there.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.045
Again, that's why I
asked the hung over

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.254
and the caffeinated part first.

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.670
By the way, there's
only some days

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490
you get to wake up and make
sure that your shirt matches

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.240
your slides.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.048
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.830
It's a design
decision I made today.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.890
Here's the rub with being
an Android developer.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.710
We're also Android users, right?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.340
Which means we implicitly know
what it feels like for an app

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.280
to not be performant.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.620
We know when we grab our
phone, and we start scrolling,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.120
and it's just hitchy,
that that's not cool.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.550
We know exactly what
it feels like to not

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.680
be able to get your
data fast enough

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.630
or see that little
stupid spinner every time

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.338
you open the app.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:30.100
We understand that anger, right?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.984
Admit it.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.650
Round of applause,
if you've uninstalled

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.390
an app because it
was not performing up

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.914
to your expectations?

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:39.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.350
And guess what?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.880
You need to remember
that feeling.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.190
Of the billions of users on
mobile today, they all do that.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.760
That is actually why we
like to say the perfmatters.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.040
For the individuals who
then go to uninstall

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.330
their application
because of performance,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.140
we found a correlation
of 73%-- they're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.120
more likely to go give negative
feedback in the store because

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.220
of it.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.400
And, in fact, they
will further go on

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.890
to tell their friends how
crappy their experience was

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.210
with your application just
because of performance.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.860
The correlation is higher
for negativity on performance

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.950
than anything else.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.500
From that standpoint,
performance

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.920
is actually a
business feature more

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.600
than it is a bunch
of bald guys yelling

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.357
about enums on the internet.

00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:29.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.314
I see some of y'all in here.

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:33.480
I'll get to you in a minute.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.710
That's why we like to say
that performance is hard.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.940
I'm sorry.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.420
I just realized something.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.930
I'm given a California
keynote in Texas.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.330
All right.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.830
Now let's try this again.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.950
We're going to start
this at top here.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.500
I came here to do
two things today.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.270
Number one's to kick ass and
number two's to give a keynote.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.183
And my keynotes almost over.

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:43.069
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.820
Now listen here.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.890
We got two things on
the agenda besides that.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.850
Keynote performance, barbecue.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.630
Listen, performance
is hard, y'all.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.950
That slide translated
pretty well, in my opinion.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.150
Performance is a hard.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.770
Look at all this crap
you got to do, right?

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.540
First off, there is just a
jazillion devices out there

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.510
you've got to worry about.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.560
I mean, people devices
attached to their cattle,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.140
attached to their watches now.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.344
I even saw, in [INAUDIBLE],
someone had a smart boot.

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:19.260
I don't know what it
does, but it's out there.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.092
And you've got to worry
about performance on it.

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:23.550
And then the problem
is, if he does

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.200
have a problem
with his smart boot

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.350
when he's out the
fields hunting quail,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.545
you can't repo the
performance problem.

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:31.920
Little do you know
that there was

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.340
a quail attached
to his boot when

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.070
he experienced that hitchiness.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.120
But that don't mean he
ain't going to give you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
a bad review for it.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.960
So as a developer,
it's hard for you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.292
to find these
performance bugs, right?

00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:45.250
Can I get a hell, yeah.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.730
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.770
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, that's pretty.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.170
Oh.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.320
We're going to milk that one.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.380
In addition to that,
when you do get the bug

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.120
and can finally actually
repo the damn thing,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.200
you got to go to do it manually.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.290
You got to hit the
button, and run the tool,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.630
and get the information,
and figure it out, and then

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.100
hand it back to
someone else, who

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.435
tells you're stupid because
there wasn't a quail

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:09.560
in the testing environment.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.710
I keep a well stocked
cupboard of quail, by the way.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.490
It's a delicious
animal, if you ain't

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.355
been quail hunting this season.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:22.980
The issue with that
though is that even

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.050
though you do this manual
profile, the tools are hard.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.310
I mean, listen, they're more
complex than a snub nosed bull

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.055
inside of a cotton field.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.640
I mean, come on now.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.860
So even when you can do
the manual profiling,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.750
you've got to go through
all this bullshit

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.570
to try to get through it.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.620
And the reason that the
tools are so complex

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.670
is that the daggone
system's complex, right?

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.250
I mean, we're talking about
stacking a bull on top

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.520
of a hayfield inside of a barn.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.839
You can't just do that.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.630
You can't just walk in
one day and be like,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.515
I'm going to stack some bulls.

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:01.095
No.

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.429
You've got to plan it, and
you got to get some diagrams,

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.303
and you got to get Chet
there, and Chet's got

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:07.090
to talk about it,
and then he tells you

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.720
that you can't check
in your damn code

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.470
because it ain't
compliant to readability.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.350
And I'll be like, I just want
to stack a damn bull today, OK?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.656
But you can't do it
because it's too complex.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:17.530
And that's all right.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.900
I can forgive that.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.940
But performance is
difficult because of it.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.600
And, of course,
the final problem

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.940
is actually going in and
making the damn changes

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.120
to fix the performance
issues that you realize

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.300
the smart boot was having
with that stupid quail out

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.730
in the field.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.100
Stupid quails.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.450
Now don't get me wrong,
we're here in Texas

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.660
and we enjoy a little
manual labor, am I right?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.340
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.620
COLT MCANLIS: Can
I get a hell, yeah?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.340
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.131
COLT MCANLIS: Wait.

00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.961
First off, who here is
actually from Texas?

00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.845
[CHEERING]

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:44.470
All right.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.175
Who's here from Oklahoma?

00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:49.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.740
Y'all go back.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.840
Arkansas?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.520
Oh.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.740
Bless your heart, honey.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.140
Bless your heart.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.070
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.420
Oklahoma.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.560
All right.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.140
So this is the reason that
performance is daggone hard.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.450
It's too difficult to
build our applications

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.620
in a performant manner
because of these things.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.190
And I've got to
tell you what, this

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.520
is the whole reason we started
the Android Performance

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.622
Patterns product.

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:21.702
AUDIENCE: Hell, yeah.

00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:23.160
COLT MCANLIS:
Joanna, this is where

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.650
you're supposed to clap
and get them all started.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.150
No, no.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.108
Just do it now, please.

00:07:27.108 --> 00:07:28.160
Thank you.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.906
Good help's hard to find.

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:38.030
This is the reason we
started this whole initiative

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.110
because it's too damn hard
to get the performance

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.500
of your applications right.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.610
And we started this
almost a year ago now.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.290
And we started putting the
videos online in January.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.880
So let's see what our
little hodung group has

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.556
done in the process here.

00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:51.380
[WEAK CLAPPING]

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.880
Nope.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.810
That was wrong.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.540
I gave you a sheet with
a time stamp on when

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.740
you're supposed to do it.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.714
Can you just look at
the sheet, please?

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:02.380
Bless her heart.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.602
She tries so hard.

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.060
So listen, actually
doing the work,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.920
we can't help you with that?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.660
You've got to go out there.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.030
You've got to get your
hands dirty, right?

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.780
I mean, if you're going
to be bailing hay,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.880
you've got to bail hay.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.900
You can't get a machine
to bale the hay for you

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.378
because that ain't Southern.

00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:17.176
[LAUGHING]

00:08:17.176 --> 00:08:18.300
I can't help you with that.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.883
That's on you.

00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:23.790
But the complexity of the
system, now that's something

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.477
I can help with.

00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:25.935
Again, trying to
get a bull stacked

00:08:25.935 --> 00:08:28.310
on top of a hen inside
of a barn-- it just

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.320
doesn't work that way.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.150
That's why this bald
man on the internet

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.970
has been rambling so much.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.049
The systems are so complex
and it's so difficult.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.924
You what it's like?

00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:38.549
It's like you getting
a burger and then

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.590
asking the waitress
what color the bull was,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.756
so you could understand the
temperature of the meat.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.990
It don't work that way.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.020
You need somebody to sit there
and tell you how it's actually

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.816
going to work.

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:51.690
And that's what these
videos have been doing.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.898
So from our perspective,
we've got you covered there.

00:08:53.898 --> 00:08:56.020
The complexity of the
system is all in the videos.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.119
We've been trying to
explain it to y'all people,

00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:59.410
especially y'all from Oklahoma.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.784
We know you've
got some problems.

00:09:00.784 --> 00:09:01.357
It's OK.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.565
We're going to take little
time and explain it to you

00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:05.035
the right way.

00:09:05.035 --> 00:09:06.910
For now though, you've
got the complex tools.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.685
So you can understand what's
going on underneath the hood,

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:10.670
but you don't know how
the daggone tools work

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.650
because it's a tennis sneaker--
my graphics guy gave me that.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.150
I actually don't
what that would do.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.220
Is that the smart boot, Asher?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.900
Where's Asher?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.740
Asher, is that the smart boot?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.500
Did we copyright that logo?

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.110
No?

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.000
Or is it a trademark?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.499
I forget.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.900
Someone said, it's
a trademark, no?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.880
I'm Southern.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.130
So the complex tools.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.350
So what do we do with that?

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.610
Well, the good news is,
we've got a whole, great team

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.170
dedicated to
actually letting you

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.360
know how to use these tools.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.020
And they're on
developers.android.com.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.780
We've gone through all of the
performance available tools

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.400
and tried to walk you
through how to actually use

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.309
them to solve your problems.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:49.600
So if you combine the videos
that tell you what's going

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.766
on under the hood and you
take a look at the tooling

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:54.080
documentation, y'all
should be able to do this.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.092
Unless you're from
Oklahoma or Louisiana.

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:58.751
[LAUGHING]

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.180
Sorry.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.430
Now the manual profiling part.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.721
Let's take a look at that here.

00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:05.170
Now that's still a challenge.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.800
I'm going to admit,
that's something

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.424
that we ain't got
around to fixing yet.

00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:11.000
I mean, it's only been
53 weeks at this point.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.150
But we have been making
some good changes.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.060
This is Systrace 2.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.940
Can I get a hell,
yeah for Systrace?

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.765
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:16.765 --> 00:10:19.140
Now in the Systrace tool, we
understand it's really hard.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.763
You've got to go
in there, you've

00:10:19.763 --> 00:10:20.600
got to click the
buttons, you've got

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.760
to understand what them little
fandung boxes are doing there.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.060
But we added something
in there for you,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.200
if you don't know about.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.180
See them little tags
up there at the top?

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.440
Those are alerts.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.740
As you do a capture, we're
going to analyze your frame

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.740
information and tell you what's
going wrong in them alerts.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.895
Now those pop up like
ticks on a mule deer.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.480
[LAUGHING]

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.882
When you click on one of them.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:50.090
Something I miss on that one?

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.714
It's just a mule deer.

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:53.630
They're out in the fields
out here everywhere.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.150
You never picked
ticks off a deer?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.430
OK.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.580
You click on one of them.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.496
It's going to tell, at
the bottom, the problem

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:02.940
that we found and how
you can go fix it.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.870
It's kind of like
a runtime lint.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.120
So we can help you
take your analysis

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.460
and get a little bit more
automation in finding out

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.092
where daggone problems are.

00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:13.050
Can I get a hell, yeah.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.383
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:15.757
Chet, can I get a hell, yeah?

00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:16.691
CHET: Hell, no.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.560
COLT MCANLIS: I'm going
to make you wear the hat.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.110
So we can't really fix that,
but we're making strides there.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.859
So what about this
difficult to repo part?

00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:30.800
That's actually
a little complex.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.080
Because the issue is, on
the Google Play Console,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.579
we can give you some really
good information, but most of it

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:38.310
is catered towards crashes.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.380
Some form factor of
Android development

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.050
crashes because
some person actually

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.060
tried to use a duck bill to
communicate with his device.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.360
And boom, there you go.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.370
We don't really have a
lot of good information

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:54.050
there with respect to how to
repo performance information.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.156
That really hurt my
mouth to say that time.

00:11:56.156 --> 00:11:58.040
Performance.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.790
Joanna, round of--

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.289
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:01.200
Thank you.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.900
So we can't really do that one.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.170
Now the different devices.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.590
Let's get real here for
a minute because we've

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.237
been not real so far.

00:12:10.237 --> 00:12:11.400
[LAUGHING]

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.010
So I'm sure you've
all seen a picture

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.150
like this on the internet.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.062
It's more popular than
them Bieber pictures

00:12:17.062 --> 00:12:18.020
that are out there now.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.250
Bless his heart.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.070
He needs some church.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.040
[LAUGHING]

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.530
That's as much as I can say
about that with my PR people

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.450
watching.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.720
Let's be honest about this.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.280
Yes, there is a lot
of form factors.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.135
And this is fan-goddamn-tastic.

00:12:34.135 --> 00:12:35.010
You want to know why?

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.500
Because this allows
your constituents

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.550
to get to your application at
every-- wait, constituents?

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.790
No-- at every price point and
form factor that they need.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.790
Individuals can make
the opportunity choice

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.300
to figure out if they want
the quail smart boot or the $3

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.530
million dollar
phone in their hand.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.540
This is fantastic, but it
does create a problem for you,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.480
as an individual,
on what you actually

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.210
test your performance on.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.580
So we can't really help
you with that either.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.510
But the good news is, when you
look at these three things that

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.843
we haven't been able to solve
as the Android Performance

00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:08.000
Patterns initiative
over the past year,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.960
hopefully some of y'all
see a pattern here.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.260
Oklahoma, you see a pattern?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.250
[LAUGHING]

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.260
They ain't left yet, so I'm
guessing they're still with me.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.710
See those are pictures
moving on the screen.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.420
Sorry.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.042
We love you, Oklahoma.

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:28.500
When you look at
these, you realize

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.208
that there's already
a solution out there

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:32.720
from a technological advance
perspective that solves this.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.970
And it is called
automated testing.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.550
Hell, yeah for
automated testing.

COLT MCANLIS: Raise your hand if
you use automated testing right

00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:41.810
now?

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.310
OK.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.080
That's all right.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.140
Hold on.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.760
Why are they all
sitting over here?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.820
That's like Gaussian
distribution

of people of people who are
actually test their damn code.

Are y'all just showing up late?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.250
Is that what happened?

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.710
Y'all are the
preventative programmers.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.710
And y'all just do
this shit ad hoc.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.830
Is that what's going on here?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.160
I just put some duct
tape on it and ship it.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.830
We'll blame the performance
man, if it ain't right.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.430
That's OK.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.304

00:14:11.304 --> 00:14:13.650
COLT MCANLIS: Hell, yeah.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.958
We're going to go
drinking later, boy.

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.067
[LAUGHING]

00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.650
So the truth is that
automated testing

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.330
solves this problem for you,
but we got a problem with that.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.620
It's that automated
testing ain't never really

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.446
been applied to performance.

00:14:26.446 --> 00:14:28.070
We do the testing to
be able to clicky,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.986
clicky the button, button
and figure out where

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:32.460
it crashed with the duck bill.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.530
That's a weird test.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.210
I had to get a duck and
I had to like harness it.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.670
It's all quacking like--

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.240
[QUACKING]

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.930
You can't tape its bill closed
because you have to feed it.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.670
So it's--

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.370
[QUACKING]

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.970
But then you put it on
one of them little dippers

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.469
right there.

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:47.150
And so he gets mad
and starts pecking

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.010
at the screen, if you put a
little feed pictures on it.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.810
And that's how we got our
testing done in the south.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.350
I hope you all got
a better version.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.730
Well, that's what
y'all use, right?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.220
That's called duck testing.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.860
Hashtag.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.630
#ducktest.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.310
[LAUGHING]

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.990
Automated testing
solves this, but we

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.620
haven't had a chance to apply
it to the performance realm.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.660
I mean, in reality,
this is what you want.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.160
You want some sort
of automated UI test

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.590
that can be run through a
bunch of different scenarios

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.682
and devices and provide for
you performance information.

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:21.140
Now if you had
something like that,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.450
what could you do with it?

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.830
If you had the ability to run
continuous integration tests

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.300
and get performance
data from it,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.800
what could that
actually give you?

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.175
Well, first off,
you can actually

00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:34.580
watch the performance health
of your application overtime.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.600
Hell, yeah.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.000
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.916
COLT MCANLIS: Number two
is you can figure out

00:15:38.916 --> 00:15:41.500
how those performance
metrics correlate to money.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.980
Money?

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.591
(SINGING) Bam, bam, bam, money.

00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.090
No?

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.790
ZZ Top, anybody?

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.920
Am I too old for that?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.070
I see some beards longer
than mine in here,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.090
I can't be that old.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.670
Although, I do have the least
hair, except for that guy.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.430
We're getting a beer later, too.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.300
You can actually track how your
performance actually adheres

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.640
to your monetization metrics
and y'all love money, right?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.598
Round of applause for money.

00:16:08.598 --> 00:16:11.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.560
Round of applause for barbecue.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.400
Aaron, I think you may have
a nice barbecue, money, trade

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.644
commission going on here.

00:16:21.644 --> 00:16:23.060
The nice thing you
can also see is

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.700
how your memory on
your device fluctuates

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.450
based upon the duck
testing UI changes.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.540
So you can actually see
that clicking a button

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.850
actually has these
ramifications of performance

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.100
across your environment.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.460
And finally, you could actually
be able, when someone actually

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.280
submits a change list,
to be able to tell them

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.150
that they're stupid
because it actually

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.570
caused performance problems.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:50.680
You could track that down right
to the exact CL in your GitHub.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.357
Hell, yeah.

00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.690
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.356
COLT MCANLIS: But
again, the problem is,

00:16:54.356 --> 00:16:58.760
we don't have this built,
which is why I am tickled pink,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.300
ladies and gentlemen,
to announce today,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.715
y'all going to build it.

00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:06.565
[LAUGHING]

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.280
We got one of the
fanciest code labs

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.839
our team could come up with.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.407
At 12:15, y'all are going to
build continuous integration

00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:18.490
environment for performance
for your applications.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.491
Hell, yeah.

00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:20.904
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:21.943
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:23.609
COLT MCANLIS: She's
trying too hard now.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.910
It's OK.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.694
She did spend a little
time in Oklahoma,

00:17:26.694 --> 00:17:27.819
although she is from Texas.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.020
A Googler was stabbed
to death today

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.630
for insinuating that someone
from Texas was from Oklahoma.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.636
May he rest in peace.

00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:44.260
But the truth is,
we're not done there.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.676
Not only are y'all going to
be able to go to this code lab

00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:49.390
and build the environment to
test your apps in a performant

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.920
manner, so you can make more
money on the back end and tell

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.961
them people checking in
code they're messing with

00:17:53.961 --> 00:17:56.630
your performance-- but
we can't stop there

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.430
because there's still a
fantastic amount of different

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.035
Android devices out there that
you need to run this code on.

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:03.660
And we know that you
can't get all them

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.700
devices in your pocket, in your
environment that your testing

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.710
on, on top of your desk.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.410
Which is why we got a
second code lab today

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.655
about how to use
Google Cloud Test,

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:15.280
so you can get your
performance running

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.600
application in an automated
environment on the cloud.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.321
Can I get a hell, yeah?

00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:21.654
AUDIENCE: (TOGETHER) Hell, yeah.

00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:23.377
AUDIENCE: Hell, no.

00:18:23.377 --> 00:18:24.210
COLT MCANLIS: Uh oh.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.080
Are you from Oklahoma?

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.850
[LAUGHING]

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.525
Hell no.

00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:28.191
AUDIENCE: Worse.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:28.950
Canada.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.530
COLT MCANLIS: Oh.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.865
Oh.

00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:34.655
[LAUGHING]

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.802
We will pray for you.

00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:42.538
[LAUGHING]

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.170
So this is going to bring
me to my second topic today.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.200
We covered performance.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.158
I want to talk about
something else real quick.

00:18:48.158 --> 00:18:50.100
I want to talk about barbecue.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.110
That's what we're
here for, right?

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.640
I've got to tell you, as hard
as performance is, barbecue

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.454
is damn near impossible.

00:18:56.454 --> 00:18:58.120
Now for those of us
who have been raised

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.880
on southern tradition, you
know that barbecue is not just

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.205
a cooking process,
it's about community.

00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:04.980
It's about family.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.820
It's about your cousin, who you
know ain't right in the head,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.840
but you let them in your
house on Sunday anyway.

00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:14.199
AUDIENCE: Hell, yeah.

00:19:14.199 --> 00:19:15.990
COLT MCANLIS: That's
what barbecue's about.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.930
It's about coming together.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.760
And I tell you what,
over the past year, what

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.860
we've been doing is trying to
build one hell of a community.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.480
And I've got to thank everyone
of you in the room here today

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.770
because y'all have
been a part of that.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.180
Y'all have been
watching the videos.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.020
You been on the
Google+ community.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.350
You've been using the
perfmatters hashtag.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.060
And I cannot tell you how
humbled I am that you're all

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.580
part of our barbecue.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.662
Thank you for that.

00:19:42.662 --> 00:19:45.578
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.750
But let's talk about
something real quick.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.630
[LAUGHING]

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:07.154
Even though y'all
are wrong-- Yes.

00:20:07.154 --> 00:20:08.570
If you've got the
shirt, stand up.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.340
Stand up.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.756
Stand up, if you've
got the shirt.

00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:11.490
One, two, three.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.642
Round of applause for
these wrong people.

00:20:13.642 --> 00:20:15.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.380
Bless their hearts.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.180
Bless their hearts.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.330
They came today despite--
these are the cousins you

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.530
invite to the barbecue.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.830
Right there.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.570
They just stood up.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.780
Well done.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.440
I've got to tell you what, this
is what I love more than ever.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.570
Y'all can argue with me until
I'm pickled in the face,

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.270
it don't matter.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.500
I will sit there and argue
with you happy, happy, happy

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.300
as a cat on a hot tin
roof because this means

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.740
you're part of our barbecue.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.987
It means you're passionate
enough about performance.

00:20:42.987 --> 00:20:44.820
And your code base--
you're willing to argue

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.570
with a bald man on the internet.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.510
And I know how hard that is.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.260
Thank you for being
part of all this.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.120
Thank you for being and loving
performance and everything

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.420
we do.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.999
So I've got to
tell you, from all

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:01.040
of the team that work on
this-- it ain't just me.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.831
It ain't just one, bald
man running around.

00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:04.702
We've got a whole team
back at Google HQ.

00:21:04.702 --> 00:21:06.660
I want you all to give
them a round of applause

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.285
because not all of
them are here today.

00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:09.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.170
This team works so hard in
getting these videos done,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.587
the documents done,
everything together.

00:21:15.587 --> 00:21:16.670
They're the ones to thank.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.180
I'm just the great looking
man on the internet

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.346
who gets to talk about it.

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:21.220
AUDIENCE: Hell, yeah.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.470
COLT MCANLIS: Hell, yeah.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.314
Was that guy bald who said that?

00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:28.730
So with that, I'm going to let
y'all get to the conference

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.240
today.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.099
We've got a fantastic
goddamn conference.

00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:34.640
When y'all go out there, I want
you to remember three things.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.164
Number one?

00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:37.385
AUDIENCE: Keep calm.

00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:38.426
COLT MCANLIS: Number two?

00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:39.895
AUDIENCE: Profile your code.

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:41.020
COLT MCANLIS: Number three?

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.280
AUDIENCE: Always
remember, #perfmatters.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.821
COLT MCANLIS: Hey,
get some barbecue.

00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:45.870
Thank y'all very much.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.420
