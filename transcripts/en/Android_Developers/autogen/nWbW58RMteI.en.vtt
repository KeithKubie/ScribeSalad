so the theme for this talk really is
thinking about how can android empower

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
thinking about how can android empower
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.749
thinking about how can android empower
you the developer to enable your app to

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
you the developer to enable your app to
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.780
you the developer to enable your app to
help users get things done and on the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
help users get things done and on the
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.460
help users get things done and on the
team we really think a lot about how to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
team we really think a lot about how to
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.650
team we really think a lot about how to
give your apps superpowers so you can

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
give your apps superpowers so you can
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210
give your apps superpowers so you can
help users throughout the operating

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
help users throughout the operating
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890
help users throughout the operating
system even when users aren't

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
system even when users aren't
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.120
system even when users aren't
necessarily in the full screen

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
necessarily in the full screen
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.900
necessarily in the full screen

experience of your app for this talk
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.839
experience of your app for this talk
will focus on three major areas that you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
will focus on three major areas that you
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.179
will focus on three major areas that you
can take advantage of in Android Q the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
can take advantage of in Android Q the
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880

first is with sharing next we'll talk a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
first is with sharing next we'll talk a
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440
first is with sharing next we'll talk a
little bit about notifications and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
little bit about notifications and
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600
little bit about notifications and
finally we'll discuss new details around

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
finally we'll discuss new details around
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.760
finally we'll discuss new details around
multitasking so in Android q we're

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
multitasking so in Android q we're
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130
multitasking so in Android q we're
excited to have launched our redesigned

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
excited to have launched our redesigned
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.869
excited to have launched our redesigned
share sheet experience and there's a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
share sheet experience and there's a
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400
share sheet experience and there's a
number of improvements that we've made

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
number of improvements that we've made
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.670
number of improvements that we've made
for improving user's experience so the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
for improving user's experience so the
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650
for improving user's experience so the
first is around much improved

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
first is around much improved
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.930
first is around much improved
performance through a new API that we've

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
performance through a new API that we've
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.860
performance through a new API that we've
introduced that we're going to talk

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
introduced that we're going to talk
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.119
introduced that we're going to talk
about a little more detail

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
about a little more detail
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220
about a little more detail
we've also actually updated the user

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
we've also actually updated the user
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.080
we've also actually updated the user
experience to make it simpler for users

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
experience to make it simpler for users
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850
experience to make it simpler for users
to figure out where they can share their

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
to figure out where they can share their
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950
to figure out where they can share their
content to so the share sheet is now

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
content to so the share sheet is now
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.090
content to so the share sheet is now
going to be organized into three

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
going to be organized into three
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280
going to be organized into three
sections the first is going to clarify

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
sections the first is going to clarify
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440
sections the first is going to clarify
what is the content that users can share

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
what is the content that users can share
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300
what is the content that users can share
to and will provide a default experience

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
to and will provide a default experience
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070
to and will provide a default experience
of what that looks like but you as a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
of what that looks like but you as a
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600
of what that looks like but you as a
developer can also provide additional

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
developer can also provide additional
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.810
developer can also provide additional
metadata to provide a richer preview

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820
metadata to provide a richer preview
 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.450
metadata to provide a richer preview
next up are our direct sharing shortcuts

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
next up are our direct sharing shortcuts
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670
next up are our direct sharing shortcuts
where you can share within apps and then

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
where you can share within apps and then
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770
where you can share within apps and then
finally our the app targets which have

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
finally our the app targets which have
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499
finally our the app targets which have
been split into two sections some which

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
been split into two sections some which
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030
been split into two sections some which
are suggested by the operating system

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
are suggested by the operating system
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249
are suggested by the operating system
and then finally the full alphabetical

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
and then finally the full alphabetical
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660
and then finally the full alphabetical
list and you'll see that it's a very

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
list and you'll see that it's a very
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.630
list and you'll see that it's a very
familiar interface to our launcher we've

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
familiar interface to our launcher we've
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399
familiar interface to our launcher we've
also included a lot of new developer

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
also included a lot of new developer
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140
also included a lot of new developer
customization options because we

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
customization options because we
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819
customization options because we
understand that a lot of you a lot of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
understand that a lot of you a lot of
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.740
understand that a lot of you a lot of
developers need to tailor their share

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
developers need to tailor their share
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660
developers need to tailor their share
sheet for various use cases and we want

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
sheet for various use cases and we want
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130
sheet for various use cases and we want
to enable and empower developers to do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
to enable and empower developers to do
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.270
to enable and empower developers to do
so so one area that I want to highlight

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
so so one area that I want to highlight
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280
so so one area that I want to highlight
in particular is the sharing shortcuts

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
in particular is the sharing shortcuts
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.649
in particular is the sharing shortcuts
API and really the goal of the sharing

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
API and really the goal of the sharing
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780
API and really the goal of the sharing
shortcuts API is to allow users to share

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
shortcuts API is to allow users to share
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420
shortcuts API is to allow users to share
more directly within your apps these sit

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
more directly within your apps these sit
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700
more directly within your apps these sit
above the app targets that users can

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
above the app targets that users can
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920
above the app targets that users can
share to and they can include targets

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
share to and they can include targets
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320
share to and they can include targets
like a close friend that you are in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
like a close friend that you are in
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240
like a close friend that you are in
contact frequently with or an important

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
contact frequently with or an important
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.990
contact frequently with or an important
work folder

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
work folder
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.490
work folder
the performance benefit that they

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
the performance benefit that they
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.710
the performance benefit that they
provide users we're gonna actually rank

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
provide users we're gonna actually rank
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.930
provide users we're gonna actually rank
these ahead of the old chooser targets

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
these ahead of the old chooser targets
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.750
these ahead of the old chooser targets
and so we encourage your adoption so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
and so we encourage your adoption so
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.980
and so we encourage your adoption so
users can take advantage of these in the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
users can take advantage of these in the
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.510
users can take advantage of these in the
API I'm switching gears now into

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
API I'm switching gears now into
 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.670
API I'm switching gears now into
notifications one thing that we looked

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
notifications one thing that we looked
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.410
notifications one thing that we looked
at at the start of this release is we

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
at at the start of this release is we
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.840
at at the start of this release is we
found that 75% of our users get at least

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
found that 75% of our users get at least
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.510
found that 75% of our users get at least
one buzzing notification or noise making

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520
one buzzing notification or noise making
 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.880
one buzzing notification or noise making
notification every hour and fifteen

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
notification every hour and fifteen
 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.980
notification every hour and fifteen
percent of users get these every ten

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990
percent of users get these every ten
 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.020
percent of users get these every ten
waking minute every time waking minutes

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
waking minute every time waking minutes
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.330
waking minute every time waking minutes
so we thought how can we help you just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
so we thought how can we help you just
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.220
so we thought how can we help you just
manage this overload and so we're

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
manage this overload and so we're
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.750
manage this overload and so we're
introducing the concept of gentle

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760
introducing the concept of gentle
 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.970
introducing the concept of gentle
notifications in queue and really the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980
notifications in queue and really the
 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.100
notifications in queue and really the
goal of gentle notifications is to help

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
goal of gentle notifications is to help
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.410
goal of gentle notifications is to help
organize those important and valuable

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420
organize those important and valuable
 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.479
organize those important and valuable
notifications that users want to consume

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
notifications that users want to consume
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.180
notifications that users want to consume
but that aren't time sensitive and that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190
but that aren't time sensitive and that
 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.190
but that aren't time sensitive and that
they can consume on whatever their own

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200
they can consume on whatever their own
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.370
they can consume on whatever their own
schedule is and so the story is for

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
schedule is and so the story is for
 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.290
schedule is and so the story is for
developers that you still set the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300
developers that you still set the
 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.460
developers that you still set the
priority as you normally would

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470
priority as you normally would
 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.040
priority as you normally would
users can still adjust that priority but

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050
users can still adjust that priority but
 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.990
users can still adjust that priority but
now the system will also help adjust

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
now the system will also help adjust
 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.729
now the system will also help adjust
that priority on behalf of users and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739
that priority on behalf of users and
 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.670
that priority on behalf of users and
this will mainly target notifications

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680
this will mainly target notifications
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.350
this will mainly target notifications
that are set with the default priority

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
that are set with the default priority
 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.160
that are set with the default priority
in AOSP and in Hue the system will use a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
in AOSP and in Hue the system will use a
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.560
in AOSP and in Hue the system will use a
heuristic model but we're also will be

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570
heuristic model but we're also will be
 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.449
heuristic model but we're also will be
incorporating on device machine learning

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459
incorporating on device machine learning
 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.759
incorporating on device machine learning
to make this a better experience having

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769
to make this a better experience having
 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.430
to make this a better experience having
organized notifications the next step is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
organized notifications the next step is
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.110
organized notifications the next step is
to make them even richer and more useful

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120
to make them even richer and more useful
 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.090
to make them even richer and more useful
to users and so the way that we're

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100
to users and so the way that we're
 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.009
to users and so the way that we're
tackling this problem is by enhancing

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019
tackling this problem is by enhancing
 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.050
tackling this problem is by enhancing
these notifications with suggested

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060
these notifications with suggested
 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.120
these notifications with suggested
actions there are two use cases that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130
actions there are two use cases that
 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.640
actions there are two use cases that
we're targeting for this the first is by

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650
we're targeting for this the first is by
 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.979
we're targeting for this the first is by
suggesting responses for users to reply

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989
suggesting responses for users to reply
 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.170
suggesting responses for users to reply
to with messages as well as providing

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180
to with messages as well as providing
 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.270
to with messages as well as providing
access to actions that are related to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
access to actions that are related to
 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.460
access to actions that are related to
the content of the notification so now

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470
the content of the notification so now
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.800
the content of the notification so now
messaging notifications on Android will

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810
messaging notifications on Android will
 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.530
messaging notifications on Android will
contain actions to navigate to an

let's see the hit the details that

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140
let's see the hit the details that
 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.410
let's see the hit the details that
matter most to you we know folks like

this experience even better so now we'll

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950
this experience even better so now we'll
 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.840
this experience even better so now we'll
show up to eight deep linked targets but

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850
show up to eight deep linked targets but
 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.960
show up to eight deep linked targets but
we know the loading chooser targets from

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970
we know the loading chooser targets from
 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.240
we know the loading chooser targets from
every installed chooser target service

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
every installed chooser target service
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.990

on a user's phone can be a little slow

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000
on a user's phone can be a little slow
 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.210
on a user's phone can be a little slow
so to make loading deep link targets

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220
so to make loading deep link targets
 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.140
so to make loading deep link targets
faster we need a new architecture so in

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150
faster we need a new architecture so in
 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.080
faster we need a new architecture so in
cue we're extending the shortcuts API to

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090
cue we're extending the shortcuts API to
 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.530
cue we're extending the shortcuts API to
do just that publish a dynamic shortcut

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540
do just that publish a dynamic shortcut
 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.290
do just that publish a dynamic shortcut
and Android will load and rank much

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300
and Android will load and rank much
 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.560
and Android will load and rank much
faster than we could with direct share

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570
faster than we could with direct share
 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.120
faster than we could with direct share
previously we would only consider two

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130
previously we would only consider two
 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.920
previously we would only consider two
chooser targets per chooser target

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930
chooser targets per chooser target
 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.610
chooser targets per chooser target
service and now we'll consider all of

then the system can generate suggestions

00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:15.029
then the system can generate suggestions
 

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:19.340
then the system can generate suggestions
such as yeah sure or no I can't make it

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.350
such as yeah sure or no I can't make it
 

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.439
such as yeah sure or no I can't make it
or give me a deep link to maps to see

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:21.449
or give me a deep link to maps to see

the way this works is the system takes

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:27.749
the way this works is the system takes
 

00:13:27.749 --> 00:13:30.079
the way this works is the system takes
the content of the notification runs it

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:30.089
the content of the notification runs it
 

00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:31.309
the content of the notification runs it
through machine learning models and

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:31.319
through machine learning models and
 

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:33.769
through machine learning models and
tries to understand the the content of

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779
tries to understand the the content of
 

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.449
tries to understand the the content of
that notification and what the user

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459
that notification and what the user
 

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:37.730
that notification and what the user
might like to do do with this and then

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740
might like to do do with this and then
 

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.860
might like to do do with this and then
it will pop those actions inside of your

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:39.870
it will pop those actions inside of your
 

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.210
it will pop those actions inside of your
notification let's have a look at how

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220
notification let's have a look at how
 

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.519
notification let's have a look at how
you could I'm sorry there's one other

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:49.529
you could I'm sorry there's one other
 

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.319
you could I'm sorry there's one other
feature that you can enable with this

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:51.329
feature that you can enable with this
 

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:55.639
feature that you can enable with this
it's called tap tap to edit whenever the

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:55.649
it's called tap tap to edit whenever the
 

00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:57.369
it's called tap tap to edit whenever the
system generates a text reply and

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:57.379
system generates a text reply and
 

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:01.730
system generates a text reply and
usually clicks this clicks to reply what

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740
usually clicks this clicks to reply what
 

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.429
usually clicks this clicks to reply what
you could do is you can enable the fact

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:04.439
you could do is you can enable the fact
 

00:14:04.439 --> 00:14:05.840
you could do is you can enable the fact
that the system were allowed the user to

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:05.850
that the system were allowed the user to
 

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.299
that the system were allowed the user to
set and to edit the notification before

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:08.309
set and to edit the notification before
 

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:11.629
set and to edit the notification before
sending it so for example if I was

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639

do you build a bubble if you've ever

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299
do you build a bubble if you've ever
 

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.060
do you build a bubble if you've ever
sent an Android notification or if

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.070
sent an Android notification or if
 

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.129
sent an Android notification or if
you've ever built an activity you can

00:20:40.129 --> 00:20:40.139
you've ever built an activity you can
 

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.430
you've ever built an activity you can
build a bubble it's very straightforward

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440
build a bubble it's very straightforward
 

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.150
build a bubble it's very straightforward
first you're configuring an activity

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:45.160
first you're configuring an activity
 

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.250
first you're configuring an activity
to display in a bubble then you're

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.260
to display in a bubble then you're
 

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.440
to display in a bubble then you're
building a bubble metadata object

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:49.450
building a bubble metadata object
 

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.630
building a bubble metadata object
attaching that to a notification and

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640
attaching that to a notification and
 

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.800
attaching that to a notification and
sending the notification so let's look

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:55.810
sending the notification so let's look
 

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.150
sending the notification so let's look
at some code here we have our activity

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.160
at some code here we have our activity
 

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160
at some code here we have our activity
definition in the Android manifest and

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:02.170
definition in the Android manifest and
 

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.140
definition in the Android manifest and
there are three things you need to have

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.150
there are three things you need to have
 

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.960
there are three things you need to have
set on your activity for it to bubble it

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:06.970
set on your activity for it to bubble it
 

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.760
set on your activity for it to bubble it
needs to be embeddable it needs to be

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:08.770
needs to be embeddable it needs to be
 

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.620
needs to be embeddable it needs to be
document launch mode always and it needs

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:10.630
document launch mode always and it needs
 

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.890
document launch mode always and it needs
to be resizable if your activity fails

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:13.900
to be resizable if your activity fails
 

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.160
to be resizable if your activity fails
any of these checks your notification

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.170
any of these checks your notification
 

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.290
any of these checks your notification
won't bubble it'll just show as a normal

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:19.300
won't bubble it'll just show as a normal
 

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.970
won't bubble it'll just show as a normal
notification and to construct bubble

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:23.980
notification and to construct bubble
 

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.280
notification and to construct bubble
metadata this is a new api on

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:26.290
metadata this is a new api on
 

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.340
metadata this is a new api on
notifications and you get the pending

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:29.350
notifications and you get the pending
 

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.540
notifications and you get the pending
intent for that bubble activity and then

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:32.550
intent for that bubble activity and then
 

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.070
intent for that bubble activity and then
this is very basic like all you need is

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080
this is very basic like all you need is
 

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.560
this is very basic like all you need is
an icon and an intent the api has a

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:37.570
an icon and an intent the api has a
 

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.120
an icon and an intent the api has a
couple of other flags that you can look

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.130
couple of other flags that you can look
 

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.910
couple of other flags that you can look
at in the developer documentation but at

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:41.920
at in the developer documentation but at
 

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.740
at in the developer documentation but at
minimum you need the icon and the

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:43.750
minimum you need the icon and the
 

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:50.040
minimum you need the icon and the
activity then you attach this metadata

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.050
activity then you attach this metadata
 

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.320
activity then you attach this metadata
object to your notification so you build

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.330
object to your notification so you build
 

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.880
object to your notification so you build
a notification as you normally would

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.890
a notification as you normally would
 

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.100
a notification as you normally would
and then you just do that one call set

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.110
and then you just do that one call set
 

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.710
and then you just do that one call set
bubble metadata on it and then use

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720
bubble metadata on it and then use
 

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720
bubble metadata on it and then use
notification manager to send the

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.730
notification manager to send the
 

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.080
notification manager to send the
notification now I might have mentioned

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.090
notification now I might have mentioned
 

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.140
notification now I might have mentioned
that not everything gets to bubble so

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.150
that not everything gets to bubble so
 

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.310
that not everything gets to bubble so
bubbles are meant for highly interactive

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320
bubbles are meant for highly interactive
 

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.070
bubbles are meant for highly interactive
use cases and they can be convenient but

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080
use cases and they can be convenient but
 

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.690
use cases and they can be convenient but
they might be annoying if the user

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:15.700
they might be annoying if the user
 

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.390
they might be annoying if the user
doesn't find them handy they show up on

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400
doesn't find them handy they show up on
 

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.830
doesn't find them handy they show up on
screen they take up screen real estate

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840
screen they take up screen real estate
 

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.030
screen they take up screen real estate
and they want your attention so right

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.040
and they want your attention so right
 

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.130
and they want your attention so right

now we're focusing on messaging calling
 

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.520
now we're focusing on messaging calling
and user initiated use cases if your

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:29.530
and user initiated use cases if your
 

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.160
and user initiated use cases if your
notification doesn't fulfill these

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.170
notification doesn't fulfill these
 

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.960
notification doesn't fulfill these
requirements it won't display as a

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:33.970
requirements it won't display as a

of this if you are messaging you'll want

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840
of this if you are messaging you'll want
 

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.610
of this if you are messaging you'll want
to use message style and you'll want to

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:45.620
to use message style and you'll want to
 

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.530
to use message style and you'll want to
an inline reply action attached to the

an inline reply action attached to the
 

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.570
an inline reply action attached to the

app is in front of the user you can send
 

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.510
app is in front of the user you can send
any kind of notification as a bubble and

any kind of notification as a bubble and
 

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.120
any kind of notification as a bubble and
that'll appear and once the app goes out

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:10.130
that'll appear and once the app goes out
 

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.010
that'll appear and once the app goes out
of the foreground that bubble will

of the foreground that bubble will
 

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.049
of the foreground that bubble will
remain on screen and you can continue to

00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:14.059
remain on screen and you can continue to
 

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:21.460
remain on screen and you can continue to
send updates to it okay so just to

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.470
send updates to it okay so just to
 

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.130
send updates to it okay so just to
confirm did that thing I send did a

bubble and you can query notification

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:26.660
bubble and you can query notification
 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.940
bubble and you can query notification
manager whenever something is bubbled or

when it's an active notification it'll
 

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.190
when it's an active notification it'll
appear and get active notifications and

appear and get active notifications and
 

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.900
appear and get active notifications and
then you just can check the flags of it

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:37.910
then you just can check the flags of it
 

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.060
then you just can check the flags of it
this code gives a little bit of a sense

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:40.070
this code gives a little bit of a sense
 

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.630
