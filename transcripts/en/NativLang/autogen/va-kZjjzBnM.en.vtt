00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.700
in the last lesson I brought up the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
in the last lesson I brought up the
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160
in the last lesson I brought up the
concept of the verb as a function word

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
concept of the verb as a function word
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.110
concept of the verb as a function word
that has a number of different arguments

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
that has a number of different arguments
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029
that has a number of different arguments
we didn't really go into the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
we didn't really go into the
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429
we didn't really go into the
implications of that statement but we'll

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
implications of that statement but we'll
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.880
implications of that statement but we'll
start to unravel it this time like other

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
start to unravel it this time like other
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.519
start to unravel it this time like other
verbs give has a number of slots that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
verbs give has a number of slots that
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410
verbs give has a number of slots that
take a certain number of nouns or

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
take a certain number of nouns or
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.919
take a certain number of nouns or
pronouns giv has three of those slots to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
pronouns giv has three of those slots to
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.830
pronouns giv has three of those slots to
be specific it expects three arguments

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
be specific it expects three arguments
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900
be specific it expects three arguments
so I give it to him

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
so I give it to him
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.020
so I give it to him
makes sense but I gave it kind of with

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
makes sense but I gave it kind of with
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990
makes sense but I gave it kind of with
holds information we're expecting and I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
holds information we're expecting and I
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750
holds information we're expecting and I
gave leaves us with two slots that are

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
gave leaves us with two slots that are
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.740
gave leaves us with two slots that are
not filled as I described before those

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
not filled as I described before those
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709
not filled as I described before those
slots are filled by arguments which are

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
slots are filled by arguments which are
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.040
slots are filled by arguments which are
nouns and pronouns now let's talk about

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
nouns and pronouns now let's talk about
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.340
nouns and pronouns now let's talk about
the number of those arguments verbs can

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
the number of those arguments verbs can
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740
the number of those arguments verbs can
be described by their valency which is a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
be described by their valency which is a
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900
be described by their valency which is a
fancy way of talking about the number of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
fancy way of talking about the number of
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.810
fancy way of talking about the number of
arguments that a verb requires valency

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
arguments that a verb requires valency
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330
arguments that a verb requires valency
is specific to a single verb a verb like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
is specific to a single verb a verb like
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.480
is specific to a single verb a verb like
run expects one argument the subject so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
run expects one argument the subject so
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030
run expects one argument the subject so
it's called mono valent divalent verbs

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
it's called mono valent divalent verbs
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.810
it's called mono valent divalent verbs
expect to like the verb see I see it she

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
expect to like the verb see I see it she
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.109
expect to like the verb see I see it she
saw them trivalent verbs include give as

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
saw them trivalent verbs include give as
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.140
saw them trivalent verbs include give as
in I gave it to him the labels

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
in I gave it to him the labels
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.929
in I gave it to him the labels
monovalent divalent and trivalent depend

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
monovalent divalent and trivalent depend
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.510
monovalent divalent and trivalent depend
on the core arguments the arguments that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
on the core arguments the arguments that
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490
on the core arguments the arguments that
are required for normal use of the verb

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
are required for normal use of the verb
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.789
are required for normal use of the verb
in question we can of course add extras

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
in question we can of course add extras
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.670
in question we can of course add extras
in the form of adjuncts she saw it on

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
in the form of adjuncts she saw it on
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.190
in the form of adjuncts she saw it on
Thursday she saw it on Thursday with her

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
Thursday she saw it on Thursday with her
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.969
Thursday she saw it on Thursday with her
brother etc we can look at it another

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
brother etc we can look at it another
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.420
brother etc we can look at it another
way by focusing on transitivity

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
way by focusing on transitivity
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.800
way by focusing on transitivity
transitivity considers what type of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
transitivity considers what type of
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.859
transitivity considers what type of
objects the verb takes transitive verbs

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
objects the verb takes transitive verbs
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.100
objects the verb takes transitive verbs
take a direct object I say John sees her

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
take a direct object I say John sees her
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.190
take a direct object I say John sees her
because si takes a direct object in this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
because si takes a direct object in this
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.999
because si takes a direct object in this
case her intransitive verbs do not take

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
case her intransitive verbs do not take
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.609
case her intransitive verbs do not take
a direct object you would say I slept

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
a direct object you would say I slept
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230
a direct object you would say I slept
but probably not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
but probably not
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.510
but probably not
I slept then because sleep is an

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
I slept then because sleep is an
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249
I slept then because sleep is an
intransitive verb

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
intransitive verb
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960
intransitive verb
we can make a further distinction

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
we can make a further distinction
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.059
we can make a further distinction
between intransitive verbs and Dai

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
between intransitive verbs and Dai
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729
between intransitive verbs and Dai
transitive verbs I gave it to him as

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739
transitive verbs I gave it to him as
 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.430
transitive verbs I gave it to him as
both a direct object and an indirect

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
both a direct object and an indirect
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.410
both a direct object and an indirect
object so it's a Dai transitive verb

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420
object so it's a Dai transitive verb
 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.330
object so it's a Dai transitive verb
defective verbs are a curious class and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
defective verbs are a curious class and
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.820
defective verbs are a curious class and
they include verbs with only one fairly

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
they include verbs with only one fairly
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.280
they include verbs with only one fairly
meaningless phenomenal subject that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
meaningless phenomenal subject that
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.070
meaningless phenomenal subject that
subject fills a grammatical function the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
subject fills a grammatical function the
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960
subject fills a grammatical function the
so called whether verbs are great

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
so called whether verbs are great
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.259
so called whether verbs are great
examples it rains it snows it Hales

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269
examples it rains it snows it Hales
 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.839
examples it rains it snows it Hales
those all have a subject it that we

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
those all have a subject it that we
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.369
those all have a subject it that we
don't switch out for another subject

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379
don't switch out for another subject
 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.360
don't switch out for another subject
like Steve snows the pronoun it is a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
like Steve snows the pronoun it is a
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640
like Steve snows the pronoun it is a
dummy pronoun that just stands in the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
dummy pronoun that just stands in the
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.589
dummy pronoun that just stands in the
slot simply because we expect to have a

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
slot simply because we expect to have a
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.050
slot simply because we expect to have a
subject this isn't a full-fledged

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
subject this isn't a full-fledged
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.789
subject this isn't a full-fledged
argument here so when it comes to

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799
argument here so when it comes to
 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.650
argument here so when it comes to
valency we call these a valent verbs

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
valency we call these a valent verbs
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.940
valency we call these a valent verbs
that's a good way to start thinking

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
that's a good way to start thinking
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.069
that's a good way to start thinking
about the number of arguments that a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079
about the number of arguments that a
 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.830
about the number of arguments that a
verb has come around next time we're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840
verb has come around next time we're
 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.599
verb has come around next time we're
going to start discussing the type of

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609
going to start discussing the type of
 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.420
going to start discussing the type of
arguments

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.489
you
