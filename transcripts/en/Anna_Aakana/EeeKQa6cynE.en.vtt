00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 So, Sarah. You've been with us for five years. 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.080
 Correctly. 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.380
 I see amazing effort and diligence ... mhm. 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.120
 I'll read it later. 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.560
 So, I invited you to my office to talk a little bit about 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.820
 your future! Great, I think I know where you're going .... 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 Especially as for Steava. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.220
 Uh, Steve, uh, the internist? 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.500
 Yeah, Steve, damn best internist of all time. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.560
 [giggles] 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 Actually, it reminds me when I was a kid. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 Anyway, we just hired him as a junior manager 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.900
 and I'd like you to show him how. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.080
 Uh. Is there any reason why I wasn't considered for ... 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 ... open position? 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.620
 No! Sarah, you're great where you are 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.700
 and if you were serious about wanting to be promoted in the next few years, 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.900
 which I - for the record - didn't know you wanted 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.660
 I think you should try a little more. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 Good. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660
 (everybody is laughing) 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.380
 ... and I said "no way, buddy" 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.760
 (laughter) 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 Sports! Am I right? Am I right? 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.260
 Oh! Something glittering! 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 (Storm) 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.020
 What? 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.240
 (Laughter) 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.940
 You all had piss ** y. 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 Just two seconds ago. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.260
 Hey, I really like your shoes. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 Oh, thank God, I bought them at a discount! 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480
 You see, I saw them online at Nordstorm's site and they were at full price and-- 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.980
 (impact) 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 So 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.140
 it looks like you had a very clear hallucination 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.800
 that you lived in a world that was predominantly male-driven. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 (Shaking) 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.260
 You have to shake it off. 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.300
 This is great !! 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.960
 (the phone is ringing) 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 Good job Steve. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.060
 Oh, ou! 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 Is this something we do now? 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.180
 Just if she's as sexy as Steve. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.360
 I want to have sex with you, Steve! 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.320
 (Doors closing) 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.060
 That was ... a simple assumption of what everyone was saying. 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.660
 Don't be weird. 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.180
 So, get ready to meet the new sexy face of our advertising campaign. 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.900
 Wooo " 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.560
 Yeah! 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.180
 You look good! 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.820
 I could scrub the underwear on my stomach muscles, Bill. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.320
 I feel somehow violated. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.380
 Bill, learn to accept compliments! Damn it. 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.500
 (whispers) Sorry! 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.180
 So, Sarah, you've been with us for five years. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.580
 Yes, that is correct. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.940
 And I'm sure I loved each of those last five years 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.460
 working for you, Mrs. Chief. 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.280
 Boss Lady. 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.960
 Yeah, listen, uhm 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.960
 Sarah, you're doing a great job and I'd love to promote you. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 Yes! Thanks! I will not let you down! 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 But you're not ready yet! 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.300
 That ... what? 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.200
 You remind me a lot of myself when I first started. 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.280
 And I wouldn't have come here without that extra effort, 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.760
 every step of the way, trying harder, working smarter than everyone around me. 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.400
 (running water) 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.300
 Hey, are you okay? 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.180
 You've been acting a little weird all day. 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.240
 No, no, I'm fine. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.300
 Is it the weird lightning that turned all men into women? 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.160
 You know about it? 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.520
 Duh-doy! 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.420
 You know, I was thinking ... 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
 I wondered ... if every woman didn't have to fight 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.320
 against the others in the order of that little spot 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.740
 on the male desk, 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.560
 that things would be so much better. 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.240
 But it's like we're literally swapping places and now 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.640
 we are the morons. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.740
 No no no! 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.040
 The mascara waves on my lashes will not actually make them denser at all. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.220
 I had to invest months of oil care and eyelid massage, 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 to be denser from roots to ends. 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.360
 Why don't you just fake false eyelashes-- 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.300
 I'm just saying that waving a magic wand to change from a guy to a woman is just a cosmetic difference 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400
 Real changes happen when we start 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.760
 discuss how the problems of gender imbalance affect us all. 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.900
 That was deep. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.120
 (bag zipper sound) 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.840
 Here. 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.800
 You might need that later. 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.860
 I'm not bleeding ... but thanks. 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.120
 (closing the door)
