00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.210
So here we have it. Transcription. A promoter

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
region, a sequence of DNA, tells proteins exactly where

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.440
transcription should start in a particular region. And we

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.680
call this region the transcription start site. And at

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.230
this point, individual RNA nucleotides are going to be

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.470
brought in and matched with the DNA. One by

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490
one. And this will continue, until we reach the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.450
end of the gene. So on a molecular level,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.720
you really get a feel for the chemistry that's going

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.500
on here. And so for us to really see what's going

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.740
on at this point, we need to zoom out a little

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.770
bit more. So if we take a look at the DNA

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.810
gene as a whole, from start to stop. This is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.660
where transcription started, and this is where transcription ends. This was

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
the full length of the DNA gene that we wanted to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.710
transcribe and eventually turn into protein. The RNA copy is actually

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.750
called an mRNA copy. mRNA means Messenger RNA. It

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.140
turns out that RNA serves many purposes in a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.070
cell. And so there are lots of prefixes for

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.310
RNA that distinguishes what it can do. And the most

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.140
important one for us is this messenger status. Because

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.450
the messenger means that it was a copy made

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.140
from a DNA gene, and that's eventually going to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.870
be turned into protein. We call this our mRNA or

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.420
our messenger RNA copy. Now you might notice

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.290
a couple of differences, from our DNA gene. And

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.660
our mRNA copy. I've drawn these images to be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
representative of some distinguishing characteristics of the process. So

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.030
I want you to tell me, how does this mRNA copy differ compared to the DNA gene

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.020
that it came from? I'm not going to give you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.450
any answers to choose from, just a text box.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.770
I'd like for you to organize your thoughts and try to answer

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.330
this question. Don't worry about getting this right or wrong. Just look at

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.540
the difference between the gene and the mRNA and whatever difference you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050
notice, I want you to write it down in the text box here.
