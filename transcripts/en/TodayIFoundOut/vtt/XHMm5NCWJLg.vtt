00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:17.030
Today, Casual Friday is a day when the conventional
dress codes of most offices are cast aside

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.369
in favour of denim jeans, comfortable t-shirts
with movie slogans on them and shirts with

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.690
the sleeves rolled up.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.759
But few people realise that this time-honored
tradition of “sticking it to the man”

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.079
forcing you to wear a noose around your neck
four days a week (see: Origin of the Neck

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.700
Tie) has its origins in a Hawaiian garment
company who were simply trying to find a way

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.020
to sell more of their shirts.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.650
In 1962, the Hawaiian Fashion Guild began
pushing to make the iconic Aloha shirt (better

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.610
known in the mainland States and abroad as
a Hawaiian shirt) an acceptable piece of business

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.620
attire.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.850
The Hawaiian Fashion Guild’s main argument
was that the hot, temperate climate of Hawaii

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.120
made conventional business attire uncomfortable
for most workers, also adding that encouraging

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.790
the wearing of Aloha shirts would bolster
the Hawaiian garment industry.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.300
The Hawaiian Fashion Guild were inspired,
in part, by a similar campaign in Honolulu

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.720
in 1946 which eventually resulted in the creation
of Aloha Week- a week long celebration of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.500
Hawaiian culture that included the wearing
of Aloha shirts.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.210
This celebration not only helped forge a sense
of national identity for post-war Hawaiians,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.080
but also helped kick start the burgeoning
Hawaiian garment industry who were quickly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.770
inundated with many thousands of orders for
these Aloha shirts.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.530
(In the 1990s, due to intense interest in
the event, it was expanded to encompass a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.520
whole month of celebrations and was re-branded
simply as the Aloha Festival.)

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.750
Back tot he 1960s, as part of what they dubbed
“Operation Liberation”, the Hawaiian Fashion

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.420
Guild sent Aloha shirts to every member of
the Hawaiian Senate and House of Representatives,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.600
and lobbied for them to encourage Hawaiians
to wear the shirts.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.330
After months of this, the Hawaiian government
issued an edict recommending that “the male

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.420
populace return to ‘aloha attire’ during
the summer months for the sake of comfort

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.149
and in support of the 50th state’s garment
industry.”

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.069
But this wasn’t enough for the Hawaiian
Fashion Guild, led by Bill Foster, who began

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.810
a new campaign targeting the workplace.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.799
In 1965, they once again began lobbying the
government to allow its employees to wear

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.829
Aloha shirts every week on Fridays.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.159
Within a year, people working at businesses
across the state were donning their favourite

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.780
Aloha shirts before heading to work every
Friday- “Aloha Friday” was born.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.450
After the introduction of Aloha Friday in
1966, the manufacturers of Aloha shirts quickly

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.790
began producing designs with more muted colors
that were less distracting and more suitable

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.930
for a day at the office.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.299
This, in turn, saw Aloha shirts become more
and more accepted as a regular every day shirt,

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.760
boosting sales even further.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.529
It’s noted that by the early 1970s, most
businesses in the region allowed their workers

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:04.549
to wear Aloha shirts whenever they felt like
it, not just on Fridays.

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.139
As a result, Aloha Friday became the day on
which some workers would choose to wear more

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:14.280
flamboyant shirts sporting brighter, more
elaborate designs than typically worn the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.430
rest of the week.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.040
Although Aloha shirts were already a thing
in mainland America at this point, and had

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.700
been since the 1940s when American GI’s
serving in the Pacific theatre brought them

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.330
back after WW2, the idea of Aloha Friday didn’t
make its way to the mainland until around

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.739
the early 1990s, when cash-strapped businesses
affected by a brief recession began looking

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.549
for a way to raise employee morale without
spending any money.

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.579
The result- “Casual Friday”.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.260
Within a few years, this had spread across
the entire country.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.999
This all brings us to yet another innovative
shift in acceptable business attire thanks

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:55.749
to a marketing campaign by a major clothing
manufacturer- this time Levi’s.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:01.400
In 1992, Levi’s began a guerrilla marketing
campaign to try to define the idea of “Business

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.219
Casual” as they saw fit.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.379
The impetus for this campaign was that, as
companies began introducing “Casual Friday”

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.329
and otherwise relaxing their dress codes,
a problem arose.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.370
PR guru Rick Miller, who worked on the Levi’s
campaign, outlined the issue- “We found

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.220
when guys shed their coats and ties they really
didn’t know what to wear…

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.669
People were showing up in Hawaiian print shirts
or sandals and shorts.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.050
Frankly, there were concerns on the part of
management that work might become too much

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.050
fun.”

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.800
As such, Levi’s created a brochure called
“A Guide to Casual Businesswear” and sent

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.980
it to approximately 25,000 businesses across
the United States.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.330
The brochure was not only helpful to companies
trying to figure out how to define acceptable

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.650
casual wear at the work place, but also a
thinly veiled advertisement for Levi’s Dockers-

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.250
khaki pants formerly generally only seen on
the golf course.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.250
It worked.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.229
Many businesses used elements from this guide
for their own guidelines for business casual

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.879
wear for their employees.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.990
Within a year, men across the country began
turning up for work en masse wearing Dockers.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.900
As happened with Aloha Friday in Hawaii, the
idea of Casual Friday disseminated throughout

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.669
the world of business and the idea of “business
casual” being suitable for every day of

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.740
the week eventually became the accepted norm
at many companies.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.689
So, in some sense, you could say the reason
many of us reading this can go to work wearing

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.910
something other than a suit is, in large part,
because in the 1960s a company in Hawaii really

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:46.380
wanted to boost sales of Aloha shirts.
