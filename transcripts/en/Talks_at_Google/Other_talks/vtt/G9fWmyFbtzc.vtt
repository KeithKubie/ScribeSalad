00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:07.460
GEORGE MACKERRON: Well,
Alex has stolen the content

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.330
on my first couple of slides.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.620
So I guess I'm
George, and I'm going

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.578
to talk to you about the
economics of happiness

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.460
and some of the findings
of my own research.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.992
As Alex says, I've got several
hats, academic economist,

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.200
creator of a study called
Mappiness, which is largely

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.761
what I'll talk to
you about today,

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.760
which I think is the
biggest momentary happiness

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.730
study that's been done,
and also, as Alex says,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.790
co-founder of a startup.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.840
So I research election
environment economics

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.360
and behavioral economics
and happiness economics.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.520
I also teach PhD students
regular expressions,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.978
but no one knows that they need
to know regular expressions

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:38.240
until they come to my session.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.290
They don't come to my
session because they

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.820
don't know they need to
know regular expressions,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.319
despite the fact
that I advertise it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.044
with an XKCD cartoon.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.710
Anyway, I know something
about measuring

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.166
and possibly something
about improving happiness.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.790
And as Alex says, I
do a certain amount

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.669
of teaching in the
course of all of this.

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:56.210
So today I want to give you a
very brief history of happiness

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.850
economics, persuade you that
happiness is worth measuring,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.300
and that happiness measurements
are valid and useful.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.910
And the poster for
this talk promises

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.910
to answer this question.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.390
How happy would it make
you be to be drinking

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.910
by an estuary in the
vicinity of riots the day

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.820
after your football team lost
unexpectedly at a full moon

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.460
when Donald Trump had
just won an election?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.389
So I'll do my best to answer
that question as we go along.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.680
And I can tell you right away
that two of those factors

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.820
aren't important.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.870
But I'll leave you guessing for
now as to which two those are.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.880
So a very brief history
of happiness economics.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.040
And I'm going to explain
this via a timeline

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.666
of old white men, which
given the context is perhaps

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.790
not my brightest idea ever.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.020
But anyway, we start
with the 18th century.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.540
And we have Jeremy Bentham.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.670
And reading straight
from Wikipedia,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.230
"Bentham is regarded
as the founder

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.910
of modern utilitarianism.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.460
And he defined as the
'fundamental axiom' of his

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.027
philosophy the principle that
'it is the greatest happiness

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:54.110
of the greatest number
that's the measure of right

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.140
and wrong.'" And so this sort
of hedonic or philosophic

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.860
calculus, which Bentham
called it, happiness maths,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.130
is basically a kind of cost
benefit analysis using pleasure

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.310
and pain.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.723
So when you're trying to figure
out what action is right,

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:10.139
you should consider the pleasure
and the pains that result

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.520
from it, and how intense
they are, how long they last,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.200
how certain you are
of them, how near

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.770
they are at hand,
how likely they

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.680
are to lead to future
pleasures and pains,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.417
and how many people they
benefit or they hurt.

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:23.500
And then you should consider
all the alternatives.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.380
And that might be the best
way to choose what to do.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.632
Now, around 100 years after
Bentham, we have Edgeworth.

00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:32.840
He was the founding editor
of "The Economic Journal,"

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.256
and laid lots of the foundations
of sort of modern utility

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:35.760
theory.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.801
And Edgeworth went as far
as to imagine something

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.770
that he called a hedonometer,
an idealized happiness measuring

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.300
machine.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.920
And he waxed really
lyrical about this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.770
and says "let there be granted
to the science of pleasure what

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.700
is granted to the
science of energy.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.400
Imagine an ideally
perfect instrument,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.250
a psychophysical machine,
continually registering

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.400
the heights of pleasure
experienced by an individual,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.650
exactly according to the
verdict of consciousness

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.800
or rather diverging there from,
according to a law of errors.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.440
From moment to moment,
the hedonometer varies,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.850
the delicate index
now flickering

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.770
with the flutter of the
passions, now steadied

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.140
by intellectual
activity, low sunk

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.860
whole hours in the
neighborhood of zero,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.300
will momentarily spring
up towards infinity."

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.190
But unfortunately,
Edgeworth's peers

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.040
were mostly not on
board with this idea.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.560
Economists then, in
the early 20th century,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.320
increasingly wanted to be
thought of as scientists.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.000
They had a kind of physics envy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.541
And they certainly
did not want to be

00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:35.060
thought of as psychologists
such as Freud, who we see here.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.670
And therefore, if we look at
Pareto, Pareto, for example,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.430
was very proud of
his Theory of Choice

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.890
in which he said that every
psychological analysis is

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.880
eliminated.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.190
And he boasts that he's not
interested in the reason

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.380
why man is indifferent
between one bundle of goods

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.620
and another bundle of goods.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.160
"I notice the pure
and naked fact."

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.610
And so words like willpower
and imagination and feelings

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.834
began to vanish from economics.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.500
Instead, economists came up with
very elegant and certainly very

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.560
useful theories of well-being
as preference satisfaction,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.870
where you're happy to the
extent that you can satisfy

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.660
your consumer preferences, and
you can approximate the extent

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.940
that you can satisfy you
consumer preferences by how

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.110
much income you have.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.580
And therefore the
recommendations

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.717
of economists tended towards--

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.300
both for individuals
and for nations--

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.600
well, do your best
to get richer.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.490
Now, 20th century
economists were not stupid.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.540
And of course,
they're not oblivious

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.730
to the potential unintended
consequences of that.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.215
But they have this
special powerful Latin

00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:29.840
to protect their
assumptions from that.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.610
So we just say
"ceteris paribus,"

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.990
and that means all other
things being equal--

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.160
and definitely it's true--

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.010
but all other things being
equal, aiming to get richer

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.850
is a pretty solid idea.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.320
But around the 1970s,
some economists

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.840
started asking awkward
questions on this topic.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.020
And in particular, here
is Richard Easterlin

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.420
of the University
of Pennsylvania

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.340
and now the University
of Southern California,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.423
who's commonly regarded
as sort of the grandfather

00:04:52.423 --> 00:04:54.410
of modern happiness economics.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.740
And Easterlin published a
paper in 1974 with the title

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.430
"Does Economic Growth
Improve the Human Lot?"

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.650
which was probably the
economists' equivalent of

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.380
is the pope Catholic
and do bears

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.350
go to the toilet in the woods?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.220
But Easterlin was
sort of looking

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.380
to confront this
economic growth data

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.820
with some kind of external
measure of happiness.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.040
And in order to do that, he used
self-reported well-being survey

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.930
data.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.150
And following Easterlin,
lots of other economists

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.740
have taken up this
line of thinking.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.090
And one of the key figures,
certainly, in this country

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.882
is Professor Richard Layard,
who is a labor economist at LSC

00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:30.340
and a member of
the House of Lords.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.530
Layard wrote an
influential book in 2005

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.270
based on some
earlier lectures, and

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.172
along with the former cabinet
secretary here, Gus O'Donnell,

00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:39.130
has been kind of instrumental
in getting the UK

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.171
government to take well-being
measures seriously,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:46.060
both within the civil service
and in the country at large.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.880
I said Easterlin used
self-reported well-being survey

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.540
data.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.590
What is that data?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.341
Well, it's answers to
questions like this.

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:54.090
And actually, these
are the four questions

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.870
that the Office for
National Statistics

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.900
now asks regularly
across the country

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.520
of a representative sample.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.135
How satisfied are you
with your life nowadays?

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:04.510
And this relates
to what we often

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.580
call the evaluative
account of well-being,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.310
thinking about your
life as a whole.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.860
It asks what extent do
you feel the things you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.830
do in your life are worthwhile?

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.960
And that gets at what we often
call the eudemonic account

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.330
of well-being, sense of
meaning, sense of purpose,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.330
sense that what you do in
your life is worthwhile.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.890
And then the last
two questions, how

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.570
happy did you feel
yesterday and how

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.260
anxious did you
feel yesterday, get

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.290
at what we call the
hedonic account, which

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.100
goes back to Aristotle, as in
fact the eudemonic account does

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.676
too.

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.550
That's sometimes sort
of rather deprecatingly

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.200
referred to as
smiley face feeling.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.440
It's kind of mood,
emotion, in the moment,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.900
the most immediate kind
of measure of happiness.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.130
Now, all three of these
accounts of well-being

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.150
are very highly correlated.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.566
You know, you'd
expect that people

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:50.330
who have enjoyable moments feel
satisfied with their lives,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.680
for example, although there are
some interesting divergences.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.320
Having kids might cause you to
have an interesting divergence

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.028
in some of these.

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:59.922
You might get very high highs
but also some fairly low lows.

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:01.880
You might feel that your
life has more purpose.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.730
It might affect
things differently.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.480
By and large they move
together, but there

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.954
are some things that can move
them somewhat separately.

00:07:07.954 --> 00:07:09.370
Economists have
mostly just looked

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.630
at the evaluative
account, because it's

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.796
really easy to get ahold of.

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.769
It's one question, and
you can ask it today,

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:15.560
and you can ask it next
week and next month

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.470
and you'll get a similar answer.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.470
So you can sort of
shove it into any survey

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.292
that you're asking people.

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.000
And it's also the one
that's most closely

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.880
related to people's income,
which makes economists

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.290
feel comfortable with it.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.030
My own project,
Mappiness, is actually

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.851
primarily a hedonic
measure of happiness.

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:31.600
And not just how happy
you felt yesterday,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.860
but how happy do
you feel right now.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.820
And I will talk a whole
lot more about that soon.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.520
A key question that comes up
in economics and elsewhere

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.270
is very simple.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.080
Is this valid?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.400
Is this meaningful?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.710
Can people really reduce
the quality of their life

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.061
to 0 to 10 scale?

00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.560
And certainly within
economics there

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.807
remains an amount of
controversy about this.

00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:51.640
There are certainly
economists who are quite

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.280
wedded to the preference
satisfaction view,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.230
and to their indifference
curves, and to not

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.290
getting involved in the messy
business of how people feel.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.830
And in reducing the quality
of your life experience to a 0

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.734
to 10 scale, we can certainly
be accused of reductionism.

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:07.400
It is a kind of
reductionist enterprise.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.460
And I'm not for a minute
saying that's the only way

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.418
that we should seek to
understand people's life

00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:12.089
experiences.

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:14.380
But my view is certainly that
the subjective well-being

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.600
ratings are valid enough
and meaningful enough

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.550
to tell us interesting
and valuable things.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.610
And for one thing, there's
a lot of convergeability.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.820
Lots of other things point
very much in the same way.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.270
For example, subjective
well-being responses

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.870
are very strongly correlated
with objective indicators,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.850
including neural
activity from fMRI scans.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.440
Biochemical markers,
such as levels

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.429
of cortisol in the blood,
heart rate, blood pressure,

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:43.690
smiling, other people's ratings
of a person's well-being.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.480
They're a strong predictor
of people's future behavior.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.950
And subjective
well-being ratings

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.244
are also very highly
correlated with income.

00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:53.410
Certainly they're very
highly correlated with income

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.439
if you look at a single
country at one time.

00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:58.480
The income relationship
is sort of less clear cut

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.120
if you look between countries.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.710
And we could talk
about this all day.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.900
These charts are
sort of interesting.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.960
So these are actually
the same charts.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.500
One of them is on a log scale.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.360
One of them is on
a linear scale.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.300
And the choice of which
one of these you plot

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.210
is actually potentially
quite political.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.680
If you plot this
one, you kind of

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.971
make very clear that Robin
Hood was doing a good thing,

00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:19.084
because up here,
very little happiness

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:20.500
distinction between
people earning

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.860
$100,000 versus $150,000.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.910
Down here a very large happiness
distinction between people

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.765
with a much smaller
differential.

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:29.140
So if you ever look at the
Institute for Economic Affairs

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.240
report, for example, they'll
always plot this one.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.511
But there is a strong
relationship within a country.

00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.260
Now, you do need to
be careful when you're

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.555
comparing between individuals.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:37.930
And certainly you
need to careful

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.610
when you're comparing
values between countries.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.360
But you can get a lot
of mileage even out

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.440
of just the changes within each
individual's own responses.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.930
And that's actually primarily
what my research relies on.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.610
So I would certainly
argue that this

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.992
is a valid and a useful
way to look at the world.

00:09:55.992 --> 00:09:57.700
Some of you may be
saying, back up a bit,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.830
didn't I see an fMRI
scan a few slides ago?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.160
Wouldn't that be the gold
standard scientific way

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.090
to measure happiness?

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.610
You know, it's got big
machines, costs lots of money,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.110
spits out hard numbers.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.420
Give me a break from this
hand-wavy social sciencey

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.430
question asking stuff.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.210
But actually, no.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.890
Because happiness
is fundamentally

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.660
a completely subjective thing.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.710
It's part of an
individual's experience.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.122
The only reason that we know
what the fMRI scans mean

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:23.080
and we can interpret them
in terms of happiness

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.680
is because at some
point in the past,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.680
we put people in fMRI
machines and we asked them

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.930
how happy they were while we
were scanning their brains.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.280
So you can make
quite a strong case

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.113
that actually, the gold
standard for knowing

00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:35.605
how happy people are
is just to ask them.

00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:38.110
You might also remember
that I promised

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.090
that subjective well-being
data could tell us

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.423
valuable and interesting things.

00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:42.946
So what kinds of
things would be?

00:10:42.946 --> 00:10:44.320
Well, there's at
least three ways

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.860
that economists might want to
use subjective well-being data.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.750
One of them is very
simply to test and refine

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.050
other economic theory.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.610
There's this kind of
tautological sense in economics

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.380
that what do people
want is what they do.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.920
And what they do, well,
it's what they want.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.170
And you can't really get
out of that very easily

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.970
in this kind of revealed
preference, almost

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.370
kind of behaviorist,
way of figuring out what

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.596
people want in their lives.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.220
But if you can measure
their happiness,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.160
you can tell if people do
seem to make the choices that

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.210
make them happier, or
whether they systematically

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.990
mispredict what's going
to make them happiest.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.900
And there's lots
of good evidence

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.820
that they do
systematically mispredict,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.320
and they don't make
the choices that

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.650
would have appeared to make
them happy in retrospect.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.194
You can discriminate
between models

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:24.860
that have different
underlying utilities

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.790
but look the same in terms
of people's behavior.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.890
Becker has an idea of
rational addiction, where

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.960
given a certain
set of preferences,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.210
people can rationally
become addicted to drugs.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.320
It's very difficult
to distinguish

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.445
that when you look at
people's behavior from people

00:11:37.445 --> 00:11:39.040
just lacking
self-control and not

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.930
being in control of
the choices they make.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.640
But if you can
observe how they feel,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.720
then you might be
able to discriminate

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.360
which of those is in fact the
explanation for the behavior

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.950
that you see.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.510
And speaking today,
having just been

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.940
to your canteen, situations
where people are happier

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.740
having less choice,
which is sort

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.680
of paradoxical and impossible
in standard economic theory,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.100
because more choice
always kind of less choice

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.200
is nested within it.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.400
And more choice must be better.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.500
But it's certainly the
case that sometimes there

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.060
are situations
where we are happier

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.684
having less choice, just one or
two things to choose for lunch.

00:12:09.684 --> 00:12:13.074
Or I was in a situation where
I got taken somewhere flying

00:12:13.074 --> 00:12:14.240
business class at one point.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.477
And it was amazing.

00:12:15.477 --> 00:12:17.810
And then the next time they
offered to pay me the money,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.210
and then I had to make
a choice whether to fly

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.390
business class or not.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.510
And that cost me an awful lot
of anguish, because the price is

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.020
ridiculous.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.236
And on the other hand,
I kind of enjoyed it.

00:12:26.236 --> 00:12:27.610
So there are
certainly situations

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.260
where we're happy having no
choice, which don't make sense

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.093
in normal economics.

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:33.647
But subjective well-being data
might help you understand them.

00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:35.980
And there are probably more
things than this you can do.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.860
But the third of the things
I was going to talk about

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.580
are that we can
value things and we

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.110
can sense the
importance of things

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.360
that aren't traded in markets.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.234
And this might be things
that you really just

00:12:44.234 --> 00:12:46.570
couldn't trade in markets
at all, like marriage.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.980
And there is a paper
that finds that marriage

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.063
is extraordinarily valuable
if you try and turn it

00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:52.030
into an income equivalent
in terms of people's

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.490
subjective well-being.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.300
And also, for example,
the environment,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.051
which in certain areas can
be kind of traded in markets.

00:12:58.051 --> 00:12:59.800
And you can at least
ask people to imagine

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.992
that it's traded in markets.

00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:02.950
But nevertheless, that
isn't always very strong

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.290
information on how people
do value the environment

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.420
and how it makes them feel.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.160
And that brings
me to my research.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.680
And this is the
logo for Mappiness,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.230
which was an iPhone app that
launched in 2010 as part

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.852
of my PhD at LSC.

00:13:15.852 --> 00:13:17.560
And this is, in a
sense, quite a good day

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.434
to take stock of this
project, since actually

00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:21.390
the release of iOS
11 yesterday marks

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.890
the moment when Mappiness just
stops working more or less

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.210
everywhere.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.130
The code was written for iOS 3.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.500
This was pre automatic
reference counting, and pre

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.530
almost everything else.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.330
So the background.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.692
What Mappiness is for is
looking at the impact--

00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:37.150
was originally,
certainly-- looking

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.970
at the impact of natural
environments on people's

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.930
happiness.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.800
Here's green space.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.190
Same slide, I think, that
was behind all the logos

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.040
at the beginning.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.100
And we can all agree that green
space, hopefully, is nice.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.062
It makes us feel good.

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:50.770
And I once went to a
geography conference

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.410
where no one said anything
else for three days.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.180
That's fine as far as it goes.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.820
But it doesn't go all that
far, because what is actually

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.294
kind of useful to know
is just how lovely

00:14:00.294 --> 00:14:01.210
is green space, right?

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.680
Policy makers want
to spend money

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.250
on all kinds of
different things.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.680
They can't spend all their
money on green space.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.440
And so it's helpful to them to
have some quantitative sense

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.140
of the loveliness
of green space,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.610
also blue space, other kinds
of natural environment.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.840
So how much happier are people
in natural environments?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.580
Economists looking at
this have generally

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.050
done big observational studies.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.800
And they've looked at
countrywide averages

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.050
of happiness and environment.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.008
Or they've looked at
people's general happiness

00:14:25.008 --> 00:14:27.310
on the individual level in
relation to where they live

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.110
and their immediate
surroundings.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.026
There are some problems
with those approaches.

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:33.150
So what I kind of set out
in the PhD thinking was,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.650
wouldn't it be nice
if we could look

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.600
at the experiences
of individuals

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.850
at particular moments in time?

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.683
So not just how happy
do you feel in general

00:14:39.683 --> 00:14:42.170
and where do you live, but how
happy do you feel right now,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.540
and where are you right now?

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.490
And that will give you
some really direct data

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.260
on the link between
happiness and environment.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.676
And it would need to be that
hedonic account of happiness,

00:14:49.676 --> 00:14:51.430
that smiley face
feeling, because that's

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.260
the thing that varies sort
of minute by minute and hour

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.680
by hour.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.970
If you were to ask
people how satisfied

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.500
they were with their
life as a whole

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.990
in different environments,
you wouldn't probably

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.614
get very much if you tried
to do that every day.

00:15:01.614 --> 00:15:03.530
Now, looking at people's
momentary experiences

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.150
has been done for many
years in psychology

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.140
and also in medicine.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.556
In psychology, these are called
Experience Sampling Method

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:10.140
studies.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.598
In medicine, they're called
Ecological Momentary Assessment

00:15:12.598 --> 00:15:13.110
studies.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.984
And Alex tells me,
actually, that some of you

00:15:14.984 --> 00:15:19.550
are running something very much
like a Ecological Momentary

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.370
Assessment study at the
moment, using watches.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.419
But in the classic ESM
survey, certainly when

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:27.210
these things were come
up with decades ago,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.980
you would give out
notebooks or PDAs.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.480
You beeped people
at random moments,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.550
and you asked people
about their experience

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.400
and the context of
their experience.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.122
And the benefit of this,
you get no recall bias.

00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:39.330
You get an accurate and
detailed record of experience

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.129
that isn't affected
by the things

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:42.795
that, for example,
Kahneman talks about,

00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:45.454
about the peak/end rule and
all of the kinds of biases.

00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:47.370
There's an interesting
philosophical question,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.420
actually, about
whether you are more

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.680
interested in what
you experience

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.580
or what you remember.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.750
But certainly you
can make an argument

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.160
that it's nice to have no
recall bias in this data.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.230
And we get panel data.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.554
We get longitudinal data.

00:15:56.554 --> 00:15:58.470
And that means we can
do fixed effects models,

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.110
where we only use the
variation within an individual.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.454
And that's a big benefit.

00:16:04.454 --> 00:16:06.120
If you want to think
about that benefit,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.000
here's a green space in London,
Buckingham Palace Gardens.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.650
And if we went and found
that responses from people

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.390
in Buckingham Palace Gardens
were generally happier

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.280
than the average, you
might want to argue

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.320
that the kind of people you find
in Buckingham Palace Gardens

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.640
are not quite the
same as the average,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640
and more likely to have
just been bought a yacht

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.874
by the taxpayer, for example.

00:16:20.874 --> 00:16:22.290
There are all kinds
of reasons why

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.795
those people might be happier.

00:16:24.795 --> 00:16:26.170
But with the fixed
effects model,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.336
when we're looking only
within individual variation,

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:31.410
we can tell that the same people
in Buckingham Palace Gardens

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.271
are happier than
when those people are

00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:34.770
on the other side
of the wall facing

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.669
lots of buses driving past them
on their bicycle, for example.

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:39.210
And so this is a
kind of powerful way

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.626
of looking at this,
because we get

00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:42.400
to use that within
individual variation

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.570
and take out effects that say
that certain people are found

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.900
in nice environments and
those are different people

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.120
than go elsewhere.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.730
And then around this time with
the PhD, the iPhone launched.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.950
And then apps became
available for the iPhone.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.408
And this seemed a
great tool to us.

00:16:57.408 --> 00:16:59.185
So ESM studies
began in the '70s,

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.810
and they were kind
of difficult to run,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.300
because you had to
give out these diaries.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.680
You had to give
out these pagers.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.089
And they found that
in some studies,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.089
almost half the people
filled in all the diaries

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.990
at the beginning to get it out
of the way with, or at the end,

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.170
because they realized
they haven't done it yet.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.420
And it's a real
logistical challenge,

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.200
whereas with the iPhone and
now with other similar devices

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.720
which I'm told exist,
you've got GPS.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.460
You've got a microphone
for sound levels.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.744
You can send the data back
using a mobile data connection.

00:17:26.744 --> 00:17:28.910
You can interrupt people
with a noise at any moment.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.350
You can even have them take
a picture of the environment.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.250
And of course almost everyone
now has one of these things.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.490
And there was a problem, which
is that certain kinds of people

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.090
have iPhones.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.150
And I suppose certain kinds of
people have Android phones too.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.700
Certainly in 2010, iPhone
owners are on average

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.897
sort of young and
rich and educated.

00:17:46.897 --> 00:17:48.730
And they have to
self-select into the study.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.430
And then they have to be
able and willing to respond

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.929
to a beep.

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:53.520
So certainly, we don't
have anything approaching

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.970
a representative sample.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.450
And you can grill me on
that later if you want to.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.484
But if I do want to take
part, then 2010, 2011, 2012,

00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:02.400
which is when most of
our respondents are for,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.390
it's a free download
in the app store.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.690
I spend two or three
minutes signing up.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.760
And then I get dinged.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.810
And then I spend sort of
30 seconds or so responding

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.836
to a series of questions.

00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:16.710
I say how happy I am.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.335
And that's mostly
the data that we use.

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:21.120
That's mostly the dependent
variable in the regressions

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.770
that I'll tell you
about in a minute.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.480
And then I report a
few control variables

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.830
which sometimes
turn out to be quite

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.760
interesting in their own right.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.384
But I say who I'm
with, what I'm doing.

00:18:28.384 --> 00:18:32.130
I think at this point that I'm
imagining that I'm in a pub.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.170
And this will relate to one of
the things I talk about later.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.330
And then all the
data gets sent back.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.270
I can look at my
data in the app,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.844
get some very
simple information.

00:18:40.844 --> 00:18:42.260
I think actually
just being caused

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.250
to reflect on your
happiness twice a day

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.650
is more powerful, probably,
than a few simple charts.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.200
There's also a sort
of adjacent API

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.960
where I can build
things off this.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.820
And there's even a kind
of an online section

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.600
where I can look at my
data on the Google map.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.350
I can view charts.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.750
I can look at all my
pictures, and so on.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.619
And there's me working on
Mappiness website, I think.

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:05.410
The project got really
good media coverage.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.870
I was sort of thinking,
this is a PhD.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.786
I might get 100 people
doing it for two weeks.

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:10.410
That would be fine
for a PhD thesis.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.650
But actually, we
launched in August,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.066
which was a great idea, because
nothing happens in August.

00:19:14.066 --> 00:19:16.940
And so we got really nice
coverage, interview on CNN,

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.930
front page of "Le Figaro,"
not quite so useful

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.130
because we're not
targeting France.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.010
But anyway, Tuesday
is worse than Monday,

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.090
and that's a really big story.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.060
Featured in the app
store, so that now we

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.770
have more than 4
million responses

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.809
from about 66,000 people.

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:33.100
And if I give you some sort
of very simple descriptive,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.880
this is the first year of
data and a half hour moving

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.124
average of how happy
people report being.

00:19:38.124 --> 00:19:39.790
It's a little bit
washed out at the top,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.620
but the left I think
starts at 8:00 AM,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.290
and the right ends at 10:00 AM.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.040
And then there's a
sort of horizontal line

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.640
per day through the year from
the beginning of September 2010

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640
to the end of August 2011.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.260
And a few patterns
might jump out at you.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.752
Firstly, it's stripey.

00:19:56.752 --> 00:19:57.960
And the stripes are weekends.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.780
So you can see lighter
colors are happier.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.309
Weekends are enormously
happier than weekdays.

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:06.350
There's a kind of really
bright spot around here,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.550
which is Christmas.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.383
And there's a really
bright spot around here

00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:11.257
which is sort of the
May bank holidays.

00:20:11.257 --> 00:20:13.340
We get a little bit lighter
as we go from the left

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.860
to the right, which tells
you that, on average, people

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.565
get happier throughout the day.

00:20:17.565 --> 00:20:19.940
And you can also see that the
second half is a little bit

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.170
noisier than the
first half, so you

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.711
can tell that we had slightly
more respondents in this period

00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:26.330
than we did in this period.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.370
This actually now
goes over the whole 6

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.950
and 1/2 years up to the
beginning of this year.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.620
It's probably too
small to see, which

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.578
is sort of vaguely
intentional, because I still

00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:36.620
haven't published this.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.780
But you can see these
peaks are all Christmases.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.260
Christmases are always good.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.320
There's a general
downward tendency.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.940
I don't know whether we should
make anything of that or not.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.898
It might just be that
different kinds of people

00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:48.140
were signed up later than
were signed up earlier.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.129
So maybe some face
validity for saying

00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:51.920
that people are a little
bit less happy now

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.878
than they were in 2010?

00:20:52.878 --> 00:20:55.295
But I couldn't guarantee
you that from the data.

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.470
A few other events
that we can spot.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.340
Murray winning Wimbledon
here on a hot day.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.864
Hot days of above
about 25 degrees,

00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:05.530
you get a really big
spike in happiness.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.130
Other weather variables
make a difference, but not

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.046
such a big difference.

00:21:08.046 --> 00:21:09.830
But really hot
weather is very good.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.060
Olympic opening
ceremony, royal wedding,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.380
annoying for Republicans.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.900
And you probably
can't read this,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.525
but it relates to
one of the questions.

00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:22.280
This is the worst,
the least happy day

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.270
that we recorded over the
whole of the 6 and 1/2 years.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.490
And this is the news
that Trump got elected

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.450
as the president of America.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.900
This is, I think,
the Brexit result.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.727
I think that's the
fourth least happy day.

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.310
Now, you might say
this just shows you

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.101
that Mappiness users
are not representative

00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:39.970
of the population.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.470
On the other hand,
referendum voters

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.010
are not representative
of the population either.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.000
And Mappiness voters
have great taste.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.870
So I seem to have made
a more political point

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.526
than I intended.

00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:54.650
Planning to use this to
create a happiness forecast

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.100
at some point.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.933
And I've been planning
this for a long time.

00:21:56.933 --> 00:21:59.630
But there's this idea of
Blue Monday every year.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.080
It's the second
Monday in January.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.680
They kind of wheel out the guy
who came up with Blue Monday.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.010
And sometimes they
wheel me out to say

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.176
that Blue Monday is rubbish.

00:22:06.176 --> 00:22:08.832
But we've got no evidence that
the second Monday in January

00:22:08.832 --> 00:22:10.040
is anything particularly bad.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.234
If anything, it looks
like a Tuesday in November

00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:14.150
might be the worst day
of the year on average.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.300
But I hope to have news on
that in the near future.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.790
Now, in Mappiness I was
interested in green spaces.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.090
And so as an incredibly
naive first approach,

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.530
this is measuring the
number of green pixels

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.250
in each of the pictures
that people take.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.304
These are the colors that
I'm counting as green.

00:22:28.304 --> 00:22:30.470
And this is some indication
of how many pixels there

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.830
are in each one.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.514
It was done very
simply in processing.

00:22:34.514 --> 00:22:35.930
Interestingly, the
amount of green

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.210
is very strongly
correlated with happiness

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.860
before we control
for anything else.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.290
So no green pixels
to all green pixels

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.416
gives you about six points
out of 100 jump in happiness.

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.290
I'm not sure we can read
very much into that,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.700
because the effect
goes away when

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.650
we control for other things.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.370
It might well be, for
example, that people really

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.494
don't like work and that
workplaces generally don't

00:22:54.494 --> 00:22:56.120
have a lot of green in them.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.369
And it could be
as simple as that.

00:22:58.369 --> 00:23:00.160
I've also been thinking
about deep learning

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.201
for image classification.

00:23:01.201 --> 00:23:03.326
There's about 300,000
photos, so that could be fun.

00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:05.534
I'm sure there's lots of
other kinds of deep learning

00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:07.190
that can be done with this data.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.550
But for the PhD, and the more
serious analysis in the PhD,

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.404
I joined up habitat data
with each response location.

00:23:13.404 --> 00:23:15.320
And this is an extract
from the Land Cover Map

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.190
2000, which is a high resolution
remote sense satellite

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.854
data set.

00:23:19.854 --> 00:23:21.770
This is London, so you
can see a lot of black,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.955
which is continuous urban.

00:23:22.955 --> 00:23:24.680
But you can also see the river.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.240
You can also see Hyde
Park as a mixture of trees

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.380
and grassland and so on.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.470
So this is not about
country versus city.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.284
It's very much about land
cover wherever it occurs.

00:23:33.284 --> 00:23:35.200
And then all the information
that we collected

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200
goes into one big
regression model.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.920
So it predicts happiness from
naught to 100 on the left,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.051
with on the right the
habitat that you're in,

00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:44.300
the weather conditions, the
daylight, who you're with,

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.010
what you're doing, what kind of
place you're in, time of day,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.343
day of the week, how many
responses you've given before,

00:23:49.343 --> 00:23:51.500
because we find that people
get happier over time,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.458
and we use individual
fixed effects to take out

00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:55.602
that average effect
of being each person.

00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:56.810
And these all go in together.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.685
And that means that each
effect is controlled

00:23:58.685 --> 00:23:59.690
for every other effect.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.169
That's important, because when
you're out in a green space,

00:24:02.169 --> 00:24:03.710
it might also be
sunny, and you might

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.168
be playing Frisbee
with your mates,

00:24:05.168 --> 00:24:07.240
and it might be the
weekend, and so on.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.640
So this all goes together to
this big regression model.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.450
To get a feel for the
size of the effects,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.950
you can look at the happiest
and the least happy activities.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.730
The top activity
is one that I added

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.937
after many emailed requests.

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:21.020
There may be people looking
over people's shoulder

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.570
at this point, so we take
that one with a pinch of salt.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.028
But you can see
that generally it's

00:24:25.028 --> 00:24:27.740
sort of physical activities
and cultural activities

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.150
and social activities that
seem to occupy the top spots.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.365
And most of these
give a give a bump

00:24:33.365 --> 00:24:35.660
of sort of four to
six points out of 100

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.890
in people's happiness.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.570
We've got plenty of data, and
so these are the 95% confidence

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.070
intervals.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.980
So these are very
significant effects.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.760
And then the focus of the
research, which was land cover.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.040
And we find this
land cover type,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.780
marine and coastal margins.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.360
People were enormously happier
in marine and coastal margins

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.436
than anywhere else.

00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:55.310
This is all relative.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.710
Zero here is being in
an urban environment.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.350
So people are on average about
six points happier in what's

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.320
effectively an estuary.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.130
This is a kind of an
estuary environment,

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.254
marine and coastal margins.

00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:07.749
It's not any coastline.

00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:09.290
But in any other
natural environment,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.450
they're also
significantly happier

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.370
than they would be in
an urban environment

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.328
after we've controlled
for all the other things

00:25:15.328 --> 00:25:17.019
that we can think of.

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:19.560
And this stands up to a number
of different robustness checks

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.230
and some completely
different ways of defining

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.146
a natural environment.

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.140
So it works very
similarly if we use

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.260
areas of outstanding natural
beauty, national nature

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.415
reserves, and one other
the classification

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.270
that I forget now.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.592
But different kind of
administrative classifications

00:25:34.592 --> 00:25:36.800
of countryside give us sort
of similar sized results.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.520
And people are happier in
those than they are outside.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.114
And so this was reported in a
paper in the journal "Global

00:25:43.114 --> 00:25:44.030
Environmental Change."

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.437
A strong line of evidence
on links between environment

00:25:46.437 --> 00:25:47.020
and happiness.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.110
Slightly ambitious title.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.943
This is only the UK.

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:50.130
It's not representative.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.490
But anyway, we've got some
nice quantitative evidence

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.960
on this point.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.952
And that's nice,
because we all probably,

00:25:55.952 --> 00:25:57.410
as I said at the
beginning, realize

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.924
that people like green spaces.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.340
But this generally sounds a
little bit soft and intangible

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.990
and perhaps doesn't
stop the government

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.545
proposing to
privatize our forests

00:26:04.545 --> 00:26:06.920
or allowing them to bulldoze
sites of scientific interest

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.044
for golf courses and so on.

00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:09.950
And so the more hard
quantitative data

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.440
we've got on this, perhaps
the better the chance

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440
we might have in saving some
of the environmental treasures

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.090
that we've got.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.310
So we've covered
being by an estuary.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.239
That's really good.

00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:22.655
And we've covered Donald Trump
winning the election, which

00:26:22.655 --> 00:26:24.180
is very bad.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.450
We've got a number of
things left in this list

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.932
that I promised you.

00:26:27.932 --> 00:26:29.390
Any of you that
are werewolves will

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.806
be interested to
know that I don't

00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:34.090
find any effect of the full moon
or any other phase of the moon,

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.590
although I do have to control
quite carefully for other time

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.070
variables in order to not get
interesting false positives

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.940
on that point.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.960
And that leaves us with
drinking, riots, and football.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.080
Unsurprisingly, we do find
that alcohol, drinking alcohol,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.510
makes people happier in the
moment than when you're not

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.290
drinking alcohol.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.623
And that's after controlling
for lots of the things that

00:26:56.623 --> 00:26:59.360
go along with drinking alcohol,
such as probably not working,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.192
being with friends, being
in a pub, and so on.

00:27:02.192 --> 00:27:03.650
And we also see it
making you tired

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.830
the next day, which
is not rocket science.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.840
These were back of the
envelope calculations

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.465
for the cabinet office
who were looking

00:27:10.465 --> 00:27:12.620
for evidence of the
benefits of local pubs

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.987
as sort of community hubs.

00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:16.070
These, again, are fixed
effects regression results

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.970
controlling for a whole
range of other things.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.280
And we don't know what
people are drinking.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.049
We don't know how
much they're drinking.

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:23.090
But we do find a big
positive effect of drinking,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.740
six points out of
100 in happiness.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.510
And that's very significant.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.550
And then we have some
other interaction.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.675
Drinking in the pub is
better, drinking on your own

00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:33.540
is significantly
worse, and so on.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.330
Now, that's the basis
of another paper.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.980
And, of course, that's not
the whole of the well-being

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.880
story with alcohol, right?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.280
We saw negative coefficients
on drinking alone, drinking

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.322
on a weekday morning.

00:27:41.322 --> 00:27:43.280
There are, of course,
drinkers and non drinkers

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.440
who have their lives
wrecked by alcohol.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.676
But the positive effects
are part of the story.

00:27:47.676 --> 00:27:49.300
And actually, some
recent research work

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.320
and some recent
policy work often

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.209
can entirely neglect to
mention the positive reasons

00:27:54.209 --> 00:27:55.250
why people drink as well.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.712
So it is useful to be
able to quantify those.

00:27:57.712 --> 00:27:59.420
And that's the point
that my coauthor Ben

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.230
Bamburg makes in this paper.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.720
I have very little
interest in football,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.570
but some of my colleagues at
Sussex are football fanatics.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.460
And it seems to be a source of
strong emotion for some people,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.190
judging by these quotes
that I've picked out.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.780
And so we figured out that
actually with the Mappiness

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.880
data, we can look at this.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.760
And we have responses like
this one, which occurs here,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.450
kind of very close to
the football stands,

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.160
middle of the afternoon
on a Saturday.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.910
And the individual reports that
they're at a match or sporting

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.730
event.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.860
So we found a data set with the
locations of football stadiums.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.380
We found another data set
that has match dates, results,

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.625
and the bookmakers' odds.

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:44.250
And we did a little
bit of web scraping

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.040
to find the exact kickoff
times of those matches.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.370
And then we could join all
that together to figure out

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.200
who seem to be keen football
supporters, which teams they

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.830
follow.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.450
Ideally you spot them
at two different matches

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.930
with one team in common and
then you're reasonably certain.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.774
And we get 100 or
200 people that way.

00:28:59.774 --> 00:29:01.440
And we get a few
hundred more if we just

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.362
assume that people are probably
supporting the home team.

00:29:04.362 --> 00:29:06.570
And then we can follow those
people's happiness level

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.519
throughout the season.

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:09.060
We're not limited
just to the matches

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.140
that we spot on the map.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.760
And this is actually a paper
that I'm working on right now.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.970
And what we find is
interesting and very much

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.340
in line with sort of the
behavioral economics on loss

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.100
aversion.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.810
So we find that a win is sort
of niceish for an hour or two.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.610
A loss is really bad.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.610
It's much more negative
than a win is positive.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.290
And not only is it much worse,
it also lasts much longer.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.230
So you can still
see the next morning

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.510
that people are unhappy
if their team lost,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.579
even more so if they
didn't see it coming.

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:37.370
So if you also have an
interaction in there

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.703
for the bookies' odds being
that they were going to win,

00:29:39.703 --> 00:29:43.460
and then they lost, that
makes it even more painful.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.350
And actually, this does have
some quite interesting sort

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.000
of real world outcomes as well.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.840
There was a paper in
the "Quarterly Journal

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.394
of Economics" about
American football

00:29:51.394 --> 00:29:53.310
and looking at domestic
violence that came out

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.772
with very strong findings.

00:29:55.772 --> 00:29:57.980
And we may also be able to
look at people's behavior.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.000
We haven't done this yet,
but kind of quite interested

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.541
to find out whether
it has any effect

00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:04.500
on the probability of showing
up at work the next day.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.960
So that leaves us with
riots, I think, of the things

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.120
that I promised to
talk to you about.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.504
And this is work that was
done by my PhD student

00:30:11.504 --> 00:30:13.420
[? Panka ?] [INAUDIBLE]
who wanted to be here,

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.810
but unfortunately isn't
quite back from the States

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.040
on a Fulbright scholarship.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.540
This follows on
from some work where

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.998
we looked at
happiness impacts sort

00:30:19.998 --> 00:30:22.560
of rippling over time and
space from terrorist incidents

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.707
in Northern Ireland.

00:30:23.707 --> 00:30:25.290
So [? Panka ?] took
the Mappiness data

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.914
and was looking for
a sort of signature

00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:30.034
from the riots that happened in
August 2011 in English cities.

00:30:30.034 --> 00:30:31.950
And if you weren't here
or you don't remember,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.960
there were sort of
several days of looting

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.460
and setting fire to things and
clashing with the police that

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.190
started, I think, in
Hackney, and spread

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.887
to other parts of London and
then the country as a whole.

00:30:40.887 --> 00:30:42.720
Now, that seemed
reasonably promising to me,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.820
because I was living close
to Elephant and Castle

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.430
at the time, and I remember
that we were planning to go out

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.772
to a restaurant and then we
thought maybe the Elephant

00:30:49.772 --> 00:30:51.480
and Castle shopping
center isn't the best

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.100
place to be at this point.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.470
So I thought you'd have seen
it in my happiness data.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.640
[? Panka ?] hasn't
actually managed

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.931
to find this in the Mappiness
data, which I don't think

00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:02.000
is her fault. I think
we just don't see it.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.600
All that we do
see is that we can

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.190
see that people are watching
telly a little bit more

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.780
over this period,
which is potentially

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.870
people keeping track with
what's going on on the news.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:10.930
We're not quite sure.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.660
But as far as we can
tell, these riots

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.666
don't have an impact on
your average Mappiness user.

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:18.540
So that's all the things
that I promised you,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.080
but how are you doing today?

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.880
Well, the bad news, obviously,
is that you're at work.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.796
And of all the things
that you could be doing,

00:31:23.796 --> 00:31:26.774
work ranks second only to
sickness as a cause of misery.

00:31:26.774 --> 00:31:28.440
These are all the
activities that people

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.690
can report doing in Mappiness.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.460
There's about 40 of them.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.262
And here is working or studying.

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:35.220
And we can restrict this
just to the people who

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.940
say that they're
in full time work,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.540
and we find that has quite a
big negative coefficient, second

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.850
only to being ill in bed,
which is rather bigger.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.917
That's 20 points out of 100,
but work is still minus 5.

00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:48.000
And in fact, it's not just
being in the workplace.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.810
The working day and working
are independently negative.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.632
I can't remember how
colleagues turn out.

00:31:54.632 --> 00:31:55.840
Maybe I shouldn't say anyway.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.220
This is work with
Alex Bryson at UCL.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.980
And we also look at what you're
doing while you're working.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.850
And we find, in fact,
that only 0.3% of people

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.440
follow Snow White's
advice, which

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.250
is a pity, because the
happiness effects of singing

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.500
and performing would be just
about enough to wipe out

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.350
the negative effects of
working, although the effects

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.000
on your coworkers might also
need to be factored in there,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.432
I suppose.

00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:22.890
So there were two other things
that I want to mention today

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.270
in terms of what
we've been doing

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.690
and what we're going to do next.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.690
And I mention these two
things particularly just

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.909
in case anyone here
is sort of interested

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:31.200
and potentially could help out.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.710
Now, this is a bit washed out.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.560
And so my PhD
student, [? Panka ?]

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.840
is now sort of turning her
attention to air pollution.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.548
And we've got really
good reason to think

00:32:38.548 --> 00:32:41.250
that air pollution will affect
people's subjective well-being,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.306
including routes via
their physical health.

00:32:43.306 --> 00:32:44.680
We've also got
really good reason

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.370
to think that it will impair
their physical and cognitive

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.060
abilities.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.000
There's a really amazing
paper last year from LSE

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.610
by Sefi Soth, where he gives
quite convincing evidence,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.890
having kind of put air
pollution monitors in the exam

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.130
rooms at LSE, that high levels
of particulates in the exam

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.170
room increase students'
probability of failing

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.420
their exam by about 5%.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.640
And he has the same students
sitting different exams

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.764
in different rooms at
different levels of pollution

00:33:07.764 --> 00:33:11.010
so that the identification is
quite convincing in that one.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.640
Now, I raise this possibility
of a link between air pollution

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.420
and performance because
one thing that occurs to us

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.220
is that Google has really rich
data on some kinds of cognitive

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.920
and perhaps also physical
performance, for example, maybe

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.520
mistyped searches, mistyped
words on Android keyboard,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.540
and so on.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.570
And these data presumably could
be located in space and time.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.070
And that means that
potentially they

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.960
could be related
to air pollution

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.760
data to look for potentially
causal relationships.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.310
And in cities like
London and lots

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.560
of American cities, different
places around the world,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.400
there's quite good data now
on air pollution through space

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.950
and over time.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.500
So if you can think
of any data that

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.083
would help us
understand air pollution

00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:50.760
effects on performance, then do
let me know at the end of today

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.219
or on email or via Alex.

00:33:52.219 --> 00:33:54.510
It doesn't necessarily have
to be big things, you know,

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.080
thinking about a simple typo.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.960
A simple typo has been enough in
various situations in the past

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.200
to administer a near
fatal drug dose.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.489
To lop several nines off
the availability of S-3,

00:34:06.489 --> 00:34:08.280
we'll have the world
believing that there's

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.571
an order of magnitude more
iron in spinach than in fact

00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:13.274
is in spinach, which is the
origin of the Popeye cartoons.

00:34:13.274 --> 00:34:15.690
So even small things, I think,
could be really interesting

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.569
there.

00:34:16.569 --> 00:34:19.110
And the other thing I was going
to talk about, which as I say

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:22.080
is sort of apposite on the day
after Mappiness kind of goes

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.424
dark, is Mappiness 2.

00:34:23.424 --> 00:34:25.590
And there are sort of three
things that distinguish,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.089
we hope, this next iteration
of Mappiness, which I'm already

00:34:28.089 --> 00:34:29.969
working on, from the original.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.144
Firstly, it will be
on iPhone and Android,

00:34:32.144 --> 00:34:34.620
and we hope it will add in
some fun stuff like heart rate

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.245
variability measurement
with the camera

00:34:36.245 --> 00:34:39.290
and flash which, I discover,
Alex and some of his team

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.618
know an awful lot about.

00:34:40.618 --> 00:34:42.659
Integration, probably,
with HealthKit and perhaps

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:46.350
equivalents on Android, which
I'd be happy to talk about.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.972
It will try to not only
quantify your happiness--

00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:51.305
and as I said, we do find
that the process of reflecting

00:34:51.305 --> 00:34:52.980
through doing
Mappiness for a while

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.739
does seem to make
people happier--

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.390
but also to improve
your happiness.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.740
Now the idea in the
original Mappiness

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.720
was just that we wanted data,
so we kind of didn't want

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.080
to change people's happiness.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.840
Obviously it's a good thing
that people's happiness went up

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.340
rather than down,
or we'd have a lot

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.120
of trouble getting ethical
approval for any future study.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.530
But it's a little bit cold in
that you can tell Mappiness

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.738
that you're really miserable
day after day after day,

00:35:12.738 --> 00:35:15.360
and Mappiness the original
does nothing about it.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.000
My co-founder at Psychological
Technologies, Nick Begley,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.530
was the first
employee at Headspace,

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.510
and so he knows plenty
about mindfulness

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.302
and other sorts of
scientifically validated

00:35:23.302 --> 00:35:24.968
approaches to making
people feel better.

00:35:24.968 --> 00:35:27.330
So the idea is that in the
next Mappiness, if you're not

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.280
feeling good, we can
begin to offer you

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.530
suggestions for the
kinds of things that

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.790
might make you feel better.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.580
And for example, we have
mental and physical well-being

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.760
interventions that are
integrated in Mappiness 2,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.885
like this sort of interactive
mindfulness practice.

00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:42.843
And we can suggest them
at appropriate moments.

00:35:42.843 --> 00:35:44.400
And even better,
hopefully over time,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.227
we can collect data on what the
most appropriate moments are

00:35:47.227 --> 00:35:49.560
for which kinds of interventions
and how those are going

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.290
to make people feel better.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.590
And the third thing
that's new in Mappiness

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.770
is more of a focus on work.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.216
So as I said, the
first Mappiness

00:35:57.216 --> 00:35:58.840
found that people
aren't happy at work.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.060
And that wasn't what
we set out to do.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.060
And we therefore didn't
collect lots of the data

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.990
that you'd probably
most want to try and dig

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.319
in to that in more detail.

00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:08.110
You know, we don't know
what sector or even

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.220
what company people are working
in, what they do at work,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.560
anything about what they
think about their employer,

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.405
and so on.

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:15.780
And this is
obviously information

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.910
that employers are interested
in and that employers

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.190
could use to make the
workplace better and make

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.860
people happier at work, as well
as perhaps more productive.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.350
So we already have employees
in one big household name

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.700
firm using what's effectively
a kind of an alpha version

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.670
of Mappiness 2.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.406
But we're also looking for
people, and indeed workplaces,

00:36:32.406 --> 00:36:33.780
who would like to
help us conduct

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.732
some kind of randomized
controlled trial on the impacts

00:36:36.732 --> 00:36:38.940
of this sort of technology,
measuring and then trying

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.140
to improve people's
well-being through the apps

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.090
in their pockets.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:46.566
So that's it, but
hopefully there's

00:36:46.566 --> 00:36:47.940
plenty of time
for any questions,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.106
if you've got any questions.

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:50.390
And thank you for listening.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:55.972 --> 00:36:57.680
SPEAKER 1: We do have
time for questions.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.679
Please raise your hands.

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:00.850
Yes.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.860
Quick question.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.190
Have you looked at the
cultural or ethnic component?

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.790
Does this apply to everybody of
all ages, and things like that?

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.460
GEORGE MACKERRON: That's
a very good question.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.750
We don't ask questions
about ethnic origin,

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.680
and we're primarily
looking in the UK,

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.430
so unfortunately I don't
have much data on that.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.470
We do ask some demographic
questions, age, gender,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.862
marital status, employment
status, and so on.

00:37:28.862 --> 00:37:31.070
Now, generally, the analysis
that I've shown you here

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.180
have been these
fixed effect things.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.263
And so all these individual
level things drop out,

00:37:34.263 --> 00:37:38.129
and we're just looking at
the average across everyone.

00:37:38.129 --> 00:37:39.670
We have looked a
little bit, I think,

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.836
at some gender differences
and some age differences.

00:37:41.836 --> 00:37:44.060
And in a lot of cases,
there isn't any single thing

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.760
significant, and in some other
cases, there's not very much.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.540
I'm a little bit hazy
now on the answers.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.498
Now, there's definitely
scope to do more there.

00:37:51.498 --> 00:37:53.600
You could do more with
the data that we've got.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.640
You would ideally, actually,
ask some more questions as well.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.290
I mean, the focus on
Mappiness, really,

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.780
was let's look at
natural environment,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.270
and let's make it
so quick and easy

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.510
that possibly some people
will want to do it.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.240
So in retrospect,
there's quite a lot

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.560
of things that would
be nice to look at.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.435
I mean, do you have any
hypotheses about what

00:38:08.435 --> 00:38:10.660
you might find in any of that?

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.980
AUDIENCE: No, I mean,
there [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.490
some cultural components
to how somebody perceives

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:22.110
drinking in some cultures
versus how somebody perceives

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.720
drinking in a cultural context.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.022
And that can affect the--

00:38:26.022 --> 00:38:27.480
GEORGE MACKERRON:
No, that's right.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.146
So I guess results
that I show you today

00:38:29.146 --> 00:38:31.860
are kind of valid for the
subset of people in the UK

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.725
that we've got.

00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:34.850
And you're right, actually.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.391
That's certainly a
good example where

00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:39.780
you would have some
different effects, I'm sure.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.570
SPEAKER ONE: More questions?

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:42.069
Yep.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.900
AUDIENCE: Is there any more you
can say about people seemingly

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.400
being very happy at Christmas?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.650
Because my experience is
that everyone moans about how

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.566
terrible Christmas is.

00:38:55.981 --> 00:38:58.230
GEORGE MACKERRON: So, I
suppose a lot of it turns out,

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.180
I think, to come back
to how likely people are

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.060
to be working.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.875
And I suspect that
happiness at Christmas

00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:04.500
is partly driven by
the fact that we've

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.434
got the least number of people
working throughout the year.

00:39:07.434 --> 00:39:09.600
We see bank holidays as
being very positive as well.

00:39:11.979 --> 00:39:13.770
Beyond that, it's just
anecdotes, isn't it?

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.874
I mean, it would be good
to do qualitative research

00:39:16.874 --> 00:39:17.790
in some of this stuff.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.100
And I guess that's not my area.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.014
There's perhaps a slight worry
about whether people don't

00:39:24.014 --> 00:39:25.680
report if they're not
happy at Christmas

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.940
because they feel
like they should be,

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.130
or if they misrepresent
their happiness at Christmas,

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.680
again because they feel that
that's the time that they're

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.555
supposed to be happy.

00:39:31.555 --> 00:39:33.816
They don't want to
admit that they're not.

00:39:33.816 --> 00:39:35.190
I mean, if you
were going to find

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.870
that in any kind of
well-being research,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.310
hopefully you wouldn't
find it in this,

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.893
which is a very kind of private
thing with you and your phone.

00:39:40.893 --> 00:39:43.911
It's not someone ringing
you up and asking questions.

00:39:43.911 --> 00:39:45.220
But yeah, it's a good question.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.920
People have sometimes sort of
expressed surprise at that,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.350
and sort of said, hmm,
people spending a lot of time

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:54.390
with their family isn't always
a recipe for high happiness.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.010
So, yeah, it's a good question.

00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:01.440
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think the
obvious question is are people

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.940
otherwise happier when
they're spending time

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.690
with their family?

00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:08.490
GEORGE MACKERRON: And they are.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.249
Yeah.

00:40:10.249 --> 00:40:11.790
But I mean, the
things that we looked

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.980
at where happiness was amazing,
that was not controlled.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.438
That was just sort
of raw averages.

00:40:15.438 --> 00:40:18.300
So you're right that if we
sort of start taking out

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.310
the variation that
we can predict,

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.080
then you will see those peaks
drop almost certainly, right?

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.496
Because they're
with their family.

00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:24.252
They're drinking.

00:40:24.252 --> 00:40:25.710
Probably some of
them are drinking.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.668
And they're doing other
things that they enjoy.

00:40:27.668 --> 00:40:29.621
And they're not working.

00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:30.120
Yeah.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.840
So some of it's--

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.691
AUDIENCE: --they're not lying.

00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:33.690
GEORGE MACKERRON: Right.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.050
OK.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.290
So that's certainly
in line with-- yeah.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:35.630
Yeah.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.880
And I mean, it's an average
effect, so you would need,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.247
I guess, as long as 2/3
of the people are happier,

00:40:40.247 --> 00:40:41.830
1/3 of the people
could be less happy,

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.980
and the average coefficient
here comes out the way

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.760
that we've seen.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.260
So there's also
certainly scope here

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.801
for looking more at
the distribution,

00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:49.380
and maybe doing
quantile regression

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.046
and seeing what drives
the low responses

00:40:51.046 --> 00:40:53.044
versus the high responses, say.

00:40:53.044 --> 00:40:54.960
Always in these talks
there's a million things

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.380
that I have to apologize
for not having done.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.570
There's a lot still to do.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.591
Yeah.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:02.340
AUDIENCE: So with the
fixed effects model,

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.780
you're sort of
looking at differences

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.910
within individual people.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.690
Like they're happier when
they're in a green area.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:13.050
But I mean, is
there some concern

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.500
that people might adapt
to these interventions?

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.840
Like maybe the government
puts green spaces everywhere

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.120
and there's still
a big difference,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.610
but instead of being really
happy in green spaces and just

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.830
kind of meh in city
urban environments,

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.730
now I'm used to green spaces
and urban environments

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.730
are just really terrible?

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.712
AUDIENCE: Or bitter,
because of the difference.

00:41:34.712 --> 00:41:35.670
GEORGE MACKERRON: Yeah.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.320
And I guess related
to that, there's

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.150
a question of sort of contrasts.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.110
And so most of our
respondents live in cities.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.670
And so maybe it's partly that
they're getting out of the city

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.600
and they're going on holiday.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.016
And that's actually
the number one

00:41:47.016 --> 00:41:49.810
question that I wish we'd
asked, is are you on holiday?

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.350
And we can kind of
try and get to that

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.310
with various heuristics,
but we don't quite have it.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.434
So that's an obvious
thing to try and get at,

00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:00.850
also looking at people who
perhaps live in the countryside

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.200
and then visit the city.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.440
That's sort of one of
the top things on my list

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.014
to stop apologizing for
not having done and do.

00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:08.930
And I promised a book
chapter later this year,

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.649
actually, where my plan is to do
that amongst some other things.

00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:14.190
In general in the
happiness research,

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.644
sort of habituation
or adaptation

00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:17.560
is certainly an issue.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.976
And I mean, one
of the things that

00:42:18.976 --> 00:42:21.957
drove me to do this was I moved
down to London to do the PhD.

00:42:21.957 --> 00:42:23.790
I was previously in
Cambridge at that point.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.456
And Cambridge was
green and quite clean.

00:42:25.456 --> 00:42:28.140
And London was incredibly
kind of dirty and polluted.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.490
And that kind of got me down.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.050
By the end of five,
six years in London,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.750
I was getting-- at
least, I was aware

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.630
of it getting me down less.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.890
So no, that is a question.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.290
And that is certainly a
question for policymakers.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:41.250
You know, there's all
kinds of other things

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.090
people adapt to as well.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.460
You know, they adapt to sort
of chronic health problems

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.080
that the government
thinks it's worth spending

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.350
quite a lot of money to avoid.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.830
Those then don't seem to
affect people's happiness

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:54.306
in the very long run as
much as you'd expect.

00:42:54.306 --> 00:42:55.680
One of the reasons
for that might

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.970
be that happiness
isn't the only thing

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.219
that people are interested in.

00:42:58.219 --> 00:42:59.710
And in fact, the
football research

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.710
also talks to that idea
that happiness might not

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.060
be the only thing that
people are interested in.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.790
Because unless everyone
supports teams that always win,

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.400
which I'm pretty
sure isn't true,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.720
then losses are so
much more painful

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.480
than wins are pleasant that
you'd think that they weren't

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.840
maximizing the sort of the
integral of their happiness

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.450
by going to football
matches and following them.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.440
So that's a bit of a rambling
answer, but it kind of-- yeah.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.130
Your point is still
valid and interesting.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.672
What you'd, I
guess, like to do is

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:29.130
have some kind of,
again, some kind

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.620
of trial, some kind of random
assignment of more or less

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.670
green space.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.300
See what happens if a park
ends up being closed for a year

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.439
to the people who
live nearby, say.

00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:39.480
And then you might look
at the profile over time.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.850
If there is some adaptation,
how much is there?

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.740
I suspect that it
wouldn't be complete.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.450
There are lots of
other things that--

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.889
the reasons that we think
people like green spaces,

00:43:47.889 --> 00:43:49.680
you would imagine
perhaps wouldn't go away.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.550
So you know, there's
an opportunity

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.720
for sort of physical exercise
that improves health.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.910
There's an opportunity for
socializing with people.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.740
And there's also this idea
that we evolved in the savanna,

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.790
or on the edge of
forests, or wherever

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.041
it is that we evolved over
tens of thousands of years.

00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:04.165
It might well be something
that just kind of causes

00:44:04.165 --> 00:44:06.936
us to find these patterns in
our visual system and kind

00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:08.310
of attractive,
You this biophilia

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.050
hypothesis of Eo Wilson.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.697
So I would be surprised
if all of those

00:44:11.697 --> 00:44:12.780
were totally adapted away.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.821
But it would certainly be
interesting to find out

00:44:14.821 --> 00:44:15.575
how far they were.

00:44:15.575 --> 00:44:17.700
AUDIENCE: There's a new
park in East London, right,

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.100
during the time period
that you studied?

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.130
GEORGE MACKERRON:
Yeah, the Olympic Park.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.338
Yeah, we should look at that.

00:44:23.338 --> 00:44:24.995
We have briefly looked
at the Olympics,

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.620
mainly with the ax to grind that
I wonder if it would have been

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.953
an awful lot cheaper just to
have a couple of extra bank

00:44:29.953 --> 00:44:31.380
holidays.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.630
Might not turn out to be true.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.380
I haven't really checked
in enough detail.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.385
I suspect that we don't
have enough responses

00:44:36.385 --> 00:44:37.010
from that time.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.480
And there aren't enough
people living around it.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.730
Because they're also
kind of building-- well,

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.810
I guess the houses have just
been built, haven't they?

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.450
People have presumably all just
kind of moved there as well,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.490
because it was a sort
of big redevelopment.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:47.656
It's an interesting thought.

00:44:47.656 --> 00:44:49.250
It's the right kind
of thing, I think,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.640
for us to think
about looking it.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.227
Yeah.

00:44:52.227 --> 00:44:53.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, sorry.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.042
You had sports and doing sports
as one of the top things that

00:44:56.042 --> 00:44:56.750
drives happiness.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.157
But also drinking alcohol,
as well, was on that list.

00:44:59.157 --> 00:45:01.490
Just wondering about the trade
off between like virtuous

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.550
behaviors and then
maybe not so virtuous

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:09.104
behaviors and how
they impact happiness.

00:45:09.104 --> 00:45:11.270
GEORGE MACKERRON: Yeah, I'm
not sure I have anything

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.160
very intelligent to say about
that, apart from that, yes,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.270
it does sound interesting.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.460
And I suppose if
we've got people

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.749
that we observe over
a long period of time,

00:45:19.749 --> 00:45:21.290
then we could
potentially, I suppose,

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.206
look at that kind of
cumulative effect of what

00:45:23.206 --> 00:45:23.957
you've been doing.

00:45:23.957 --> 00:45:26.540
I mean, one of the things that
actually I don't do at all here

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.081
is you don't have
any dynamic models.

00:45:28.081 --> 00:45:30.037
So we kind of account
for the responses

00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:31.620
being from the same
people in the era.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.830
But we don't use the fact
that we could kind of,

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.492
this next response follows
the previous response.

00:45:36.492 --> 00:45:38.200
And so, in general,
we could kind of both

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.616
do that on a kind
of shorter level

00:45:39.616 --> 00:45:41.117
and I guess also
on a longer level,

00:45:41.117 --> 00:45:42.950
and see people who often
report that they're

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.241
doing sport versus people
who often report that they're

00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:46.335
drinking, for example.

00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:48.710
Some of these things, certainly
the drinking, potentially

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:49.880
has reverse
causality, because it

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.046
might be that people drink
because they're stressed.

00:45:52.046 --> 00:45:54.427
And it can be awkward, but
with the time series data,

00:45:54.427 --> 00:45:56.510
we might have a chance of
addressing some of that,

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.135
because you can see
what precedes what.

00:46:00.672 --> 00:46:02.880
AUDIENCE: It seems like most
of your data and results

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.420
here are from local areas.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.890
Do you have any plans
with the new release

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.650
to target the US, Korea,
other industrialized areas?

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.000
GEORGE MACKERRON: Right.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.780
So the other thing that I should
have said about Mappiness 2

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.070
as well as being
on more platforms

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.778
and doing a few more
things is that, yes,

00:46:14.778 --> 00:46:15.950
it should be worldwide.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.439
And it would, I guess, have
been a good idea if Mappiness

00:46:18.439 --> 00:46:19.230
had been worldwide.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.830
And I have to kind of--

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.830
it was quite late in the PhD,
and timezones were really

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.540
screwing with my head.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.440
So you can use it.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.231
You can use the original
Mappiness anywhere

00:46:29.231 --> 00:46:30.964
in the world.

00:46:30.964 --> 00:46:32.380
You just have to
adjust the times.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.740
You'll be beeped in London time.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.910
You know, it's a silly
thing, and probably would've

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.680
taken me a day or two and
I could have fixed that.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.860
And then we'd have
had more people.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.310
But I guess the other question
is I couldn't-- you know,

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.292
what I was planning to do, the
key thing was to join this with

00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:44.750
environmental data
and do research.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.150
And I couldn't promise for
100 countries in the world

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.490
that I'd go and find
environmental data

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.250
and make that join up.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.875
So I couldn't have
ever said to people,

00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:52.909
you'll definitely be
part of the research.

00:46:52.909 --> 00:46:54.450
But yeah, definitely
it will be good.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.908
And that would
also, I guess, speak

00:46:55.908 --> 00:46:58.530
potentially to this question of
different cultures and so on.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.284
And that would be
interesting to do.

00:47:01.284 --> 00:47:03.700
AUDIENCE: Here at Google, we
have a whole people analytics

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.200
team.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.555
Have you spoken to them?

00:47:05.555 --> 00:47:07.346
GEORGE MACKERRON: No,
but that sounds good.

00:47:10.904 --> 00:47:11.820
Yeah, put me in touch.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.090
I'll talk to you afterwards.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.160
That would be great.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.270
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry
if you mentioned it.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.780
I missed it.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.570
But did you ask gender question?

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.540
Any correlations there?

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.540
GEORGE MACKERRON: I haven't
gone into the gender

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.600
data in lots of detail.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.520
In terms of natural
environment my recollection

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.340
is that there's one small thing
that was slightly at odds,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.480
but largely the nature effects
were kind of fairly consistent

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.444
between the genders.

00:47:35.444 --> 00:47:36.360
Yeah, we do have that.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.320
As I said, most
of these have been

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.610
done with fixed effects,
where you only look

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.850
at the individual variation.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.913
So all the effects that pretty
much don't change for anyone

00:47:43.913 --> 00:47:44.736
aren't seen.

00:47:44.736 --> 00:47:46.110
And in fact, we
don't give people

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.540
an opportunity to tell us
that any of those things

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.414
have changed, either.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.364
AUDIENCE: Did I see
that the app can--

00:47:54.364 --> 00:47:57.410
it prompts you for a
response, but you can also

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.706
self decide to respond?

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:02.330
Are there any
differences between these

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.281
prompted and self-reported?

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:05.780
GEORGE MACKERRON:
So mostly, I mean,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.820
there's an advantage in letting
people do it at any time, which

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.200
is that they feel like
they're in control,

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.991
and they can also sort
of show it to people

00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:13.220
and show them how it works.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.610
It's a good question.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.490
It's not something
I've focused on.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.270
So generally, we've
just taken the responses

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.250
that were prompted, because
the idea of this experience

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.020
sampling method is you
want a kind of probability

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.853
sample of all the moments
in someone's life.

00:48:22.853 --> 00:48:25.294
And of course, they
may have reasons.

00:48:25.294 --> 00:48:26.710
They may be showing
it to someone,

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.876
or they may be doing it
because they're particularly

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.170
happy or particularly unhappy.

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:32.510
So I suspect that you're
right, they would be different.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.304
I guess I'm not 100% sure what
the difference would tell us,

00:48:35.304 --> 00:48:37.220
but it would be a thing
that we could look at.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.970
Generally we can take
a response, I think,

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.170
that's within an hour of
having being signaled.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:46.610
And about half of signals get
a response within an hour.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.450
You can reduce that or
increase it, I think.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.957
And in ESM work, typically, it's
sometimes been just 20 minutes.

00:48:51.957 --> 00:48:53.540
But then in ESM work,
typically people

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.956
have made up half
their responses.

00:48:54.956 --> 00:48:56.797
So it's kind of swings
and roundabouts.

00:48:56.797 --> 00:48:58.880
It doesn't make a lot of
difference to the effects

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.588
that we were looking
at here, whether you

00:49:00.588 --> 00:49:03.140
take a really short window or
a really long window, which

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.172
is encouraging.

00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:06.380
Of course, we are missing
half of people's responses.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.030
And in fact, the
original Mappiness

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.410
requires a data
connection to beep you.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.770
It was push notifications,
because local notifications

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:13.580
weren't available.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.590
Which is a shame, because people
up in the middle of nowhere up

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.210
a mountain might
be the happiest,

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:19.806
but we can't ding them.

00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:21.227
But yeah.

00:49:21.227 --> 00:49:23.060
AUDIENCE: Have you seen
anything interesting

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.070
as people have aged
through your study?

00:49:31.756 --> 00:49:32.630
GEORGE MACKERRON: No.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.244
I guess we could try that.

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:43.660
It would be difficult, though,
I suppose, to disentangle--

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.493
I don't know if we've
got a long enough time

00:49:45.493 --> 00:49:47.890
series to disentangle you
aging versus the world going up

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:49.970
in flames.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.340
And I mean, in general,
we'd expect a big U shape.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.610
So in the subjective well-being
literature generally,

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.720
there's this kind of
big U, where being 40,

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.690
45 is the worst.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.015
And then it picks up again.

00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:04.585
And some of it
picking up again is

00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:07.870
that, again, people retire, and
they're not working anymore.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.500
But that's what
we expect to find.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.250
But I haven't looked
at that in Mappiness.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.708
As I say, I'm not sure if we've
got the best data for that.

00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:18.960
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
some of these scenarios

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.512
where there's a
lot of variability

00:50:21.512 --> 00:50:23.220
in terms of happiness
for a single event,

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.590
for example having children.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:28.140
Are there things that are
much more consistent, and then

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.900
so maybe the government
could do or companies

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.560
could do to improve?

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.920
Are there things that
everyone agreed on

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.850
as being happy things?

00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:42.690
GEORGE MACKERRON: I mean,
one of the interesting things

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.648
in relation to economists
normally saying, just

00:50:44.648 --> 00:50:46.770
get richer, versus
us thinking are there

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.770
unintended consequences
of getting richer?

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.190
I mean, certainly one of the
things that springs to mind

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.920
is sort of people in city jobs
who get paid vast salaries

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.560
but don't have any option at
all except to work full time

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.480
or double full time.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.904
I kind of think that
working time regulations are

00:51:00.904 --> 00:51:02.070
potentially quite promising.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:05.290
Now, you know, if you could have
people cut their working hours,

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:08.370
but not have it be a signal
that they weren't committed,

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.590
they might do well with four
days instead of five days

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:15.620
and 80% of their salary, say.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.336
The Economics Foundation
have quite a lot

00:51:17.336 --> 00:51:18.960
of interesting work about
that, and that potentially

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.730
is also kind of good for the
environment, because, you know,

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.000
your city lawyer only has a sort
of one weekend in every four

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.035
off, and then jets far
away and comes back.

00:51:26.035 --> 00:51:27.660
Probably isn't made
very happy by that,

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.034
and in addition, they're kind
of using a lot of the world

00:51:30.034 --> 00:51:32.640
resources to do it.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.860
Work life balance
issues, potentially.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.710
Yeah, I don't have a
brilliant answer to that.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.210
I mean, redistribution,
potentially.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.610
I showed you this chart
about how little difference

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.810
it makes kind of up at
the top end of income,

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.600
how much more income you get
compared to how much difference

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.730
it makes at the bottom.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.986
And economists are normally
very worried about that.

00:51:51.986 --> 00:51:53.610
They're like these
Pareto improvements,

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:54.930
right, where everyone
can agree that if you

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.210
can make some people happier
and no one less happy,

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.730
then that's great.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.230
But they generally kind of don't
like to talk about the ones

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:02.605
where you make
someone a tiny bit

00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:05.309
less happy to make
someone else much happier.

00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:07.350
And you know, that's a
difficult political thing.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:11.440
But that's some of what
politics is about, I suppose.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.154
So there's a thought.

00:52:13.154 --> 00:52:14.820
Actually, this is
both my Twitter handle

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.640
and GitHub handle.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.473
And probably not worth
going to the Twitter,

00:52:17.473 --> 00:52:20.581
because it's just
political ranting.

00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:21.872
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:24.728
Which of the
findings of the study

00:52:24.728 --> 00:52:27.230
have surprised you the most?

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.980
GEORGE MACKERRON: And
this is the question

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.250
that journalists always ask.

00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:33.860
Yeah.

00:52:36.707 --> 00:52:38.790
Which of the findings have
surprised you the most?

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:39.150
I don't know.

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.441
I mean, I guess I'm kind of
used to these findings now.

00:52:41.441 --> 00:52:42.880
And the thing
about most of them,

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.220
you probably noticed
a couple of times

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.261
I was apologizing that
they were kind of obvious.

00:52:46.261 --> 00:52:48.870
But the thing that it's
nice is to quantify them

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.840
and compare them to each other
and show that they're real.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.060
So there hasn't been much
that has kind of come

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.800
completely out of the blue.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.780
No, I'm not sure.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.010
SPEAKER ONE: We have time
for one more question.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.710
Any last question?

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:05.490
If not--

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:06.080
GEORGE MACKERRON: I
mean, to be honest,

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.400
the thing that surprised me most
is that 66,000 people wanted

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.400
to do this, on average,
for six weeks at a time,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.494
which was wonderful.

00:53:11.494 --> 00:53:13.410
And I think they did
that because they learned

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:15.118
about themselves, and
they felt like they

00:53:15.118 --> 00:53:17.710
were contributing to a sort
of research enterprise.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.419
So that was good.

00:53:18.419 --> 00:53:20.085
AUDIENCE: So this is
my second question,

00:53:20.085 --> 00:53:21.697
so I feel like I'm
cheating a bit.

00:53:21.697 --> 00:53:23.280
Have you considered
talking to someone

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.300
like Facebook, who with a
single slider on the front page

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.150
saying how happy are you, could
get you billions and billions

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.012
of data points very rapidly?

00:53:32.012 --> 00:53:32.970
GEORGE MACKERRON: Yeah.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.460
And during the PhD I did think
about kind of Facebook apps

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.840
and that kind of thing.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.090
I haven't approached Facebook.

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:40.215
I know, actually, that
Facebook worked a little bit

00:53:40.215 --> 00:53:43.350
with the guy behind
trackyourhappiness.org,

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.155
which is a somewhat similar
study based in the States.

00:53:46.155 --> 00:53:48.030
I think they have slightly
fewer data points,

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.010
and they don't have location.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.830
But otherwise, they had quite
a sort of similar approach

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:53.330
to things.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.990
And I think he actually
works part time there.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:57.240
It could be worth thinking of.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.990
I suspect that an awful
lot of researchers

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.055
are kind of sidling up
to Google and hoping

00:54:01.055 --> 00:54:02.180
for that kind of thing too.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.090
So I don't know.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:03.590
But yeah.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:08.112
And I guess you'd get this kind
of social network, potentially.

00:54:08.112 --> 00:54:10.070
You could sort of trace
through some of the way

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.460
that it works through
networks, too,

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.747
with that data, which
obviously would be fascinating.

00:54:16.347 --> 00:54:17.680
SPEAKER ONE: We are out of time.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.263
Thank you very much,
George MacKerron.

00:54:19.263 --> 00:54:22.280
