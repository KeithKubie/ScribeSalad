00:00:00.217 --> 00:00:02.427
- [Voiceover] What I want to
do in this video is explore

00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:06.799
the mechanics of a typical
adjustable rate mortgage,

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.200
often known as an ARM, and
then think about and wonder

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.599
what situations could this be advantageous

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.167
and in which situations might not

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:19.233
this be the best scenario
for the home buyer.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:23.366
So let's just first think
about the mechanics,

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:27.333
and to do that I will draw
a little bit of a timeline.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.400
Let's say on the vertical axis

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.841
this is going to be your interest rate,

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.342
this is in percentage terms.

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:42.723
That's one percent, two
percent, three percent,

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:47.607
four, five, six and it
can higher than that even.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.522
Let's say this is the time axis.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:56.322
This right over here is
the time axis in years.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.921
That is one year, two years,

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.105
three years, four years,

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:16.466
five years and maybe
we'll go six years out.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.146
Before I even plot the
adjustable rate mortgage,

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.450
let's think about a fixed rate mortgage.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.633
If I had a fixed rate mortgage,

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.833
it is exactly what the word implies.

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.400
The rate is going to be fixed.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
On a fixed rate mortgage,
where the fixed rate mortgages

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.866
are at the time you get
the loan, based on the type

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.267
of loan you're getting
and your credit score,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.733
let's say you get a
four percent fixed rate.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.033
So that means over the life of your loan,

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.259
your loan is going to
be at a four percent.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.727
Whatever you have to
pay on your principle,

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:53.200
whatever principle you
have left over every period

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.666
you will pay an equivalent of
a four percent annual rate.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.200
And we've gone into some
depth on that in other videos,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.098
where we talk about 30 year and 15 year

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:03.933
and 10 year fixed mortgages.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.200
And you might be saying "Wait, I thought

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.967
"as time goes on I pay down
more and more principle,

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:10.900
"which means that each of my payments,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.219
"less and less of it goes to interest.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.200
"So it doesn't feel like
my interest is changing."

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.266
And there's truth to
that, the dollar amount

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.169
that you're paying towards interest

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.600
with a traditional fixed
rate mortgage does go down

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.819
every month as you pay down
more and more principle.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.900
But the interest rate, the
rate that you're paying

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.966
on the principle that you have remaining,

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.833
is going to be constant.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.733
In this example, it would
be a constant four percent.

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.033
Now what about an
adjustable rate mortgage?

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.366
As you can imagine, that means

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.346
that the mortgage is going to adjust.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:46.433
So an adjustable rate mortgage
might start at two percent,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.967
and that might look really good,

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.300
but the way that the deal will work is,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.133
if short term interest
rates were to increase,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:58.227
the adjustable rate mortgage
will increase as well.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:02:59.666
So there could be a reality where

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.833
if short term interest
rates increase enough,

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:05.200
the adjustable rate mortgage
interest rate, or rate,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.109
might be even higher than
the fixed rate mortgage.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.900
And if interest rates were
to go dramatically higher,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.966
that depends on if there are caps in place

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:15.233
and whatever else, this rate
could grow dramatically higher.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.500
What do I mean by all of that?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.700
And what do I mean by

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.718
"What if short term interest
rates were to go up?"

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.800
When you have an adjustable rate mortgage,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.566
it usually adjusts to some index rate.

00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:31.840
In the US the most typical
one is short term Treasuries.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.833
That's the rate that the
government has to pay

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.833
when the government wants
to borrow money for a year.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.619
So one year Treasuries, although there

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.657
could be other underlying indexes.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:46.800
Another very typical index for any type

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.266
of adjustable rate loan,
not just mortgages,

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.033
but any type of loan,
even corporate loans,

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:56.033
could be the London Interbank
Offered Rate, LIBOR.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:58.238
London Interbank Offered Rate,

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.400
and we have other videos on what LIBOR is.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.666
Let's just say that we're
dealing with one year Treasuries

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.904
as the underlying index.

00:04:04.904 --> 00:04:07.366
One year Treasuries, there's
a market for Treasuries,

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.566
so that just changes with the day.

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.942
Let's say this is the plot of what happens

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.766
for one year Treasuries over time.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.755
So this is the rate, so
this means that right

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:26.266
at this period of time, if you were

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.367
to lend the government money for a year,

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:30.881
you're going to get two percent.

00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.133
The government's borrowing
rate is two percent.

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:36.133
Now, it's very unlikely that any lender

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.333
will give you the exact
same rate as the government.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.200
The government can print
money, you have the full faith

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.800
and credit of the United States.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.366
So you don't have that when you're paying,

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:49.333
you might get into financial
difficulty, you might not

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.166
be able to pay your loan for some reason.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.200
So you're not going to get that
exact rate, you're gonna get

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.400
that rate plus some premium.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.833
Let's say you have pretty good credit,

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.833
so let's say the premium
is only one percent.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.866
A premium like one
percent, that's actually

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:04.300
what even very, very well
established companies would get.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.263
This is just to make the math easy.

00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:09.009
You see that right over here, the time

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.533
that the loan was issued,
the one year treasury

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:15.000
was like one percent, and so
you're gonna get a two percent.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.833
The way that an ARM works is,

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:19.766
at some period, sometimes
it'll be every six months,

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:22.979
sometimes every year,
your rate will be reset.

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.033
So let's say we're dealing with
an adjustable rate mortgage

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:27.800
and it resets every year.

00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:37.500
So yearly adjustment in the
case that we're looking at.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.658
So that means you're
gonna pay your two percent

00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:43.533
for the first year, from time zero

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.488
to one year going by.

00:05:45.488 --> 00:05:47.966
And then at that point,
they're going to look

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:50.066
at what the underlying
index is, and it's like

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.433
"Okay, the index now looks like it's

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:54.000
"at about one point six percent."

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.866
So you're gonna pay a one
percent premium over that,

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:58.866
so you're gonna pay two point six percent.

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:02.522
So you're gonna pay two point
six percent for the next year.

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:08.863
Now short term interest
rates have gone up even more.

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:10.500
Looks like they're pretty close to three,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.000
so now you're gonna pay
four percent interest.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.133
So in this scenario where interest rates

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:20.333
have steadily gone up, your mortgage rate

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:23.333
is adjusting every year up.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:28.233
You see by at least this
third year, you are paying

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:32.450
roughly the same as if you had
gotten a fixed rate mortgage.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.411
Now you might be saying "Hey, but it's

00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.747
still been a good deal.

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.900
"I've paid for the first two years lower

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.666
"than I would have paid
on a fixed rate mortgage.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:41.500
"And then only in the third
year I'm paying the same."

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
And that's true, for this scenario,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.133
that so far has worked
out pretty well for you.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:48.533
But then in year three,
interest rates are even higher,

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.625
so it would adjust even higher.

00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:56.636
So your adjustable rate might be up here.

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:58.766
In this year you're actually paying more,

00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:02.766
your interest rate, the rate
of interest on the principle

00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:06.127
that you owe on your house, is now more

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:07.900
than your fixed rate mortgage.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.433
Then I draw a scenario
where all the sudden

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:12.817
it becomes more favorable
again, so it might adjust down.

00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:15.266
So here you're still paying
more than you would pay

00:07:15.266 --> 00:07:18.365
in your fixed rate, but then by this year,

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:22.307
you're now paying less again.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.724
This is just one of many scenarios.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:25.565
In this one you're like

00:07:25.565 --> 00:07:27.433
"Okay, you know adjustable rate mortgage,

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:30.633
"maybe this might have worked
out more years than not.

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:32.500
"I'm paying less than I would have paid

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.166
"with the fixed rate mortgage."
Lower rate I should say,

00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.700
there's only a couple of years here.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.355
But you have to remember,

00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:41.066
this is just one of
many possible scenarios.

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:44.267
Maybe inflation goes
crazy, or whatever else,

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:47.733
and maybe this index
does something like this.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:52.400
Which isn't typical, it's
not likely to happen,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.666
but things like that
have happened in history,

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.956
when you had large inflationary periods.

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:58.767
In something like this, all of a sudden

00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.400
you can see your adjustable rate mortgage

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.533
adjusting up by a good bit.

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:04.400
There's often these things called caps

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.766
in place that keep the
mortgage from adjusting

00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:09.866
more than a percent or
two percent per year.

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:13.232
But if you saw something like that,

00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:15.891
or if you saw something

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.167
that just went straight
like this, that means

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:19.248
that over the life of your loan,

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.533
especially if your loan goes
out 10 or 15 or 30 years,

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:25.633
you could end up paying a
substantial amount more interest.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:27.567
On the other hand, it's
completely possible

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:32.433
that interest rates do
this the entire time.

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:34.400
In which case, the
adjustable rate mortgage

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.166
might work out better.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.100
So you might be noticing a pattern here.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.514
With your fixed rate mortgage,
it's very predictable.

00:08:43.946 --> 00:08:47.333
You can predict this, so the
payment that you're making

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.400
from one month to the next,
even if it's interest only,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.900
whatever payment you're making,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.933
whatever interest rate,
it is not going to change.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:57.540
While the adjustable rate
mortgage it is less predictable.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.033
This brings up a very interesting idea,

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:10.000
called interest rate risk,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.633
which you might sometimes
hear people talk about

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:16.067
on the cable finance
networks and whatever else.

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:19.766
Or if you're reading the financial section

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:24.485
of the newspaper, interest rate risk.

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:27.166
This is just the risk that you take on

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.700
if interest rates were
to change dramatically.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.266
If you have an adjustable rate
mortgage, what's your risk?

00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:36.925
The interest rate risk you're taking on is

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:39.546
"What if interest goes up a lot?"

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.300
Then your payment goes up.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.833
With a fixed rate mortgage,

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:45.133
who takes on the interest rate risk?

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:47.000
With a fixed rate mortgage,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.146
the bank takes on the interest rate risk.

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.633
Let me write this down, this is an ARM,

00:09:56.633 --> 00:10:01.367
and this right over here is the fixed.

00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:11.884
Who takes on the interest
rate risk in the ARM scenario?

00:10:11.884 --> 00:10:14.366
The borrower does.

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:16.066
They might get the benefit of lower rates,

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:18.266
but if rates were to go up dramatically,

00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:21.666
the borrower takes on this risk.

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:28.142
While in the fixed rate,
who takes on the risk?

00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:31.307
In this scenario it's
going to be the lender.

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:34.000
Why is the lender taking on a risk?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.700
If they lend something to
you at a fixed interest rate,

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.733
let's say this four
percent, and if interest

00:10:39.733 --> 00:10:43.666
were to go up dramatically,
remember many lenders,

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:45.700
especially financial
institutions like banks,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.200
they are borrowing money as well.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.394
Who are they borrowing money from?

00:10:49.394 --> 00:10:52.166
They could be borrowing from
a whole bunch of sources.

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:54.633
One of them is the people
who are keeping deposits.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:56.747
Remember what a bank does.

00:10:56.747 --> 00:11:00.907
If this is the bank right over
here, people give deposits,

00:11:00.907 --> 00:11:03.166
and we go into much more
detail in other videos,

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:06.700
and then it is loaned out.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.086
When they take deposits,
they are often times

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:13.672
promising people interest

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.042
and when they issue loans

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:18.200
they're getting interest as well.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.100
This is fixed, right over here,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.925
but if short term interest
rates were to go up,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.433
then they're going to be paying
more than they're getting.

00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:31.666
Or this is not changing,
while this is going up,

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:34.867
so they're not going to
be making as much money.

00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:37.766
So the risk, adjustable rate
mortgage, borrower takes on,

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:41.633
the fixed rate, the lender takes on.
