00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; BRADY: Why do so many people hate mathematics?

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.279
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: Very good question.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.090
I think there are several reasons.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.929
The problem is multi-dimensional, no pun intended.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.520
Imagine that you had to take an art class
in which you were taught only how to paint

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.519
a fence or a wall but were never shown the
paintings of the great masters.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.310
Would that make you an art lover?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.170
Years later you will talk to your friends
and say "Oh my gosh!

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.050
I hated art at school, I was so bad at it."

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.170
What you would really be saying is "I was
bad at painting the fence."

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.059
And likewise with mathematics people often
say "Oh, I was so bad at math, I hate math."

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.289
but what they are really saying is "I was
bad at painting the fence."

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.680
So how do we make people realise that mathematics
is this incredible archipelago of knowledge?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.950
If you want your kids to understand and appreciate
the beauty and power of mathematics we have

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.809
to connect it to our daily lives.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.449
Let me give you an example.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.620
Say you go on Amazon to buy a book and you
are immediately presented with various recommendations.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.900
How does Amazon come up with these recommendations?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.920
Well, there are sophisticated algorithms at
play which analyse your past choices, which

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.350
correlates you with other users who are deemed
to have similar preferences.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.150
Then all this data is processed and you're
presented with these choices.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.700
Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily
a good thing but I think at the very least

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490
we have to be aware of this.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.710
We have to be aware of these algorithms invading
our lives, and those algorithms are based

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.710
on mathematics.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.420
&gt;&gt; Brady: You and I live in houses and we
appreciate the houses we live in, it doesn't

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.429
mean we need to know how to lay bricks.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.429
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: That's right.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.659
&gt;&gt; Brady: So why, just because we - just because
mathematics is underlying some of the technologies

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.170
in our lives, why does that mean we have to
understand it or even appreciate it?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.270
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: That's a very good point
and likewise people say "well, we fly airplanes

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.159
without necessarily understanding the, you
know, the physics of flight."

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.729
But there is a difference, and first of all
mathematics is part of our culture just like

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.220
literature and art and to have a fulfilling
life we have to be aware of this.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.620
But also, because mathematics is becoming
so important in our lives there is a lot of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.620
opportunity for misuse of mathematics and
for manipulating us by using highly sophisticated

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.620
mathematics.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.540
There are many examples of that, global economic
crisis was to a large extent caused misuse

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.319
of mathematic models.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.360
Which one could argue often were used by,
you know, executives of financial firms who

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.950
did not fully understand them.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.100
What if we lived in a world in which a, say
a Wall Street executive, would not say "Oh,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.209
I don't get this stuff but as long as it works,
it's fine."

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.631
What if in fact that person would say "OK,
tell me more about it, I would like to understand

00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:57.709
how this model works."?

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.650
There's this great quote by a great German
mathematician Georg Cantor, said "The essence

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.989
of mathematics lies in its freedom."

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.849
But, I would augment this with the following;
where there is no mathematics there is no

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.849
freedom.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.750
So mathematics is essential to our freedom,
to the function of our democracy.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.690
That's why it's not just about finding out
how some things work, which you don't need

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.240
to know about because, you know, 'who cares?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.530
As long as they work.'

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.271
I think that our ignorance can be misused
by the powers that be, and for us to be, you

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:37.220
know, the citizens in this brave new world,
we have to be more aware of mathematics.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.909
We have to know and appreciate its power to
do good, but also to do ill.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.650
&gt;&gt; Brady: The art world tells us we should
appreciate art more.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.360
An English professor will say we need our
language skills improved.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.900
Computer scientists will say we need to understand
code.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.510
The mathematicians are telling us we should
appreciate maths, well some of the math. [laugh]

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.020
We've only got these finite brains and only
so many hours on the planet, why do you bring

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.200
mathematics above the others?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.460
I know you're a bit biased.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.709
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: Well first of all I'm
a mathematician, right?

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.280
But also, I would say that art for example,
let's take art.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.142
So the situation was, people don't go to art
museums of course.

00:04:13.142 --> 00:04:16.209
We know that, not everyone goes to that, not
everyone pays attention.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.930
But at least people know that there are, there
exists museums.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.060
If you say the word art, they don't think
about painting the fence but they think about

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.130
van Gogh and Picasso and Leonardo da Vinci.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.110
So they know that at least, if they ... whenever
... if they have an interest they know where

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.500
to go, where to find those paintings.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.720
Or they can go online and find those paintings,
right?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.930
In the case of mathematics they are not even
aware of the masterpieces of great mathematicians

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.830
the way that they are aware of the existence
of masterpieces of the great artists.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.090
Art of course is important because it speaks
about our emotions and it speaks about the

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.680
world and about ourselves.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.660
But in a way, one can survive without art,
but one cannot survive without mathematics.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.490
Everything is based on mathematics; it is
the language of nature.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.810
&gt;&gt; Brady: Well, let's apportion some blame,
let's blame someone then.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.280
It sounds to me like you're blaming high school
teachers?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.610
You were saying, you know, back in our school
days they're making us paint fences instead

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.930
of showing us Picasso.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.220
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: Well, if I really were
to assign blame I would assign the blame to

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.840
myself and my colleagues.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.000
Professional mathematicians.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.699
We don't do nearly enough, exposing these
ideas to the public in an accessible way.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.440
Often times we're not willing to come up with
good metaphors and analogies and this is how

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960
science should be communicated.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.900
You have to communicate science in a way that
would, you know, in a way that's creative.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.669
That links to something people already know.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.800
And I feel as though other scientists are
doing a much better job; physicists, biologists.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.350
We keep talking about the solar system about
the universe, about galaxies, about atoms

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.870
and molecules, elementary particles and DNA.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.310
Those concepts are no more complicated than
things we do in modern mathematics.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.530
Why is it that, you know, DNA and stars and
elementary particles are part of our cultural

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.460
discourse but mathematical ideas are not?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.300
Well, in part because we are not doing nearly
enough.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.900
We professional mathematicians are not doing
nearly enough.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.870
I don't blame the teachers because, you know,
they are in the precarious, really unenviable

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.710
position often times because they are, you
know, overworked and under paid and also teachers

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.970
themselves are products of the same flawed
system.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:44.699
My solution is that, first of all, more mathematicians
should go out and let other people in on the

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.069
secret.

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.361
Because it's really almost like a secret and
we're almost like this elite which is sort

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:52.550
of keeping this secret, and I don't want that
to continue.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.990
I want everyone in on the secret.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.050
I want everyone to realise there is this beautiful
world out there, which is so important for

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.030
our daily lives, which possess the, you know,
unparalleled power and beauty.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.539
We have to convey this idea; we have to find
ways to convey those ideas.

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.639
And then, you know, we have to also work through
our education system.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:20.260
We also have to help teachers to learn the
necessary content and to learn how mathematics

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.020
connects with the real world, so that they
make the study of mathematics for students

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.529
more enjoyable, more fun, more interesting.

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:29.910
&gt;&gt; Brady: Why has that not happened?

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.070
It sounds so obvious.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.229
What you've said is not like a huge conceptual
leap.

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:35.229
Why has this not already happened?

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.050
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: What has it not already
happened?

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.470
Well sometimes I wonder myself, why has it
not already happened?

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.759
It's almost a conspiracy, I mean honestly,
it's almost like there's a system of mirrors

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:48.050
that has been created which distorts, you
know, reality.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.100
Which does not allow most people to see what
is out there.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.990
And let's face it, how many more things are
left to discover?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.340
We can't be the first to discover another
continent like Columbus; we can't be the first

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.419
to step on the moon.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.860
But what if I told you there is this beautiful
world out there and you don't even have to

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.340
travel anywhere to find it?

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.400
It's right at your fingertips.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.190
Wouldn't you want to go and find out more
about it?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.410
And if you do this in the right way you will
have children, you will have students, you

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.830
know, running to class!

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.620
Not away from the class but running to the
class, like "I want to know more.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.750
I want to find out more.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.851
I want to talk to my peers, to my classmates
about this stuff."

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:30.039
This is the coolest stuff in the world, that's
what it is.

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.070
&gt;&gt; Brady: Coolest stuff in the world?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.070
And yet, everyone hates it?

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.539
&gt;&gt; Professor Frenkel: And yet everyone hates
it.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.150
Isn't it ironic?

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.580
&gt;&gt; Brady: If you'd like to hear more from
Professor Frankel about his love of mathematics,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.700
this is his book 'Love and Math'.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.160
You can't have this one, this one's mine,
but you can get your own copy, and one of

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.390
the ways you can do that is through the sponsor
of this particular video, Audible.com.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.800
Biggest range of audio books you can image,
and one of them is this one.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.420
As you probably know by now you can go to
Audible.com/Numberphile and if you sign up

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.940
you can download a free book and it could
be this one, it'll be the book of your choice.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.360
So if you're going to check them out go to
Audible.com/Numberphile and then when it comes

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.779
time to pick your free one, Love and Math.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:16.830
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
