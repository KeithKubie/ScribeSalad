00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.070
Is the relation given by the
set of ordered pairs shown

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.930
below a function?

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.400
So before we even attempt
to do this problem,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.210
right here, let's just remind
ourselves what a relation is

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.770
and what type of relations
can be functions.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.770
So in a relation, you
have a set of numbers

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.720
that you can kind of view as
the input into the relation.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.350
We call that the domain.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.240
You can view them as
the set of numbers

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.490
over which that
relation is defined.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.920
And then you have
a set of numbers

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.620
that you can view as the
output of the relation,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.330
or what the numbers that can
be associated with anything

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.230
in domain, and we
call that the range.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.130
And it's a fairly
straightforward idea.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.360
So for example, let's say that
the number 1 is in the domain,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.240
and that we associate the
number 1 with the number 2

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.847
in the range.

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:50.430
So in this type of
notation, you would

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.340
say that the relation
has 1 comma 2

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.240
in its set of ordered pairs.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.400
These are two ways of
saying the same thing.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.730
Now the relation can also
say, hey, maybe if I have 2,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.850
maybe that is associated
with 2 as well.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.616
So 2 is also associated
with the number 2.

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:15.990
And so notice, I'm just building
a bunch of associations.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.770
I've visually drawn
them over here.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.560
Here I'm just doing
them as ordered pairs.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.540
We could say that we
have the number 3.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.720
3 is in our domain.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.330
Our relation is
defined for number 3,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.510
and 3 is associated with,
let's say, negative 7.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.020
So this is 3 and negative 7.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.720
Now this type of
relation right over here,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.330
where if you give me any
member of the domain,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.650
and I'm able to tell you exactly
which member of the range

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.200
is associated with it, this is
also referred to as a function.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.640
And in a few seconds,
I'll show you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.740
a relation that
is not a function.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.490
Because over here, you pick
any member of the domain,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.820
and the function really
is just a relation.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.090
It's really just an
association, sometimes called

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.730
a mapping between
members of the domain

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.360
and particular
members of the range.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.026
So you give me any
member of the domain,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.150
I'll tell you exactly which
member of the range it maps to.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.590
You give me 1, I say, hey,
it definitely maps it to 2.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.980
You give me 2, it definitely
maps to 2 as well.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.460
You give me 3, it's definitely
associated with negative 7

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.200
as well.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.330
So this relation is both a--
it's obviously a relation--

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.007
but it is also a function.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.090
Now to show you a relation
that is not a function,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.700
imagine something like this.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.760
So once again, I'll
draw a domain over here,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.790
and I do this big, fuzzy
cloud-looking thing

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.710
to show you that I'm not
showing you all of the things

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.293
in the domain.

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:37.190
I'm just picking
specific examples.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.840
And let's say that this big,
fuzzy cloud-looking thing

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.760
is the range.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.060
And let's say in this
relation-- and I'll

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.940
build it the same way that
we built it over here-- let's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.440
say in this relation,
1 is associated with 2.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.490
So let's build the
set of ordered pairs.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.890
So 1 is associated with 2.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.420
Let's say that 2
is associated with,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.250
let's say that 2 is
associated with negative 3.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.270
So you'd have 2,
negative 3 over there.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.970
And let's say on top of
that, we also associate,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.390
we also associate 1
with the number 4.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.490
So we also created
an association with 1

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.960
with the number 4.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.860
So we have the ordered
pair 1 comma 4.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.400
Now this is a relationship.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.576
We have, it's defined
for a certain--

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:26.950
if this was a
whole relationship,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.940
then the entire domain is
just the numbers 1, 2--

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.100
actually just the
numbers 1 and 2.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.797
It's definitely a relation, but
this is no longer a function.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.630
And the reason why it's
no longer a function

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.160
is, if you tell me,
OK I'm giving you 1

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.027
in the domain, what member of
the range is 1 associated with?

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:45.610
Over here, you say, well I don't
know, is 1 associated with 2,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.870
or is it associated with 4?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.570
It could be either one.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.430
So you don't have a
clear association.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.430
If I give you 1 here,
you're like, I don't know,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.470
do I hand you a 2 or 4?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.914
That's not what a function does.

00:03:54.914 --> 00:03:56.580
A function says, oh,
if you give me a 1,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.180
I know I'm giving you a 2.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.930
If you give me 2, I
know I'm giving you 2.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.763
Now with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:04:01.763 --> 00:04:03.941
try to tackle the
problem right over here.

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:05.940
So let's think about its
domain, and let's think

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.240
about its range.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.920
So the domain here,
the possible, you

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.190
can view them as x
values or inputs,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.960
into this thing that could be
a function, that's definitely

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.279
a relation, you could
have a negative 3.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.250
You could have a negative 2.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.210
You could have a 0.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.650
You could have a, well, we
already listed a negative 2,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.000
so that's right over there.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.510
Or you could have a positive 3.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.910
Those are the possible values
that this relation is defined

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.960
for, that you could
input into this relation

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.920
and figure out what it outputs.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.150
Now the range here, these
are the possible outputs

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.650
or the numbers
that are associated

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.260
with the numbers in the domain.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:56.230
The range includes 2, 4,
5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 8.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.300
2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.277
I could have drawn this
with a big cloud like this,

00:05:00.277 --> 00:05:02.360
and I could have done this
with a cloud like this,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.060
but here we're showing
the exact numbers

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.490
in the domain and the range.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.880
And now let's draw the
actual associations.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.120
So negative 3 is associated
with 2, or it's mapped to 2.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.630
So negative 3 maps
to 2 based on this

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.360
ordered pair right over there.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.030
Then we have negative
2 is associated with 4.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.990
So negative 2 is
associated with 4

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.015
based on this ordered
pair right over there.

00:05:25.015 --> 00:05:26.390
Actually that
first ordered pair,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.670
let me-- that
first ordered pair,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.450
I don't want to
get you confused.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.770
It should just be this
ordered pair right over here.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.260
Negative 3 is associated with 2.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.870
Then we have negative 2-- we'll
do that in a different color--

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.990
we have negative 2
is associated with 4.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.090
Negative 2 is associated with 4.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.060
We have 0 is associated with 5.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.260
0 is associated with 5.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.600
Or sometimes people
say, it's mapped to 5.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.050
We have negative
2 is mapped to 6.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.050
Now this is interesting.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.830
Negative 2 is already
mapped to something.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.070
Now this ordered pair is
saying it's also mapped to 6.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.521
And then finally--
I'll do this in a color

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:07.770
that I haven't used yet,
although I've used almost all

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.830
of them-- we have
3 is mapped to 8.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.000
3 is mapped to 8.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.170
So the question here,
is this a function?

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.850
And for it to be a function
for any member of the domain,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.180
you have to know what
it's going to map to.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.210
It can only map to one
member of the range.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.580
So negative 3, if you put
negative 3 as the input

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.160
into the function, you know
it's going to output 2.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.800
If you put negative 2 into
the input of the function,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.340
all of a sudden
you get confused.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.680
Do I output 4, or do I output 6?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.740
So you don't know if you
output 4 or you output 6.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.780
And because there's
this confusion,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.380
this is not a function.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.430
You have a member
of the domain that

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.180
maps to multiple
members of the range.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.700
So this right over here is not
a function, not a function.
