00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.730
I think that there's
an element in which

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.110
the artist and the lover in love
share similar characteristics

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.570
and dispositions.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.230
There is a willingness
to surrender.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.430
There is a willingness to
give one's self to some higher

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.170
meanings.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.200
There is something to be said
for a different kind of truth,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.190
for subjectivity, for
the truth as it plays out

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.900
in your own head.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.890
I mean, science
has been phenomenal

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.110
at empirical investigations,
at deconstructing the world

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.780
into little bits and pieces and
isolating the properties that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.110
constitute reality.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.605
That is all wonderful.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.880
But as Werner Herzog says,
there's another kind of truth.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.480
It is ecstatic truth.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.390
It's a risk.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.920
The artist has to
take that risk.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.230
He has to put himself in
that state of heightened

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.130
vulnerability.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.200
He has to disarm himself.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.630
Freeman Dyson talks
about a new age of wonder

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.820
in which literally a new
generation of artists

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.670
will be writing genomes
with the fluency

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.400
that Blake and
Byron wrote verses.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.510
How might these
technological instruments

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.150
empower the artist,
empower the imagination?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.045
We try to smash our
sense of separateness

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:23.060
in temples of fragmentation in
a form of electronic Buddhism,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.660
with throbbing bass beats
temporarily dissolving the self

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.880
and allowing us to
merge with the other.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.570
When we have sex,
like Kama Sutra,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.775
people talk about
blending into one another,

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.205
becoming one another,
entering the subjective head

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:36.860
space of the other.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.230
This is a wonderful idea.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.840
It reflects Richard Holmes's
book, The Age of Wonder,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.460
where he talks about
the 17th century

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.010
where the artist
and the scientist

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.985
were friends, where the
astronomers were poets.

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:47.610
And then he talked
about the importance

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.050
of sort of interpretation,
subjective experience.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.060
Although people in many
ways are afraid of that,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.609
they're afraid of letting go of
their individuated self, when

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.650
you pop out the other
side, it was the best thing

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.886
you ever did, ultimately.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.260
Those things we
fear the most end

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.337
up being the greatest therapies.

00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:04.670
Life really does begin at the
edge of your comfort zone,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.870
to take that leap, fall
in love, or die trying.
