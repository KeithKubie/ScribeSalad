00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.279
It's nice hey guys I am Nate I'm here back at the dome, and I am Zach from the YouTube channel  Jerry rigs everything

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.950
We've got another fun experiment that we're gonna be trying out today

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.559
We are going to melt down some aluminum until it's nice and molten hot and then we are going to pour it down

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.660
Inside this block of clear ice what do you think's gonna happen? Well I know what I think is gonna happen

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.460
I think the whole thing's gonna explode

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
But either way hopefully we get a cool design out of the aluminum once. It's cooled down again

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
I think the aluminum pouring into the block of ice might heat up the water so much that it expands and a steam just shreds

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
The block apart, it's possible that there won't be enough power to break the block

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
But instead it will shoot the aluminum out the top of the block and that would be pretty cool

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.620
Or the aluminum might just settle inside the ice melting its way and cooling down at the same time and give us some strange

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.160
Formation, I don't know which of those is gonna happen or something else entirely

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.730
But let's find out so this right here is our pouring device by pulling the pink string. It causes this to tip and

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.048
Once that's full of its molten aluminum that should pour down right into the ice

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.429
We've got some aluminum cables that are wrapped up into bundles and these will be melted intrusive

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.100
Three two one

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.320
LAUGHTER

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.220
That was amazing holy oh!

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.720
(AND IT EXPLODED!!!!!!!!!)

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.620
holy cow

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.120
My gosh that was beautiful, haha

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.860
MORE LAUGHTER

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.419
Yes, I didn't think it was going to you because I saw it pouring in and I thought oh

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.429
It's just gonna settle down inside there

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.750
That's cool

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.500
But it's not asked and right about I was thinking that's not as cool as if it exploded it exploded in a huge way

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.880
look at this like the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.100
Explosion is probably what 10 feet out at least there's little ice at least Everywhere.That was cool

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840
That was obliterated

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.829
Man

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.829
That was as good as I could have possibly hoped for oh well my binder. Clip is like aluminum

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.570
welded to our I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.570
Can't get it off

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.430
(ICE SIZZLES ON HOT CRUCIBLE)

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430
Oh

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.408
My gosh exactly what I wanted to have happen

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.730
Seriously

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.730
Man look at these shards

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.489
Just shattered pieces

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.908
It's like broken glass, too

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.849
That's really what it looks like I'll give you take it like a coke bottle or something yeah

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.539
And I think it's partly just because we're not used to seeing ice

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.269
That's so cohesive like these clear blocks of ice

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.349
They don't have the the brake lines that you would get if you had ice

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.589
It's full of air bubbles and so just really seeing ice breaking this crystalline shapes is pretty different

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.849
The outside of this cup so it poured in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.169
At that angle and then the the aluminum exploding just completely coated this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.530
Better coat at the bottom of this to a little bit

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.519
Let that cool down and melt its way through a block at the same time

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.108
That was amazing that was seriously one of the coolest effects. We've ever had happen on this show the explosion alone was

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.189
That thing just shattered into a trillion tiny little pieces and sent shards of ice flying really hard

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.388
I think we had some go almost 20 25 feet away, and it was loud

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.359
Really really loud. It's like the initial as we were pouring it in. I was like oh alright. That's all it's gonna happen

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.159
We're you know a little cube of aluminum that is all dry, but then BOOM

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.459
So blood projects like this are always great

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.048
And we've been doing so how long is the king of random it doing? It's been about seven years now

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.049
Yeah, I started my youtube channel about six years ago

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.090
and it's been great being able to turn my hobby into a career and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.330
Luckily the king of random and I grant Thompson

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.120
And I have we're gonna get together with a bunch of other large youtubers and talk about how to form your hobbies on

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.760
YouTube and online into a career

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.179
It's a seminar called self-made and we'll leave a link in the video description

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.770
Where you can sign up to come and listen to us? Whether it's online or in person and establish your business online?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.549
