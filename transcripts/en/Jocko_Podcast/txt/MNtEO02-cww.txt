Speaker 1:          00:00          Make your luck. Yeah, you gotta make your luck. And if you make it, if you keep, if you keep putting forth the maximal effort that luck's gonna come, you're gonna make your luck happen. You know that, you know that actually when we, when we came, when tasking a bruiser came home from Iraq, there was, there was, you know, people were like, oh you guys got super lucky on that deployment because we got a lot of action. Right. And there was two like immediate thoughts behind that was number one like, hey, you know, first of all we lost our bros. Like there nothing lucky about that was the first immediate thought in my head was like, hey man, like cause cause the bottom line is seals want to go into combat bad. And that's just a broad statement. And so when we came home, had been in a lot of combat and killed a lot of bad guys and people were kind of saying, Hey, you guys got lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And, and again, the first thought was, hey man, you did. If this is luck, I don't want it. The second thought was just like the same thing. Like, oh, we got lucky. We didn't like crush ourselves into workup and try and be the most, you know, prepared we could be and then get overseas and form relationships with all the conventional forces and do good work for them and continue to w you know, just get, go as hard as we could the whole time. No, that didn't have anything to do with. It was just luck and it kind of fell into our lap. But you know, of course, just nod your head and say thanks man. Appreciate it. Yeah, good times. Uh, so luck is definitely a part of it. A little part because where was I lucky to be in Ramadi? Cause I could have deployed a year later and a year later Ramadi was pacified.

Speaker 1:          01:43          So is there a lock there? There absolutely is. So, I don't want to sound arrogant, but luck is a part, it's like foot locks. It's like heel hooks. They're a part of the game. They're not a game changer. They're a part of the game. They're not a game changer. We, we had a group come in, and this is back in the day, a group came in, a guys that we're known for foot locking and heel hook and what they did, they thought we were Jujitsu guys, normal [inaudible] guys, but we weren't because we were dean, right? So we were foot locker and heel hugging all the time and these guys came in and immediately they were going for, these are the kind of guys that would go and I don't know if you, I don't know if you remembered this time period in Jujitsu, it was like immediate.

Speaker 1:          02:30          They're going for a full lock, like just diving for it. But they didn't know that we did for the longest all the time. And you weren't going to just grab a full lock on Dean lister or me like that. There's wasn't going to happen. And it kind of Inventables also, they didn't have the rest of Jujitsu. You have the rest of the game. So then it was not good for them because they only had this one dimensional game. And that's what taught me that foot locks aren't important, but they're not more important than a choke or a guard pass. They are definitely part of game. You can't leave out, but they're not a game changer. And you see that now, now that you see everyone broadly getting good at at the whole leg, locking foot, locking heel looking game. Now you see it coming back around where you have to have the rest of Jujitsu as well. Even though even as much as like a year ago, it was like, oh, this guy got this crazy heel hook and the guy tapped and you didn't know what was happening. That very rapidly changes into, okay, the guy went for a heel hook, the other guy got out. Now we've got to, where are we back to? We're back to the Jujitsu, so same thing. Luck is a factor. It's not the factor. Yeah.
