00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.560
Okay so here I am inside DevTools for our page.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.820
And I've got the div selected that has our name and title.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.980
It looks like we're in the right place but let's go ahead and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.040
check Bootstrap's documentation, to figure out which classes we need.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.920
I found this section about alignment classes in the CSS documentation.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.490
It looks like we just need to add text-right to get Right aligned text.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.070
Let's go ahead and try that out.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.380
I'm back in DevTools.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.940
And I will, double-click on the class to open it up.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.230
I'll type in text-right, and press Enter.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.800
And we see that our name and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.190
title immediately pop to the right side of the screen.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.590
So it looks like we're on the right track.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.170
Let's see if we can get it capitalized.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.170
Right underneath alignment,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.660
we see transformation classes, including Uppercased text.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.970
All we need to do is add the class text-uppercase.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.738
Let's see if it works.

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:55.460
So now we have text-right and text-uppercase and I'll press Enter, and voila!

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.400
We have capitalized text that is aligned on the right.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.960
So for right-align text, we just need text-right.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.590
And to make text uppercase we simply add text-uppercase.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.200
It worked for us when we added these classes to class equals col-md-6, but

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.440
in fact you could also add it to the h1 and h3 tags.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.150
While adding it to h1 and h3 would work,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.830
it's actually a lot cleaner when you add it to the div containing them.
