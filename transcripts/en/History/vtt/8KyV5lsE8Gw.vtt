MAN: Hey, how's it going?

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.330
MARK: Hey man, I've got
a coin I'd like to sell.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.210
OK.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.500
An 1867 Shield nickel.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.710
This is cool.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.380
Where in the world
did you get this?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.170
MARK: I've had it
for maybe 15 years.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.040
OK, and you had it graded
and everything else like that?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.170
MARK: Yeah.
This is an extremely rare piece.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.120
MAN: OK.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.040
This is really intriguing.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.380
MARK: I came to the pawn
shop today to sell a very

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.920
rare 1967 Proof Shield nickel.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.750
It's the finest one ever
graded and has huge eye appeal.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to sell this coin
because I can use the money

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.380
and invest it in other things.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.330
MAN: I mean, this
is really neat.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.040
This was just a
practical choice.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.580
I mean, half dimes
were expensive,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.170
they were made out of silver.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.330
This was a nickel alloy
that would last a long time.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.380
It wouldn't wear out and
everything else like that.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.670
It's a very cool nickel.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.170
There's only 25 made.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.880
MAN: That's pretty amazing.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.710
What makes this
nickel so special

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.250
is that it's a proof coin.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
That means there was a
polished blank coin that was

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.580
put into the minting machine.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.420
They made sure it
was a perfect coin.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.250
Proof coins from the 1800s
are a rare, rare thing.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.250
It could be worth
some serious money.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.580
Basically what
they did is the US

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.920
Mint would make a proof copy.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.460
Because all these coins
had to get approved.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.120
They would make the
proofs, they would

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.540
show them around to congressmen,
they would say yes or no.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
MARK: This proof coin
was actual production.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.620
And they stopped the
production of this coin

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.250
because the coin has
stars and bars on it.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.420
And the reason they stopped
that is because the North

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.380
didn't like the fact
that stars and bars

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080
signify the Confederacy.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
So they only made
this for one month

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.710
then they stopped making it.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.620
MAN: OK, so how much are we
looking to get out of it?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.290
$90,000.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.250
OK, let me--

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.960
you know, I know it's
worth a lot of money.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.580
I don't know what they're
going for at the moment.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.330
So do you mind if I have
someone take a look at it?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.920
MARK: Yeah.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.120
Let me call a buddy of mine.
I'll tell him about it.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960
He'll help us
figure out a price.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.670
I'll be right back.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.080
Thanks.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080
I think that having
an expert is very good

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.750
to call in and authenticate.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.250
I have nothing to hide.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.290
I hope he looks at it,
because he's going to say

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.920
the same thing I've said.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.330
These things rarely
come to the market.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.250
So I called in my buddy Dave
to help me figure out a price.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.080
There it is.
This is what I called you about.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.960
DAVID VAGI: Yeah.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a fantastic coin.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.290
Wow.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.290
MARK: I love the
toning on it, you know.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.580
DAVID VAGI: Perfect.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.170
Well, this is one of
the great rarities

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.500
in the American series.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.330
It's kind of on
everyone's checklist

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.960
who wants something like the 100
greatest United States coins.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.000
It's a historical
coin, struck right

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.750
after the Civil War
had ended, right

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.670
when they were trying to drive
that fractional currency, that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.670
paper money out of the market.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.170
It's a very handsome coin.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.710
DAVID VAGI: The 1867
Shield nickels with rays

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.000
is really the king
of the whole series.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.210
It's like the big
fish in a little pond.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.290
It's the Shield nickel
that everyone who collects

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960
Shield nickels wants to own.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.620
MARK: I've had it in the
family for a long time.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.880
It's a great one.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.960
With the the wreaths
and the garlands,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.710
the whole thing is quite nice.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.000
Yeah.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.540
And it has a very
interesting story.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.460
As these things are struck,
it forces the metal from

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.710
the planchet into the crevices.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.500
If you have a lot of crevices,
it really stresses the dies.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.670
So this is a very
busy design, and it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.960
created a lot of problems.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.790
But because it
has rays, it makes

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.500
it significantly rarer
than similar ones from 1867

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.170
without rays.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.420
And nobody knows how many
of these things were struck.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.580
OK.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.750
MAN: And when they
graded it, they

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.830
gave it a star,
which means it's got

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.210
really good eye appeal, right?

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.080
DAVID VAGI: It means
exceptional eye appeal.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.210
So what do you
think it's worth?

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.750
DAVID VAGI: These have
brought in a range of prices

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.210
from about $63,000 to--

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.330
there was one outlier
that brought $80,000.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.750
MARK: We have our
opinion of values,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.920
it's slightly
different than yours.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
OK.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.080
Thanks man, appreciate it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.670
DAVID VAGI: All
right, no problem.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.210
Thanks.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.880
Appreciate it, you've
got good knowledge, thanks.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.170
Thank you.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.580
A coin like this is
always in demand.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.250
It's somewhat of a narrow
market because it's

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.670
a specialist market.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.080
So a coin like this
usually finds a home.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.120
And I think if Rick can
get it for the right price,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.580
it's a good buy.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.750
MAN: So what's your
best price on it?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.250
I told you $90,000.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.960
I-- yeah, I mean, I'm
looking at like 50 grand.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.620
I couldn't take that.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.290
I mean, that would be throwing
$20,000 away in a heartbeat.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.790
Like Dave said,
it's a $63,000 coin.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.210
MARK: This is probably
the nicest one around.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.920
MAN: Recently sold for
$63,000 at auction.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.210
So that's what I'm
going to assume it's

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.290
going to sell for here, so--

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.460
Bottom line $80,000.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.420
That's not going to happen.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.460
Sorry, we're not
going to make a deal.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.460
Well, have a nice day, man.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.750
Thank you, appreciate it.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.120
No problem.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.540
MARK: They offered me
$50,000 for the coin.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.250
You'd have to be totally
on the desert with no water

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.750
in order to take that offer.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.170
He could have had
it for $80,000 when

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.830
it's getting to go for
$120,000 or $125,000

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.830
in the next few months probably.
