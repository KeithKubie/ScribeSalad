John: The economic crisis is becoming such
a crisis of actions now not taken, for employment

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.510
and the creation of equality in employment
the center of the agenda on economic policy

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.320
internationally.
In short that means government need to focus

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.750
on ensuring that the recovery translates more
quickly into employment creation.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.461
We have to make sure that the model of economic
growth coming out of this crisis is more balanced,

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:30.580
more balanced between labor and capital, between
rich and poor, and between different regions

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.710
of the world like in the past.
That means also a focus on equality of employment,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.390
creating decent work and reducing the income
gaps and inequality

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.129
Those are the challenges in which to avoid
a major social crisis down the road coming

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.969
out of this economic and financial crisis.
