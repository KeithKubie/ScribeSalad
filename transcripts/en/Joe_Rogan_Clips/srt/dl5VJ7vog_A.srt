1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,300
The Joe Rogan experience of,
you know,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,810
occasionally I'll have my lungs
checked and they tell me they're great.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,610
Isn't that amazing? It's crazy, you
know, because I think if you keep active,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,000
you know, like you train and, and, and uh,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,930
a lot of us train now I go this
generation, they're not like lazy stoners.

6
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:23,700
They don't just sit back and do nothing.
There still are those. But you know,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,020
I don't think it has the, the
same carcinogens is, you know,

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,520
people expect it, you know, like a
cigarette. It does. And so, you know,

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,010
you might look at someone's lungs who,
who,

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,700
who smoked cigarettes and you might
see something there and like, hey,

11
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,570
you need to, you know, slow the
fuck down over here. But in,

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,330
in every time that I've had my lungs
checked or whatever, for whatever,

13
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,050
whether I've, you know, gotten
sick or whatever, they're,

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,540
they're always telling me lungs,
they're in good shape.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,380
And it's a funny thing
because, you know, in they can,

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,380
1987,
you know,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,700
I was 17 and I was gang banging,
I got shot.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,760
And you know that I got hit by a
22 in it as hollow points do it.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,350
Um, it, it broke into three, three pieces.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,120
The hollow point in one of them
punctured my lung on my left side.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,770
And uh, you know, they were telling me,
uh, well you know, um, do you smoke?

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,670
No, I don't really smoke cause
I didn't smoke cigarettes.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,700
I smoked weed but I wasn't going to
divulge that at the time I was 17 and you

24
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,550
know, and uh, they said, well you know,

25
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:37,650
well that's good because
you'll never smoke again.

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,920
It's like they punctured
your lung and Blah Blah Blah.

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,750
They thought I was going to have to
work off one lung but in the three days,

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,080
you know,

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,040
they were able to get the blood out of
the lung and I was able to get it back,

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,190
you know, through the exercises
they told me, you know,

31
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,870
to get it back to its regular size and
I've never had a problem since then.

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,410
Knock on the piece of metal out.
No, I still got the three pieces.

33
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,290
That's like when I go do my physicals
and they do the, you know, the,

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,980
the Mris and the x rays and all
that. The doctors, you know,

35
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:12,380
sometimes they forget because they see
so many patients. Is Mr Freeze, um,

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,440
these appeared to be bullet fragments.
What,

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,120
what is that? Well, you just
said it doctor bullet Fred,

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,650
you've seen him a dozen
times, you know, and uh,

39
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,160
yeah I was very lucky. I was
very lucky because, you know,

40
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,100
punctured my lung and then two of
the pieces, one was by the heart,

41
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,390
one was by my spine,

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
but I was at a Martin Luther King
Hospital in Linwood and we call that place

43
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,650
killer king because you go in there for
something small and ended up dying or

44
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,070
come out, you know, gift out
or something. So you know,

45
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:52,071
I wasn't going to allow them to try and
get to those bullets or those fragments

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,230
to open you up. Yeah. No,
no, no, no. Cause you know,

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,050
they didn't have a great success rate.

48
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,150
What kind of lung exercise they
give you try to pump your lens bag.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,560
They give you this breathing apparatus
that has like a ball in it, right?

50
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,880
And it has two lines and you know this,
it's the first line you're trying to,

51
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,650
they're telling you every day for five
minutes to 10 minutes to blow that,

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,490
you know,

53
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,260
not all in one shot but like to keep
practicing getting the ball up there and

54
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,050
that will then help inflate
the lung and get it back.

55
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,190
So I had to do that for probably
like three weeks. And uh,

56
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,620
you know, the puncture wound, it
healed itself pretty much. And uh,

57
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,540
and the pieces are still in your lung?
Not In the lung? No, it went passed along.

58
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,460
It, that shot passed along.
So you know, it's uh,

59
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,530
I got a piece up here and one
off to the side in the back.

60
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,640
Well when it's really cold due
to the, the, the nerve damage,

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,650
I'll get like stinging like you know, like
when your, when your hand falls asleep,

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,190
the little needles that
I'll get that here and then,

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,600
and then back here where it entered,
they had,

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,710
they had to cut right in between a rib
here to stick the tube in to put the hose

65
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:10,330
into the lung to get the blood out of
the lung. Dang. Yeah. Uh, as you know,

66
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,510
I was living crazy before
I got into the music.

67
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,650
The music saved my life
pretty much. Really? Yeah. How
long were you gang bang for?

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,860
Ooh, for, for some years. You know,
I started, I started young. Um,

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,080
I was probably 13 years old.
Whoa Gang Bang. And then,

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,200
and uh, I got out of it probably,
I didn't necessarily get out,

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,240
but I changed up what I was doing cause
you don't ever really get out per se

72
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,330
unless they jump you out and you know,

73
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,830
I was too into it to be
jumped out like that.

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,460
You know what I mean? That
wasn't something I was going
to do because, you know,

75
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,420
for as negative as it was,
it taught me a lot. Um,

76
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,460
so my, my boys that I, you know, ran with,

77
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,190
they understood I was trying to
do something different. You know,

78
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,220
I made a choice to try the music and
leave that shit alone because there,

79
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,630
there was no way that you do both.
If you do both,

80
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:12,400
do you see the results of that?
What's happening today with a lot of cats?

81
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,920
You know what I mean?
That they try to ride the line,

82
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:16,570
be professional and be in the music,

83
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,380
but they're still kind of in this
world over here. And when it bleeds in,

84
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,300
one bleeds into the other, it, you know,
it fucks everything up, you know? And, uh,

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,520
so I chose,
you know,

86
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,390
I was going to do music and just talk
about those life experiences and whatnot.

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,310
And that was probably it.

88
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,580
I'm 18 that a,

89
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:41,230
I started taking on the music and uh,
that's, that's where it went. You know,

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,750
like when you said you learned a lot
from it, like what did you learn from it?

91
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,800
Well, you know, your
street, you know, there's,

92
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,570
there's common sense and then
there's common sense on the streets.

93
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,960
And then there's being aware
and looking out and you know,

94
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,100
not being a doormat and, uh, just,

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,800
it's a whole different type of schooling
when you're gang banging, you know,

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,340
that's the way you, uh, carry yourself,

97
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,260
the way you communicate with someone and
know whether they're disrespecting you

98
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:13,580
or not and how you deal with that
disrespect, which is, you know,

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,420
a whole different world in the
gang bang shit. But it's a,

100
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,160
it's a different kind of education. You
know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't take it back.

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
Some of the things I would,
you know,

102
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,620
I definitely regretted while I
was doing it for sure. But, um,

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,870
it made me see things from a different
perspective, you know, and, and why,

104
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,850
you know, things are the way they are
in gangs and stuff like that from lack,

105
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,440
lack of opportunities, you know, for,
for these kids to be doing something,

106
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,590
you know, cause not everybody's
good at sports, you know,

107
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,591
but there has to be other opportunities
other than other than that to get kids

108
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:55,460
interested in doing something else
because falling into the gangs, it's,

109
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,220
it's easy if you don't have
a good home life at home.

110
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,190
The guys on the street are your second
family and they eventually become your

111
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,270
first family. You know what I mean? And
if you don't have a father figure at home,

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,140
one of the guys in the gang,
you know, becomes your mentor,

113
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:16,790
he could become like the guy you look up
to as like your father figure. You know,

114
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,390
there's that. And then, you know, again,

115
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,400
there's not enough programs out there
to keep people into doing something

116
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:29,090
different than falling into that. And
then sometimes, you know, it just,

117
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,690
it's a matter of, you know, you
growing up in this neighborhood,

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,230
if you have to walk down that street
and they approach you and say, Hey,

119
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,590
you live in this hood, you got
to be with us. If you don't,

120
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,760
we're going to make it hard for you.

121
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,230
So there's that peer pressure and
then there's the legacy shit. Like,

122
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,890
so if my father was a gangster in
this gang and he still lives in this

123
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,903
neighborhood,

124
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,250
pressure's on for me eventually
to take up where father left off,

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,120
you know? And uh, it's,
it's all those things.

126
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:03,440
And then some people just start thrill
seekers and they choose and have nothing

127
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,220
in common with none of that.
They just choose it for some people too.

128
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,440
It's so appealing to have
somewhere that you belong right in.

129
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,363
And that's the thing,

130
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,470
because if you don't feel like you
belong in your school or you don't belong

131
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,410
with your,
in your family and that,

132
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,880
that she can totally take hold
in, you end up there. You know,

133
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:27,080
fortunately, I had good friends
that weren't gang bangers. You know,

134
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:31,610
that they had talent for music, which is
mugs and sin, and sends brother Mellow.

135
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,540
You know, they were, you know, I
did music as a hobby, you know,

136
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,160
before I got into gangs.

137
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:42,161
And they got me back into
the music because they
recognized something in me and

138
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,310
said, hey, we want you to come back where
we got these opportunities over here.

139
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,180
Come join us.

140
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,620
[inaudible].
