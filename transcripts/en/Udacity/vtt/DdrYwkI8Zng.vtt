00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:03.107
So in the full dataset there were 23 launches

00:00:03.213 --> 00:00:05.098
and many of which had no failures.

00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:08.121
The sum of Xi was 1,600,

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:10.928
sum of Yi is 9 as before.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.043
The Xi square is 112,400

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:17.912
and the crossover here is 574.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:20.042
Now this is all extracted from the data,

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:21.649
we have done it before,

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:23.823
and now please calculate for me b.

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:25.970
So this is some work

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.208
but please calculate for me b again

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:29.708
and here is the formula

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:30.353
as before.
