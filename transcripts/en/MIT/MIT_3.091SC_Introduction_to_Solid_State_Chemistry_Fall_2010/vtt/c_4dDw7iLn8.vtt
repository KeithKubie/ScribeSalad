00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.500
PROFESSOR: OK, a couple
of announcements.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Tomorrow will be the Periodic
Table test. I provide the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.430
numbers, you provide
the letters.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.430
Friday, the contest
ends, 5:00 pm.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440
Get the submissions to me,
either over the internet or if

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.960
you have something majestic,
you have to cart it in with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.080
the riggers.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.330
Get it to my office.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.600
Last day, we had a lesson
on the Aufbau principle.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.080
And the Aufbau principle
gave us the--

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.280
There's still too
much talking.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.270
Still too much talking.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.830
I will tolerate zero,
zero talking.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.990
When you walk through that door,
I'm assuming it's an act

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.790
of free will.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.080
And when you walk through
that door, we

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.520
enter into a contract.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.440
The contract goes something like
this: You have certain

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.250
expectations of me.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.040
You expect me to come
to class prepared.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.080
You expect me to treat you
with respect, not to use

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.900
vulgar language, not to say
things that are insulting,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.140
insensitive.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.620
And I have certain expectations
of you.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.670
I expect you to come
to class prepared.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.480
I expect that you've
done the reading.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.820
And I expect that you're
going to sit quietly.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.990
Absolutely quietly.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.510
Because it's my duty to preserve
a fertile learning

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.120
environment.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.110
If you don't want to learn,
I don't care.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.670
I don't care.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.570
But if you impair the ability
of your neighbor to learn, I

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.830
will take action.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.120
It's very simple.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.370
Very simple.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.410
Where was I?

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.110
I think I was talking about
the Aufbau principle.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.050
And the Aufbau principle tells
us what the filling sequence

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.710
of electrons is in a
multielectron atom, which

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.420
ultimately we rationalized in
terms of the four quantum

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.540
numbers and the filling in
ascending order of energy.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.850
And then we tried to understand
what's behind the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.040
Aufbau principle.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.280
And lastly, we took a journey
through central Europe in the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.130
1920s and 1930s.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.330
And we met de Broglie,
who gave us the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.040
concept of matter waves.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.630
If matter has wave-like
properties, the wavelength

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.870
would be given by the ratio of
the Planck constant to the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.160
Newtonian momentum.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.660
Heisenberg taught us that we
can't deal with precision down

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.150
to atomic dimensions, and
there's a certain degree of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.420
uncertainty or indeterminacy.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.650
And it's given by this
relationship here.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.540
And then, lastly, we saw
Schroedinger, who wrote the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.440
wave equation saying that if we
have wave-like properties

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.210
then let's model the atom as
a wave, and he gave us this

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.880
equation here, which is
essentially the equation of

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.172
the simple harmonic
oscillator.

00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:24.370
The simple harmonic oscillator,
which allows you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.630
to tell us what's going on
with the plucked string.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.670
And it's essentially just this,
the double derivative x

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.670
double dot plus kx goes
to some function.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.610
And the solution of that is a
bunch of sines and cosines.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.910
And that's this equation, but
dressed up for night-time.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.040
It's a little bit more
sophisticated and gives us the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.890
three dimensions, eigenfunctions
that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.650
ultimately, we can take and
generate the pretty pictures

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.020
of the orbitals.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.020
So, today what I want to do is
go a little more deeply into

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.750
properties.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.180
And if you learn nothing else
from me in 3.091, this is what

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.750
I want you to retain.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.170
It's that electronic structure
dictates properties.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.290
Electronic structure dictates
properties.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.570
You know this on
your death bed.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.730
It's that simple.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.730
Electronic structure dictates
properties.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.640
Then we're going to take 14
weeks and describe electronic

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.110
structure, right?

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.500
But that's it.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.940
That's it.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.290
So I want to go back to this.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.380
We got into this energy, Aufbau
principle because we

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.060
saw on the Periodic Table
there's some problems here.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.180
If we just go in terms of
quantum numbers, we see

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.710
there's two elements in
n equals 1 shell.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.300
There's 8 elements in
n equals 2 shell.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.440
And, if we just kept going,
we would expect to find 18

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.850
elements in n equals 3 shell,
but instead we found only 8.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.130
And that's where the
journey began.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.060
Well, there's a way to sort of
help remember what the filling

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.260
sequence is.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.560
And that rule is encapsulated by
the n plus l relationship.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.870
So for equivalent, n plus l
values, for equivalent n plus

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.900
l values, you fill
in ascending n.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.730
Fill in ascending n.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.580
So let's take a look.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.630
So, here's Aufbau.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.760
n plus l rule.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.240
Here's an example where
we have 3d.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.020
d means l equals 2.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.860
p means l equals 1. s
means l equals 0.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.470
So 5 plus 0 is 5.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.610
4 plus 1 is 5.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.090
3 plus 2 is 5.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.010
So what do I do?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.200
Well, it's saying go in order
of ascending n plus l.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.740
And so, you can snake your way
through this n plus l, and get

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.500
the filling sequence for the
whole Periodic Table.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500
So let's take a look.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.690
We'll start with 1s.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.980
Well, that's easy.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.610
That's hydrogen and helium.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.650
Then we go next to 2s.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.330
There's lithium and beryllium.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.870
And then next goes 2p.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.860
I mean, nobody's going to try
to stick 3s ahead of 2p.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.700
That's pretty straightforward.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.020
2p, and that gets us all
the way over to neon.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.350
And then we wrap around
over here to 3s.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.370
That gets us from sodium
to magnesium.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.950
And then we jump to
3p, gets us from

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.680
aluminum over to argon.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.850
And then, we don't go to 3d,
because 3p is 3 plus 1 is 4.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.160
4s is 4 plus 0 is 4.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.950
So it says we fill
in ascending n.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.550
So we go to 4s next.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.990
And that gets us potassium
and calcium.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.550
Then comes 3d.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.640
So that gets us scandium over
to zinc. Then comes 4p,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.360
gallium to krypton.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.520
5s.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.530
I'm having fun here, I'm
going to keep going.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.230
5s gets us over to strontium.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.270
Next comes 4d.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.430
Gets us all the way
over to cadmium.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.070
5p gets us to xenon.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.410
Now it's turn 6s
cesium, barium.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.295
4f.

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:12.780
We've got to jump down here.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.130
Finally we're going to
get to the f shell.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.280
See?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.670
The 4f is in here.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.430
Now, this is an item
of convenience.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.590
Strictly speaking, lanthanum
is 57, cerium is 58.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.730
So all of these elements
belong in here.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.400
But if we were to put this to
scale, the Periodic Table

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.245
would be way over here.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.940
It wouldn't fit on a page.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.810
So people, over time, have
gotten used to just

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.750
putting it down here.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.680
But these elements are
in the middle here.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.670
So you go 4d, 5p, 6s, then 4f.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.180
Finally we get over to the edge
here, to erbium, and then

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.110
we jump over here to hafnium,
5d, over to

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.410
mercury, 6p, et cetera.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.880
So the n plus l rule gives you
the filling sequence in

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.440
ascending order.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.500
That's good.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.910
So we've got a nice compact
way of grabbing this e

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.730
goes to n plus l.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.850
Now let's look at
some properties.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.570
We said it's a table of
the elements, but

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.730
it's a periodic table.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.430
So let's see what this
periodicity looks like.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.250
Now, here's a variation of
first ionization energy.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.550
So here it is in kilojoules per
mole, and here's my pet

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.700
unit, the electron
volt per atom.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.500
Because here's hydrogen, of 1.6
megajoules per mole, but I

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.920
like the 13.6 electron volts
because I can remember 13.6.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.040
I can't remember 1312
megajoules per mole,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.130
kilojoules per mole,
whatever it is.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.920
13.6 electronic volts.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.930
So here's hydrogen,
there's helium.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.760
And then we drop down to
lithium, and then we move

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.170
across up to neon, and so on.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.950
So you can see 1s, we
filled the 1s shell.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.920
Now, we're going to go
to shell n equals 2.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.720
Here's 2s.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.250
And then we go to 2p.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.770
And you can even see, look,
boron, carbon, oxygen, the

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.820
ascending value of the first
ionization energy.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.780
And then there's a little
jog here at oxygen.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.140
Because here we've got
the three unpaired

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.150
electrons for nitrogen.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.280
And then there's the oxygen
starts to pair, and we

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.130
continue to neon, and so on.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.790
3s, 3p, 4s.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.510
So you can see the relationship
between that

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.650
property, and the place,
the element, in

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.120
the Periodic Table.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.050
So how do we measure
these values?

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.690
Well, I thought it might be a
good opportunity to look at,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.820
revisit the whole question
of gas dynamics, and also

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.110
understand the measurement.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:51.690
Measurement of ionization
energies.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.890
And the technique that's used
is called photoelectron

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.750
spectroscopy.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.172
Photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.900
All right.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.520
And it's got a three-letter
initialization, PES.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.130
I want to show you a cartoon
of how this works.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.310
Actually, I took one --
this is taken from the

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.630
text we used to use.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.250
I like the text that we're using
now better, but there

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.100
are a few things in the other
text that were good.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.030
So, we've scanned these few
pages and posted them at the

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.850
website if you want to go
through and read this stuff.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.650
So let's jump over to that.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.220
So here's an example of
a terrible drawing.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.040
I look at this and I haven't got
the faintest idea how this

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.210
thing works.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.420
It's not the artist's fault.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.240
Somebody should have proofread
this thing.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.485
What they should be doing is
showing something like this.

00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:50.510
So, let's see what's going on.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.490
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to bombard a

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.040
specimen right here.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.220
Which they never show.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.240
I suppose this atom beam is
supposed to be colliding with

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.920
the photons.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.120
That would be quite
an apparatus to

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.670
build, let me tell you.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.270
Instead, what you have is, you
have the apparatus sitting so

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.260
that you've got the material in
the center of the chamber.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.270
And you irradiate
with photons.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.290
And the photons have very, very
high energy, and they

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.220
dislodge electrons.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.030
When they dislodge electrons
that's the ionization event.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.930
And then what we do is, we
measure the velocity of those

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.270
ejected electrons.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.750
And if we know the velocity,
we know their energy.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.720
We know the energy of the
incident energy and by

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.813
difference, we calculate the
binding energy of the electron

00:11:40.813 --> 00:11:41.640
and the atom.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.630
So let's take a look.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.440
I'm going to draw a cartoon here
that gives you a sense of

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.210
what's going on.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:53.980
So, here's the n equals 1
shell, or the k shell.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.940
And then I'm going to show,
say, a second shell here.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.120
One, two, three.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.690
So this is the l shell,
or n equals 2.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.510
And you might say, gee,
he's got that wrong.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.000
It's kind of simple,
and so on.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.190
It's as complex as it needs
to be for the explanation.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.770
Don't let accuracy
trump clarity.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.050
The real accurate picture here
is too detailed to convey what

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.820
I'm trying to convey.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.610
So, this is the specimen,
right?

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.000
Let's call this the specimen.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.520
And I'm going to irradiate the
specimen with some radiation

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.150
of high energy.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.080
And so, I generally indicate the
photon by a squiggly line

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.710
with an arrow.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.430
That's to indicate it's got
wave-like properties.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.580
And I'll usually write h nu next
to it, to indicate that

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.270
it's a photon of energy h nu.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.640
So the photon comes in, and if
the energy is high enough, it

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.626
will dislodge an electron.

00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:58.490
So this electron is dislodged.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.210
It's now ballistic.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.790
It's rendered ballistic.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.030
It's free.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.280
It's ionized.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.150
It's gone.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.540
It's gone.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.910
And what we're going to do is,
we're going to take an energy

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.600
balance here.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.590
And at some point you may
come back and learn

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.250
some quantum mechanics.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.780
This photon is annihilated
at this collision.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.950
So the photon doesn't act the
way an incident electron does

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.520
where it loses some
of its energy.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.500
All of the energy is lost.
So this photon's gone.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.670
All of the energy is given
to this electron.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.340
So let's do an energy
balance here.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.840
So I can say that the energy
of the incident photon, the

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.500
energy of the incident photon,
is now going to be given to

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.620
the electron.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.820
It's now got some kind
of kinetic energy.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:03.520
E kinetic plus the energy
it took to pull

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.250
it out of the atom.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.430
Plus E, let's call it binding.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.910
E binding

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.540
And we know the incident energy
of the photon because

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.900
we're running the experiment.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.830
So we set the value of
the incident energy

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.640
of the photon beam.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.200
And then we send this
to a detector.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.210
This goes to a detector.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.930
And the detector measures the
velocity and ultimately gives

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.980
us the energy of the
scattered electron.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.820
This is called the dislodged
electron, or photoelectron.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.530
It's the electron that was
kicked out by the photon.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.670
So it's known as the
photoelectron.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.200
Photoelectron.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.430
Pardon me, let's
try that again.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:15:05.170
Photoelectron energy is measured
at the detector.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.530
And then by difference, we
get the binding energy.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.230
We get the binding energy.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.340
So this is h nu.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:16.550
This one here is going to be a
1/2 m b squared, and then by

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.160
difference we get the
binding energy.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.790
And what kind of photon
energies do we need?

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.370
We need fairly high energies.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:30.440
And so typically, we might use
wavelengths down around 1

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.100
angstrom, which then
makes it an X-ray.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.800
And so, over here in Building
13, we have such

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.750
instrumentation, and the
material scientists

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.640
would call this XPS.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.580
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.280
And if you don't want to blast
all of the electrons out of

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.980
the specimen and just get the
most weakly bound, then you

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.080
want a lower incident photon
energy, which means a longer

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.000
wavelength.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.980
You might come in at around
100 angstroms, which is

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.030
ultraviolet.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.980
You know, people, the general
public, is so afraid, they

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.090
don't know science.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.990
If they hear X-ray they
get all panicked.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.320
You know, it's radiation.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.460
Their children are going
to die and all

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.150
this kind of stuff.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.150
So, what people will do is,
they'll say instead of soft

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.730
X-ray they'll say hard
ultraviolet.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.730
And then the public thinks, oh,
as long I wear sunscreen

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.330
I'm going to be OK.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
So if you use hard ultraviolet,
it's called UPS.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.860
That's nothing to do
with brown trucks.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.990
It's ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.200
And collectively, this
is known as PES--

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.890
photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.270
All right.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.970
So now, let's go back
to this schematic.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.710
Now you can see how bad this
schematic was that these

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.420
photons are coming in as so.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.470
And striking the specimen
here, ejecting the

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.460
photoelectrons which then are
focused and ultimately

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.620
measured here at the detector.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.730
So there's the energy balance.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.780
The energy of the incident
photon is distributed across

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.960
the kinetic energy of the
photoelectron plus the binding

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.400
energy, and this is how we
measure all of these

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.650
quantities.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.690
Since you're using very, very
high intensity radiation,

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.030
there's nothing saying
that you're going to

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.110
eject only one electron.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.630
You can eject a plurality
of electrons.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.260
And the different
electrons have

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.980
different binding energies.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.470
So you're going to get a set
of binding energies, which

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.250
means you'll get
a set of lines.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.410
You'll get a spectrum
of energies.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.250
So this is what the spectrum
looks like, and this is, by

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:43.220
the way, just a general way of
looking at any spectrum so

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.120
that you train you eye to
know what to look for.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.910
If I look at any spectrum, I'm
going to have a plot of some

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:57.660
kind of intensity, some kind of
intensity unit versus some

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.390
kind of energy unit, versus
some kind of energy unit.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.030
And sometimes, energy increases
from left to right.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.720
But sometimes they might put
energy increasing from right

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.320
to left as you see in
these spectrum.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.290
But energy is along here.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.790
And intensity is related
to population.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.150
All other things being equal, if
I have a specimen that has

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.740
two times the concentration of
active species, I'm going to

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.180
get twice the strength
of the line.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.510
So the intensity measures
population.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.750
The energy is related to the
characteristic binding energy

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.090
of a particular electrons, so
the energy is related to the

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.620
identity of the species.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.840
This is how we can identify
certain species.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.990
I've already shown you if you
walk in and you see those four

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.360
Balmer series lines on a
spectrum, you know that's

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.130
characteristic of
atomic hydrogen.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.510
Nothing else.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.650
So those are energies.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.460
And then, where do we go?

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.950
So we have a line here, but we
know that real data have a

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.190
little bit of a spread
to them.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.660
So you don't see discrete lines;
you'll see a spread

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.360
centered at about the value.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.310
So let's look at these.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.490
These are highly stylized, but
here you can see-- here's

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.950
boron for example.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.680
So these are the 1s electrons of
boron, and they're held at

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.190
a binding energy of about 19.3
megajoules per mole.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.640
And then this is 2s,
and here's 2p.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.590
Now there's a difference between
2s and 2p, but they're

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.680
of the same order.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.170
They're roughly about a
megajoule per mole.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.620
There's subtle differences.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.500
And this goes back to
Sommerfeld, who said that even

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.410
though there are s and p
orbitals, there's a circular

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.290
orbit and there's an
elliptical orbit.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.400
But they're roughly in
the same shell and

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.450
that's what you see.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.240
But there's a huge difference in
going from shell n equals 1

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.210
to n equals 2.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.080
This is not to scale.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.460
You see they got a little
break there.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.870
And now look, what's the
electronic structure of boron?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.350
1s2 2s2 2s1.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:10.890
There are two 2s electrons,
but only one 2p electron.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.050
And this is trying to show that
the height here is twice

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.640
the height of the 2s peak.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.800
So you see that we've got two
electrons here, one electron

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.540
here, and it's easiest to pull
out the 2p electrons first.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.830
And you go on, there's
beryllium and so on.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:36.460
So we see that we can build
data in this fashion here.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.350
We keep going.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.090
Here's carbon, which
is 2, 2, 2.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.590
And then oxygen has 2s2--

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:45.550
pardon me.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.800
1s2, 2s2, 2p4.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.830
So this is two electrons,
this is four electrons.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:57.160
Showing that the 2p height
is twice the 2s height.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.290
And then finally, neon
is 2s2, 2p6.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:05.190
So this is roughly three times
the height of the 2p.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.800
But all of the 2p numbers are
roughly of the same order of

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.300
magnitude and decidedly
smaller than

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.250
what's going on at 1s.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.710
And what else do you see?

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.490
Well, the carbon has 6
protons, so the inner

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.570
electrons of carbon are held
not as tightly as the inner

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.430
electrons of neon, which
has 10 protons.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.510
All of this comes out.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.720
The data are all good.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.650
So now what do we want
to talk about?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.580
What's all this about?

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.360
I said electronic structure
leads to properties.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.490
The first thing we want to
talk about is reactivity,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.960
chemical reactivity.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.980
Well it's pretty clear from
looking at these XPS data that

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.870
those inner shell electrons
aren't going anywhere.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.130
They're too tightly held.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.740
So first thing is the only
electrons that we can even

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.970
think about involving in
chemical reactivity must be

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.200
the electrons in the
outermost shell.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.950
These are called valence
electrons.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.320
The outermost shell is called
the valence shell.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.760
So let's get that down because
that's probably important.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:29.910
So chemical reactivity
determined by only electrons

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.170
in outermost shell.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.340
And we're going to term that
the valence shell.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.175
And those electrons are called
the valence electrons.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:54.900
And, these are the only ones
that we expect to see involved

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.250
in chemical reactivity.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.780
And we want to have a measure.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.300
You can see that there are
subtle differences between the

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.480
energies that hold the valence
electrons of carbon as opposed

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.370
the valence electrons of neon.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:16.380
And so what we can do is have
a measure of the ability for

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:23.250
valence electrons to react.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.330
That is to say, to participate
in chemical activity.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.840
And that measure is
called the average

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.570
valence electron energy.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.065
And there's no special symbol
for that, so we

00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:41.940
just call it AVEE.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.190
And it's just the values
of the valence

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.330
electron energies averaged.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.210
So if I want to take the average
valence electron

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.310
energy for say, oxygen.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.030
So I can take it right
off of there.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.280
I can see I'm going to need
two times the ionization

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:10.940
energy of 2s plus four times the
ionization energy of 2p.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.250
And those data are up there.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.880
All divided by 6.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.530
2 plus 4, the total number
of valence electrons.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:26.110
And if I go through the math up
there I get 1.91 megajoules

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:32.660
per mole, which I prefer to
expresses as 19.8 electron

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.060
volts per atom.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.530
And when we go through and
calculate the values of

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.960
average valence electron
energies, we find trends.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.030
And here's what the
trends look like.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.320
So you have, first of all,
following along with the

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.460
ionization energies, very
similar values.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.380
Pardon me.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.840
So here's the plot of average
valence electron energy in bar

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.530
heights arranged as the elements
are found on the

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.380
Periodic Table.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.460
So you have hydrogen here,
helium on this scale

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.480
would be way up.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.810
And then here's lithium,
beryllium, boron.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.730
And so you see a monotonic
increase as you move

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.470
from left to right.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.310
And you see a monotonic decrease
if you stay in the

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:27.050
same column from low
mass to high mass.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.170
So what's going on there?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.250
Why do we have that change?

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.030
We have similar electronics
structures.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.650
We have similar electronics
structures in a given column

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:42.340
and lithium is s1, sodium
is s1, potassium is

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.440
s1, rubidium is s1.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.010
And let's put some
values on here.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.240
Let's put some values.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.410
For the majority of elements in
the Periodic Table, we get

00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:01.350
values of average valence
electron energy less than 11

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.290
electron volts.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.920
And when we have such values,
we have the following

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.450
properties: the valence
electrons are weakly held.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.300
The valence electrons
are weakly held.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.000
How do we know this?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.150
Because the binding energy
isn't so strong.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.890
That means the electronic
are weakly held.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.080
So we say that the element
is a good electron donor.

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:31.150
It's a good electron donor
and we term this a metal.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.870
The property that makes an
element a metal is that it has

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.110
a low value of average valence
electron energy and therefore,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.280
it is a good electron donor.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.600
And it turns out about
75% of the Periodic

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.210
Table is made of metals.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.410
At the other extreme we have
high values of average valence

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.650
electron energy.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.200
High values.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.940
So when the average valence
electron energy is high, we

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.700
have the complementary
set of properties.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.750
So that means the valence
electrons are tightly held.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.675
Valence electrons
tightly held.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.630
Tightly held.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:17.790
And so the element is a
poor electron donor.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:27.610
But complementary fashion, it
is a good electron acceptor

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.190
because when it gets near
electrons it tends to grab

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.750
them and hold on to them.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.440
So this is a good electron
acceptor.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:44.100
And we term such a element
a nonmetal.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.190
And so roughly, about 25%
of the Periodic Table is

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.380
non-metallic.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.770
And I think I've got
that shown here.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.330
And you see just a
few elements off

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.980
to the upper right.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.540
And then in the middle,
we've got this--

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.800
about a half a dozen elements
and they have values of

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:15.630
average valence electron energy
intermediate between 11

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.860
and 13 electron volts.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:23.500
And so, they can behave either
as electron donors or electron

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.040
acceptors depending on who
else is in the room.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.870
So if you put an element like
silicon with a very strong

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.390
metal, silicon will act as
an electron acceptor.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.350
If you put silicon in the
presence of something that's a

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:42.190
very strong nonmetal, silicon
can act as an electron donor.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.220
It has that dual property.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:51.290
And these elements are called
semimetals or metalloids.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.680
And I think I've got some
images to portray that.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.010
There's the semimetals.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.710
And if you look carefully at
the Periodic Table that you

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.110
have, you'll see that there's
this red staircase here.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:15.400
So there's silicon, arsenic,
tellurium, antimony and so on

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.050
that act as semimetals.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:24.040
They can behave in
both fashions.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.500
All right, so now with this
classification scheme, let's

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.820
start thinking about chemical
reactivity.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.480
And seeing if we can, on the
basis of where the elements

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.840
are found on the Periodic
Table, start

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.790
to make some judgments.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.850
Well I know one thing right
off the bat that along the

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.610
right-hand column, the noble
gases are chemically inert.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.870
That much we know.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:54.890
Noble gases are chemically
inert.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:00.390
I know there's a Nobel Prize out
there for getting xenon to

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.390
combine with fluorine, and the
chemistry textbooks love to

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.420
point out these exceptions.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:11.780
But by and large, the group 8
elements are chemically inert.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.610
So what do we know about their
electronic structure?

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.840
They all have the
same electronic

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.695
structure ns 2, np 6.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.090
With the exception of helium.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.880
Helium, because it's 1s 2.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880
There's no p.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:37.740
So beside helium, starting with
neon, we've got 2s2, 2p6.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.685
Argon is 3s2, 3p6, and so on.

00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:46.200
n2 p6, it has 8 p electrons.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.780
It has a full valence shell.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:31:03.080
And because the last electrons
are p electrons, this is

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.550
termed octet stability.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.030
There's something about having
a full shell that renders the

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.620
system satisfied
energetically.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.265
And it doesn't want
to react anymore.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.250
So we say octet stability, and
if you want to be a wise guy,

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.110
parenthetically you whisper
helium is due at stability.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.890
But you know, whatever.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.220
All right, so let's make this
octet stability a hypothesis

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.560
and see how far we
can go with it.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.630
So the next one I want
to look at is sodium.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.800
Now sodium, it's got the
electronic structure 1s 2,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:49.780
2s2, 2p6, 3s1.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.790
Now, I really don't need to talk
about anything up to n

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.160
equals 3 because this is
not valence electrons.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.870
I just put it up there for
completeness, but this is all

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.960
we have to worry about.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.490
Now we know that sodium
is a metal.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.120
It's a metal.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.180
It's got an average valence
electron energy of about 5.2

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.900
electron volts, which happens
to be the ionization energy.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.610
Because that's trivial; it's
only got one electron, so the

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.460
average valence electron
energy is equal to the

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.260
ionization energy.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.065
So it's a metal.

00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:22.330
So it's a good electron donor.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.100
But let's think about that.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.680
If we could get rid of that
electron in sodium, we could

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.240
then turn it into something that
has the same electronic

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.120
structure as neon.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.190
And why do we want to do that?

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.340
Well because there seems to
be an energy well there.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.640
If we can make something
neon-like, then

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.010
it's going to be happy.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.740
So let's do it.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:47.520
Let's write a reaction sodium to
lose an electron and become

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.330
sodium plus.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.950
And sodium plus now
is this minus 3s1.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.210
So it's isoelectronic
with neon, and neon

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.390
has the octet stability.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.590
But charge neutrality
forbids me to

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.250
say, OK, lose an electron.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.800
It won't.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.200
The only way for sodium
to lose an electron

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.950
is to find an acceptor.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.090
So if you put a good electron
donor in the presence of a

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.080
good electron acceptor, then the
donor can give an electron

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.390
to the acceptor and both profit
from the transaction.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.330
So, where are we going to find
a good electron acceptor?

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.890
Well I just told you, the
nonmetals are the really good

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.180
electron acceptors.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.480
So let's go zooming over to the
right-hand edge of that

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.030
row and look at chlorine.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.440
We need an electron acceptor.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:49.920
So choose just for argument's
sake, chlorine.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.590
It's got an average
valence electron

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.920
energy way, way up there.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.730
So let's go.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.200
Chlorine, it has the electronic
structure of neon

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.980
plus 3s2, 3p5.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.210
So chlorine, if it could acquire
an electron, would

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.720
then become isoelectronic
with argon.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.210
So imagine chlorine plus
electron becomes Cl minus and

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.350
Cl minus is isoelectronic
with argon.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.950
So now I've got two elements.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.630
One that's one electron richer
than inert gas structure, and

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.880
one that's one electron poorer
than inert gas structure.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.920
If I put them together, put them
both together in the same

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:42.370
reactor, they will react and
electron transfer occurs via

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.646
electron transfer.

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:50.345
Chemical reaction occurs.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:57.490
Chemical reaction occurs through
electron transfer.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.900
And what's the purpose
of electron transfer?

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.680
It's to achieve full
valence shell.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.360
Achieve full valence shell
occupancy, if you like.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.710
Achieve full valence
shell occupancy.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.110
So, now we've got it.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.640
But there's more.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.460
There's more.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.980
What happens after the electron
transfer step?

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.030
We don't have neutral
species anymore.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.160
The sodiums have given up their
electrons to become

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.340
sodium ions.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.440
And the chlorines have acquired
electrons to become

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.100
chloride ions.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.720
And these are free.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.700
Let's make this simple.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.770
Let's make it a gas
phase reaction.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:47.140
So sodium vapor and chlorine
gas have become sodium ion

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.110
vapor and chloride ion vapor.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.330
What do you know happens when
you have charges of opposite

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.750
value, opposite polarity?

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.980
There's a coulombic force
of attraction.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.540
So the sodium will attract
the chlorine.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.680
So let's put the two together.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.850
So sodium attracts chlorine,
but it's not over.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.320
There's more sodiums, there's
more chlorines.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:18.060
So chlorine attracts sodium,
which attracts sodium.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.810
Which could attract
more chlorines.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.470
Which could attract
more sodiums.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.630
And what do you see
happening here?

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:30.660
Well we're now starting with a
gas phase and we're forming

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:33.980
some giant atomic aggregate.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.895
This is a giant ion aggregate.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.300
What's the state of matter going
to be if this thing's

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.170
honking big?

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.620
It's going to be a solid.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.920
We're going to form a solid
starting with those two gases:

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.320
sodium vapor and
chlorine vapor.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.600
And what about the solid?

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.280
What do we see about the atomic
arrangement here?

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.890
All the sodiums are the same
size and all the chlorides are

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.120
the same size.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.300
They have the same coulombic
forces of attraction in

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.210
between them.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.910
Can you see that they're going
to form not just a solid, but

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.480
they're going to form a solid
consisting of atoms in a

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.200
regular array?

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.085
This is going to be
an ordered solid.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.830
And there's a plain Anglo-Saxon
word for an

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.010
ordered solid, it's
called a crystal.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.970
Now look at how far
we've come.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.030
Look at how far we've come.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.410
10 minutes ago we hadn't done
anything about chemical

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.650
reactivity.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.210
We made one observation.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.560
We had the tools of course.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.590
We were ready.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.140
We're ready for discovery.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.170
We had the tools.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.830
We had the average valence
electron energy.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:54.140
We knew that helium, neon,
argon, krypton, xenon, radon,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.220
et cetera, all have
this inertness.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.910
We postulated that the octet
stability was some--

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.420
as a sweet spot.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.060
And then we went with it.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:10.210
And operating with that one
postulate, we get to electron

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.850
transfer and we're concluding
that if I take a really,

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:15.760
really good metal--

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.820
see, I can generalize
this now.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.880
There's nothing peculiar about
sodium that makes it react

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.280
this way and no other element
will react this way.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.360
I could replace sodium
with any other metal.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.160
I could say any metal, any
metal will react with any

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.500
nonmetal in order to achieve
octet stability.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.290
So now you can take big pieces
of the Periodic Table and

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:48.720
conclude that entire sets of
elements will act in this way

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.400
to form ionic compounds,
crystals, atoms of regular

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.450
periodicity.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.200
That's a nice pun
there, right?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.100
We started with the Periodic
Table and now we have periodic

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.690
spacing of atoms. I think
that's beautiful.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.830
Obviously this view
is not shared by

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.250
the rest of the audience.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:14.070
This crystal consists of ions.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.520
It's held together by
what chemists like

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.490
to refer to as bonds.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.720
This is called an ionic bond.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.340
And what you're witnessing here
is ironic bonding via

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.805
electron transfer.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:36.050
So we've now categorized the
first form of primary bonding.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.610
Sodium chloride, magnesium
oxide--

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.790
ionic bonding.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:47.405
And ionic bonding must give us
solids at room temperature.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.440
If you've got ionic bonds and
you don't have a solid,

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.710
clearly you are at elevated
temperature where at elevated

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.980
temperature, the thermal energy
is disruptive enough to

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.730
break those bonds.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.240
Those are very, very
strong bonds.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.660
And what we're going to do next
day is look at the nature

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.060
of those bonds.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.580
So I think I'm going
to stop the formal

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.270
lesson at this point.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:26.480
And by the way, perhaps I failed
to mention on the first

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.240
day of the class.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.190
What I'm doing is I'm lecturing
for, out of the 50

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:36.650
minutes, about 45 on
hard core topics.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.990
And then, about the last 5,
7 minutes, I want to go to

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.990
something related to these--
chemistry in the

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.130
world around us.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.080
That's why you see this
little break.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.800
But it doesn't mean that
class is dismissed.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.930
There's a difference between
changing topics

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:51.910
and dismissing class.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.130
I don't know how people
confuse the two.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:59.490
But somehow I've inadvertently
communicated to you evidently.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.360
So we're not dismissing yet.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.650
We're going to try to apply
this knowledge somehow.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.450
So what I wanted to do was to
show you what happens with

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.990
these ionic solids
in commerce.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.230
And in particular, I wanted to
talk about metallurgy and the

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.100
best form of metallurgy,
which is of course,

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.540
electrometallurgy.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.730
Which is the kind of research
that I'm involved in.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.030
And electrometallurgy
is quite pervasive.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:31.930
The aluminum beverage can is
made by electrometallurgy, as

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.645
is magnesium.

00:41:33.645 --> 00:41:35.560
So I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about magnesium.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.340
This is a bar of magnesium.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.090
Obviously, it's magnesium
because if it were steel, it

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.395
would be so massive that I
wouldn't be able to fling it

00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:43.500
around like this.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:49.160
The density of iron is 7.87,
the density of magnesium is

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.110
about 1.76.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.310
It's less than 2.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.040
It's 2/3 of the density
of aluminum.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.290
It's lighter than aluminum.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.140
Now perhaps some of
you've been told

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.230
that magnesium burns.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.810
Well, let's see what happens.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.020
There's a billet of magnesium
and this is

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.620
the key made of steel.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.812
We're OK.

00:42:09.812 --> 00:42:10.460
We're OK.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.590
It's not going to burn.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.700
That's a myth.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.780
Magnesium in powder
form, magnesium in

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.510
ribbon form will burn.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.760
The surface to volume ratio is
so high that the oxidation

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.840
generates a lot of heat.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.830
But here the surface to
volume ratio is so

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.620
low that it's fine.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.870
In fact, I went to school at
the University of Toronto.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.230
And at the time the department
head was a man by the name of

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.520
Pigeon who invented a process
during World War II to make

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.890
magnesium cheaply.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.440
And when he came into the
classroom to lecture on the

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.990
day that he would talk about
magnesium, in those days they

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.740
had lab benches at the front
of the class with sinks and

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.750
gas outlets.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:55.000
And he would put the magnesium
billet on a stand and light a

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.490
Bunsen burner under it.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:59.960
And of course, people in the
class sort of leaned back, and

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.860
he would lecture for 45 five
minutes with the Bunsen flame

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.220
burning the whole time.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.660
And then towards the end he
would extinguish the flame,

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.560
let the billet cool.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.430
And then pick it up and go back
to his office with it to

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.890
make the point.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:18.010
All right, so how do we
make these metals?

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.250
Well, what we do is we reverse
the electron transfer step.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:26.680
And we start with the cations
and anions, and we force the

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.520
electrons back onto the
cations anions.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.170
Thereby, creating the
neutrals again.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.560
This is called electrolysis.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.530
So cation plus electron
gives us neutral.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.980
Anion minus electron
gives us neutral.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.000
So in the case of magnesium,
we start with magnesium

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.790
chloride, which dissolves and
forms magnesium cations and

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.130
chloride anions.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.190
So, at elevated temperature--

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.900
in this case, at about 700
degrees Celsius, the ionic

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.600
solid becomes an ionic liquid.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.880
And it's clear, colorless, and
has the fluidity of water.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.950
And this is a very simple
schematic, so we've made the

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.930
cathode of steel negative and
on the negative electrode,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.710
magnesium ions are reduced to
magnesium, which is a liquid

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.500
at this temperature.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.920
And these are little bubbles
of magnesium

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.125
and they pool here.

00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:20.990
And we collect them and
syphon them off.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.120
And on the other electrode,
we're

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.770
making bubbles of chlorine.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:27.150
And they rise and
we collect them.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.322
So we reverse nature.

00:44:29.322 --> 00:44:32.180
If you put chlorine in the
presence of magnesium it wants

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.320
to form magnesium chloride.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.080
Here we do the reverse.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.950
So electrolysis undoes the
spontaneous electron transfer

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.080
of ion formations.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.060
So I decided I better get
something more authoritative

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.070
than my little cartoon.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:49.540
So first I looked on the library
website and I found

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.960
that there was an article in
this volume of Advances in

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.410
Molten Salt Chemistry.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.930
And there's this article here,
an authoritative article about

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.160
chemistry and electrochemistry
of magnesium production.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:08.350
And so I decided to turn to the
article and let me read

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:12.800
the first paragraph of this
authoritative article.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.120
A cubic kilometer--

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.190
what is a cubic kilometer?

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:18.450
It's a cube, 1 kilometer
on edge.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.270
A cubic kilometer of sea water
contains approximately 1

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.650
million tons of magnesium.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:29.220
1 million tons of magnesium as
the salt magnesium chloride

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.740
decahydrate dissolved
in sea water.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.840
More than has ever been produced
in one year by all

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.985
the magnesium plants
in the world.

00:45:36.985 --> 00:45:39.600
The world production of
magnesium right now is about

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.030
600 million tons.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:48.690
No, furthermore, sea water
contains only 3.7% of the

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:54.230
total magnesium present in the
earth's crust. Clearly

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.890
magnesium resources are
ubiquitous and virtually

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.170
inexhaustible.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.280
So when people tell you we've
got to recycle because we're

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.960
running out of resources,
I read this--

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.410
I don't know.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.810
You might want to recycle for
other reasons, but you can't

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.320
make the case it's because
of scarcity.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.440
This is magnesium that
has been made by this

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.320
electrolytic root.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.140
And what's the value of this?

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.090
It can substitute for steel
in automobiles.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.080
It's density is less than 2.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.430
Steel is about 8.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:32.420
Factor of 4 you lightweight the
vehicle, which means per

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.730
unit distance traveled,
less fuel consumed.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.140
Fewer emissions.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.750
And less fuel, which means less

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.770
dependence on imported petroleum.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:45.420
So why aren't we doing this?

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.690
Why aren't we lightweighting our
vehicles with magnesium.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:52.610
Because the bonds are so strong
the energy required to

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:58.650
make this metal is so high
that it's very costly.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.570
If I give you a light bulb that
costs three times what

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:06.300
the other light bulb does and
burns only twice as long, you

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.720
won't buy it.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.630
If it costs three times as much
and burns 10 times as

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.680
long, then you're willing
to pay the premium.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.640
So what we do in my research
group, among other things, is

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.640
study the electrochemical
processes by which we make

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.580
these metals in order to make
the process more efficient.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.200
Thereby reducing the cost,
making these lighter materials

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.830
more competitive.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:36.710
Thereby, making the world a
better place by electron

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.905
transfer in service
of humanity.

00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:41.960
And I invite you
to do the same.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.350
But in order to do so,
you have to learn

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:45.990
the lessons of 3091.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.800
Because after all, this is the
most important subject you

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.130
will take at MIT.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.090
All right, we'll see
you on Friday.
