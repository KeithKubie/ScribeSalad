00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.300
But much more interesting
than a Markov model for

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.370
what we're going to do is what's
referred to as a hidden Markov model.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.230
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.458
Suppose you actually can't
observe the state, kay?

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.160
So there's some state doing its thing,
but you can't observe it.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.790
But what you can observe, or
what are referred to as observables, or

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.500
the evidence.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.350
So let's suppose for
the same weather example, okay?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
Let's suppose the things that
we can observe are essentially

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.840
what women of the day happen
to be wearing or carrying.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.840
So maybe I see this very sheik bathing
suit on a person, or I see just a nice

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.160
coat that can be worn any time
that it was sunny, or an umbrella.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.380
So these are the evidence
of what the state is.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.990
So before I can go further,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.520
I have to tell you one more thing
about our Markovian system, and

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.630
that's what's referred to as
the emission probabilities.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.260
Emission, if you think of it
as symbols being spit out, and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.940
the emission probabilities
are written like this.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400
B, sub j of k.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.270
And what that means is,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.560
the probability that you'll see symbol
k, that you'll see a bathing suit,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.970
given that at some time you're
in some particular state, okay?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.240
So what's the probability you'll see
a bathing suit, given that it's sunny?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.830
What's the probability
you'd see a bathing suit,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.870
given that it's snowy, all right?

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.740
Those are called
the emission probabilities.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.880
And what that means, our entire system
when it's running, looks like this.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.920
In this new system,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.950
where we can't observe the states, we
don't ask questions about the likelihood

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.430
of having seen a particular sequence of
states, because we can't see the states.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.740
Instead, we're going to ask
about the likelihood, or

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.340
the probability of seeing a particular
sequence of observations.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.280
So that's shown here.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.100
So you could say, given this
sequence of observation, coat,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.060
coat, umbrella, umbrella,
bathing suit, umbrella,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.555
umbrella, what's the probability of that
series of that sequence of observations?

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:01.245
Well, we could evaluate that if
you give us everything, right?

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:05.625
So here, I've just written it out
as P of O is the sequence of all

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:10.715
the observations, and I know the way to,
to compute that and we'll get more

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:16.400
of the details later is, I can say well,
if you told me the sequence of states,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.370
then I can tell you the probability
of given observation.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.410
And if I multiply that by
the probability of that sequence,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.840
I can get the whole thing.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.200
So one simple example is, well,
one possible sequence of states,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.970
just one, is that it's all sun.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.520
All right, and that can be determined
from the yellow stuff here, all right?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.940
All right, so it's the probability that
I start with sun, 0.7, right there.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.850
And then I follow that with a whole
bunch of sun, 0.8, point, right?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.710
All e, sunny days.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.760
So, this is the probability of
all sunny days, and this would

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.060
be the probability of seeing this
sequence, if every day was sunny, right?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.260
So, the coat,
it's a 0.3 probability t, there's 4,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.650
umbrellas, and there's only a 10% chance
of seeing an umbrella when it's sunny.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.930
Notice by the way,
I wrote 0.1 to the 4 here.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.295
The order doesn't matter, right?

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:16.830
because I'm assuming that
if you tell me the state,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.710
that I could tell you the probability
of being, of, of having an umbrella.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.150
It doesn't matter what the day before or
the day after was.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.890
You tell me that it's,
that it's raining,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.760
I can tell you the probability
that they're carrying an umbrella.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.080
But this was only for
one particular sequence of all sun.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.070
You have to worry about all
possible sequences of weather,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.590
over those seven days to talk about the
probability of getting this one series.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.610
So to make that a little clearer and
a little easier, let's just do the math.
