TIMOTHY JORDAN: So we're
going to be talking

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:05.049
about distributing
your Glassware.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.590
We're going to talk
about two things.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.260
One, what is the review process?

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.810
And then two, what's new?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.910
And this part's going
to be pretty awesome.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.020
And then at the end, I did
leave some time for Q&amp;A.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.090
So we can talk about that.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.237
I am Timothy Jordan.

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.570
I'm a Developer Advocate
working on wearables at Google.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.960
And that's Jeff Harris.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.820
Jeff just found out
how to get here.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.470
And Jeff is a Product
Manager for Platform on Glass

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.100
and he's going to be joining
me for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.335
OK, so let's dive right in.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.790
In the last six months, the
catalog of Glassware on MyGlass

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.810
has grown 80%, is
pretty [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.190
And in the last month alone,
we've launched more Glassware

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.780
then we have in
the previous five.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.410
And it's not all the Glassware
that people are experimenting

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.010
with but rather these are
the ones designed and refined

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709
against our best practices.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.250
And there's even
[INAUDIBLE], in fact

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.041
there's a lot of Glass
wear in review today

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.580
that we know you're
going to love.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.170
So let's just get right into it.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.130
Why have a review
process at all?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.250
Well, the reason
is simple but I'm

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770
going to give you
some more detail.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.360
We want to launch lots
of awesome Glasswear.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.895
The lots is pretty
straightforward

00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:21.930
but the awesome-- that
actually requires-- I mean,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.240
that's the hard
part right there.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.814
Now is a common goal
with App Stores.

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:28.730
Everybody wants to have
lots of great software

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.880
for the platform.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.290
And there are all sorts
of review processes

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.240
and we took a look at these
before we designed our review

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.870
process.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.210
You could have at one end of
the spectrum, no review at all.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.710
Right?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.255
Just let everything that comes
up, says "Hi," on to the store

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:48.710
and gets launched to the users.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.210
On the rather end
of the spectrum,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.160
you got this black box review.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.660
Right?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.080
You submit your
software for review

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.540
and you get a yes or a no
and you have no idea why.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.040
Right?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.440
Both these models exist out
there as for App Stores.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.820
The Glassware
review process isn't

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.315
at either end of that spectrum.

00:02:06.315 --> 00:02:07.940
In fact, you could
sort of say it's not

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.250
on that spectrum at all.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.130
It's based on the idea
that we can help developers

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.490
create amazing
experiences on Glass.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.940
And in fact, it'd be
crazy not to help them.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.150
And it's also an opportunity
to understand more deeply what

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.210
you're doing in this early
phase of Glass and Glassware.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.030
We learned from
the review process

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.870
and we use those learnings
to directly grow the platform

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.770
and product improvements.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.301
Now, when the
Glassware comes in,

00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.550
we look for two simple things.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.519
First, is it safe for users?

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.060
Ultimately, there's
so much that we--

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.950
only so much that we can do.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.050
But we can use the Glassware
and do our best to make sure,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.370
at the very least, it
does what it says it does.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.090
All right?

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.080
It asks for appropriate
permissions,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.324
that kind of thing.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:56.740
And this is sort
of obvious but we

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.910
should do what we
can in this area.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750
The next thing-- this is
the second out of the two,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.880
is it these two things
are very different.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.380
Right?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.430
And in our experience working
with developers and partners

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.060
is that the tendency is to take
an experience from the phone

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.920
and just stamp it out on Glass.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.510
It's the same
experience over there.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.200
But the thing is, is
the paradigms on Glass

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.660
and how the user interacts with
it are remarkably different.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.160
Right?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.610
It's important for-- I'm
sorry, somebody's give me

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.380
hand motions.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.800
And I don't know what-- OK.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.290
You got to think about
what's special, right?

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.620
What can you do now that
you couldn't do before?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.860
And then you had to do that.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.011
And the review process is
there to help with that.

00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:42.510
Right?

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.090
It's our goal never to say,
"No you can't do that."

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.890
Instead, any time
where it's like, "This

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.370
is something new or this is
outside the best practices."

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.910
How could we say to the
developer "yes and."

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.490
It's this beautiful concept
that we learned from improv,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.890
where you build upon
each other's ideas.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.540
Instead of saying
no to developers,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.150
we help them adapt their ideas
and their dreams for user

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.050
and activity to this
new environment.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.430
That make sense?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.004
OK.

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:14.170
Here are the steps involved.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.899
First, you submit
your Glassware.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.589
There's a form.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.255
You fill it out.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:19.850
No big deal.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.620
Then we have a conversation
and we offer assistance.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.120
All right?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.330
And this is the fun part.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.170
This is where you get
the personal attention

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.490
of a Glassware expert and
sometimes the UX team itself

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.550
when there's new
things going on to help

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.970
you make the best
Glassware possible.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.640
And then we get it
launched out to users.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.610
That's the process.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.860
All right, I'm going to come
back to that in a moment.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.890
Here's a few new things
that we can talk about.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.100
First off, we're always trying
to improve this process, right?

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.010
How can we make it
better for developers?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.244
How can we make it faster?

00:04:52.244 --> 00:04:53.910
How can we make it
where we're reliable?

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.630
How can we make all this
Glassware more awesome?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.130
One of the things
that we silently

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.550
launched just a
couple months ago

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.670
is that you can now submit
both Mirror API Glassware

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.010
and GDK Glassware and
MyGlass will support both.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.364
Now, some folks have gone
through this process,

00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:14.030
as we just sort of
silently launched it.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.310
Others are coming along.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.901
And of course, we're
ready for more.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.670
The next thing, another
sort of small announcement,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.977
is that we've got a form
for updating your Glassware.

00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:24.560
So if you've got
major changes and you

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.980
want us to look
at them, you'll be

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.729
able to see this form
on our documentation

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:28.711
in the next few days.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:29.710
SPEAKER: --send advices.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.140
You can--

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.435
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --have already
gone through the review process

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.105
and you just need
a quota increase,

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:34.730
you can use this form
for that as well.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.790
OK.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.350
Now finally a piece of feedback
we've gotten quite frequently

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.800
is that the review
process takes too long.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.710
Well, we agree.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.250
We would like to go faster.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.610
And we examined it.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.560
The one place where
everybody sort of

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.760
agrees that it is
taking too long

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.530
is between submitting
and getting

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.890
that first round of feedback.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.770
And the way we
handle this, as you

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.780
saw in this diagram
earlier, is that we assemble

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.300
a whole list of
feedback and then we

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.570
give that as one chunk
back to the developer.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.800
But then what happens
is that if there's

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.720
any big things they change,
we take a look at it,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.970
and we have this conversation
about how to really make

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.690
this Glassware great
and fit onto Glass.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.830
Well, since we're having
this conversation anyway,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.010
why don't we just start that
conversation right away?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.510
So we're announcing that we're
going to do earlier feedback.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.990
Now what this means
is that as soon

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.850
as you submit your
Glassware, we're

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.150
going to start reviewing it
and as the feedback comes in,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.260
we'll share that sheet with you
and you can see it as it comes.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.890
So instead of waiting for
the full chunk, right?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.710
As there's major pieces of
feedback that we give you,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.620
you can start working
on those right away.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.450
OK.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.600
Another way that we're going to
help you get earlier feedback

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.080
and speed up the whole
process requires a new tool.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.877
So I'd like to talk about that.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.710
Now many of you might
have seen that there's

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.340
this common visual
language that I

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.230
use in a lot of my
presentations, right?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.260
It's this representation
of the Glassware flow.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.710
A tap goes down
on this flow chart

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.440
and a swipe forward
goes to the right.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.030
A swipe back goes to the back.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.160
And with this, it's a
pretty simple and effective

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.720
representation of how the
UI or the user experience

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.200
is on this Glassware.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.220
Now I do this in Keynote
and it takes me awhile

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.136
to get this all right.

00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:27.610
Where we've built
a tool and it's

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.220
going to be available to
you very soon in beta,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.240
on the documentation site.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.014
It's called the
Glassware Flow Designer.

00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:38.680
Now the cool thing about this is
that you can just jump right in

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.850
and you can put in
HTML or screenshots

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.950
and then very quickly, build
this flow chart about how

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.021
your Glassware works, and it
saves all the files to Google

00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:51.520
Drive so you can just share
them like you do any other files

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.895
to everybody you're
working with.

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:55.235
And you can collaboratively
edit this together.

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:56.610
Now our hope is
what you're going

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.710
to do is you're going to
build these right away,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.400
even before you
start developing.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.900
Right?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.840
As you're thinking
about this idea.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.230
And that you're going
to send this our way.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.810
So we can take a
look at it, even

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.870
before you started
building things.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.850
And we can give you those
major pieces of feedback

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.900
that we often like delivered
to people who submit Glassware

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.670
for the first time, even
before you start building,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.540
to make the whole
process easier,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.210
to make it even faster
from idea to launch,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.540
not just submission
to review to launch.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.310
So that's the new
things that we're doing.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:30.980
You like that.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.659
That's good.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.549
Reviewing Mirror and GDK
Glassware available on MyGlass

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.650
now and anybody can
submit both of those.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.900
Earlier feedback, we're going
to give you the feedback

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.809
as soon as it starts happening.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.400
We've launched this Glassware
Flow Designer which is really

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.560
going to help you design your
Glassware and collaboratively

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.280
design that Glassware very
early on, even before you start

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.160
developing.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.790
And that you'll be able to send
this our way so we can give you

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.140
that expert feedback
even before you've

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.090
started going down a path.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.944
Now a very common
piece of feedback

00:09:01.944 --> 00:09:03.860
is that sometimes people
use an immersion when

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.550
they should really
use a live card.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.925
That's the kind
of thing you want

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:08.700
to know before you
build the immersion.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.200
So we really want
to help with that.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.615
And our resources are on
 developers.google.com/glass/distribute.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.740
I hope that you'll join us
there and ask questions.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.106
If you add a /glass/community,
you can reach any of us and we

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.480
can talk about it
there, as well.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.380
OK and with that, I'd like
to bring Jeff up on stage

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.860
and we're going to do some
questions and answers.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.196
I have another microphone.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.320
In fact, can I get
somebody to help?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.490
Would you mind?

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.358
Thank you, Hoi.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.277
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:50.110
One tool that I use on
the Play Store a lot,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.070
both within my own team
and with the testing

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.124
apps with the broader user base
is the Beta and Alpha Channels.

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:56.790
Have you thought about
bringing anything

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.200
like that to the Glass store?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.520
JEFF HARRIS: Uh, yes.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.870
So we have some capabilities
like that already.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.250
If you submit Glassware to us,
we can whitelist that Glassware

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.960
for just a Google group or
an individual set of users.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.909
And we're pretty
willing to do that.

00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:12.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.590
That's great.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.630
Just so one other question.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.770
What's sort of a crash reporting
tool or aggregated stats

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.800
do you currently offer
through the MyGlass store?

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.430
Like for the developer side?

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.370
JEFF HARRIS: So our UI stuff
for that isn't that great.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.520
We do tend to communicate
to developers when

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.680
we see the crash report.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.090
So if we see your
app crashing a lot,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.940
we will reach out
and let you know.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.830
But there isn't a
proactive way for you

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.870
to get that information.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.630
AUDIENCE: So do you recommend
that we use other tools

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.900
like a crash analytics or
maybe other third parties

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.590
to collect stats if
there's not like a tool--

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.630
JEFF HARRIS: I think that's
generally a good idea.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:43.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.180
All right.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.679
Thank you.

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:49.870
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.130
This question is related
to the-- can you hear me?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.264
JEFF HARRIS: Yes.

00:10:55.264 --> 00:10:56.680
AUDIENCE: This
question is related

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.100
to do-- like the
hardware part of this.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.930
Nothing, my major seriously.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.270
But can you find a mechanism,
do a simple thing to this Glass

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.980
and let people know when
you will go to a restaurant

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.870
or somewhere that
this camera is not on.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.941
Because I hate to remove
it when people like,

00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:14.940
"You need to move that."

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.110
So as a mechanism,
just to put it in,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.250
people can see that this,
the camera part is closed

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.090
and it's not going to record.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.440
Still I can review
my emails, like check

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.180
who's sending me a message on.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.410
So it's just like something
like a universally

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.090
accepting, "OK, the
camera is covered."

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.810
So don't worry.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.774
You don't have remove that
at a restaurant or a bar,

00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:37.690
pub, or even when you
walk to the restaurants.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.140
Sometimes, I accidentally
walk, oh, I have to go back.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.610
So that-- can you do that?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.040
It's-- I don't think it's
a major hard problem.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.490
But I think it's
just a suggestion,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.407
it will be helpful to everyone.

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.050
So just for the people that
might not have heard that,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.275
it's a feature request.

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:54.400
Definitely appreciate that.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.880
We sort, of course, can't
comment on any future features

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.280
or where we may go in that area.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.779
But if you do have
feature requests,

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.020
definitely welcome them.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.867
Next question.

00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:06.450
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
I was really excited about when

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.470
you said [INAUDIBLE] it was--
Mirror, GDK combined apps.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.970
And I know one of
the things you add

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.320
was the authentication flow,
where you could have a Mirror

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.350
app that then authenticates
the GDK by creating

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.880
an account on Glass.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.990
And I know, right
now the requirement

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.420
is you gotta need to submit
before you can try any

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.754
of the accounts stuff on advice?

00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:29.628
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:12:29.628 --> 00:12:30.837
So this is how that works.

00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.420
And there are some
challenges in here.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.730
And I think we could provide
some more tooling over time.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.980
But if you want now to
have a GDK Glassware that

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.530
has an account and
authentication, therefore,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.800
you don't we don't to
use the Mirror API.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.060
But there is a
RESTful API that you

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.120
hit where you send the
account information to Google

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.400
and then when the APKs delivered
to Glass through MyGlass,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.990
the account is as well so it's
available to your application

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.170
when it starts up.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.110
The sort of shim
that you can use now

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.760
is you can use ADB to send
this account to Glass yourself.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.260
Right?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.060
So you can test
all the components

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.230
of getting the user
up to the point where

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.230
you would send the account
information to Google

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.960
and then you have to plug the
device in and do ADB and send

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.000
the APK.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.890
And then when you do bring your
Glassware through to the review

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.410
process, part of what
you'll get is the ability

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.220
to test that on MyGlass
before you launch.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.720
Yeah.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.890
But you will need that
shim up until that point.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.060
AUDIENCE: You try to
never say "No, you

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.800
can't do that on Glass."

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.870
Have you actually flat
out rejected any apps?

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.110
Have you ever to say that?

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.568
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, we do
have developer policies, right?

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.240
And remember, I talked
about user safety

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.365
but also, like you got to
comply with the developer

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.070
policies and the API
terms of service.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.360
When we see something that
doesn't, we will say no.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.200
Right?

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.507
An example of this--
what's a good example?

00:13:53.507 --> 00:13:56.090
JEFF HARRIS: Like one example
is we don't let apps launch that

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.404
use the camera without
turning the screen on.

00:13:58.404 --> 00:14:00.070
For kind of the concern
that you get at.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.040
We want some visual indication
that the camera's running.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.330
So we wouldn't let an app
launch if it didn't do that.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.812
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
But the-- where we

00:14:07.812 --> 00:14:10.020
give the feedback is that
we'd say specifically that.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.290
Like "yes, you
can use the camera

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.870
but you need to
have the screen on."

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.750
So it's adapting the idea
to the Glassware and Glass

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.600
world and the way
of doing things.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.610
Question down here.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.870
AUDIENCE: I submitted a
Glassware three weeks ago

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.230
and I'm still in the "too
long" part of you flow chart.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.100
I was that thinking about--
what about giving a-- like,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.720
because I assume
that you are looking

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.360
at two different things about
the app at the same time.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.560
Like giving, like
more transparency say.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.790
Because it's far as
simple, you can reject apps

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.110
or say there's a
problem with app

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.330
like from the very beginning.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.710
For example, the
content is offensive

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.550
or why not say like "Your
app was approved for that

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.390
and now we are
checking this part.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.472
We're checking--"

00:14:57.472 --> 00:14:58.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's exactly what

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.010
we want to do with
the earlier feedback.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.130
One of the-- we look at
a lot of the big things

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.980
that we can recognize quickly
that are often sort of done

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.640
wrong or that we can help with.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.940
We give that feedback
as soon as possible.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.910
There is some Glassware that
sort of in this place where

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.330
we had kind of a long
queue that hasn't

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.630
gotten that early feedback yet.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.070
But we're working hard to
work through that backlog

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.822
and get that out as
soon as possible.

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:22.030
AUDIENCE: And same question--

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.988
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we're
also growing the team

00:15:23.988 --> 00:15:25.720
and scaling up to
meet some more demand.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.810
And it's interesting how
the Glassware submissions

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.160
have grown over time.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.873
We also want to
grow the team to be

00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.560
a bit more responsive to that.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.470
AUDIENCE: And out curiosity, how
many Glassware submissions do

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.710
you receive?

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.620
Or is that--

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You know, I
don't have that number with me

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:42.850
today.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.850
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:15:50.014 --> 00:15:54.340
AUDIENCE: Hey, I have a
question about the standby mode.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.170
In the-- before
XE18, I think, there

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.670
was no vision feedback
on the display.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.630
So it was great
for saving battery.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.160
I would put it on standby or
would take pictures and record

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.910
videos and saving battery.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.560
And now with the
XE18, the display

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.230
turns on so I get a
feedback, which is great.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.250
But then I lose battery faster.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.250
What's up with that?

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.280
Is that something for the
privacy issue you mentioned?

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.780
JEFF HARRIS: I'm actually not
aware of that behavior change.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.350
So standby mode, you mean
when you press the button

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.440
on the side of Glass?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.420
So that should turn off the
display and you're saying it

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.230
doesn't?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.650
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.150
Yes.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.680
So now it goes on standby
mode, so I cannot tap anymore.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.830
But when I take a
picture, record a video,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.230
the screen turns back on.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.650
JEFF HARRIS: I see.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Every
time you take a picture,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.620
record a video, the
screen should turn on,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.330
whether you're in
standby mode or not.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.720
AUDIENCE: Different question
about upgrading a Mirror

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.270
API to add additional
permissions.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.890
So if you have a Glassware
that only does one permission

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.440
and you have
additional permissions,

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.020
for example, the authentication.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:07.030
How does that user flow and
then also the development flow

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.250
work with adding
new permissions?

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
This is a challenge.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.668
Jeff and I have talked
about this a lot, right?

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:18.460
Because you want
to give-- you want

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.049
to get permission
for those things

00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:22.554
that you're doing with
your application that day.

00:17:22.554 --> 00:17:23.970
And if you have
another permission

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.839
for some future
feature, like it's

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.390
weird to ask the user for that
even though you're not using it

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.020
right away.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.710
You really want
just the permission

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.590
you're going to use
and then expand.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.720
And this is OAuth problem as
much as it is anything else.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.600
Is they whenever you
expand permission,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.270
you need the user to go
through that flow again.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.985
A way that you can
do this today is

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:46.335
that you can notify the
users in an appropriate way

00:17:46.335 --> 00:17:48.210
and just have them go
through the flow again.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.050
It could be as simple
as going to MyGlass

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.840
and turn it off
and on or could be

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.090
like clicking a link that
brings them to that flow

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.129
and they just re-accept
their permissions which

00:17:56.129 --> 00:17:58.420
updates your token and then
you have those permissions.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.090
There's probably more that
we could do here with MyGlass

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.215
and we're definitely
exploring options around that.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.397
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:11.397 --> 00:18:12.980
I'm going back to
the earlier question

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.620
of using the
authentication in GDK.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.690
And you gave a solution.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.350
Is there a way to find
all these solutions in

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.370
somewhere in the Help
or [INAUDIBLE] of GDK?

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:24.870
Like--

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.911
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, yeah.

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:27.540
You mean like to
use the ADB shim

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.330
to get the account
on the device?

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.985
Tony, do you know if we
have documentation on that?

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.860
If not, we should probably
get some together.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.842
I can make a post.

00:18:34.842 --> 00:18:35.800
AUDIENCE: Next release.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There is
the Android documentation

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.489
about this.

00:18:38.489 --> 00:18:40.285
It's Account Manager
stuff, right?

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:43.390
And there is a way to use ADB to
get an account onto the Account

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.110
Manager.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.730
Remember that Glass is built on
Android and whenever possible,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.860
we do things in the
standard Android way.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.210
All we're doing with
the GDK authentication

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.050
is when we deliver
the APK to the device,

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.050
we also deliver an
account that gets

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.800
added to the Account
Manager, based

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.116
on the credentials you gave
during the sign up process.

00:19:02.116 --> 00:19:03.490
So all you're
doing with the shim

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.062
there is using ADB
to add that account.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.520
AUDIENCE: But there
is the problem,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.730
some of the GDK
features and all.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.130
I can send you a list.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.210
We are struggling
how to test this

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.800
without-- you know, before
we publish it and all.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, I mean
before you get into the review

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.070
process, you need
to test through ADB.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.680
That's the right way to do it.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.420
Once you get it in
the review process--

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.680
and Jeff was talking about how
we can whitelist the Glassware

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.180
for specific Google accounts or
a group or even a Google Apps

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.360
domain-- we can do that
pretty soon in the process.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.000
So as soon as you
enter that process

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.416
and as you're
working on feedback,

00:19:39.416 --> 00:19:42.356
you could also debug any
account issues that come up.

00:19:42.356 --> 00:19:43.980
AUDIENCE: My next
question is, is there

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.140
any plan to support webview?

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.700
Or is there way to
support webview today?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: A plan
to support webview?

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.970
I'm looking at Tony and Jeff.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.541
I don't know.

00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.290
JEFF HARRIS: You can
use Chrome View today

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.870
like you can on Android, right?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.754
Yeah.

00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:04.420
That stuff should all
work just the same

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.010
as it does on regular Android.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.560
AUDIENCE: So is there
anything special or should we?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.920
JEFF HARRIS: I mean, the
interface won't look as good

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920
if you look on most
websites because they're not

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.580
as optimized for a small screen
but it is the same rendering

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.650
engine so it should work
just the same in KitKat,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.406
MR1 version, so--

00:20:21.406 --> 00:20:22.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.550
Thank you.

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:32.480
AUDIENCE: At what
point should we

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.900
be submitting stuff for review?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.790
When it's totally complete,
when it's feature complete,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.200
when we've got a
really, really-- we're

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.935
really on the way and we're
ready to add authentication?

00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:44.810
At what point do you
want to start seeing it?

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So given
the announcements today,

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.610
this is the right
way to go about it--

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.980
is you use the Glassware
Flow Designer to create

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.900
a flow of how you
want the UI to work.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.900
And this is part of
your design process.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.440
Submit that before you start
developing and we'll give you

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.270
feedback on the overall,
like the big pieces

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.610
of the application, if there's
anything there to talk about.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.940
Then you start developing.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.800
The point at which you're
in near final testing,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.620
you've got all your
big pieces in place,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.230
and it looks the way
that you want it to,

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.170
and you start the
testing and debugging

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.970
phase, that's when
you want to submit it

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.880
to the Glassware review process.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.170
And then we'll be part
of that process with you.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.890
All right I think with time,
we'll take two more questions.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.900
AUDIENCE: Just to say a
followup about updating APKs.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.845
So is it correct
that the only way

00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:38.340
to do that is by basically
resubmitting through that form?

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.560
That's not a way to
automatically add a new APK.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So if
you're in the review process

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.290
and you've made changes
based on the feedback,

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.380
you'll have a line to the team
and you can send them APKs

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.430
through that, through
emails and other methods.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.439
Once you've launch and
you have major features,

00:21:56.439 --> 00:21:58.730
that's when you're going to
go to that update form that

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.475
will be live in the
next couple days.

00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:01.310
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.750
And those updated
apps are automatically

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.880
pushed to users' devices?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:03.950
Is that correct?

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Correct.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.510
AUDIENCE:

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.630
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.910
Great.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.409
Thanks.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
One more question?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.221
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:13.420
So I submitted an app
to the Glassware gallery

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.980
about a month ago and I
haven't heard any feedback yet.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.070
So what are-- what's
like the timeline

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.160
to kind of hear feedback?

00:22:22.494 --> 00:22:24.660
JEFF HARRIS: A month,
unfortunately, is not atypical

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.340
right around now.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.340
We've been kind of heads
down with getting stuff

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.980
ready for I/O, so I would expect
you should hear in less than a

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.480
month.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.306
But in around a
month is probably

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.930
what most people have
been experiencing

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.870
over the past couple months.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.745
So I would expect feedback soon.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:40.447
If you tell me the app
afterwards, I can check, too.

00:22:40.447 --> 00:22:42.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And, again,
because of the announcements

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.690
today, there's going
to be earlier feedback.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.760
So our goal is to start getting
you feedback much earlier

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.390
than a month.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.990
And hopefully
overall, the process

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.222
will take less time, as well.

00:22:52.222 --> 00:22:53.680
So that's about
time for questions.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.000
We'll be around for a
few minutes afterwards.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.730
And if you have any questions
about your specific Glassware,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.550
Jeff and I'll be around
for a little while.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.090
Please do go to this URL,
engage with the documentation,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.720
have a chat with us online.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.810
It is our goal to make the
review process what developers

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:10.660
want it to be.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.030
When we started building
this review process,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.070
it was to help developers make
as awesome the Glassware they

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.440
can and to help
with that process.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.367
It's still the goal.

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.450
We want to make it faster.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.810
We want to make it more helpful.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.680
We want to get really
awesome Glassware launched.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.830
Thank you so much.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.380
Thanks.
