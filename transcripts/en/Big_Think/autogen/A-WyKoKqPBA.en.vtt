it's it's not so much tips that I have
 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.940
it's it's not so much tips that I have
but what we're seeing is exactly why we

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950
but what we're seeing is exactly why we
 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.469
but what we're seeing is exactly why we
wrote the book so we're seeing these

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479
wrote the book so we're seeing these
 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.870

their operations so for example you have
companies with different departments all

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010
companies with different departments all
 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.740
companies with different departments all

other to to understand why they're doing
 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.030
other to to understand why they're doing
all of these things so that's one

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
all of these things so that's one
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.950
all of these things so that's one
example another example is you have a

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240
traditionally and never had that so we
 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.150
traditionally and never had that so we
see these as social media integration

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160
see these as social media integration
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.900
see these as social media integration

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910
hurdles and and what we're seeing is
 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.010
hurdles and and what we're seeing is
that these are indicative of much deeper

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020
that these are indicative of much deeper
 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.480
that these are indicative of much deeper
organizational issues so in these two

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490
organizational issues so in these two

organizational issues so in these two

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.100
examples one is that you have silos that
don't communicate or don't collaborate

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110

development problem it's like a culture
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.129
development problem it's like a culture
change problem the other example with

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139
change problem the other example with
 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.589
change problem the other example with
policies maybe you don't actually trust

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599
