00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
attention from the user well this is a
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840
attention from the user well this is a
this is a really good question and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
this is a really good question and
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359
this is a really good question and
nothing substitutes for a good subtle

knowledge about how users are
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050
knowledge about how users are
interacting with your apps so if you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
interacting with your apps so if you
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.550
interacting with your apps so if you
haven't done a little user research I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
haven't done a little user research I
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350
haven't done a little user research I
would suggest that you go do some before

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
would suggest that you go do some before
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810
would suggest that you go do some before
you tackle this step but I think there's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
you tackle this step but I think there's
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310
you tackle this step but I think there's
a there's first of all there's a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
a there's first of all there's a
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200
a there's first of all there's a
distinction that we that we really need

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
distinction that we that we really need
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179
distinction that we that we really need
to make there are times when you will

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
to make there are times when you will
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249
to make there are times when you will
absolutely need your users attention

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
absolutely need your users attention
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200

maybe have an update maybe there's
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.130
maybe have an update maybe there's
something that's absolutely critical

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
something that's absolutely critical
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710
something that's absolutely critical
about continued use of the app you need

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
about continued use of the app you need
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630
about continued use of the app you need
their attention there are other times

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
their attention there are other times
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399
their attention there are other times
when you just want your users attention

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
when you just want your users attention
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980
when you just want your users attention
it's really important to distinguish

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
it's really important to distinguish
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.280

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700
that app that's constantly making
demands on your one on your user whether

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
demands on your one on your user whether
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679
demands on your one on your user whether
you want it or you just or whether you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
you want it or you just or whether you

makes sense so what are some things that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490
makes sense so what are some things that
 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.130
makes sense so what are some things that
developers need to keep in mind when

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
developers need to keep in mind when
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.080

they're asking their users to pay

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090

well let's sure first of all let's share

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900
well let's sure first of all let's share
 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200
well let's sure first of all let's share
some examples about wanting versus

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
some examples about wanting versus
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.180
some examples about wanting versus
needing okay and I think the first thing

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190
needing okay and I think the first thing
 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.160
needing okay and I think the first thing
is it's really important to imagine that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170
is it's really important to imagine that
 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380
is it's really important to imagine that
your app doesn't just rely on the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390
your app doesn't just rely on the
 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.660
your app doesn't just rely on the
phone's battery doesn't just rely on the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670
phone's battery doesn't just rely on the
 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.490
phone's battery doesn't just rely on the
network connection doesn't just rely on

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
network connection doesn't just rely on
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.250
network connection doesn't just rely on
the computing capacity of that device it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
the computing capacity of that device it
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320
the computing capacity of that device it
also relies on another finite resource

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
also relies on another finite resource
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.610
also relies on another finite resource
which is your users attention let's say

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620
which is your users attention let's say
 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.380
which is your users attention let's say
that the app has just gone through an

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
that the app has just gone through an
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.630
that the app has just gone through an
update and that update is available to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640
update and that update is available to
 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.300
update and that update is available to
be released um let's say in fact that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310

more permissions but also as you've
 

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.540
more permissions but also as you've
updated the new version there's some

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:46.550
updated the new version there's some
 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.010
updated the new version there's some
changes you've made to the backend and

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.020
changes you've made to the backend and
 

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.130
changes you've made to the backend and
you need to basically move users off of

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.140
you need to basically move users off of
 

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.690
you need to basically move users off of
the old back-end into the new back-end

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:52.700
the old back-end into the new back-end
 

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.810
the old back-end into the new back-end
so it's critical in this situation to to

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:55.820
so it's critical in this situation to to
 

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.220
so it's critical in this situation to to
actually make sure everybody has

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:57.230
actually make sure everybody has
 

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.800
actually make sure everybody has
migrated first before you turn off the

00:09:59.800 --> 00:09:59.810
migrated first before you turn off the
 

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.960
migrated first before you turn off the
old web services that you have running

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:01.970
old web services that you have running
 

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.850
old web services that you have running
and that is actually something

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:03.860
and that is actually something
 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.290
and that is actually something
developers are some application

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:05.300
developers are some application
 

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.700
developers are some application
developers don't take into account which

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:06.710
developers don't take into account which
 

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.620
developers don't take into account which
leads to a pretty bad user experience so

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:08.630
leads to a pretty bad user experience so
 

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.680
leads to a pretty bad user experience so
when users of the older applications go

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:11.690
when users of the older applications go
 

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.240
when users of the older applications go
to actually run them they just stop

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.250
to actually run them they just stop
 

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.830
to actually run them they just stop
working which is which is pretty awful

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:14.840
working which is which is pretty awful
 

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.720
working which is which is pretty awful
and so you have to keep in mind that it

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.730
and so you have to keep in mind that it
 

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.810
and so you have to keep in mind that it
takes time for updates to reach all the

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:19.820
takes time for updates to reach all the
 

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.310
takes time for updates to reach all the
users of your of your application so

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320
users of your of your application so
 

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.500
users of your of your application so
make sure that you're checking to see

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:23.510
make sure that you're checking to see
 

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.000
make sure that you're checking to see
how many times

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.010
how many times
 

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.770
how many times
your old web services are being used and

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:26.780
your old web services are being used and
 

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.080
your old web services are being used and
so on before you actually decide to turn

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.090
so on before you actually decide to turn
 

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.400
so on before you actually decide to turn
them down

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.410
them down
 

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.900
them down
turn them off so another thing you might

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:31.910
turn them off so another thing you might
 

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.040
turn them off so another thing you might
want to do if it's a it's a really

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.050
want to do if it's a it's a really
 

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.600
want to do if it's a it's a really
critical upgrade and you can't really

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:34.610
critical upgrade and you can't really
 

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.120
critical upgrade and you can't really
wait I consider actually giving them an

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.130
wait I consider actually giving them an
 

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.030
wait I consider actually giving them an
explicit notification and and this way

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040
explicit notification and and this way
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.800
explicit notification and and this way
you know at the very least when they

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:41.810
you know at the very least when they
 

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.650
you know at the very least when they
need it they won't be surprised that

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:44.660
need it they won't be surprised that
 

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.670
need it they won't be surprised that
it's not working anymore

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680
it's not working anymore
 

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.960
it's not working anymore
because you've actually done the work

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:46.970
because you've actually done the work
 

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.630
because you've actually done the work
and you've actually notified them ahead

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:49.640
and you've actually notified them ahead
 

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.010
and you've actually notified them ahead
of time that they do need to perform

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.020
of time that they do need to perform
 

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.130
of time that they do need to perform
this update and you know this is that

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.140
this update and you know this is that
 

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.080
this update and you know this is that
this is really this is a this is also an

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.090
this is really this is a this is also an
 

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.790
this is really this is a this is also an
important topic for developers to

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800
important topic for developers to
 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.530
important topic for developers to
remember because notifications can be

00:10:59.530 --> 00:10:59.540
remember because notifications can be
 

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.940
remember because notifications can be
super helpful there are lots of

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:00.950
super helpful there are lots of
 

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.070
super helpful there are lots of
opportunities to to inform and to engage

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.080
opportunities to to inform and to engage
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.110
opportunities to to inform and to engage
your users through notifications but

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120
your users through notifications but
 

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.760
your users through notifications but
it's equally important that you don't

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:06.770
it's equally important that you don't
 

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.590
it's equally important that you don't
have to turn everything into a

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600
have to turn everything into a
 

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.470
have to turn everything into a
notification so let's say you figured

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480
notification so let's say you figured
 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.760
notification so let's say you figured
you've met you you've done your research

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.770
you've met you you've done your research
 

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.440
you've met you you've done your research
you know how your users are engaging

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:14.450
you know how your users are engaging
 

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.380
you know how your users are engaging
with your pizza delivery app and you

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:17.390
with your pizza delivery app and you
 

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.410
with your pizza delivery app and you
know how to time that there's there are

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.420
know how to time that there's there are
 

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.110
know how to time that there's there are
good ways and less good ways to reach

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120
good ways and less good ways to reach
 

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.270
good ways and less good ways to reach
out for that for that for that for the

out for that for that for that for the
 

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.730
out for that for that for that for the
rating or for some feedback you know you

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:27.740
rating or for some feedback you know you
 

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.580
rating or for some feedback you know you
know that you've done it the users had

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:30.590
know that you've done it the users had
 

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.350
know that you've done it the users had
the pizza and the pizzas been deliver

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
the pizza and the pizzas been deliver
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.270
the pizza and the pizzas been deliver
it's about 60 minutes that's the right

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:34.280
it's about 60 minutes that's the right
 

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.850
it's about 60 minutes that's the right
time to reach out to them that may also

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:36.860
time to reach out to them that may also
 

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.860
time to reach out to them that may also
be the right time to to give them other

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:38.870
be the right time to to give them other
 

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.230
be the right time to to give them other
notifications related to for example

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240
notifications related to for example
 

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.120
notifications related to for example
changes in payment it might be an

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.130
changes in payment it might be an
 

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.930
changes in payment it might be an
opportunity other kinds of non-critical

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:45.940
opportunity other kinds of non-critical
 

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.160
opportunity other kinds of non-critical
changes in payment options changes in

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.170
changes in payment options changes in
 

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.040
changes in payment options changes in
selection of pizzas other kinds of

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.050
selection of pizzas other kinds of
 

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.210
selection of pizzas other kinds of
non-critical things you might consider

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.220
non-critical things you might consider
 

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.220
non-critical things you might consider
matching these intelligently and

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.230
matching these intelligently and
 

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.710
matching these intelligently and
delivering them at a time you know that

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720
delivering them at a time you know that
 

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.690
delivering them at a time you know that
the user is in a state of mind to pay

00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:58.700
the user is in a state of mind to pay
 

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.130
the user is in a state of mind to pay
attention to them you know that makes a

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.140
attention to them you know that makes a
 

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.710
attention to them you know that makes a
lot of sense so now I'm so I guess the

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720
lot of sense so now I'm so I guess the
 

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.260
lot of sense so now I'm so I guess the
the most important thing is that the

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.270
the most important thing is that the
 

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.900
the most important thing is that the
timing is critical and that

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:06.910
timing is critical and that
 

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.290
timing is critical and that
understanding the difference between

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.300
understanding the difference between
 

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.180
understanding the difference between
what is engagement and what is an

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.190
what is engagement and what is an
 

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.220
what is engagement and what is an
interruption so like in this situation

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:12.230
interruption so like in this situation
 

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:19.060
interruption so like in this situation
like Mille I need to rate my pizza like

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.070
like Mille I need to rate my pizza like
 

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.820
like Mille I need to rate my pizza like

the feature is a bad thing I do need
 

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.120
the feature is a bad thing I do need
that feedback but the but the

that feature is surfaced in the user
 

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.780
that feature is surfaced in the user
experience determines whether whether

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:31.790
experience determines whether whether
 

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.640

the user actually is delighted by it or

is somewhat annoyed by it right we can
take an example of a notification that

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:38.730
take an example of a notification that
 

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.780
take an example of a notification that
can be either an interruption or an

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:41.790
can be either an interruption or an
 

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.790
can be either an interruption or an

opportunity to engage depending on its

opportunity to engage depending on its
timing right Pizza app let's say

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380

that makes perfect sense
so so again as a developer then it's

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.210
so so again as a developer then it's
 

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.810
so so again as a developer then it's

so I've seen this in some applications

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480
so I've seen this in some applications
 

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.110
so I've seen this in some applications
where notifications are used as a way to

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120
where notifications are used as a way to
 

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.820
where notifications are used as a way to
debug things which is obviously a very

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:40.830
debug things which is obviously a very
 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.320
debug things which is obviously a very
negative thing and I've also seen

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.330
negative thing and I've also seen
 

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.180
negative thing and I've also seen
persistent notifications for example in

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.190
persistent notifications for example in
 

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.000
persistent notifications for example in
Android used to basically notify the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.010
Android used to basically notify the
 

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.920
Android used to basically notify the
user that an application is running or

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:48.930
user that an application is running or

something is connected those are really
 

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.650
something is connected those are really
bad and they need to go away right

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660
bad and they need to go away right
 

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.260
bad and they need to go away right
that's right so back to the story about

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.270
that's right so back to the story about
 

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.750
that's right so back to the story about
the little boy who cried wolf or Chicken

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.330
how what your users patterns of activity
 

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.870
how what your users patterns of activity
are by using what we think of as

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880
are by using what we think of as
 

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.150
are by using what we think of as
attention profiling you can change how

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160
attention profiling you can change how
 

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.740
attention profiling you can change how
your notifications occur and when

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:09.750
your notifications occur and when
 

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.570
your notifications occur and when
certain kinds of activities how certain

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:11.580
certain kinds of activities how certain
 

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.820
certain kinds of activities how certain
kinds of activities are best and carried

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:13.830
kinds of activities are best and carried
 

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.330
kinds of activities are best and carried
out no that makes sense so now this data

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.340
out no that makes sense so now this data
 

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.400
out no that makes sense so now this data
this attention profiling data like it

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.410
this attention profiling data like it
 

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.810
this attention profiling data like it
can be collected in a variety of ways

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820
can be collected in a variety of ways
 

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.630
can be collected in a variety of ways
like we could actually have analytics

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:23.640
like we could actually have analytics
 

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.940
like we could actually have analytics
running or think they actually pieces of

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:25.950
running or think they actually pieces of
 

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.760
running or think they actually pieces of
code that are basically generating

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:28.770
code that are basically generating
 

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.590
code that are basically generating
analytics data that are running on the

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600
analytics data that are running on the
 

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.060
analytics data that are running on the
device that then send all this

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.070
device that then send all this
 

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.860
device that then send all this
information to the server where it's

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:33.870
information to the server where it's
 

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.860
information to the server where it's
stored deeper analytics can be run and

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:36.870
stored deeper analytics can be run and
 

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.500
stored deeper analytics can be run and
then patterns can be predicted that

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:39.510
then patterns can be predicted that
 

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.660
then patterns can be predicted that
actually notified the application about

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:41.670
actually notified the application about
 

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.340
actually notified the application about
how a user actually interacts with it

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.350
how a user actually interacts with it
 

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.010
how a user actually interacts with it
now this data can then be used to

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.020
now this data can then be used to
 

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.990
now this data can then be used to
determine when scheduling operations

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000
determine when scheduling operations
 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.300
determine when scheduling operations
should happen between the applications

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
should happen between the applications
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.680
should happen between the applications
running on the device and and whatever

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:51.690
running on the device and and whatever
 

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.240
running on the device and and whatever

now alternatively if developers don't

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.070
now alternatively if developers don't
 

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.160
now alternatively if developers don't
have such sophisticated ways to make

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.170
have such sophisticated ways to make
 

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.070
have such sophisticated ways to make
this happen

00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.080
this happen
 

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.290
this happen
there's a simpler solution which is

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:01.300
there's a simpler solution which is
 

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.520
there's a simpler solution which is
let's say you have an RSS reader

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:02.530
let's say you have an RSS reader
 

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.410
let's say you have an RSS reader
application and you have like hundreds

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.420
application and you have like hundreds
 

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.720
application and you have like hundreds
of feats that you subscribe to it would

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:06.730
of feats that you subscribe to it would
 

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.820
of feats that you subscribe to it would
be appropriate for that application to

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:08.830
be appropriate for that application to
 

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.430
be appropriate for that application to
ask you when you first run it how often

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:11.440
ask you when you first run it how often
 

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.290
ask you when you first run it how often
do you want to update do you want it to

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:13.300
do you want to update do you want it to
 

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.000
do you want to update do you want it to
happen for every single change in your

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.010
happen for every single change in your
 

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.680
happen for every single change in your
feats you will want it to happen once a

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:16.690
feats you will want it to happen once a
 

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.390
feats you will want it to happen once a
day twice a day once a week and so on so

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400
day twice a day once a week and so on so
 

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.520
day twice a day once a week and so on so
there's high tech solutions to this and

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:20.530
there's high tech solutions to this and
 

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.830
there's high tech solutions to this and
low tech solutions but the important

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:22.840
low tech solutions but the important
 

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.200
low tech solutions but the important
thing is to set the appropriate

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.210
thing is to set the appropriate
 

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.940
thing is to set the appropriate
expectation and also determine like for

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:26.950
expectation and also determine like for
 

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.250
expectation and also determine like for
example what the user is expecting so

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:29.260
example what the user is expecting so
 

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.200
example what the user is expecting so
that you don't disappoint them even with

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.210
that you don't disappoint them even with
 

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.440
that you don't disappoint them even with
these constrained resources that we have

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.450
these constrained resources that we have
 

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.090
these constrained resources that we have
so now let's say that you do you do

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.100
so now let's say that you do you do
 

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.560
so now let's say that you do you do
collect a lot of really high-quality

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:37.570
collect a lot of really high-quality
 

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.150
collect a lot of really high-quality
attention profiling data you can also

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160
attention profiling data you can also
 

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.430
attention profiling data you can also
consider providing this information to

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440
consider providing this information to
 

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.970
consider providing this information to
all the connected devices that the the

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:47.980
all the connected devices that the the
 

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.160
all the connected devices that the the
user has so that means that if you have

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.170
user has so that means that if you have
 

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.990
user has so that means that if you have
a signed-in experience you can actually

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000
a signed-in experience you can actually
 

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.660
a signed-in experience you can actually
take advantage of the fact that you know

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:54.670
take advantage of the fact that you know
 

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.360
take advantage of the fact that you know
something about how your users is using

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.370
something about how your users is using
 

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.500
something about how your users is using
their particular devices or your

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:58.510
their particular devices or your
 

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.480
their particular devices or your
applications on their device and then

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:00.490
applications on their device and then
 

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.940
applications on their device and then
you can use that data to drive the

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:02.950
you can use that data to drive the
 

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.460
you can use that data to drive the
experience on all them and all the

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:05.470
experience on all them and all the
 

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.350
experience on all them and all the
devices that are signed in to and you

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360
devices that are signed in to and you
 

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.940
devices that are signed in to and you
could search for example with sign-in

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:08.950
could search for example with sign-in
 

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.980
could search for example with sign-in
with Google you can create a piece

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:10.990
with Google you can create a piece
 

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.180
with Google you can create a piece

both those apps get smarter so that's

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.170
both those apps get smarter so that's
 

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.020
both those apps get smarter so that's
something which is I think a really big

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.030
something which is I think a really big
 

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.690

opportunity that that developers can can

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:24.700
opportunity that that developers can can
 

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.430
opportunity that that developers can can
take advantage of and and these

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440
take advantage of and and these

should cue notifications let's say

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.230
should cue notifications let's say
 

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.730
should cue notifications let's say
you're asleep and if the device knew

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:47.740
you're asleep and if the device knew
 

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.530
you're asleep and if the device knew
that then perhaps it would not send you

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.540
that then perhaps it would not send you
 

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.760
that then perhaps it would not send you
notifications while you're asleep right

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:50.770
