00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.621
The greatest common factor for
these two numbers is .8, and

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.142
the greatest common factor for
these two numbers is 3.5.

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:10.520
Nice thinking if you've
got these two factors.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.298
We know .8 divides into 1.6 two times.

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:17.191
So this simplifies to 2.

00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:21.879
And .8 divides into 2.4 three times.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.905
For these two numbers 3.5
divides into itself 1 time.

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.235
And 3.5 divides into 7, 2 times.

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:34.011
We've removed a common factor
from the numerator and

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.780
the denominator since
they simplify to 1.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.620
This leaves us with 3 times
1 in the numerator and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.200
2 times 2 in the denominator.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.598
So we'll have 3 divided by
4 times 10 to the third.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:53.590
Three-fourths is 75 hundredths, so
we have 0.75 times 10 to the third.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.710
Moving this decimal place
one spot to the right,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.270
we would decrease by a power of 10.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.300
So this number is the same as
7.5 times 10 to the second.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.250
Notice how this number is
in scientific notation.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.986
Since this number right here
is between one and ten.

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:14.010
The number above it isn't
in scientific notation.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.173
Since the absolute value of this
number is not between one and ten.

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:22.268
So for our final answer,
we know that this division

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:27.232
simplifies to 7.5 times 10
to the second or just 750.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:28.420
