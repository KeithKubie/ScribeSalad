00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Narrator] In previous
videos we talked about

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.558
the dramatic turn around
in the fourth century

00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:06.218
in terms of how Christianity

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:08.266
was treated in the Roman Empire.

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.435
As you enter into the fourth century

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:13.090
it's persecuted by Diocletian

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.309
but then Constantine takes power.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.107
He's sympathetic to the Christians.

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:20.185
He even convinced them in
order to unify the Christians

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.645
to have a more unified sense

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.011
of what it means to be Christian,

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:27.021
in order to settle things
like the Arian controversy

00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:29.274
and he converts himself to Christianity.

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.372
And as we exit the fourth century

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.741
you have Theodosius who makes Christianity

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.023
the official religion of the Roman Empire

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:40.701
and then begins to
persecute other religions.

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.897
Now what we're going to do in this video

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:45.759
is continue the narrative
and in particular,

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.368
we're going to see how
there's an evolution

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:52.399
between the church in the west
and the church in the east.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.752
In previous videos we already talk about

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:56.826
how the Roman Empire itself has

00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:00.977
initially administered
between west and east,

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.688
and then that administration
becomes more and more formal.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:08.108
Theodosius is the last emperor
to truly rule both halves.

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.219
They start getting ruled separately

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.225
and as you get into the latter
half of the fifth century

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:17.392
the western empire itself
falls to Germanic conquerors.

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:21.517
Now in previous videos we talk about

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:26.029
how the emperors who
rule from Constantinople

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:29.327
consider themselves to
continue the Roman Empire.

00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.897
They didn't call themselves
the Byzantine Empire

00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:33.258
as we now call them.

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:35.167
They call themselves the Roman Empire.

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:37.851
They consider themselves Roman emperors.

00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.414
The west falls as I just mentioned

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:43.247
into a bunch of Germanic kingdoms.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:48.646
Justinian is able to
reclaim a lot of the land

00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:52.146
formerly lost in the Western Roman Empire.

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:55.098
Now there's some interesting actors

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:57.783
we see emerging on this map

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:01.092
and once again, we're
now in the sixth century.

00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:02.906
You have these Germanic tribes,

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.398
the Visigothic Kingdoms
here in modern day Spain

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:09.672
and here in modern day
France you have the Franks,

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:12.002
and the word France really is referring to

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:16.075
land of the Franks,
another Germanic tribe.

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:20.511
Now, they are about to factor
much, much more relevantly

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:21.497
and when I say about I'm saying

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:23.450
over the next several hundred years

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.963
in this eventual division
culturally and religiously

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:30.429
between east and west.

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.298
As I mentioned in previous videos,

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:37.067
the division, yes, it will
center on notions of language.

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:40.321
In the west especially in
the church Latin is used.

00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:43.398
In the east in the church Greek is used.

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:44.623
There's spiritual debates

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:46.562
that we will touch on in a few minutes

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:48.582
but there's also a power struggle.

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:53.069
You have the Byzantine emperor
seated in Constantinople.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.148
You have the bishop of Rome

00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:59.550
now known as the pope,
really the pope of Rome

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.890
who considers themselves more and more

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.319
the leader of all of Christianity.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.784
And their argument there is

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.861
look, this is the church
that according to tradition

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:11.852
was founded by Peter,
first amongst the apostles.

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:14.477
You have the patriarch of Constantinople

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.239
and patriarchs of other
significant centers of Christianity

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.528
to say, wait, hold on a second.

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:24.756
Yes, bishop of Rome you are very important

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:27.983
but we consider you to
be first amongst equals.

00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:31.287
You don't have jurisdiction
over all of Christendom.

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:34.283
Together we have jurisdiction.

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:38.174
And this was to some degree
the case under Justinian

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.753
and it was very clear at this time

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:42.100
that the Byzantine
emperor was very powerful

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.673
not just over the temporal realm

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:46.415
really referring to the
day to day material realm,

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:48.993
but also a lot of influence
on the spiritual realm

00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:50.769
which was really supposed to be the domain

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.899
of the bishops or the
popes or the patriarchs.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.490
This notion of the Pentarchy was codified

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.720
in the Justinian law,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.840
this idea that these five
centers of Christianity

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.282
really have extra weight and collectively

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:06.310
are really leading Christendom.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.708
Now as I mentioned, things get interesting

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:11.625
as we fast forward about 250 years.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:15.236
Let's go to the year 800.

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:20.167
One thing you might notice
is that group in yellow,

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.549
the Franks have now conquered a lot more

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:24.594
and they're conquering
it under the leadership

00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:26.200
of Charlemagne.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.595
At the same time, you
see this green over here,

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:34.821
Islam has dramatically
spread from its founding

00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:38.804
in the early seventh
century all the way now

00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:41.953
as we're exiting the eighth century

00:04:41.953 --> 00:04:45.098
to cover most of the Middle East, Persia,

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:48.871
bordering on modern day
Pakistan, India, North Africa

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.849
and even going into modern day Spain.

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.781
At the same time especially because

00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:56.523
of this Islamic conquest,

00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:59.634
the Byzantine Empire and
the Byzantine emperor

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:01.634
is significantly weaker.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.075
You could imagine the pope
in Rome here is saying,

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:06.867
"Well, who's going to protect me

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:09.529
"especially from my political enemies?"

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.309
Now Charlemagne considers himself

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.289
something of a protector of Christianity.

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.132
And Pope Leo III goes
to him for protection

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:20.927
and Charlemagne is able
to actually provide it.

00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:24.507
And in exchange or perhaps
in thanks for that,

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:28.674
the pope crowns Charlemagne
as Holy Roman Emperor.

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.688
Now what's significant about this

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:36.007
is it really introduces
a fourth actor here

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:38.611
because the title Holy Roman Emperor

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.785
was intentionally given to say, look,

00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.505
now you Charlemagne, you are the heir

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:45.109
to the grandeur of Rome.

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:47.421
You are the heir to the Roman emperors.

00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:49.081
Now, you might be saying wait,

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.377
isn't that what the Byzantine
emperors thought they were?

00:05:51.377 --> 00:05:53.774
Didn't they think this
was the Roman Empire?

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:56.917
And at that time their
emperor was an empress.

00:05:56.917 --> 00:06:00.103
It was Empress Irene of Athens.

00:06:00.103 --> 00:06:03.197
And so once again, this is
creating further tension.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:07.284
They're using different
languages, Latin versus Greek.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.978
You now have the western pope

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:12.133
recognizing a different as you could say

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.522
Roman emperor in Charlemagne.

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:17.555
The nature of the west
is becoming more Germanic

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:19.715
and using the language Latin,

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.611
while the nature of the east

00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:25.012
is continuing in Greek traditions.

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:28.762
On top of that what you
have in the year 800,

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:31.536
you're actually in this period

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:33.182
where you've had several conflicts

00:06:33.182 --> 00:06:36.305
over this notion of Iconoclasm.

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:38.958
This Iconoclasm movement you could say

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.814
started in 726 when the
Byzantine emperor said

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:46.626
enough of these images of
Jesus and the Virgin Mary

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:49.154
and other figures of
Christianity in our churches.

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.152
Citing references in the
Old Testament saying that

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:53.755
hey, we shouldn't have these images.

00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:57.605
And so, this Iconoclasm or
this destroying of icons

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.166
starts to begin.

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:01.664
Well, the pope in the west they say,

00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:04.782
"Hey, we don't think we
have to listen to you.

00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:06.287
"I am the bishop of Rome.

00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:08.467
"I have universal jurisdiction."

00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:11.897
And then to add insult
to injury now in 800,

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:15.833
you have Charlemagne being
crowned Holy Roman Emperor.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.889
Now a thread further running through this

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.227
is something that we've talked
about in a previous video,

00:07:20.227 --> 00:07:22.925
this notion of filioque.

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:26.331
Where in 381 the Council
of Constantinople,

00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.739
they augment the Nicene
Creed where they say,

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.139
"And we believe in the Holy Spirit,

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.891
"the Lord and Giver of Life,

00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:34.339
"who proceeds from the Father."

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:37.524
While in the west they add
the Latin term filioque

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.008
which means and the Son.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:40.681
And this is touching
on some of these notion

00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.255
in the Arian Heresy where

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:44.455
where does the Holy Spirit proceed from

00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:47.211
if the Father and Son
are really co-divine,

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.645
co-equal, of the same substance?

00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:51.654
Shouldn't the Holy
Spirit proceed from both

00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:53.276
rather than just one?

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.411
While those in the east said hey,

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.846
this isn't what we agreed to.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:56.697
While those in the west say

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:59.027
we don't think it's so important
that you agree to things

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:01.686
because we have the seat at Rome,

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:04.829
the seat that was established by Peter.
