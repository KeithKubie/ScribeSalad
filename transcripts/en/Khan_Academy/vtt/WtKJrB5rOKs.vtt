00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
What determines our intelligence?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.700
One school of thought is that,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700
ok maybe, you are either just

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.340
born with it, either have it or you don't.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.640
Some people are smart,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.320
some people are less smart,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.920
or maybe you can change it.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.920
And it turns out there's actually been a lot

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.920
of research on this in the last few decades.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380
And

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.100
the answer is pretty clear that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.220
your intelligence

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.680
can actually be changed.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.340
What we've learned, what researchers have taught us,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.640
is that our brains are actually a lot like a muscle.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.660
We know that you can grow your muscles

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.320
by going into the gym,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.660
and doing exercise,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.340
and straining your muscles.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
You don't  just work on things that are easy for your muscles to do;

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.380
you do things that your muscles have to struggle with,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.520
that your muscles have to strain with

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.340
and then they rebuild themselves

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920
and they come back stronger.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.340
By struggling, its a signal to your body

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.020
to devote more resources

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.720
to that part of the body.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.340
And we see that exact same thing with the brain .

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.940
And here, just a couple of examples

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.960
of it.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.340
This is first one,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.680
This shows how

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.780
the human brain develops

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240
in early childhood.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.340
This is a depiction of the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340
neurons in a brain

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.740
at birth.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.340
And then over time, as a child develops

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340
It interacts with its environment,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.960
it tries things out,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.340
it struggles to talk,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340
to converse,to interact with folks,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.340
to understand the world around it.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.340
And as it struggles,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340
by age 6 you have a much

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.500
deeper and much stronger connectedness

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.840
between the different neurons.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.280
Similarly, similarly,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.180
I can never say that word,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.660
These are depictions of, these are the neurons

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.660
of two different scenarios.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660
This is the nerves

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.660
of animals ,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.660
that were in un stimulating environments:

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.660
where they are not around other animals.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660
They are in a bear cage.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.660
This is the brain

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.080
of an animal that is

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.800
in a stimulating environment,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
that is constantly being challenged,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.160
that is constantly looking at

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.720
stimulating new things.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.320
And so the big take away

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320
from this whole area of research

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.800
is you absolutely can change

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.380
your intelligence.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.120
That your brain is like a muscle

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.660
the more you use it,the stronger it gets

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.680
and that the best way to grow it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.000
isn't to do things that are easy for you.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520
That might help a little bit

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.300
but what really helps your brain

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.920
is when you struggle with things.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.900
And actually research shows that your brain

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.040
grows the most not when you get a question right,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.280
but when you get a question wrong.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.540
So at least for me this is incridibly exciting

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.220
because, unless we know

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.960
that when I'm going through something.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.540
And I'm facing those times of maybe a little bit of  adversity,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.540
or a little bit of frustration.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.400
I can -

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.140
feel good about the fact that those

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.280
are actually the times that I'm growing the most.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.200
And this isn't just something that I'm saying

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.880
nice words. Research tells us that when

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.260
you get something wrong,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.620
when you challenge your brain,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.560
when you review why you got it wrong,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.360
when you really process that feedback ,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.300
that's when your brain grows the most.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.700
And then if you keep doing that

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.120
you are well on your way to having a stronger, more able,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.540
and I guess ,smarter brain.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540
