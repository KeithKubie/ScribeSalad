00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.390
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.760
[ Silence ]

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.620
&gt;&gt; MaryAnn Sonntag: Now I
have the honor and pleasure

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.150
of introducing you to a
well known illustrator

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.880
and author, Melissa Sweet.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.450
Melissa is herself some
writer and some illustrator.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.300
Pardon me for taking liberty with
the title of her latest book,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.760
Some Writer!: The Story
of E.B. White.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.740
Okay. Melissa has illustrated
nearly 100 children's books ranging

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.350
from board books to
non-fiction titles.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.740
Born and raised in New
Jersey, Melissa graduated

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.920
from Endicott College and the
Kansas City Institute of Art.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.680
Her artwork has appeared not only
in books but in The New York Times,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.360
Martha Stewart Living, Madison
Park Greetings, and Smilebox.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.680
Melissa has received many
honors for her illustrating

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.590
and writing including two
Caldecott honors, a Sibert medal,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.650
the Orbis Pictus Award,
the Stieglitz Strauss award

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440
and the Cook [phonetic] prize.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.920
That's a lot of honors,
don't you think.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.670
[Clapping] Yes.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.160
Reviewers have described her
unique mixed media illustrations

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.330
as creative delights
and I would agree.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.700
From her first job illustrating
the Pinky and Rex series

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.450 position:56%
to her latest adventure in authoring
and illustrating the life story

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.050
of E.B. White, Melissa Sweet brings
to her readers breathtaking art,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.140
well researched and
designed non-fiction,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.580
and now the masterpiece biography
of E.B. White written for pre-teens

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.750
but I'm 66 years old and think
this wonderful book will appeal

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.620
to readers of all ages.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.510 position:56%
I now present to you, Melissa Sweet.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.510
[ Clapping ]

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.270
[ Silence ]

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.570
&gt;&gt; Melissa Sweet: Good morning.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.020
Thank you for that
lovely introduction.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.580
They've made me above
these microphones.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.880
I feel better.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.370
It's good.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.150
So salutations are in order.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.880
Thank you.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.950
I'm thrilled to be here and to
introduce my new book, Some Writer!

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.450
but first let's take a listen

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.510
to E.B. White reading
from Charlotte's Web.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.860
[ Silence ]

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.640
Ah.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.110
[ Silence ]

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.090
I think our sound -- well our
sound isn't -- is -- that's okay.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.170
Maybe we can hear it at the end.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.390
I had a beautiful audio
of E.B. White.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.540 position:56%
I don't know if any of you know that
E.B. White did the audio version

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.420 position:56%
of Charlotte's Web a number of years
ago along with Trumpet of the Swan.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.080
And so I listened to that for about
three years nonstop while I was

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.990
researching this book.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.040
So young scholars as Stuart
Little often called his students,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.550
often ask me where ideas come from.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.490
And the idea for this book
came innocently enough.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.190
I was walking my dogs as I do every
day and sometimes ideas come easy

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.690
and sometimes you have
to go after them.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.620
This one just popped
into my head one day

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.060
as I was looking for
next my biography.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.160
I wanted to do another biography.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.890
I had done a few and I love
the research part of it.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.320
Life is always a rich and
steady time when you're waiting

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.640
for something to happen or
to hatch, E.B. White said.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.320
And one of the things I discovered

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.560
in researching this biography was
how much E.B. White loved eggs.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.860
Eggs of all kinds.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.170
So the book begins
and opens with eggs.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.810
He wrote a chicken primer and of
course, Charlotte lays the eggs

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.460
in the doorway of the barn
which was the inspiration

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.060
of -- for Charlotte's Web.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.370
Immediately, questions came
up that had to be answered.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.750
I wanted to know how did he come up
with the idea for Charlotte's Web?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.160
How many drafts did it
take him to write the book?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.360
And living in Maine, I
knew that he loved Maine.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.660
How young was he when he
finally -- when he -- sorry.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.690
First came to Maine?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.460
And most importantly, what were
the names of all of his dogs?

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.350
So some of the dogs -- some of his
dogs have the same name as my dogs.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.660
We were totally different
kinds of kids but there --

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.810
we had a few things in common.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.550
When E.B. White was older,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.130
someone asked him what dime novels
he read when he was growing up?

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.850
And he said, never
read a dime novel.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.460
I spent my youth on a
bicycle and in trees.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.760
We had that in common.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.610
I spent my youth on
a bicycle with dogs.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.720 position:56%
I loved to go to the library but I
was not a particularly great reader.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.070
Doesn't mean I didn't like books
but I didn't love reading as much

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.900
as I did making art and playing
with these kids that you see.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.920
Who here had spirographs
and Etch-A-Sketches?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.520
Yes me too.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.860
So paint by numbers and color
forms and all those things --

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.570
these things that looks like
toys are really wonderful

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.050
design teachers.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.610
So I was learning to make design.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.410
I was kind of preparing
myself to be an artist.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.110
Anybody here grow up in the
New York metropolitan area

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.580
and have John Gnagy for -- a few
hands up there who taught us how

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.640
to draw on Saturday mornings.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.160
And of course, I go to
my studio all the time.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.960
More preparation.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.270
The artist Teresita
Fernandez said that --

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.740
says that making art is a
solitary process and it is.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.800
So every day I go to my studio
just the way people go to work.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.010
Kids go to school.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.240
I go to my studio.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.050 position:56%
Early on in my career, I read that
Joyce Carol Oates said that she went

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.340
to her -- she wrote for 4
hours a day and I thought

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.440
if it's good enough for Joyce
Carol that's good enough for me.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.870
So my studio is part library,
part kindergarten classroom.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.720
I have everything I need
to work there all day long

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.470
and I do work probably
more than four hours.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.080
My materials are very simple.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.030
I don't do any of my
art on computer.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.310
It's all by hand and it's typical
watercolor gwash [phonetic]

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.910
found objects.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.600
So I'm either writing a book
or I'm illustrating a book

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.160 position:56%
or I might be researching a book but
whatever I'm doing so as long as I'm

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.180
in my studio, I feel
that I'm working.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.240
So we'll move on from here.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.020
How do begin a biography of one
of America's most beloved writers?

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.210 position:56%
Well, I went back home after I had
that idea, about five minutes later.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.680
And I began -- I took the book
Letters of E.B. White off the shelf

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.310
and I began reading
everything he wrote.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.530
I went to Cornell where
he went to school.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.270
I actually saw his farm in Maine
although it's not a public place.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.500
The family brought me
there and of course,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.230
you could see the title
on this book.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.590
This book is revised and
edited by Martha White.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.470
Martha White is a neighbor and
friend of mine in Rockport, Maine.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.680
And she was generous enough to
talk with me fairly early on.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.200 position:56%
I had done quite a bit of work
before I talked to her but that's --

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.340
we'll talk more about that.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.190
And I had some preparation
with biographies.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.030
I had illustrated The Right
Word which is about Peter Roget,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.610
the man who invented the thesaurus.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.690
He was a list maker as a kid.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.690
So in any biography, who are
these people as children?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.680
Was anything ever hard for them?

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.840
What was -- what were their
defining moments that led them

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.300
to become the person they became?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.710
I wrote and illustrated
the Balloons Over Broadway.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.750
The story of Marionette maker,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.340
Tony Sarg who invented the
Macy's Parade balloons.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.510
And Horace Pippin who was a
self taught artist and he --

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.500
as a soldier in the war lost the
use of his right arm yet he went

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.000
onto become an American master.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.410
So all these people had hardships

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.710
and difficulties along the
way to get where they got.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.180
And I think that is
such a riveting part

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.680
of the research and
part of the story.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.390 position:56%
And lastly, William Carlos Williams,
and I'll show you a little bit

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.690
about how I break open
a book in my art.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.640
So a lot of my books -- a lot
of my art has books in it.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.150
And this is the spine of a
book that I've taken apart.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.950
The cover which I painted on and
then I placed it on the background.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.630
And much of my work
can be seen as a grid.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.240
So the grid is what
I hang my art on.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.000
Like a scaffolding or a skeleton.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.110
Design is not just
about making things.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.530
It's about making things happen
and this was absolutely a series

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.000
of teamwork between
Houghton Mifflin and myself.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.460
I do things -- give myself
assignments and made a timeline.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.690
I made a family tree
using a real tree.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.220
Why not? Just pull a tree out
of the ground and we use it.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.100
I had the pleasure of -- as
I said of visiting the farm

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.820
and I mapped the farm to give
myself a sense of where he lived

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:43.130
and also looking ways to tell the
story with maps and so I don't have

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.800
to say he went cross
country after Cornell.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.600
I can show where he went
and what happened to.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.520
If there was one object,
though, I found was --

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.740
represented E.B. White was
the essence of his work,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.610
it was the typewriter but do kids
know what a manual typewriter is?

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.230
We put directions at the beginning.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.730
And I used the manual typewriter
in these chapter openers.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.030
This is an example of
an early chapter opener

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.560
where there's a typewriter
key and E.B. White's quotes.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.800
And then at the bottom is a label.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.820 position:56%
So also using office supplies like
he might have had at The New Yorker.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.390
E.B. White wrote so many
essays and beautiful letters.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.200
And as the research went on,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.510
I wanted to use those
quotes within the book.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.130
So I typed them up on a
manual typewriter and there --

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.800
I consider these a
hinge into his writing.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.130 position:56%
My text goes along and then you come
to one of his quotes which furthers

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.950
who he was a writer
and part of his life.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.480
Young scholars also want to know
how do I make those big collages

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.120
and how do they get in the book?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.980
Well I start with a form.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.280
And I do a lot of sketching.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.320 position:56%
And you'll see a little bit here
how I created one particular collage

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.310
for the Stuart Little page.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.220
And I'm doing a lot of sketches.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.270
And I'm trying to make that
scene where he drives his car

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.680
and he ends up at a general store.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.570
And my husband said -- I wanted
to create this scene of a porch.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.780
And I said should I make
a porch out of wood.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.080
I don't know how to do this.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.240
And he said no, just give it
porchness and it'll work fine.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.320
So I'm making all these pieces that
are going to go into the collage.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320
And again you can see
I'm taking apart a book

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.930
and I'm faking a book that's
going to go into the collage.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.800
There are dozens of
things that don't get used.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.010 position:56%
I've made but I've made Stuart
Little's wonderful birch bark canoe.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:43.300
I've made his bed made
out of clothes pins.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.160
So just like when you're a
kid and you're playing dolls

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.120
and you're making all this stuff, I
think that just never ended for me.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.580
I'm just continuing to
make these collages.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.080
These assemblages.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.040
So I think we don't have time to
see this whole thing but it ends

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.050
up looking a bit like this.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.740
You'll see in a second.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.180
I think. There.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.110
So that's the end -- the finished
collage after much pushing

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.470
around and pulling around.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.580
He worked for The New Yorker.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.840 position:56%
Some surprises in that research were

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.330
that he shared an office
with James Thurber.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.680
And the two of them, James Thurber

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.120
who would become a famous
humorist and cartoonist.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.630
Thurber was as gregarious
as White was reserved.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.360
And he also at The New
Yorker met his future wife,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.500
Katharine Sergeant Angell.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.280
Katharine Angell was
a fiction editor.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.810
They fell in love and married.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.930
She's also the mother
of Arthur Roger Angell.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.800
One of the things I love most

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.720
in E.B. White's writing
is The Elements of Style.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.100
That book came to him when
-- as when he was Cornell.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.450
Written by William Strunk.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.620 position:56%
We think of it now as Strunk and
White because years later, in the --

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.370
later in his life, he
edited and revised it.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.190
So Elements of Style
became Strunk and White.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.080
Strunk and White's
Elements of Style.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.140
Katharine and E.B. White spent
the latter part of the years

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.500
at their farm in Maine and that's

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.330
where he conceived the
story for Charlotte's Web.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.960
I'm not sure we're going to have
time to tell that whole story

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.890
but in essence, there
was a sick pig.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.960
And the pig sadly died.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.560
They tried their --
he tried his best

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.260
to save the pig's life but he died.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.240
And he said I knelt.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.170
I saw the pig was dead
and left him there.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.840
His face a mild look
expressive neither

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.320
of deep peace nor deep suffering
although I think he had suffered a

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.840
great deal.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.350
He buried the pig and
later said that I wanted

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.210
to find a way to save a pig's life.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.810
A while later he saw a
spider spinning a web

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.380
in the door yard of the barn.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.460
And he took that nest
-- sorry I said a web.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.900
I meant a nest.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.720
So she had laid her egg sack.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.310
He took it back to New York.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.610
The eggs hatched.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.360
All these little spiders
were all over his dresser.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.900
He discovered that the
spiders were aranea cavtica

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:21.070
and that he spent the next couple
of years researchign spiders.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.070
So he these two very
divergent episodes.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.010
Later, he was taken some slops
to the barn and he thought what

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.560 position:56%
if a spider could save a pig's life.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.830
He wrote his editor,
Ursula Nordstrom,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.290 position:56%
has there ever been a spider as a
main character in a children's book?

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.480
Not as far as she knew
not since Ms. Muffett.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.840
[Chuckling] So the story of
Charlotte's Web was born.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.210
He was illustrated by Garth
Williams who struggled

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.920
with anthropomorphizing Charlotte
and giving her a spider's face.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.950
E.B. White ended up accepting
the more scientific rendition

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:05.600 position:56%
of Charlotte and at the end, E.B.
White added three hairs and two eyes

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.830 position:56%
to Charlotte and Charlotte was born.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.240
There were many first drafts.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.100 position:56%
He started off I shall -- he
started off the book with Charlotte.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.610
Charlotte was a big, gray spider
living in the door yard of a barn

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.590
but then he changed
to Wilbur, the pig.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.840
I shall speak first of Wilbur.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.470
Another draft completely --
started completely with the barn

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.770
and all the animals in it.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.280
And then he switched to the humans.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.080
John Arable went out to the
barn with a lit lantern.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.450 position:56%
Finally setting the book aside, he
decided to start the book with Fern,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.850
the little girl, and he
-- it's the last line,

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.200
this penultimate last line
was where's Papa going

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.500
with that hand axe?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.690
Editing it down to where's
Papa going with that axe?

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.750
So I love showing these
five drafts in the book

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.250
because it shows how he worked the
way many of us work with editing.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.700
He was a consummate
editor and reviser.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.990
He said Charlotte's Web is about
friendship, life, and death.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:21.270
Stuart Little was about
the quest for beauty.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:26.130
And Trumpet of the Swan was a
love story not just between Louie,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:31.640
the swan, and his wife, Serena,
but between father and son.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:39.520
So E.B. White's work is so
accessible and so delightful,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.920
I was such an honor
to create this book

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.080
that incorporated a
lot of his writings.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.750
I'll read one quote.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.410
One last quote.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.510
We have time for one last quote.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:56.040
[ Silence ]

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.800
White writes, sailors have an
expression about the weather.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.370
They say the weather
is a great bluffer.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.680
I guess the same can be
true of our human society.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.500
Things could look dark
then a break shows

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.850
in the cloud and all is changed.

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.060
Sometimes rather suddenly.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.400
It is quite obvious that the human
race has made a queer mess of life

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.120
on this planet but as a people, we
probably harbor seeds of goodness

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.530
that have lane waiting
for a long time.

the conditions are right.

relentless, his inventiveness,

will enable him to claw his way out.
