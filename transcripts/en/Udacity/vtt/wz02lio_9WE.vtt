00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It turns out that this problem is actually remarkably similar to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the skier problem we did in the previous problem set,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we're going to have to use a lot of geometry to help us get through this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're first going to try and solve for what your speed is when you just jump of the swing,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and to know that, we're going to have to know how much potential energy you started with,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and to know how much potential energy you had, we're going to have to know

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
what your height was above the ground.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And doing a little trigonometry here, I find that the maximum height

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
achieved by the swinger is 5-4&lt;i&gt;cos 45°, and this turns out to be 2.17 m.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And using the equation for gravitational potential energy,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I find that my original potential energy is 1302 J.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I know that the original potential energy of this value of 1302 J

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is going to be exactly equal to my final potential energy plus my final kinetic energy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's start by solving for the final potential energy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Once again doing a little more trigonometry, I find that my final height above the ground is 1.54 m,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and using this height, I get a final potential energy of 924 J.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now from this equation, I know that the final kinetic energy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is just going to be equal to the difference in the two potential energies,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which is equal to 378 J and using the equation for kinetic energy,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I get that the final speed is equal to 3.55 m/s.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Alright, now that I know my speed when I'm jumping off the swing,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it should be pretty easy to figure out how far I go.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Alright, if I do a little geometry here, I see that the angle that the velocity that make the horizontal

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is exactly 30°, the angle of the pendulum.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And now that I know that this angle is 30°, I can solve for the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
x and y components of velocity as shown here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now I can use this kinematic equations here

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to solve for the time t when I finally reached the ground.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And note that this value of Δy is is not equal to 1 m when I jumped off the swing,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it's actually equal to this value hf and plugging in my numbers here

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then using the quadratic equation to solve for t, I find that t = -0.405 s or t = 0.761 s.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And just like in the ski jumping problem, we know that it's actually this value for time we care about.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This one we don't care about, so now we know it take me 0.761 s

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
after I jumped off of the swing to hit the ground.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And now let's figure out how much I move along the ground in this time.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
To calculate how far away from the swing I land, I'm going to use this kinematic equation here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And this time there is no acceleration in the x direction,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and plugging in my numbers I find that I've landed 2.34 m away from

00:02:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
where I jumped off the swing--great work!
