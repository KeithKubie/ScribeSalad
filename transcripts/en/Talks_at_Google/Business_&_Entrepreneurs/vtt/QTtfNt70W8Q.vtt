00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.840
GRAHAM ALLCOTT: Hello.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.290
The first thing to say is
thank you all for coming.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.540
I should probably say that
the turnout today perhaps

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.999
either reflects how amazing my
book is or the time of year,

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.581
and the fact that
everyone is starting

00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.060
to think about productivity
at the start of January.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.535
So welcome.

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:31.570
For the last just
coming up to 10 years,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.570
my life has been about
obsessing and thinking

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.120
about the subject
of productivity.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.604
It started out because I
myself had some big holes

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:42.520
in my own productivity,
and I didn't do things

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.850
particularly well.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.960
And I started to really go on
a journey of conquering that

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.717
for myself, and then
started to falling

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:50.800
into teaching other people
about what I'd learned,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.341
and teaching other
people on how they

00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.770
could start to develop their
own productivity, as well.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.530
So I'm going to talk
to you about some

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.570
of the key ideas
from my book, "how

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.930
to be a Productivity Ninja," and
hopefully give you a few ideas

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.480
and spark a few thoughts that
you can then take away and use

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.210
practically to make some changes
to the way that you work.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.270
So the first thing
I want to talk about

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.790
is the fact that often
there's a bit more

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.620
fatigue around
this whole subject,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.080
apart from, obviously, at
the very start of January.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.450
And the reason for that is
that I think a lot of people

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.370
have been familiar with some
of the key ideas and techniques

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.240
of time management.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.070
You've probably been on some
kind of time management course

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.700
before.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
Just by a show of hands,
who's been on some kind

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.630
of time management thing?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.760
And keep your hand up if
everything is now fixed,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.730
and it's all sorted, and you're
100% wonderful in the way

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.570
that you work.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.310
So I think, for me, time
management is broken,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.570
time management is dead.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.440
And I think the
flip side of that

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.930
is to start to think much more
about the idea of attention

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.560
management.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.110
So rather than thinking
about how we manage our time,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.104
really think about
attention as being

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:53.770
the most precious
resource that we have,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.740
and how can we get the
best out of those times

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.610
that we have the best attention.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.130
So I'm going to talk to
you about nine things

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.050
that you can do that
really help you to make

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.000
the best of your attention.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.760
I have nine different
mindsets, nine ways of thinking

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.460
that will really help you to
become a productivity ninja,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.410
and really help
you to move forward

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.422
in terms of turning some
those older time management

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:16.630
ideas into something a bit
more modern and a bit more

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.520
based in the world
that we live in today.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.510
So the first one of
those is zen-like calm.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.270
So often when I'm asked to
talk about productivity,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.640
one of the questions
that I ask back is,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
when was the time that
you were most productive?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.830
So just if you think for
a few moments about when

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.720
was the last time you
really felt, yes, I'm

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.320
really on top of this, this is
a moment of key productivity.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.397
Often, when people think
about that question,

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:41.980
one of the answers
that comes up a lot

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.420
is when I was on a deadline.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.774
So you're on this deadline.

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:45.940
You've got this thing to do.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.749
It's got to be in
at five o'clock.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:48.790
You've got this deadline.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.800
And everything else in
your life and everything

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.383
else in your brain
seems to fall away.

00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:54.130
And you get into
what psychologists

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.050
refer to as flow,
this kind of state

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.099
of being totally in the
moment, focused on one thing.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.640
You're not thinking
about what you're

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.840
going to have for
dinner today evening,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.215
you're not thinking
about emails,

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.920
you're just totally you in
that zone working on whatever

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.730
that thing is, whether
it's a document,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.220
whether it's ideas, whether
it's a thing that you're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.240
doing as a team.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.770
But everybody's
just kind of focused

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.380
or you're just really focused
on getting this thing delivered,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.070
and that becomes the only thing
in your world at that point.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.530
Now for me, the
problem with that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.430
is that deadlines
are really expensive.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.670
They cost us in terms of stress.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.260
We start to-- love the
people kind of getting out

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.580
of the way of the camera there.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.630
Love it.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.640
So a deadline will really cost
you a lot in terms of stress.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.099
If you're constantly
in deadlines

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.640
and you're constantly
using deadlines

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.160
as the thing that gets you
over the line with stuff,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.270
and you're leaving
everything to the last minute

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.940
and letting the deadline push
you forward, then after a while

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.070
you're going to burn
out, whereas really,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.850
what is a deadline doing anyway?

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.580
So what a deadline
does is it brings you

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.954
into this state
of zen-like calm.

00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:55.780
It forces you to say, this
is the most important thing,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.557
I know that nothing
else matters.

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:59.890
And my contention is you can
get to that place of saying

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.181
this is the most important
thing, nothing else matters,

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:03.100
without a deadline.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.725
And what you need to
do to get to there

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.035
is much clearer thinking in
terms of what's on my plate

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:09.410
so that you're really much
clearer about your priorities.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.659
So I'm going to talk you a
bit about how to get there,

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.360
but the idea is to
spend as much time as

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.026
possible in this state
of zen-like calm,

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:17.800
this state of flow,
and this state of I'm

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.990
working on one thing, I
really know what I'm doing,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.310
and I'm really clear and
focused on that one thing.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.820
This is how a lot of us
do spend a lot of time

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.830
in work, which is
that our brains are

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.375
just full of different ideas.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.250
And does this image
look familiar?

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.550
So we have this whole
sense of feeling overloaded

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.164
and overwhelmed, and
we have this sense

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:40.080
of there's a hundred
things we could be doing,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.180
we're not quite
sure where to start.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.680
David Allen, who wrote the
book "Getting Things Done,"

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.221
has this lovely line, which is
"the mind is for having ideas,

00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:47.680
not for holding them."

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.440
So the problem is, if you've
got all these different things

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.000
going on in your
head, then it becomes

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.710
very difficult to get to
this state of zen-like calm,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.640
because you're just
totally thinking, oh,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.598
that email, that thing.

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:56.045
You know, your
brain is constantly

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.420
moving from one
thing to another,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.690
trying to work out where
the biggest priority might

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.830
be in any given moment.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.570
It never used to be
this complicated.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.800
So Peter Drucker talked about
this idea of knowledge work

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.790
in the information age.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.344
So moving from the industrial
age into the information age.

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.260
And what Peter Drucker
was very concerned with

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.210
was defining knowledge work.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.670
You all in this room
are knowledge workers.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.350
And what that means
is you add value

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.636
and you create value
out of information.

00:05:24.636 --> 00:05:26.010
That wasn't always
how we worked.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.450
So back in the
industrial age, you

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.840
might have had a job that
looked something like this.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.740
So there's a cake factory,
there's a big conveyor belt,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.030
and there's cakes coming
down the conveyor belt.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.500
You've got a big
box of cherries,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.110
and your job is to put
one cherry on each cake.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.370
So you do that nine to five.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.140
You put cherries on
cakes nine to five.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.370
You have a break
at lunch time, you

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.750
have a break in the morning,
break in the afternoon,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.400
you go home at five o'clock.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.290
How many people in that
job, putting cherries

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.500
on cakes nine to five, would
be going home of an evening

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.370
and thinking, oh, the cherries
today, it just went crazy.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.640
Or sat there on a Sunday
evening and you're

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.439
thinking to yourself,
I have no idea

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.730
how it's going to go next week.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.560
It's going to be mental.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.250
So it's very easy in
that kind of a job

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.570
to know exactly what
does done look like.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.000
What does the end look like,
what does success look like.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.890
Whereas in knowledge work
jobs, it's much more difficult.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.710
Knowledge work jobs,
it's much more about

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.880
how we define success, how we
define those particular things

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.110
that make the difference.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.870
And maybe your
viewpoint is slightly

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.411
different from your
boss's viewpoint,

00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:25.560
and there's all these competing
priorities at the same time.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.730
So really, one of the hardest
things to really acknowledge,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.230
and one of things we've really
got to take into account when

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.420
we're trying to get into
this state of zen-like calm

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.400
is this idea that we're
simultaneously the boss

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.060
and the worker all
at the same time.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.080
So by the way, all of you
have to put cherries on cakes.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.440
That is part of what you do.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.950
Those cherries on cakes are
the emails that you send,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.366
the meetings that you set up,
the things that you deliver.

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:48.160
You are all putting
cherries on cakes.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.310
And the trouble is, you're
also having to decide

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.960
what time should the
shift start today,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.940
and how fast should the
conveyor belt be going,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.648
and all these other
questions, and having

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:58.079
to think strategically about
what's going on in the wider

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.370
world is that everyone's
thinking about healthy eating,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.950
so maybe we should
take these cherries

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.741
and make fruit cocktails
with them instead.

00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.420
So we're having to make all
these intuitive judgments

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.260
at the same time as
delivering on work.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.380
So we're simultaneously
the boss and the worker

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.600
all at the same time.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.180
And really getting into
that state of zen-like calm,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.680
getting into that state of being
able to deliver in a really

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.380
focused way involves doing
that boss thinking first,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.440
like really getting to grips
with and defining what's

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.060
on my plate so that
I can then make

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.460
the best decisions in that
moment and do the best work.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.490
So slightly a sort of different
energy to follow zen-like calm

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.240
would be ruthless.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.920
So almost the opposite
energy from zen-like calm.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.850
So the second of my
nine characteristics

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.324
is ruthlessness.

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:44.240
And a lot of people,
when I put this slide up,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.510
they start to conjure up
images of Gordon Gekko in Wall

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.720
Street or Leonardo DiCaprio
in "The Wolf of Wall Street,"

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.720
kind of bowling with dwarves
and all this kind of stuff.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.880
So I'm not talking
about stuff that

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.810
is sort of very unkind
or really aggressive,

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.820
but we have to really
think about ruthlessness

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.880
in terms of how we define
tasks, how we define what we're

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.820
working on, and just our own
mindsets around all this stuff.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.440
So the first thing is to be
really ruthless with yourself.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.829
Really start to really think
about how many things do

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:21.370
I have on my plate, what are
the things that really are going

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.036
to make the most difference, and
what are the really good things

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.450
that I should be doing that
I'm going to say no to.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.910
So you know, most
people are very well

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.860
able to say no to the stuff
that doesn't really matter.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.485
It doesn't mean that
we don't sometimes

00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:35.659
spend time doing things
that doesn't really matter,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.909
but sometimes really
the trick is saying no

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.799
to really good stuff, as well.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.187
So Warren Buffett
has a lovely quote,

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.270
which is "the difference
between successful people

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.030
and very successful people is
that very successful people

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.410
say no to almost everything."

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.400
And for me, you know, this
sense of being really tight

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.710
and defined around
your role and what

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.980
you're working on, and saying
no to stuff that perhaps sounds

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.200
like a really good
idea, you know,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.996
learning that art is
really, really important.

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:06.620
Also just being with
us with ourselves,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.280
so recognizing when we are in
that sense of procrastinating.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.830
So you know, who
turns on Facebook

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.140
or WhatsApp or Instagram on
your phone or on your computer?

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.860
Like, you do.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.790
So getting ruthless with how
you manage yourself around that.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.459
And I'll talk a little bit more
about how to manage attention,

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.250
and some of the stuff
that we can do around

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.166
that in a few minutes.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.377
But really getting
ruthless to put ourselves

00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:31.210
in that right frame of
mind, that right zone

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.430
for productivity,
and really starting

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.070
to be strict with
ourselves sometimes to get

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.440
the right kind of work done.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.840
And then this one is really key.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.160
So I think, for me, I
mentioned at the beginning

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.650
that time is not your
most precious resource,

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.670
attention is your most
precious resource.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.003
So in the book, I talk about
these three different modes

00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:50.820
of attention.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.000
So I think we have three
modes of attention.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.080
The first is
proactive attention.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.550
This is the two to
three hours a day

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.200
where we have the best
energy and the best ability

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.301
to do our best work.

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.050
So when you really
start to think about it

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.540
and track this stuff
and just reflect

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.412
on your own work over
a period of time,

00:10:07.412 --> 00:10:08.870
let's say a couple
of weeks, you'll

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.989
start to notice real
kind of trends and sort

00:10:10.989 --> 00:10:12.780
of peaks and troughs
in your energy levels.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.696
So there's a time when
you're sat at your desk

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:16.970
and you feel totally
able, totally focused,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.180
able to do the really
most difficult stuff.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.200
So that's proactive attention.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.170
On the other end of the scale,
who's had a time in your day

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.300
where perhaps you're sort
of looking at the screen,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.934
you're scrolling up and down on
your email inbox or whatever,

00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:30.350
and you know, it's
like the lights

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.391
are on but no one's home.

00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:33.170
It's like four o'clock
in the afternoon.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.090
And you know, so that's
managing time really well.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.380
You're in the right place,
doing the right thing,

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.990
but actually you don't have
the right level of attention

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.312
to do really sophisticated
work at that point.

00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:43.520
And there's loads of science
behind this, too, right?

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.395
So there's loads of
science around willpower,

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.392
and willpower is a
dwindling resource each day.

00:10:47.392 --> 00:10:49.850
So it stands to reason that
there'll be a point in your day

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.225
where you have the best energy,
that proactive attention,

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:53.600
and also a point
in the day where

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.820
you have inactive attention.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.330
And the bit in the middle
is called active attention.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.770
So that's just kind of
the bit in the middle

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.320
where you can do some stuff,
but you can't do everything.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.990
There's certain things that
you can do during that time.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.660
Now, the problem is that
proactive attention often

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.660
comes at points in the day
where other people want

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.860
to take our attention away.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.940
Other people want to
scramble our attention.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.380
And so we have to get really
ruthless with how we protect

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.250
that proactive attention.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.872
So if you think about it as
being two to three hours a day,

00:11:19.872 --> 00:11:21.830
most of the studies that
have been done on this

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.750
say that that's generally,
for most people,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.010
in the morning, rather
than the afternoon.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.020
There are, of course,
exceptions to that.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.820
But that morning
time, where people

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.579
tend to have that
proactive attention,

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:32.120
is also the time
where it's like, OK,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.210
so I'm just going to spend this
just warming up for the day,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.820
or like I'm in someone
else's meeting,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.278
or like something
else is going on.

00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:40.242
And so often, there
are so many forces

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:42.200
that can just take this
attention away from us,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.030
and basically scramble
our attention.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.130
So getting ruthless with
protecting those times

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.824
and knowing when those
times are, key for you.

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:50.240
So for example,
like personally, I

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.800
have a bit of a
policy, which is I

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.900
don't do meetings in the morning
and phone calls in the morning.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.160
So my morning is like the heads
down, proactive attention time,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.969
and the afternoon is the more
kind of collaborative time.

00:12:00.969 --> 00:12:02.510
And that's kind of
easy for me to say

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.920
because I control my own diary.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.120
And I get that there are lots
of other factors at play there.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.680
But even if it's just looking
at one or two hours a day

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.804
and saying, I'm going to
ruthlessly try and protect

00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:13.790
that time, that can make
a big, big difference.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.514
Because in my
experience, most of--

00:12:15.514 --> 00:12:17.180
certainly most of my
best work, and what

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.013
I observe in everyone
else that I work with,

00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:21.200
is that that proactive
attention, the stuff that you

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.350
do in those one, two, three
hours of the day that really

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.210
makes a difference,
like, that's the stuff

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.200
that you'll get judged for.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.880
All the other stuff
really is kind of filler.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.960
You know, all the kind of
emails and conversations

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.430
and everything else.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.680
The stuff that really makes you
famous in your job, the stuff

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.170
that really makes an impact
tends to happen in those two

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.044
to three hours a day.

00:12:39.306 --> 00:12:41.680
So the third one I'm going to
talk about is weapon-savvy.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.200
So obviously, a ninja has
to have weapons and tools.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.360
It's fun to geek
out and have lots

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.030
of interesting kind
of conversations

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.365
with other productivity
geeks about different apps

00:12:54.365 --> 00:12:55.490
and all this kind of stuff.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.323
But like, we even have
to be savvy about how

00:12:57.323 --> 00:13:00.790
we use tools, how we make
the best of all the tools

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.810
that we have.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.060
So on the little
iPad there, you've

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.740
got like a few different tools.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.850
The tool I use most
regularly is called Nozbe.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.730
Nozbe is basically a to-do
list app, a very sophisticated

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:13.900
to-do list app.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.900
And that really allows
me to manipulate the data

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.700
within my to-do
list really well.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.530
I can look at it by the project
view, project by project what

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.905
am I working on,
I can look at it

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.084
by where am I going to
be to do certain things,

00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:27.250
I can categorize stuff, I
can put date reminders in,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.584
all that sort of thing.

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:30.250
So just like slightly
more functionality

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.702
than a lot of the more
basic to-do list apps.

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:34.660
Other ones you'll find
are things like Todoist,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.130
Remember the Milk.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.914
Really good apps.

00:13:36.914 --> 00:13:39.080
Most of them have a kind
of freemium model, as well,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.580
so you can get most
of what you need

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.390
from the kind of free version.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.240
And then you pay
a bit more if you

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.730
want the kind of
subscription version.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.188
But one of the
things I'd recommend

00:13:46.188 --> 00:13:49.450
is really thinking about
having some kind of app

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.970
that you're going to
use for your to-do list.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.150
And then synchronizes with
your computer, with your phone,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.816
with an iPad,
whatever you're using,

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:58.690
across those different
devices and platforms.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.320
But it gives you that ability
to really kind of prioritize

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.850
and think clearly around
the work that you're doing.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.975
So thinking about, if you're
going to use any apps at all,

00:14:07.975 --> 00:14:09.850
think about what you're
going to use for what

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.030
I call the second brain.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.150
So your own brain
is not particularly

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.130
great at holding
onto and remembering

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.550
all that different data.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.972
So having a second brain where
you put all that stuff out,

00:14:18.972 --> 00:14:21.430
you know, out on the page, as
it were, like inside the app,

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.181
and you start to see
projects and actions,

00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:25.513
and start to be able to kind
of move those things around

00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:28.119
and prioritize those things,
that's really the kind of best

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:29.410
use of technology you can have.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.530
There's loads of other really
useful apps that I use,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.690
but for me, like
getting really honed

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.180
around a really good second
brain kind of app for

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.292
me makes the biggest difference.

00:14:39.292 --> 00:14:41.875
I want to talk just, like, for
a few moments just about email.

00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:45.280
And so who loves
their email inbox?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.210
Just by a show of hands.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.120
So a couple of hands.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.360
So for me, email is
one of those things

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.492
that has just sort of pervaded
work over the last few years.

00:14:55.492 --> 00:14:57.700
I don't need to tell you
that you get a lot of emails

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.824
and that email is annoying.

00:14:58.824 --> 00:15:00.760
That's kind of a given.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.560
So I've, over the
last few years,

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.230
been a big proponent
of a thing called

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.590
Inbox Zero, the idea of getting
your inbox down to zero.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.960
And I think that's often
a misunderstood thing.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.430
I think the idea of
Inbox Zero is not

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.479
that you have your inbox
at zero all the time,

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:19.270
and that you spend
every minute of the day,

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.395
when one email comes in,
you have to kind of bat it

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:22.762
away and leave it at zero.

00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:24.220
For me, it's more
of a mindset that

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.790
says email is just the medium
that we communicate through,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.340
and it's not actually where
most of the best work gets done.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.042
So Inbox Zero is really a way
of hacking that problem in order

00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:36.250
you can get outside of the
inbox as much as possible.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.370
The real work, for me, happens
outside of the email inbox.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.305
Even when you're communicating
via email, really

00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:44.430
what's the stuff that's
really making a difference?

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.804
It's the impact of those two
people having conversations.

00:15:46.804 --> 00:15:49.120
And if you had that same
conversation face-to-face

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.112
or had that same
conversation over the phone,

00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:52.570
you'd still get to
the same result.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.670
So email is always
just the medium.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.006
Some people get very bogged
down in the idea of email

00:15:58.006 --> 00:15:59.380
is their job and
email is the one

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.546
thing they need to be doing.

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:02.770
And for me, actually,
like, amazing things

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.710
happen when you start to get
outside of your email inbox.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.397
Just a very quick
overview, there's

00:16:07.397 --> 00:16:08.980
a whole chapter in
the book that talks

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.320
about how to get your
email inbox to zero.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.650
My company, Think Productive,
runs three-hour workshops.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.302
And what I've tried to do is
take that three-hour workshop

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:19.010
and put it into that
chapter of the book.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.020
So if you spend about 45
minutes to an hour just reading

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.990
that chapter with your
email in front of you

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.490
and then about an hour going
through the stuff that it says,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.930
your inbox will be at zero.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.310
We did-- we did some stats
over our three-hour workshop,

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.885
and we found that 96%
of people in three hours

00:16:35.885 --> 00:16:37.510
left the room with
their inbox at zero.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.320
So it doesn't take you anywhere
near as long as you think.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.770
What it does mean
for the most part,

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.820
people have their email
inbox open in front of them,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.070
but they're also working
on lots of other things

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:48.840
at the same time.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.870
So for me when you get really
focused around just email,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.750
you can actually start to
hack some of that stuff

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.951
away, delete anything
that's older than a few days

00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:00.200
or whatever, and you really
start to get to zero very,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.917
very quickly.

00:17:01.917 --> 00:17:03.750
Next, I want to talk
about is a thing called

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.060
stealth and camouflage.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.117
Ninja has to be
able to get slightly

00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:10.450
off the grid at different times.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.740
So the main part of this
that I'm going to talk about

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.854
is tactical hiding.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.250
So you guys are very used to
working in a very open plan

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.960
open kind of culture.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.250
I think there's some really
nice benefits to that for sure.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.910
It also has some limitations.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.677
And one of those limitations--
probably as you're sat here

00:17:30.677 --> 00:17:32.760
listening to me, one of
things you're thinking is,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.710
well, it's all
very well for him.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.400
He probably works loads
of the time on his own.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.900
He doesn't have loads of people
interrupting him at his desk

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.790
all the time.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.384
And I get this complaint a lot
from people saying, I just--

00:17:42.384 --> 00:17:43.800
I really want to
get my head down.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.883
I really won't get into
that kind of zen-like calm

00:17:45.883 --> 00:17:47.427
kind of mode, but
actually the thing

00:17:47.427 --> 00:17:49.260
that's stopping me is
someone comes and asks

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.426
me a question then I get
loads more emails and loads

00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:53.020
of other stuff going on.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.700
So really thinking about
how we can avoid that.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.289
And I often say to
people if you're

00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:58.830
feeling like you're
being interrupted

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.080
the whole time, make yourself
just deliberately less

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.087
available.

00:18:02.087 --> 00:18:04.170
For some people that's
going to work from a coffee

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.545
shop around the corner, finding
little cupboard somewhere

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:09.750
where no one's going to find
you, whatever that looks like

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.270
but just trying to again
protect those two to three hours

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.817
of time, proactive
attention time,

00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:16.650
to really get down--
get your head down, get

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.766
really focused on things.

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:22.010
And it doesn't have to just be
a physical thing, as well, so

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.879
stealth and camouflage
in a more digital sense.

00:18:24.879 --> 00:18:26.670
Both Outlook and Gmail
both have a function

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.340
of work offline,
which I think is just

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.900
a criminally underused thing.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.930
The amount of times
I'll say to people,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.850
do you use work offline?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.240
And people don't tend to use it.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.200
But just the idea
of that is that you

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.600
can work on the stuff
that's in front of you.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.558
You can see the emails.

00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:40.660
You can see the
calendar, whatever it is.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.510
But actually, what
you don't have

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.942
is the new
notifications coming in

00:18:44.942 --> 00:18:46.150
and the new emails coming in.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.020
So just using that work
offline thing, really nice way

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.570
to just slightly make
yourself less available

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.980
and slightly get into
more of a focus mode.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.729
This one here is an
app called Forest.

00:18:57.729 --> 00:18:58.770
Who's come across Forest?

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.610
Do we have any Forest
fans, any of you?

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.110
Good, good.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.460
So Forest is a really
nice little app for focus.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.389
So the idea is that you
set a period of time.

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:09.180
So let's say it's 20
minutes, half an hour.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.590
And you say, I'm going to really
get my head down and focus

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.395
on this one thing.

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:13.770
Often the thing that gets in
the way of that is just, ah,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.850
what's on my phone?

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.110
Let me pick up my
phone and have a look

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.360
and see what's going on there.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.110
And so what Forest does is
it starts to build a tree.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.020
So you've got this 20
minutes, half an hour.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.744
It's building this tree.

00:19:23.744 --> 00:19:25.410
If during that 20
minutes, half an hour,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.940
you attempted to
pick up your phone

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.220
and go and look at Twitter,
or Facebook, or whatever,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.460
the tree dies.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.960
All right?

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.810
So really small, little thing.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.650
All it's doing is putting one
tiny, tiny, little positive

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.860
reason to not look at
your phone in competition

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.620
with all those other things
that are going on in your head.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.270
And it's remarkably effective.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.630
The other thing about Forest
is that, as a company,

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.870
they invest some of their
profits in planting real trees.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.490
So you can actually get a real
guilt from the tree dying.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.400
It's a real tree.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.100
You have to think
about it in that way.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.344
But really nice app.

00:20:04.344 --> 00:20:05.510
There's a whole new chapter.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.931
The updated version of the
book has a whole chapter

00:20:07.931 --> 00:20:09.680
called "Stop Messing
About on Your Phone."

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.221
And one of things
that it talks about

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.424
is basically treating
yourself like a kid

00:20:13.424 --> 00:20:15.590
for those two to three hours
of proactive attention.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.130
So I have an app
on my Android phone

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.090
that's called QualityTime.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.790
There's some other iPhone
implements of it as well.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.680
But basically what
QualityTime does

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.589
is it allows me to
set scheduled breaks.

00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:29.630
So in that scheduled break,
it's like in that two

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.880
to three hours, these
are things that I can now

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.930
access on my phone.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.340
Everything else on my phone
is locked for that time.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.310
So this two to three
hours of the day,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.290
I have no access
to Google Chrome.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.030
I have no access to Instagram.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.470
I have no access to Twitter.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.060
All those things
are locked down.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.367
They are unavailable.

00:20:45.367 --> 00:20:47.450
If I want to get them back,
then what I have to do

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.790
is I have to cancel
the scheduled break.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.850
And the clock starts ticking
5 minutes, 4 minutes 59,

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.080
4 minutes 58.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.040
Usually, as you watch
that clock ticking down,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.470
it's got to get all the
way to zero before you're

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.165
allowed to turn the thing off.

00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:01.550
Usually that's long enough
for you to go, ah, screw this.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.716
I'm not going to sit around
for five minutes waiting

00:21:03.716 --> 00:21:04.340
for the thing.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.070
So it just tends to be, again,
just a nice piece of psychology

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.120
that keeps you locked away from
those things for those times

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.340
and just gives you that
kind of extra focus.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.076
And obviously, the
more basic version

00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:15.700
of that is just using
the airplane mode

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.650
and just using the do not
disturb features of the phone,

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.750
just to keep some of
that stuff in a more

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.150
stealth and camouflage
kind of mode.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.880
The same, I think, can be
applied to people, as well.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.822
So actually just having
conversations in your team

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:30.530
like, what's the time
where I really need

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.550
to get my head down and focus?

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.200
What are the times when
you need to do that?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.850
How can we share
those responsibilities

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.350
and make that happen
for each other?

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.808
How can we do that
within the team?

00:21:37.808 --> 00:21:40.790
So just for me, I feel like
when I go into organizations,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.010
often it's really amazing
to me how many of those

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.030
conversations are
just left unsaid.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.672
And it sort of builds
up and bubbles up

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:47.630
in tension or whatever.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.670
But really, it never
gets put on the table.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.749
What's the expectation
around email?

00:21:51.749 --> 00:21:53.540
What's the expectation
around my attention?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.300
People don't have those
conversations as often

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.380
as, perhaps, we need to do that.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.656
Next one I'm going to
talk about is unorthodoxy,

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:03.280
just doing things
differently, thinking

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.180
in a very different way.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.560
I think that's probably fairly
self-evident coming into Google

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.910
to talk about that.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.000
But I go into so many
companies where what really

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.250
happens a lot is that
people spend a lot of time

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.260
looking at their
direct competitors,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.560
looking at the direct market
that they are in or around,

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.740
and trying to get inspiration
from what everybody

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.070
else in their sector is doing.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.200
And I'm a huge fan of just
looking way beyond that

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.509
and just thinking, how
would someone else solve

00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:29.050
this problem?

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.210
How would someone else do
that piece of thinking?

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.626
How would someone
else communicate

00:22:32.626 --> 00:22:33.550
those kind of ideas?

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.070
So thinking about it from
the point of view of someone

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.660
very principled, like Malala.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.700
Or how would you
explain this problem

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.259
to a really curious,
intelligent six-year-old?

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:44.050
So just thinking about
those different ways

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.410
to approach that same idea or
that same piece of thinking,

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.330
and coming up with a solution.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.740
The other thing around
unorthodoxy is experimentation.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.710
So I'm a big believer
that all of us

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.359
are very stuck in ruts
with our own habits

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:00.400
and the way that we work.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.380
So a couple of years
ago, I did this thing.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.070
I did 12 extreme
productivity experiments,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.690
so one for each month.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.410
And the idea was
to just challenge

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.200
all of my initial assumptions
around productivity

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.490
and the way I worked.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.990
So I did things
like, one was called

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.400
flipping the 9:00 to 5:00.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.430
So I worked 5:00 till 9:00
AM and then clocked off

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.840
for the day at 9:00 AM.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.499
I did the same 5:00 to 9:00 PM.

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:24.040
So I had the whole day, and then
I had my four hours of work.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.320
What was incredible
about that was I

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.490
only had four hours a day.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.230
And I thought I was super
focused and super productive

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.730
already.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.175
But having this limitation
of four hours really

00:23:34.175 --> 00:23:36.550
made me think twice about some
of the things I was doing.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.970
I think constraint is always
a really beautiful thing

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.240
to really get us to a much
stronger sense of focus.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.610
I still use some of the
lessons from that one.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.735
I also tried one which
was working an hour a day

00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:50.080
but seven days a week.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.750
So literally like one-hour
bursts but seven days a week

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.490
just to see how that would feel.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.124
Turns out I was really
stressed for most of that time.

00:23:57.124 --> 00:23:59.040
You do need more than
an hour a day generally.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.373
It depends on what you're doing.

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:04.570
I did one which was whenever
I feel unclear about decision

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.760
or I'm slightly procrastinating
about a decision,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.129
I made that decision
by the throw of dice.

00:24:09.129 --> 00:24:11.170
So what that meant is I
had to come up with one--

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.870
I had to come up with
basically two, or three,

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.160
or six different
answers to the question.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.042
And then so sometimes, if you're
really stuck with something,

00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:23.500
being forced to come up with
six different ways of thinking

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.720
about it just helps you
to open up your brain

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.470
and think about things
in a different way.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.360
The other thing
about that one was it

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.790
was really amazing to be able
to detach ego from decisions.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.373
It's like, well, I
didn't decide that.

00:24:32.373 --> 00:24:33.190
The dice did.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.620
It's a very different thing.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.720
I think I say that because
I'm not necessarily

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.720
expecting you to go back
to your bosses and say,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.660
I just want to
work an hour a day.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:47.020
But I think for me, doing
those kind of experiments

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.600
from extremity is
a really nice way

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.344
to then get back to some
kind of sense of normality

00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:53.260
but with new learning.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.900
I think often learning comes
from those extreme things.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.310
It comes when you're outside
of your comfort zone.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.910
And I learned so
much by doing that.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.170
And I think we can do those
things really simply in our day

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:02.740
to day.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.800
So just getting off the bus
or the tube a stop early

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.320
and just exploring the area
for 10 minutes before work just

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.153
puts your brain in a
really different thing.

00:25:10.153 --> 00:25:13.360
It gets you out of the sense of
every day starts the same way,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.830
and every day has this
certain rhythm to it.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.110
So if you're someone that
always gets into the office,

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.640
and the first thing you're
doing is on your phone,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.526
on your email, try
having the first two

00:25:21.526 --> 00:25:22.900
hours with no
phone and no email,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.460
and just see what that's like.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.910
If you're someone who usually
solves a thing by getting up

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.380
a document on the
screen, try doing it

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.450
with just pen and paper.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.200
So sometimes just those
really tiny little changes

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.005
in habitually how
we work can just

00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:35.380
make a huge
difference to the way

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.810
we think about certain things.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.670
The next one I'm going
to talk about is agility.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.900
So this idea of zen-like
calm and a lot of the ideas

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.452
around second brain and having
autonomy around our work.

00:25:47.452 --> 00:25:49.660
They can be really compromised
where suddenly there's

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.880
a big fire that
we have to fight.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.213
There's some big thing going on.

00:25:52.213 --> 00:25:53.630
And we have to react to that.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.065
So what I'd say
around that is we

00:25:55.065 --> 00:25:57.190
have to be really aware of
where those things might

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.700
be coming from.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.220
But also, having a really
good starting point.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.100
If you don't feel
right now like you're

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.125
in some kind of big
firefighting emergency mode,

00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:07.750
one of the best things
you can be doing

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.610
is really taking
stock and getting

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.170
clear around what
you are working on,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.796
because you know that some
other emergency will come along.

00:26:13.796 --> 00:26:14.920
There will be another fire.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.020
So getting to a place
where you really

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.480
know what you're working
on and getting real clarity

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.981
around that stuff makes it much
easier to drop those things.

00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:24.355
It makes it much easier when
your boss comes in and says,

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:26.380
right, can you work on
this for three days?

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.150
It's like, well, I can drop
all that because this is

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.380
what I was working on before.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.505
We all agree that this is
the more important thing.

00:26:31.505 --> 00:26:35.680
So getting that sense of
clarity and being organized

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.340
around your work is just the
most useful thing at the point

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.800
where a crisis hits, because
it's the time when you really

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.840
need to know what you're
dropping and being

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.780
able to do that in a way that
feels just more comfortable.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.920
And you're more
able to know what

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.320
you're going to leave behind.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.990
It can often be
a point of crisis

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.197
where we really start to
just look at the small things

00:26:59.197 --> 00:27:01.030
and sweat the small
stuff rather than really

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.102
thinking much bigger.

00:27:02.102 --> 00:27:04.060
So the other thing is
just habitually to really

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.160
be thinking, what
could be on the radar?

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.950
Really thinking about
that kind of future,

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.500
like what might be coming
up, and anticipating problems

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.607
before they happen.

00:27:12.607 --> 00:27:14.440
Usually, just the best
way to solve problems

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.910
is to try and nip
them in the bud

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.246
and not let these things
become big things.

00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:20.620
And the other
thing about agility

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.160
is just to dispel the
myth of multitasking.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.110
I was talking about
this with somebody

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.289
just before we started.

00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:29.080
A lot of the old-time
management books used

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.850
to talk about the holy
grail is multitasking,

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.308
like do two things
at the same time

00:27:32.308 --> 00:27:34.300
and then you'll be
more productive.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.430
Actually, all the science
points to the fact

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.460
that it's really hard for
your brain to do two thinking

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.930
tasks at the same time.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.659
So multitasking really
doesn't exist in that way.

00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:45.200
And in the kind of
stuff we're doing,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.800
we need to focus much more
on the idea of monotasking,

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.890
like doing one thing at a time,
doing one thing with focus.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.090
That can be as applicable to
the desk space in front of you.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.207
So not having five
different bits of paper

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:57.790
that relate to five
different projects

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.248
when you're trying
to focus on one.

00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:01.700
Just putting those things
in a drawer to one side.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.680
Same with your desktop.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.110
Who's got hundreds of
different open windows

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:11.345
on your computer and hundreds
of different unfiled things that

00:28:11.345 --> 00:28:11.970
get in the way?

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.770
So really getting that focus
around monotasking, not

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.480
multitasking really,
really helps.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.840
A couple more before
we finish, mindfulness.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.810
So when I first wrote the
book about five years ago,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.800
I was really struggling to
find the time and the space

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.912
to do that, because I
had a business to run

00:28:30.912 --> 00:28:31.870
and all the rest of it.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.570
So it was this thing
that kept coming up.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.153
Every week I looked at my to-do
list, it was like, write book.

00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:38.220
I was like, oh, that's
not really happening.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.270
What do I need to do?

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.850
So what I did was
something quite extreme.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.920
I booked a plane
ticket to Sri Lanka.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.300
I found a beach hut that had
no Wi-Fi, no phone signal.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.930
I was totally off the grid.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.250
And I went away to Sri
Lanka, and I wrote the book.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.910
And I didn't really have
very many conversations

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:55.590
while I was there
with different people,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.570
because I was just on my own.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.330
But I did meet a Buddhist
monk at the bus stop.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.490
And basically, the
Buddhist monk asked

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.680
me to come to the monastery
and taught me meditation.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.230
And it was a really
beautiful thing.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.260
Meditation wasn't supposed to
be one of the characteristics

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.037
in the book.

00:29:11.037 --> 00:29:12.870
But I was there, and I
was writing the book.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.530
And suddenly, I was having this
experience around meditation.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.110
It was like this has
to be in the book.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.100
This has to be a thing.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.410
And I thought it was
risky at that point

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.770
to put meditation and
mindfulness in the book.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.310
And I was going to go
into my corporate clients.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.780
And they were going to be
like, this is all a bit hippie

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.279
woo-woo.

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:26.102
What's going on?

00:29:26.102 --> 00:29:27.810
And what's happened
in the last few years

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.560
is that the opposite
has become true,

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.400
which is that mindfulness has
become such a saturation thing.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.010
And you get all these really
annoying things on Twitter that

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.020
say, the one thing you need
to do to be a better leader,

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.200
meditate for five minutes a day.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.680
Ah, well, if only
it was that easy.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.620
Great.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.810
So I think meditation
is an amazing tool.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.830
It's not for everybody.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.450
And I think there are lots
of different ways in my mind

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.790
that we can get to a
place of mindfulness.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.180
Really for me, mindfulness
is noticing your thoughts,

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.836
noticing the things
that you might

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.210
be stressed about
in that moment,

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.340
and starting to
really understand

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.700
where your brain might be
going in certain things.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.540
So you can get that
just through walking.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.250
Lots and lots of
different ways that you

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.220
can start to really
understand your brain.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.410
And for me the
benefit of that is

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.390
thinking about this idea
of the lizard brain.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.015
So the lizard brain
is the amygdala.

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:17.640
It's the part of your brain that
gives you this fight or flight

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.690
response.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.020
And often the things that become
really tricky for us to do,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.345
or we start to procrastinate
over, or we're scared about

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.970
are because the lizard brain is
having some big response to it.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.270
So for example, when I put
a book out into the world,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.550
my lizard brain is saying
to me, don't do this.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.130
And the reason for that is that
books are going to be judged.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.140
People are going to write
Amazon reviews about them,

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.030
and you know people are
going to make judgments

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.779
about what you do.

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:41.461
And that's a scary thing.

00:30:41.461 --> 00:30:42.960
It's the same reason
if you're going

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.880
to stand up and give a
presentation in front

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.730
of a bunch of your colleagues,
or even worse a bunch

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.100
of your bosses, it's like,
I'm going to be judged here.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.000
This just becomes a scary thing.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.780
So recognizing that
that lizard brain

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.509
is often going to
try and sabotage.

00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:58.050
It's going to try
and get in the way.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.510
It's going to try and give you
a period of procrastination

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.130
rather than a period
of really useful work.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.112
So when we start to
recognize that that's

00:31:05.112 --> 00:31:06.570
lizard brain
thinking, we can start

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.692
to override it and do
something differently.

00:31:08.692 --> 00:31:10.650
And for me, mindfulness
is one of the best ways

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.560
that we can start to get
into that kind of place.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.550
I think also mindfulness is
just a really useful thing

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.170
to help us just take a step back
and realize how far we've come.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.260
So this is always quite a good
point in the year, I think,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.560
where people start to take stock
of where they were last year

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.036
and what they want
to do this year.

00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:31.660
So just taking that
step back sometimes

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.050
and thinking how far we have
come, what we have achieved.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.560
A really nice
productivity tip that

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.610
doesn't feel like one is once
a week or on a regular basis,

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.200
write a have done list.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.450
So as well as your to-do
list, write a have done list.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.760
It's a really nice
empowering thing.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.060
Also just overrides that
lizard brain thinking

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.430
of like, oh, I'm not capable.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.300
I feel guilty that
I've not achieved this.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.150
It just gives you that sense
of momentum, which again fuels

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.680
the next round of productivity.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.747
Preparedness.

00:32:01.747 --> 00:32:03.330
One of things I talk
about in the book

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.790
is an idea called
the weekly checklist.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.730
So this is a thing
that you do once a week

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.070
where you just take a step
back from all of the work

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.920
that you're doing, and
you prioritize just

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.720
really clear thinking.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.929
And sometimes, one
of the things I

00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:19.470
come across quite
a lot in businesses

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.300
is people feel like
they don't have

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.074
the time for clear thinking.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.240
It just feels like a luxury.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.615
It feels like
something that I'll

00:32:25.615 --> 00:32:28.194
do when everything dies down
or when everything changes.

00:32:28.194 --> 00:32:29.610
Henry Ford has
this amazing quote,

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.490
which is, "Thinking is
the hardest work there is,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.700
which is the probable
reason so few engage in it."

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.977
And I really love that quote
because I think for me, when

00:32:38.977 --> 00:32:40.560
we're in a knowledge
work job, our job

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.590
is to add value and create
value out of information.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.690
The way we think and
really quality thinking

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.220
is the biggest
asset that we have.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.590
Our brains are our biggest tool.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.779
So taking some time to
step back and really

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:53.820
look at your projects,
look at your second brain.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.230
Make sure all that
stuff feels fresh.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.160
I think sometimes
to-do lists fall apart

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.900
and the apps fall
apart because we

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.000
lose trust in what the
data is within those apps.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.120
So we start to look
at what's in the app.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.661
And we start to go, oh, I know
there's more stuff in my head.

00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:11.220
So I don't quite trust the
app as being the full record

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.540
of everything that I've got.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.748
And then we lose trust in it.

00:33:13.748 --> 00:33:15.180
We stop using it,
and it changes.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.790
So really having that
weekly checklist,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.190
having that regular time
where your only job really

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.770
is to interact with
those lists and really

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.635
get clear on what's
on your plate

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:26.760
is a really nice way of
keeping those things fresh.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.300
And ultimately, it
gives you more focus.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.700
But there is a
cost to that, which

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.200
is a little bit of
maintenance time.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.550
So just coming back and using
those checklists to really make

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.620
those good decisions happen.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.110
The other thing
about preparedness

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:45.440
is, the idea of our biggest
tool being our brain,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.850
is basically sleep.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.350
And this slide is
just to indicate

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.912
that sleep is a good thing.

00:33:49.912 --> 00:33:51.620
And it's really good
to get enough sleep.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.300
So I think when you think
about your biggest tool being

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.786
your brain getting
good sleep, and there's

00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:58.910
a whole lot of other stuff.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.690
Hydration's a really important
thing and stuff that we know.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.490
I've just actually
just finished writing

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.520
a book called "Work Fuel,"
which is all about nutrition

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.040
and how to eat to
have better energy.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.540
Looking at the
things on your plate.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.580
Googlers, you're
doing a good job.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.210
It's good.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.380
But I think it's just one of
those really underrated things.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.150
I really couldn't find
any books out there

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.980
that looked at nutrition
and productivity

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.231
and married those two things
in a really specific way.

00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:26.188
So I've been working with
a nutritionist called

00:34:26.188 --> 00:34:28.130
Colette Heneghan, who
was my nutritionist

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.659
for a couple of years, to
really put that into practice.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.150
So that comes out in March.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.790
And I think for me,
all of those things

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.820
that help us to fuel our
brain, whether it be nutrition,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.721
whether it be sleep, whether
it be hydration, exercise.

00:34:40.721 --> 00:34:42.679
Mindfulness to an extent
can do the same thing.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.179
But just all those
things are really

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.969
important to give us as much
of that energy and proactive

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.179
attention as possible.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.230
And finally, just
to say that a ninja

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.960
is a human but not a superhero.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.940
So when you do a lot
of the stuff that's

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.356
in the book, when
you really start

00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:01.480
to have a really good
second brain and really

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.750
good load of apps and
tools that you're using,

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.940
when you've really got
the best productivity

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.589
setup that you have, people will
look at you across the office.

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:12.130
And they'll say, oh, this person
just feels like a superhero.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.440
They're doing all
this amazing stuff.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.950
You'll start to be really
valued because of that.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.760
And often people will start
to go, how do they do it?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.140
Have they got some kind
of special super power?

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.940
And really none of
us have superpowers.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.950
We're all just humans
but with good tools,

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.690
and good ways of thinking,
and all that stuff.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.374
I think that's a
really useful thing

00:35:32.374 --> 00:35:34.540
to come back and remind
ourselves of regularly, just

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.120
this idea of being
human, not superhero,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.640
because what that does mean
is that we have limitations.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.450
It does mean that we need to
acknowledge that humanness

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.992
sometimes and not work
ourselves too hard

00:35:44.992 --> 00:35:46.700
too often, because
ultimately we're going

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.415
to risk burnout by doing that.

00:35:48.415 --> 00:35:50.590
And we also need to
recognize that humans

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.530
do need that time to refresh
the mojo a little bit

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.920
and come back to who
we are outside of work

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.020
and be a human being,
not just a human doing.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.580
So for me, that's a
really important part

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.470
of the whole productivity
ninja philosophy,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.970
really, is this idea of
human, not superhero.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.311
I think productivity
is one of those topics

00:36:10.311 --> 00:36:12.310
that it would be really
boring if you could just

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.100
systematize everything,
and everything could just

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.060
be done by robots.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.130
And then it's all done.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.630
There's no challenge
in that for me.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.463
I think the interesting
part of productivity

00:36:21.463 --> 00:36:24.070
for me is that we
all come to this

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:29.080
with all those weird thoughts
that we have in our brain.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:29.855
With my podcast--

00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:31.480
I have a podcast
called "Beyond Busy"--

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.070
I've done about
100 interviews now

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:36.220
with often very high
achieving people.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.849
And people often say to me,
having done all that work

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:41.890
and done these really long
in-depth conversations

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.242
with high achieving people,
what's the commonality?

00:36:44.242 --> 00:36:46.450
What are the things that
these people have in common?

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.250
And I always say,
well, the only thing

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.208
I can find that all these
people have in common

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.910
is that humans are weird.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:52.900
Humans are weird.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.840
And we all come at all
of our work with a lot

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.240
of mental baggage, if you like.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.850
We have a lot of
thoughts in our head

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:04.270
that derail us, try and
stop what we're doing,

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.160
try and get in the way
of what we're doing.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.034
And actually, by coming
back and reconnecting

00:37:08.034 --> 00:37:09.940
with the humanness,
I think that's where

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.070
we start to recognize
some of those things,

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.960
overcome some of these things.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.617
And also by doing that, we start
to realize that productivity

00:37:17.617 --> 00:37:18.700
is a really amazing thing.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.700
Humans are amazing.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.680
We do so much amazing stuff.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.690
And despite all
those limitations,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.520
despite all these things,
we can just do amazing work.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.970
Thank you.
