00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.240
All right, welcome back.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.877
Now, a lawsuit left over
from the Jim Crow era

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.779
in the Deep South
looks like it has finally

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.280
come to a conclusion.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.849 line:0%
A federal court is ordering
a Mississippi town

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.318 line:0%
to fully desegregate
its schools.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.921
This is the culmination
of a 50-year fight

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.956
against the Justice Department.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.660
Black and white students are
largely separated in Cleveland.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.928
Under the order,

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.798
the town's two high schools
must become one.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.267
A school that's finally
being integrated

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.403
after 50 years?
Oh, man.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.971
Guys, when we first
heard this story,

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.740
we were so pumped up to do this.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.842
I mean, this is right,
like, in our wheelhouse, right?

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.377
We even wrote a sketch about it.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.047
I get to go to a white school?
Thank you, Jesus!

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.183
No, sorry, Mike, actually,
we're not doing that.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.851
We're not doing it, sorry.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.586
Yeah, I know,
it's sad. It's sad.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.756
Uh, because, uh...

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.125
something about the way
this story was being reported--

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.827
it just didn't
sit right with me.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.495
Which brings us
to a new segment called

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:05.665
Hang On a Minute, News! This
Don't Feel Right in my Bones.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.271
Ooh.

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.173
So, it felt like
the news reports were saying

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.042
that this was the case
of an all-white school

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.344
versus an all-black school
and that the town

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.646
was going to integrate
the two into one, right?

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.382
Like some sort of fantastic
racial harmony Voltron.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.318
All right? But that's not
all that's happening here.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.286
Let's look at the facts.
At Cleveland High School,

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.754
about half the students
are white.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.990 line:0%
Meanwhile, East Side High
School, situated

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.926 line:0%
across railroad tracks
in a less-affluent section

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.661 line:0%
of town, is nearly all black.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.698
That's right: the all-black
high school is literally

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.134
on the wrong side of the tracks,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.436
earning this week's
On the Nose award.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.376
I salute you,
East Side High School.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.378
But, wait, if students
already integrated

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.081
the white school, why is it
being covered like this?

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.516

-...ordered to desegregate.

I mean, they're making it
sound like George Wallace

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.598
giving his
inaugural address in '63.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.569
"Segregation now, segregation
tomorrow, segregation forever!"

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.071
(babbles)

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.806
Right?

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.342
I... That's what it
felt like to me, right?

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.978
So... But the problem
is not black students

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.513
aren't being allowed
in the white school.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.848
It's because
white students aren't

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.516
going on the other side
of the tracks

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.785
to attend the black school.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.288
"But, Larry, how could that be?"
Well, over the last 50 years,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.989
East Side High School--
the historically black one--

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.225
has vastly fewer resources.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:42.161
Until recently, East Side
had no A.C.T. test prep,

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:44.397
no science textbooks
for students to take home,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.232
and get this-- no lockers.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.202
What kind of a school
doesn't have lockers?

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.637
Where are these kids supposed to
hang up their<i> Tiger Beat</i>

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.774
with Larry Wilmore
on the cover? Right?

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.309
Where's that supposed to go?

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.145
And where are they
supposed to shove the nerds?

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.280
Which, ironically,
is anyone who has a<i> Tiger Beat</i>

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.983
with Larry Wilmore on the cover.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.552
All right, but here's my point:
this story is really about

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:10.089
the city's failure to take care
of the all-black school,

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.524
not about
the half-white school's

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.059
inability to desegregate.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.428
That school has both
black and white students.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.165
Call it Halle Berry High,
if you will.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.868
Sorry, I just use any excuse
to bring up Halle Berry.

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.205
Hey, boo.
Look...

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.642
Just racially mixed, see?
It works, so...

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.978
Look, no one
wants to send their kid

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.046
to an under-performing school,
regardless of race.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.382
So when these two schools
are so close to each other

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.618
and yet one is so dramatically
less-equipped,

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.587
it's no longer about Brown
versus the Board of Education.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.923
It's about brown...

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.359
versus a quality education.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.561
And that's the real story

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.496
that needs to be told here.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.864
We'll be right back.
