00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We saw earlier how we could prove correctness, and correctness is easy to show.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Proving security is really hard.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This property of the one-time pad that we can change the key and that leads

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to a different message, is the reason why it is secure.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But first I want to talk about how to prove security in general.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then we'll come back to the problem of how do we prove that the one-time pad

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is actually a perfect cipher.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How can we argue that a cipher is secure?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is a really hard problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to start with a quiz, and it will definitely require some guesswork.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
See if you think it through before I explain the answer.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to give you give possible ways someone might argue

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that a cipher is secure.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For this quiz, your goal is to order the arguments below

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
by how effective they are in convincing someone that a cipher is secure.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Use 1 to indicate the best argument and 4 to indicate the worst argument.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The choices are many very smart people were highly-motivated to break

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the cipher but were not able to.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That means it must be secure.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The second choice is there are 834 quadrillion possible keys, so it must be secure.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The third choice here is a mathematical proof that's been accepted by experts

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that shows the cipher is secure.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The forth choice is here is a strong argument why breaking the cipher

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is at least as hard as some problem we already believe is hard.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is a bit of a unfair question, since we haven't talked about this yet.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I think it's useful for you to think about it on your own before I talk about it.

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See if you can figure out which of these arguments are most effective.
