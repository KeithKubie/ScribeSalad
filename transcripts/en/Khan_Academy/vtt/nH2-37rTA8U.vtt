00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's return to our fairly
simple banking example, and

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.710
see if we can use it to actually
understand, or at

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.080
least get a better idea,
of what money is

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.180
and how it's created.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.450
So in the original example,
I said, I have this idea.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.020
I have all of these farmers who,
at the end of the season,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.330
they sell all of their apples--
let's say that's the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.690
main cash crop on our island.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.560
And then every year they just
have this-- collectively they

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.950
have-- I'll just make up a
number-- 1,000 gold pieces

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.210
that they get.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.960
Or at least this year, I'll
call it 1,000 gold.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.000
They have 1,000 gold coins
that they get at

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.300
the end of the year.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.510
Normally the farmers just kind
of stash it under their

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.390
mattresses, or dig up a
hole and put it there.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.910
And I said, boy, what a waste,
because there are actually

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.650
good projects out there that
people could-- maybe

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.140
irrigation ditches, factories, a
tool factory, anything else.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.800
But there's just no money
for those people

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.800
to build those things.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.700
If only somehow I could take
this money and use it for

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.520
those projects, then we would
actually create wealth.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.640
We'd have innovation.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060
And our entire pie
would get bigger.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.450
So what I do is, I start
up this bank.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.340
And I'll do it all over again,
just like I did last time.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.530
Let's say that I personally
had 100 gold pieces.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm going to stick with gold,
because I want to show you how

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
the money creation-- there is a
small multiplier effect even

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.140
when you're using gold.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.860
Some people think it only
happens with paper money.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.950
This is all a byproduct of the
fractional reserve system,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.210
which was essentially
what I showed you in

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.930
the last two videos.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.600
Let's just go through
the whole example.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.020
So I take 100 gold pieces, and
I construct this nice vault

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230
looking building.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.720
So this is real estate,
or building.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.230
And it's worth 100 gold.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.030
These are my assets.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.810
Assets on the left-hand
side, liabilities on

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.740
the right-hand side.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.190
And then I go tell all of
these farmers, one, your

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.630
money's not safe there.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200
If you actually keep it as a
deposit in my nice looking

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.220
building, I will give
you interest on it.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.639
So those farmers say,
great idea.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.970
So they all deposit
their 1,000 gold

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.010
pieces into my bank.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.610
So now I have this liability.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.820
I have 1,000 gold pieces
liability.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.320
And why is it a liability?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.610
Because I owe it
to the farmers.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.810
At some point in the future,
they're going to come back to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.110
me and say, hey, you know
that gold I gave

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.800
you, I want it back.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.190
So it's a liability to me.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.450
But it's also an asset
on my side, right?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.080
But my whole business
model is, I wanted

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280
to put this to work.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.540
So what I do is, I
put some aside.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.080
So essentially, I make
some reserves.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.300
I'll do the reserves in red,
because we're going to want to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.720
pay attention to them later.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.050
Let's say I put 10% aside.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.990
So I put 100 gold
pieces aside.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.900
And I do that in case any of
those farmers, the next day or

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.135
the next week, come to me and
say, oh, you know what, I

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:57.200
actually need my money.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.920
My son needs a haircut, or
whatever the need might be.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.770
But anyway, I put 100 gold
pieces aside as reserves.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.910
And then the remainder-- this
900 gold pieces-- I lend out.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.950
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.830
I'll do it in green.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.380
900 gold pieces I lend out.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.750
So it's an asset.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.780
But the gold is gone.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.540
I take that gold-- remember, I
had 1,000 gold pieces come

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.550
in-- I kept 100 of it.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.730
And now I'm going to lend it
to someone who has a really

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.850
good project.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.360
Normally, you would lend it
to a bunch of people.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.550
But for the sake of simplicity,
let's say I lend

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.820
it to someone who has an
irrigation project.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.210
He's going to take that 900 gold
pieces and pay a bunch of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.720
people, who are probably not
doing anything anymore because

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040
the apple crop has been
harvested and sold, and

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.700
they're going to build an
irrigation canal so that more

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.260
land is usable to make more
apples the next year. soon.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.790
And I say that's a great
investment because they're

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.070
going to make more apples, or
they're going to sell the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.930
water to the farmers.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.160
And they should be able to
pay some interest to me.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.250
So I give my 900 gold pieces
to them to essentially dig

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.750
these ditches.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.710
Well, the 900 gold pieces, that
then goes to the workers.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.310
The borrower borrowed
them, and then

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.860
paid it to the workers.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.240
900 gold goes to the workers.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.710
And so after the project is
done, you have a bunch of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.200
workers with 900 gold pieces.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.900
Well, these workers, they're
just like the farmers.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.330
They say, well, I don't want
to put it in my bed.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.610
And I want to get
interest on it.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.240
It's not safe inside my house.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.650
So, let's say that my bank
is the only game in town.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.130
So they go back to my bank.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.360
And they say, hey, Bank of
Sal, I want to deposit my

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.870
money with you.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.100
I say, great.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.630
So what I do is, I take their
900 gold pieces, and I take it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.890
as a deposit.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.665
Let me try to draw that
as a deposit.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.880
If this is 1,000, 900
might be about that.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.510
So this is the farmers'
deposits.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.150
That was the initial money.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.780
So then I get the 900 gold
pieces from the workers.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.470
I want to make this as
neat as possible.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.230
I didn't want to go through the
pain of having multiple

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.770
banks because you could do
this with just one bank.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.790
Maybe in a future video, I'll
do it with multiple banks,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.290
just to show you that all
the deposits don't have

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.330
to go to one place.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.610
But it's the same idea.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.520
Anyway, these 900 gold pieces
are essentially deposited back

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.310
into my bank for safekeeping.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.870
And I say, boy, I don't need to
keep all of this 900 gold

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.530
pieces here.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.130
I could lend it out again
for some useful project.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.380
So once again, I say, well,
these are demand deposits,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.540
which means that these farmers
could demand them at any time.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.020
So let me put a little
bit aside.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.340
I know statistically that no
more than maybe 10% of them

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.160
will come to the given days.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.330
So let me set aside
10% of that.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.230
So I'll once again have
10% reserves.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.800
So I'll set aside
90 gold pieces.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.020
And then the other-- let me do
that in the lending color--

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:22.080
the other 810 gold pieces
I lend out.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.520
And let's say I lend it out
to some entrepreneur.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.770
Remember, I'm getting interest
on all of this.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.370
But we're not concerned with the
interest right now, we're

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.180
concerned with the
money supply.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.760
So I lend it out to some guy who
wants to build a factory,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.260
build a factory for
cutting tools.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.360
That'll help all of us become
more productive when we have

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.880
to harvest our apples, or maybe

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.130
even digging the ditches.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.730
So once again, this 810 gold
pieces, they're going to go to

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.420
the construction workers
or the contractors

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.165
who built the factory.

00:06:56.165 --> 00:07:03.330
So let's call it factory
contractors, the people who

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.893
build the factory.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.450
Once again, now they have
810 gold pieces.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.560
And they're like, I don't like
keeping it in my house.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.190
There's that nice fancy vault
that Sal has, and he gives

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.180
interest on it.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.340
So they take those 810
gold pieces, and they

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.700
deposit it in my bank.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.920
And then, let's just say that
I could just continue this

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.260
process, so forth and so on.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.390
And just so you know, it
doesn't go infinitely.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.450
Because every step of the
way, we're having

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.780
a little bit less.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.240
I'll do the fancier math on
how to figure out how many

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.960
steps we can do.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.810
Let's just stop it there, just
for the sake of brevity, and

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.710
just so I you don't run
out of space on this.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.310
So they take 810 gold pieces,
and I for the most part feel

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.430
that I've lent enough
money out there.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.415
So I keep all of this 810
gold pieces as reserves.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.200
So I don't lend that out,
although I could.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.590
I could just set aside 10% of
it, 81 gold pieces, and then

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.080
lend the rest of it out.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.160
But I don't do that.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.720
I just keep all of those 810
gold pieces as reserve.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.650
So this is my balance sheet.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.580
Maybe if these transactions
occur all at once, over the

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.270
course of the year, this is what
the Bank of Sal's balance

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.870
sheet looks like.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.840
These are my assets, and these
are my liabilities.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.080
And notice, assets are
still equal to

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.830
liabilities plus equity.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.080
This was equity.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.860
This is liabilities.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.950
These are deposits that
I owe to people.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.940
Deposits equal liabilities from
a bank's point of view.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.920
They're assets for
those people.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.170
And then these are my assets.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.910
Some of them are cash
money, in magenta.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.220
This 810, this 90, this 100,
these are gold coins that are

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.590
sitting in my vault, so that's
definitely an asset that I

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.190
have. And then these are loans
that I lent-- at least, this

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.290
and this-- these are loans that
I lent out to somebody.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.380
And that's as asset, as long
as they pay me back.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.220
So now, we have set it all up.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.850
My question to you is, how much
money is there in the

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.480
system or in our economy?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.990
It all depends how
you define money.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.300
So let's make a definition.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.640
Let's say I make a definition
called m0.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.720
And this is just, how
much gold is there?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.700
How much gold in the system?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.150
Well, we can go and count it.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.145
Remember, notice, all of the
gold is being held in my bank.

00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:42.150
So we just have to go to this
one bank and count how much

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.230
gold it has.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.890
It has 100 gold here, 90 gold
here, 810 gold here.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.310
So 810 plus 90 plus 100 is
equal to 1,000 gold.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.980
So there's 1,000 gold pieces.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.820
And that makes sense, right,
because we had 1,000 gold

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.060
pieces to begin with.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.990
And we didn't mine for any new
gold, or we didn't use any

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.930
lodestones to turn lead into
gold, or anything like that.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.450
We just had the original
1,000 gold pieces.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.850
And there's no way
to create more.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.350
They don't reproduce
on their own.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.610
So we still have 1,000
gold pieces.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.070
And we can view that as our
narrowest definition of the

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.740
money supply.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.320
Let's say another definition.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.500
Let's call this m1.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.850
And I'm running out of time.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.690
And that is, how much money do
people think they have, in

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.450
terms of their checking
accounts?

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.470
Well, the farmers think that
they have 1,000 gold pieces.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.490
The original ditch construction
workers think

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.830
they have 900.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.280
And then the factory builders
think they have 810.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.580
So if you add them, it's 1,000
plus 900 plus 810.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:59.430
Let's see, that's 1,900-- that's
2,710 gold pieces.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.970
So if you went and surveyed
everyone in the city and you

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.460
said, how much do you keep in
your checking accounts?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.240
Or how much you have on demand
deposits in a bank?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.570
If you added up all of those
numbers, you would have 2,710

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.350
gold pieces, if I added
my numbers correctly.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.210
This is the multiplier effect.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.840
This happens whenever you have
a fractional reserve system.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.000
And this is what people
say when they talk

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.530
about the money supply.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.490
It depends how you measured--
and this is what people talk

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.380
about when they talk about
money being created.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.610
We had 1,000 gold coins, but
because of this multiplier

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.940
effect, people think that there
are 2,710 gold pieces.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.130
In the next video, I'll address
the issue of whether

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.950
they are correct
to think this.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.200
