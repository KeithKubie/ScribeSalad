00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.970
We're asked to factor 4y squared
plus 4y, minus 15.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.500
And whenever you have an
expression like this, where

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
you have a non-one coefficient
on the y squared, or on the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.980
second degree term-- it could
have been an x squared-- the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.059
best way to do this
is by grouping.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.600
And to factor by grouping we
need to look for two numbers

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.300
whose product is equal to
4 times negative 15.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.740
So we're looking for two numbers
whose product-- let's

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.560
call those a and b-- is going
to be equal to 4 times

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.659
negative 15, or negative 60.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.420
And the sum of those two
numbers, a plus b, needs to be

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.630
equal to this 4 right there.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.310
So let's think about all the
factors of negative 60, or 60.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.130
And we're looking for ones that
are essentially 4 apart,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.460
because the numbers are going
to be of different signs,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.660
because their product is
negative, so when you take two

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.730
numbers of different signs and
you sum them, you kind of view

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.620
it as the difference of
their absolute values.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.360
If that confuses you, don't
worry about it.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.900
But this tells you that the
numbers, since they're going

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.830
to be of different size, their
absolute values are going to

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.670
be roughly 4 apart.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.360
So we could try out things like
5 and 12, 5 and negative

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.100
12, because one has
to be negative.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.920
If you add these two you get
negative 7, if you did

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.930
negative 5 and 12 you'd
get positive 7.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.530
They're just still
too far apart.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.390
What if we tried 6
and negative 10?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.960
Then you get a negative 4,
if you added these two.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.170
But we want a positive 4, so
let's do negative 6 and 10.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920
Negative 6 plus 10
is positive 4.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.610
So those will be our two
numbers, negative 6 and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.360
positive 10.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480
Now, what we want to do
is we want to break up

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.360
this middle term here.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.880
The whole point of figuring out
the negative 6 and the 10

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.180
is to break up the 4y into
a negative 6y and a 10y.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.830
So let's do that.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.790
So this 4y can be rewritten as
negative 6y plus 10y, right?

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.630
Because if you add
those you get 4y.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.055
And then the other sides of it,
you have your 4y squared,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.580
your 4y squared and then
you have your minus 15.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.060
All I did is expand this into
these two numbers as being the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.240
coefficients on the y.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.370
If you add these, you
get the 4y again.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.900
Now, this is where the
grouping comes in.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.250
You group the term.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.300
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.760
So if I take these two guys,
what can I factor out

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.670
of those two guys?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.350
Well, there's a common factor,
it looks like there's a common

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.040
factor of 2y.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.060
So if we factor out 2y, we get
2y times 4y squared, divided

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.160
by 2y is 2y.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.820
And then negative 6y divided
by 2y is negative 3.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.130
So this group gets factored
into 2y times 2y, minus 3.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.810
Now, let's look at this other
group right here.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.300
This was the whole point about
breaking it up like this.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.070
And in other videos I've
explained why this works.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.380
Now here, the greatest
common factor is a 5.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.790
So we can factor out a 5, so
this is equal to plus 5 times

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.300
10y, divided by 5 is 2y.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.370
Negative 15 divided
by five is 3.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
And so we have 2y times
2y minus 3, plus 5

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.910
times 2y minus 3.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.900
So now you have two terms,
and 2y minus 3 is a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.400
common factor to both.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.970
So let's factor out a 2y minus
3, so this is equal to 2y

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.650
minus 3, times 2y, times
that 2y, plus that 5.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.760
There's no magic happening
here, all I did is

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.900
undistribute the 2y minus 3.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.480
I factored it out of
both of these guys.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.760
I took it out of the
parentheses.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.420
If I distribute it in, you'd get
back to this expression.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.630
But we're done, we
factored it.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.130
We factored it into two
binomial expressions.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.050
4y squared plus 4y, minus
15 is 2y minus 3,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.220
times 2y plus 5.
