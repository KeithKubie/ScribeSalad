00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.880
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.390 position:56%
My name is Roberta Shaffer and it's
my pleasure to welcome you on behalf

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.830
of Jane Sanchez, the Law
Librarian of Congress who is unable

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.760
to join us this morning,
but sent me,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.530
her Special Advisor, in her stead.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.980 position:56%
We're really delighted to be hosting
this program which is, I think,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.030
becoming part of a series of events
in which we are commemorating

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.270
and continuing to learn from the
experience of the Venetian Ghetto,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.580
so this 500-year trajectory of
learning continues this morning.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.300
We had a program last spring.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.030
Today is a full day of
learning for all of us.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.550
We have a phenomenal
display of the Library

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.500
of Congress collections relating to
Hebraic Publishing during the time

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.860
of the Ghetto as well as
other related documents.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.230
This afternoon at 2 o'clock
we will be showing a film.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.150
It's a documentary
about the Venice Ghetto.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.730
And then we will again celebrate
the Venice Ghetto with a re-appeal,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.530
a mock appeal, of the Shylock
trial from <i>The Merchant</i>

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.590
<i>of Venice </i>on June 21st
in the late afternoon

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.400
and the presiding justice
will be Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.940
So I hope that you will all
be marking your iPhones now

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.050
and will be able to
join us at that time.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.800
There is debate, as many of
you know, about the term,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.660 position:56%
the derivation of the term "ghetto."

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.110
We do believe that it was first
used in Venice and the area

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.700
of the Republic that served as the
ghetto geographically was previous

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.670
to that function a smelting area.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.100
And so we like to think that, if
we're looking at positive aspects

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.710
of the ghetto, that it was a
melting pot of many, many ideas

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.900
and cultures coming together.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.070
And such is the reality of today
as well where we have a melting pot

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.180
of many entities coming together
to bring you this program.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.730
And so it's really my pleasure to
acknowledge the Embassy of Italy,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.330
and you'll hear from our
esteemed Ambassador in a moment,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.020
the Friends of the Law
Library of Congress,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.510 position:56%
and then the Hebraic Section of the
African and Middle Eastern Division,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.700
the Italian Cultural Institute, and
the Primo Levi Center in New York,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.350
all of which have a role
to play the programs

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.830
that the Library has been putting
on and will continue to put on.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.160
We will have two speakers today,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.330
Dr. Benjamin Ravid who's a
Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.830
and Judaic Studies at
Brandeis University in Waltham,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.540
Massachusetts, and Professor Dick
Schneider who is the Associate Dean

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.980
for International Affairs
and a Professor of Law

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.300
at Wake Forest University
in Winston Salem.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.770
They will both be discussing
different aspects

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.870
of "Understanding Seclusion, the
Legal Dimensions of the Ghetto."

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.960
And so, without further ado, it is
truly an honor to introduce someone

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.310
who is no stranger to the
Library of Congress, our very,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.680
very good friend, the Ambassador
from Italy to Washington, D.C.,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.720
Armando Varricchio,
who, I have to say,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.740 position:56%
in addition to being the Ambassador,
and I think even more appropriately

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.860
for this morning, is
a Son of Venice.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.510
So without further
ado, Your Excellency.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.840
[ Applause ]

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.140
&gt;&gt; Armando Varricchio: Good
morning, good morning everybody.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.180
Thank you very much, Dr.
Schaffer, my dear friend, Roberta,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.590
for your very kind introduction.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.840
It's always a pleasure for
me to be back at the Library.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.910
Such a distinguished cultural
institution here in Washington.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.280
The reason we're here today is
to debate, from a legal point

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.710
of view these days, one of the
most seminal events in history,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.100
the creation of this place
where Jews were secluded.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.770
And from the very, very name,
Venetian name of the foundry,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.560
the name ghetto became
so familiar to us.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.880
The reason why we're here
also, because this vantage spot

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.110
of a number of events that we are
hosting together with a number

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.900
of institutions, first and
foremost, the Library of Congress,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.470
to commemorate the 500 anniversary

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.870
of the founding of
the Jewish Ghetto.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.220
And I like very much
today's presentation title,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.810
"Understanding Seclusion, the
Legal Dimension of the Ghetto."

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.550
I want to start -- all those
who have been so important,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.480
instrumental, to make
this event possible.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.200
Dr. Natalia Indrimi from the
Center Primo Levi in New York

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.330
for so generously sponsoring
tonight -- today's event.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.770
There that is part of a
series of [foreign words],

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.750
the most serene republic of
Venice, an event where we're trying

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.360
to put together different arts,
different expression of culture,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.850
and today's fits very, very
prominently into todays.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.620
I would also like to
welcome our speakers

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.370
that have already been
mentioned, Professor Benjamin Ravid

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.100
and Professor Dick Schneider.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.820
But today's central
theme, seclusion,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.770
seems particularly
appropriate in this day and age.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.600
Particularly today when we
look at the early history

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.060 position:56%
of the segregated Jewish Community
in Venice and to showcase rare books

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.410
and documents for Library
of Congress,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.190
collections related
to the Jewish Ghetto.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:52.230 position:56%
It's important to go through those
pages because we should never forget

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.440
that the ghetto, [inaudible]
and many

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.640
of the reasons why it has become so
important and prominent in history.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.000 position:56%
It's because at that particular
time it became a center for culture,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.140
production of arts,
literature, music.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:17.160
So while these people were really
forced into that small tiny place,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.660
their bodies, their persons
were secluded, but their souls,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.810 position:56%
their minds, their spirits were
flying so high to be able to produce

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.910
so important base of
arts and culture.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.520
But the ghetto, its
origin, it's history,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.840
and what it has become today, are
so intertwined with the history

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:48.280
of Venice, a city which welcomed
Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Persians,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.500
and probably not as exotic as all
those people, but Germans, too.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.090
Inclusion and seclusion, a
city which gave protection

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.820
to minorities and, at the
same time, kept them separate.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:09.110
This, of course, allows us
maybe to spend a few words

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.980
that I'm sure will be
spelled and elaborated later,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.480
but important of the melting
pot, which has been mentioned,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.300
the way we make sure, even
today, that different cultures,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.950
different languages,
different religions,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:31.350
different identities, can co-exist.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.070
Incidentally, [inaudible]
first, with the performance

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.590
of <i>The Merchant of
Venice </i>in the Old Ghetto

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.400
which was either are
the two unprecedented.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.180
I don't want to retrace
here the history

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.010
that led [foreign words] back
in 1516, the Doge of Venice

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.050
and Venetian Senate to
decree, to issue the decree,

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.240
that all Jews must
live together which,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.330
an area which was both
enclosed and monitor.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.760
What is important today
is to stress the fact

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.870
that the Jewish Ghetto Venice
is considered a pivotal point

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.010
of reference for Italian
Jewish life.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.700 position:56%
It is also the site where many early
Hebrew books were first printed,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.650
and we can have -- see
displayed most important

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.380
and beautiful examples.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.870
And as we stand here today,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.140
in what is not only the
world's largest library,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.570
but one of the Embassy's
long-standing [inaudible] industry,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.710
I must also mention the wonderful
making Hebrew books in Venice.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.210
There's an online exhibit,
the result,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.380
ultimate multimedia platform
created by the Library of Congress

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.680
in Washington

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.090
and the Biblioteca-Archivio
Renato Maestro of Venice.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.390
And these will enable
younger generation students

00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:00.130
and the general public to access
unique pieces ranging from 1521

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.670
to 1862, respectively,
the years which the oldest

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.820
and the most recent Hebrew
manuscript kept in Venice date back

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.180
to and will be accessible
on a permanent basis.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.030
But while we go through the pages
of those books, while we'll listen

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.060
to the importance of
Ghetto in history,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.950
while we assess the
legal peculiarity,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.140
because Venice was a state of laws,
so everything was done according

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:35.180
to laws of the time, we should also
think about our time, our presence,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.340
and particularly, you know, these
days in Europe, in my Europe,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.930
the importance of preserving
history and preserving identity.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.630
When people struggle for identity
I think that we should never forget

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.690
that what we are today, what, as
Italians, as Europeans are today,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.270
is because of what we
have been in the past.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.230
And because of this unique
combination of different cultures,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.160
of different histories,
of different religions,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.150
so all of this has made our
part of the world unique.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.600
And within the broader
perspective of the large Europe,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.360
there was a tiny, tiny city.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.560
I don't know whether
you [inaudible] to land

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.940
into Venice, and look from above.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.270
You can see how tiny the
collection of islands is.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:32.270
In those little part of Europe, a
city that was built not upon a hill

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.750
but on the water by people who
were trying to escape from fear,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.390
from anger, the invaders were
arriving and they were --

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.520
tried to find escape and a new
shelter by taking the water

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.580
and building on this, and
you know, unhealthy piece

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.890
of small lands a new city.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.840
Venice, as it has been in
history, as it is today,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.200 position:56%
would not have been the same
without what our brothers, the Jews,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.130
had provided to the city with
their ideas, with a daily life,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.160 position:56%
with their businesses, with all
their activities that are pertaining

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.750
to be proud citizens of Venice.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.410
So, as I said, for me, is also an
emotional moment to be here today

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.360
with you today, and I'm sure that,
as always, we'll never forget

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.480
that history is our teacher.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.570 position:56%
And when we're looking back and also
trying to understand how a democracy

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:36.480
of the time like Venice, according
to the laws, took that decisions

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.950
and made legal the Ghetto.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.540
We should never forget that
laws are so important only

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.040
if laws can reflect a
human spirit, values,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.060
and not simply make possible what
should never be made possible.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.860
Thank you very much.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:13:01.190
[ Applause ]

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.440
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I would like
to just remind you before we begin

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.270
with the formal lecture
series, to please make sure

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.900
that your phones are silenced.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.750
And now if you would not mind,
if you brought anything in,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.970 position:56%
please place it under the seat in
front of you, fasten your seatbelts,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.230
and make sure that your
minds are in an open

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:32.210
and unlocked position [laughter]
so that we may time-travel back

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.290 position:56%
to Venice 1516 together with, first,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.480
Professor Benjamin
Ravid from Brandeis.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.710
Professor Ravid, will you
please take the podium?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.510
Thank you.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.520
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Well, good
morning, bongiorno, shalom.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.110
To decide what to talk about
when it comes to the city

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.870
of Venice is a major
challenge because, you know,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.440 position:56%
there are over a hundred islands,
one of which, or two, one-and-a-half

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.110
of which, however you want
to define it, are the Ghetto.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.940
There are decades,
centuries of history.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.440
And I decided that really the two
best-known things about Venice --

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.070
one of them is fictional, the other
is reality, and I allude here,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.750
of course, to Shylock
and the Ghetto.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.130
Since my field is history
rather than literature,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.460
I thought I should not
touch <i>The Merchant</i>

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.600
<i>of Venice </i>and rather
speak about the Ghetto.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.210
Now, one reason why I
especially would like to speak

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.110
about the Ghetto is
because of a currency

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.220
that the word has in
everyday parlance.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:57.700
I think every word, every
language, on the face of the globe.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.500
I'm not quite sure what goes
on in a certain couple of areas

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.440
of the world I have absolutely no
wish to control over whatsoever.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.310
I can't even recognize the word
if I were to see it written out.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.150
But I think, certainly, when
it comes to the Western World,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.900
you know, the word ghetto has
entered everyday parlance.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:23.000
So I'd like to go back after
thanking His Excellency,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.820
the Ambassador, for his wonderful
opening words, for Roberta Shaffer

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.970
for having invited me here,
for our friends who set

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:37.340
up the wonderful exhibition which I
think is very important in showing

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.840
that there was a Hebrew press,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.450
that Venice was indeed the
center of the Hebrew press.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.320
For the [inaudible] for her
excellent administrative work

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.010
in getting me here today.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.540
And I'd to really now to turn

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.810
to something that's really been
bothering me for a long time.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.370
Indeed, approaching half a century.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.420
And I want to share this
concern with you today

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.420
because it involves not only our
understanding of Jewish history

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.450
and the position of the
Jews in the world, but also,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.760
as I alluded to before,
developments in our time,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.900
especially in the field
of urban sociology.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.990
So I'm going to do this today
by considering the nature

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.980
of the early modern Italian Ghetto.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:32.120
Now, my relationship with the
Ghetto began over 40 years ago

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.630
as I began my PhD thesis on a --

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.950
the topic of the Jewish
merchants of Venice.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.600
I will not talk about them today.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.230
I'll barely mention them.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.860
That's another issue.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.700
I came across the fact that in 1541
the Jewish merchants were required

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.580
to -- Jewish merchants
coming from the East,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.440
Levantine Jewish merchants
complained

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.430
to the Venetian Government that
when they came to Venice to trade,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.450
they did not have enough room for
their merchandise in the Ghetto,

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.340
which was too small for
them, and, therefore,

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.230
they requested additional
adequate place.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.020
And the Venetian Government, always
attuned to the interests and needs

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.090
of commerce, gave them
an additional space

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.840
in which they were to confined.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.890
That was known already
then as the Ghetto Vecchio.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:34.140 position:56%
So since the word ghetto was looming
in the very beginning of the story

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.260
of the merchants, I obviously had
to consider also -- I wanted --

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.990
I don't mean that I had
to -- it was necessary --

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.060
to also consider the Ghetto.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.190
So the history of the
Jews of Venice,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.370
as we look at their cultural,
their intellectual achievements,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.870
the community that they
built based upon Jewish law,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.140
the fact that they had virtually de
facto autonomy within the Ghetto,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.050
et cetera -- for all of
the history of the Jews

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.440
of Venice the word
Ghetto is lurking in there

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.810
and survives down to the present.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:15.650
So if we begin to investigate
the institution of the Ghetto,

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:21.730
the previous literature -- and
we're back now in the 1970s --

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.420
there seemed to be
a general consensus

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:31.620
that the word Ghetto first appeared
in Venice, but no consensus,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.240
really, about its entomology.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.230
Some saw its origin in a Venetian,
or at least Italian, source.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:45.640
And others derived it more
fancifully from Jewish sources.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.420
For example, the word ghetto -- the
word get meaning a bill of divorce

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.170
because the Jews were segregated
from society, et cetera.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:19:01.370 position:56%
And over the centuries, much ink
had been spilled tracing the history

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.020
of the word Ghetto, the
background before the Jews came

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.880
in to be confined to one.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.350
Now, actually, the original meaning
of the word Ghetto was buried

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.580
in the writings of certain 17th

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.220
and 18th century Venetian
antiquarians and historians.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.110
And today it's been established
beyond any shadow of doubt

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.860
that the word originated, as we
already heard today, in Venice,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.490
in a copper foundry in Venice.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.870
So, originally then, we have a
place called Il Ghetto, the ghetto,

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.910
that had been the site of the
Municipal Copper Foundry of Venice.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.870
The main activity there had been
the production of bars of copper

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.360
and also the alloy of bronze
used to make cannonballs.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.910 position:56%
Il Ghetto, from the Italian root
[foreign word], to throw or to cast,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.690
which we find surviving
today in English in words

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.660
such as eject, jet, trajectory.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.180
Now, if you have a foundry you're
going to have waste products.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.940
And waste products have
to be dumped somewhere.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:17.470 position:56%
So across from the ghetto, Il
Ghetto, was a sort of swampy island.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.160
Remember, Venice was all --

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.290
much of Venice was swampland
that was gradually drained

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:29.330
and the piles were put down
and the city built on those --

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.670
the land claimed from swamp.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:40.550
So, basically, the waste products
began being dumped on the island

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:48.080
across from the ghetto and what
happened was that that island

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.840
where things were dumped was --

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.420
became known as Ghetto Nuovo
because it was the new ghetto,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.120
the expansion of the ghetto.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.460
Whereas the old area that had
been the foundry area became known

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.700
as the Ghetto Vecchio.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.160
So we have two areas functioning
in Venice called Ghetto.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.740
One is the Ghetto Vecchio,
the original one.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.470
Those of you who have been there --

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.150
I assume many of you
have been there, right?

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.450
Fast show of hands.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.750
How are we doing?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.010
Okay. So, remember, the Ghetto
Vecchio is on the mainland --

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.500
well, not on the mainland.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.250
Mainland terra firma means,
you know, back in [inaudible].

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.400
It was on a very long island.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.930
You can go across on the main
streets there from one river,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.700
one canal, to the main
canal of Cannareggio.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.190
And the new area on which
things were being dumped is the

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.870
Ghetto Nuovo.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:50.110 position:56%
Now, as the foundry of the
commune, which was producing cannons

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:55.200
and balls and the like, as in the
15th century, Venice was embarked

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.500
on expansion on the
mainland, terra firma.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.490
That means, literally,
the main land .

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.170
Eventually reaching the
borders of Milan in the West.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.580
Lombardi, Milan, whatever
you want to call it.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:13.120
The ghetto could not produce enough
artillery and other things needed

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.780
for the army and, therefore,
the manufacturer of the bronze,

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:26.030 position:56%
the cannon balls, et cetera, was
moved to the arsenal and the island,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.080
the main land part, the island --

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.150
I'm sorry, the Ghetto Vecchio
on the main larger island

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:40.360
and the adjacent island of
the Ghetto Nuovo were sold off

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.650
and they became areas

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.140
which contained modest
two-story dwellings.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.410
And we'll skip the details that
have all been reconstructed,

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.890
how they were divided up and
who owned them and the nature

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.190
of the housing, et cetera.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:07.470
Now, as of then -- as of the
earlier days, and down to 1516

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.100
as the Ambassador, I
think it was, pointed out,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.290
we have no Jews whatsoever
associated with the ghetto.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:21.170
It's low and middle income,
probably more lower income housing,

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.150
mainly two stories, et cetera.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.740
Now, the interesting thing is,
as I began reading on the Ghetto

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:34.800
and more important Jewish quarters
prior to this point of 1516

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.130
in the Middle Ages,
there was a major problem

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.840
in that the word ghetto was
frequently used to refer

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.190
to Jewish quarters prior
to 1516 which, obviously,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:53.350
was a major anachronism, since
the word was not known outside

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.720
of Venice.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.680
And, moreover, nobody would have
associated it in any way, shape,

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.520
form, and manner with the Jews.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:11.270
Now, moreover, this word ghetto
was used by our contemporary,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:17.420
our contemporaneous
historians to refer

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.440
to all types of Jewish quarters.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.680
Sometimes Jews are living
in a segregated area.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.690
Sometimes Jews are living
mixed among Christians.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.360
Sometimes Christians are living
in the supposed Jewish area.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.780
As an independent variable
sometimes walls were erected,

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.160
sometimes they had gates.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.930
Because, remember, those
turbulent days, for security,

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.970
areas were walled up, gates would
be locked at night, et cetera.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.090
The main thing is that
almost always,

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:59.060
for all of these so-called Jewish
quarters, there was no reference

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.660
to any legislation or
edict establishing them.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.370
And their origins, as a rule
-- there are a few exceptions,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:11.290
and if you're aware of one of those
few exceptions, just delete it.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.910
As a rule -- I'll deal
with one exception shortly.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.530
As a rule, the origins of
when the Jews were settled

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.690
where they were are lost forever
in the mists of antiquity.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.960
I should say lost forever
because we all know that thanks

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.970
to wonderful places like the Law
Library and Library of Congress

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.010
and preservation of books, we'll
never know what will be discovered

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.470
in terms of manuscripts
and books, et cetera.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.140 position:56%
But as of today, things are unclear.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.800
So if we go back to the --

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.830
to Venice, if we read carefully
that edict of 1516, we will see --

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.320
actually, legislation of the
Senate to 1516 proclaimed

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.690 position:56%
by the Doge establishing the ghetto
and the subsequent course of events,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.990
we can conclude that the early
modern Venetian Ghetto was

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:11.340
characterized by three important
necessary characteristics.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.860
First of all, it was compulsory.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.150
Every Jew had to live
inside the Ghetto.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.800
No exceptions.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.760
Number two, segregated.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.630
No Christians were
allowed to live inside it.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.250
In fact, the Christians
had to move out

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.500
and the landlords were
granted a one-third increase

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.870
to be free from all taxes.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.170
Very important.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.650
I meant it was worth much more
than a third more in order

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.830
to get their tenants to move
out and the Jews could --

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.230
the Jews had to pay more.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.970
Thirdly, the area was enclosed.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:52.400 position:56%
In other words, it was surrounded by
walls and a gate or gates that had

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.540
to be locked at night and remained
so locked until the morning.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.270
So this then is the main
feature or features, if you wish,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.450
of a ghetto -- compulsory,
segregated, enclosed.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.720
Now during the counter-reformation
period

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.650
that usually is taken
that dates from 1555.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.260
We'll stay out of the
problems of dating things.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.000
Gradually compulsory
segregated and enclosed areas

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.670 position:56%
of Jewish residents were established
in all the other Italian cities,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:38.300
major cities with the exception of
Livorno, such as Rome, Florence,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.440
Sienna, Padua, Verona, Mantwin
[assumed spelling], elsewhere.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.450
Italian Jews are living
behind ghetto walls.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.090 position:56%
Based on the Venetian experience all

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:53.440
of these places were called ghettos
or, better in Italian, getti.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.440
And, therefore, I'm proposing

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.100
that to the turrim [assumed
spelling] compulsory, segregated,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.800
enclosed, be accepted
as a definition

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.340
of what an early modern
ghetto, Jewish ghetto,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.910
Italian Jewish ghetto,
was to differentiate it

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:13.470
from subsequent quarters
often referred to as ghettos.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:19.200
Now, with this definition of what
constitutes the original ghetto

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.930
in early modern Europe,
it should be noted

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:27.360
that the were a few
compulsory segregated

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:33.490
and enclosed Jewish quarters
in Europe before 1516,

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.580
primarily in Castile and Aragon.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.250
Let me not talk more about that

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.370
because it will take up
too much of our time.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:47.310
And most famously, of course,
was the Ghetto of Germanic Lands,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.770
Imperial Center, Frankfort,
where the Ghetto of Frankfort,

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:55.520
established in 1464, would qualify

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.150
as a ghetto before
the word so to speak.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:06.100
But these quarters were
never called ghettos.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:13.560 position:56%
They were only became called ghettos
after the end of the Venetian Ghetto

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.940
with the coming of
the emancipation --

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:22.560
that means the end of the 18th
century, the end of the 1700s.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.460
The word ghetto began to spread.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.190
And, for example, the segregated
compulsory enclosed Jewish quarter,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.680
Frankfort, was always called the
Judengasse, the Jewish Suite.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.840
Never called the ghetto
until after 1800.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.230 position:56%
The word began travelling northward.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:48.140
So, therefore, in the very
felicitous formulation

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.600
of Robert von Pfiel, the city
of Venice retains the copyright

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.450
for the semantically innovative
term ghetto as defining the locus

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.840
of the settlement of
the Jews in the city.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.380
So every Italian city,
with the one exception

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.890
as we said, Livorno, had a ghetto.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.650
And I do not mention more about
Livorno today because you have one

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.810
of the world's leading experts on
the field sitting in the audience,

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.630
Bernie Cooperman, who is at
the University of Maryland.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.480
An old friend from way, way back.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.950
Now, one of the new
insights on the ghetto,

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.230
and this is something implied but
never quite absolutely realized,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:40.680
is that no matter how many gates
and what hour they were locked at,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.370
the ghetto was not
hermetically sealed,

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.640
and it was very, very porous.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.380
And this has got to be
understood as the background

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.560
for Venice as a melting pot.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.520
Not quite the melting pot as
a mixture of various peoples

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.260
from various backgrounds.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.270
The ghetto was established, it
is true, to minimize contact

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.320
between Christians and Jews.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.680
But the government only sought
to totally eliminate it at night

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.760
because the Christian authorities
feared that under the cover

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.810
of darkness all sorts of condemned

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.670
and forbidden relations
could very easily occur.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.850
And their suspicion was
probably not without grounds.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:35.210
During the day not only could
Jews freely leave the ghetto,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.820
and Christians could enter at
will, but one group of Christians

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:48.320
in Venice was even compelled to
come into the ghetto and here --

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.580
this is most interesting
because from the very beginning,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.320
or let's say a few months
after the very beginning,

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.320
the Venetian Government
insisted that the pawn shops,

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.880
which were the reason for which
Jews were allowed into Venice,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.880
and which the government made
the Jews operate for the sake

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.860 position:56%
of the urban poor, these pawn shops,

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.020
the reason that the Jews
were tolerated in Venice was

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.740
to be located in the ghetto.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.350
So that meant that any Christian
engaging in money lending,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.350
any Christian engaged in borrowing,
had twice to enter the ghetto.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.940
Once to pawn his object and we hope

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.960
for his sake a second
time to redeem his pawn.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.500
Furthermore -- this is
often neglected -- the --

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.460 position:56%
given the topography of Venice and
the size and location of the ghetto,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.420
it would be very inconvenient for
the Christian inhabitants of Venice

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.860
to reach their destination on
occasion if they could not cut

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.620
through the ghetto during the day.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.380
And I'll digress for a minute

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.190
to show you how the most
unexpected sources dealing

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.210 position:56%
with the most unexpected things draw
your attention to the commonplace.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.690
A proposal was made in the
-- I think it was 1764 --

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:21.860
to establish a bullring in
the campo of the Ghetto Nuovo.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.870
Now, I've never personally
measured it, and I'm not quite sure

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.650
if it's absolutely
correct because I can think

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.620
of a couple of other large campos.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.120
But I remember reading
somewhere that the campo

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.850 position:56%
of the Ghetto Nuevo was the second
largest, after San Marco, in Venice.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.890
Whether it is or isn't, the
point is it really is large

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.190
and it is very convenient
for things.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.900
Now, there were some
objections to this proposal.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:49.090
And one of the objections was that
it would handicap the Christians

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.560
who wanted to pass through
the ghetto on the days

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.340
when it was closed
off for the bullring.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.770
The bullring never went up.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:02.170
There were no races
in the Ghetto Nuevo.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.570
It's been used for all sorts of
things since the emancipation time.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.310
Some of them -- I've never
personally been there

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.720
on movie night, but I'm
sure it's very pleasant

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.480
under a warm Venetian sky.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.780
So, anyways.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:20.260
The point is that Christians
were not strangers to the ghetto.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.220
And the converse of this is
agreement day Jews could be outside

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.120
the ghetto freely and they could
associate with Christians and/

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.200
or introduce all aspects
of Jewish culture,

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.940
denuded of its Christian content --

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.020
that's worth really a talk
in itself -- into the ghetto.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.600
Italian, or more accurately
Judeo-Venetian was the spoken

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.330
language of the Jews.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.650
That's basically Venetian
dialect with a little Hebrew

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.470
and Aramaic coming in
from the prayer book

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:53.200
and the religious sources,
et cetera.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.290
And the Judeo-Venetian
was the everyday language.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.760
And the elite could
not only read Italian

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.280
but they also could write it.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.860
So Jews are writing in
Italian, the vernacular.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.240
And even in Latin,
because in Latin --

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.450
in Italy, Latin was not seen
as the language of the church,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:18.380 position:56%
but rather as a language of culture,
of the inhabitants of the republic

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.900
of letters and, therefore,

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:25.480
it was not considered
by the Jews to be taboo.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:31.600
So we always then have to remember
that the term ghetto refers only

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.450
to the housing arrangements
of the Jews.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:38.190
And their culture was
determined by their environment,

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.380
not by their housing arrangements.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.810
And the nature of the community was
further determined by the nature

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:50.190
of the cosmopolitan city of Venice
which, as it was so well pointed

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.650
out by the Ambassador, and again,
there's another long theme.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:36:00.660
You can discuss whether the laws
on the -- regarding the Jews were,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.510
quote, fair, humane,
et cetera, or not.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:09.970
By contemporary standards they
were certainly at least --

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.620
they were certainly very
favorable to the Jews.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.600
But the key thing is that
everything was passed

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.250 position:56%
by a council, by a legislative body.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.810
The Jews had every right of appeal

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.330
and everything follows
the due process of law.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.760
The one thing that one can
learn from studying Venice's,

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.110
that there were laws --
this is a lawful state

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.860
and everything is proceeding
on a legal basis

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.290
with committees sometimes one
feels maybe too many committees,

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.590
but that's another issue.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.880
If you had a problem, you
established a committee.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.600
They already realized
that back then.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.200
And how often the committee
met, et cetera,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.060
and all that is another problem.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.070
But the point is this
is a law-abiding state.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.030
Now, looking ahead to the 19th and
20th century, because I really want

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.760
to keep it moving, much
confusion arose as both past

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.510
and contemporaneous dense
areas of Jewish residents

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.220
that were neither compulsory
segregated nor enclosed came

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.770
to be referred to as ghettos.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:18.510
It has been observed, in
fact, to the preliminary --

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.540
we're talking now about the
end of the 20th century.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.960
It's certainly true today.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.840
Still true -- preliminary views
of ghetto definitions reveal

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.700
that the ghetto was
probably the most misused

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:36.590
and misunderstood spatial
concept used by social scientists.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.750
Clearly, the extended
use of the word ghetto,

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.790
in many different senses,
created a blurring

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.100
of the very important distinctions
between voluntary Jewish quarters

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.020
and those that were
segregated and closed.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.060
These distinctions reflected
completely different attitudes

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.640
toward Jews on the part of
governments and societies.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.220
Because of this blurring, modern
scholars have found it necessary

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.790
to distinguish between
different types of ghettos.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.820
And I'll skip the details
on the terminology,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.880
but we have technical ghettos
and nontechnical ghettos.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:18.360
We have Louie Wirth, the great
sociologist of the Ghetto

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.880
of the Chicago School, Colin
[inaudible] using the term

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.590 position:56%
of voluntary ghetto which
certainly would have been considered

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.990
oxymoronic by inhabitants
of the Italian Peninsula.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.950
And so it goes to distinguish
between forced ghettoization,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.050
self-ghettoization, et cetera.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.020 position:56%
Now, in this connection, we ought to
note that the 20th century ghettos

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.060
of Nazi Europe, which is where
most people acquire their knowledge

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.460
of what ghettos were, and as
Mitch Duneier demonstrated

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.150
in a recent book, had much to do
with popularizing the word ghetto

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.210
in the Afro-American world,
although it was known before that.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:04.160
But it -- your [inaudible]
soldiers in the American Army

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.030
and Europe saw the Nazi ghettos.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.720
These ghettos of modern Europe,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.850
if the 20th century is
still considered modern,

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:17.700 position:56%
differed fundamentally from those of
the early modern Italian Peninsula.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:25.040 position:56%
The Italian ghettos were supposed to
provide the Jews with a permanent,

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.110
clearly-defined space in
Christian society in accordance

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:35.340
with the traditional Christian
theology that the Jews were to live

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:41.520
in a subjected condition until
the second coming of Jesus.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.700
This was to prove the rejection
of Christianity by God.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:51.090 position:56%
They're living under abject
circumstances until the Messiah came

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.280
to redeem all of humanity,
et cetera.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.730
On the other hand, the Nazi
ghettos were very, very different

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:03.050
because they in no way had
anything permanent about them.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.740
This was no way a permanent
settling of the Jewish problem

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.600 position:56%
by providing them with a living area
because of their economic utility

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.030
in Christian society, but
rather once the decision

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:20.180
to embark upon the final
solution had been made,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.630
the ghettos constituted
a temporary waystation

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.630
on the road to emancipation.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.200
And these two different kinds of
ghettos reflect the difference

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.040
between traditional religious
anti-Judaism on the one hand

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:39.660
and modern racial antisemitism
in its ultimate form.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.280
In the case of anti-Judaism
a Jew could escape the ghetto

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.580
by conversion.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.350
There was a way out.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:51.750
While in the case of modern
antisemitism, one could not escape

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.840
by one's own conversion nor by the
conversion of one's parents nor

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.680
by the conversion of less
than three grandparents.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.780
So, interestingly the difference --

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:09.910
different natures of a compulsory
segregated and closed ghettos

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:15.360 position:56%
of pre-emancipation Christian
Europe on the one hand and those of,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.870
on the other hand, of Nazi-occupied
Europe, lead to the conclusion

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:23.040
that the experience of
European Jewry from 1940

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.180
to 1945 did not constitute
a return to the Middle Ages,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.850
but rather constituted the advent

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:36.040
of a completely new
and far worse reality.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.100
Indeed, the statement or
the remis-statement better,

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.300
that the Holocaust
represented a return

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.010
to the Middle Ages is probably
one of the most misunderstood --

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:52.210
one of the most widely spread
misunderstandings associated

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.140
with the word ghetto.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:00.280
Now, to begin our descent to pick
up on Roberta's very apt analogy,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.580
I see a story and I'm very bothered
by the use of the word ghetto

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.340
to describe a wide range of
Jewish quarters, let alone those

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.120
of subsequent current
application to the situation

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.970
of other minority groups,
whatever their nature.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.040
And I hope that, after
a few more minutes --

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.100
I promise not more than a couple --
you, too, will share this concern.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.340
The basic problem is as
one historian put it,

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:34.240
the word ghetto has lived
through more metamorphoses

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.800
than any other word with
such a long history.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.420
So, when one hears the word
ghetto, one has to ask,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.570
to which ghetto is the speaker
or author intending to refer,

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.780
and does the word invoke
the desired image?

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.830
If the compulsory segregated
enclosed Jewish quarters of Venice,

00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:01.200
Rome, and Florence were ghettos,
if the Lower East Side of New York

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:07.920
and Whitechapel and wherever else
were ghettos, if Warsaw, Lage,

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.190
and Bialystok were
ghettos, if Westchester

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:18.150
and Newton are golden ghettos, what
exactly does the word ghetto mean?

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.840
Incidentally, ghettos
did not cease --

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.860
did not exist in pre-World
War II Eastern Europe.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.100
The alleged ghettos
of Eastern Europe,

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.120
which should be called [foreign
word] or [foreign word],

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.430 position:56%
and even the entire pre-World War
II, pre-World War I, palo-settlement

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.280
as a whole, cannot
accurately be called a ghetto

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.200
in the early modern Italian sense
because some Jews were allowed

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.390
to live inside it while --

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.900
outside it, while Christians
could live within it.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.650
I haven't seen it for
many years, decades,

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.210
but I believe that in <i>Fiddler</i>

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:03.030
<i>on the Roof </i>you will
not see any ghettos.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.410
Now, if our understanding
of the word is unclear,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.660
how can our understanding
of the Jewish Experience be?

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.550
And when we speak of
non-Jewish ghettos in the cities

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:21.130 position:56%
of North America, South Africa, and
elsewhere, what are we referring to?

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.560
Is it a compulsory area
established by the state

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.820
or by zoning laws or by redlining?

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:33.450 position:56%
If it is compulsory, is it enclosed,
is it gated, is there a curfew,

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:38.480
is every person who is living in
that ghetto required to live in it

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.730
and no members of any
other community are allowed

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.350
to do in it -- live in it?

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.150
What image comes to our mind
when we hear the word ghetto?

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.500
We may or we will, probably,
encounter this important question

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:58.380
when we read the morning newspaper
or watch the evening news.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:04.030
Now, clearly, the -- clearly,
the situation cannot be rectified

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.160
by a global change in every case

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.580
in which the word ghetto has
been used in print in the past.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.640
What we can do, however, is use the
word ghetto with some explanation,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.090
with some nuancing, and with a
full awareness of the problematics

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:26.040
of identifying a ghetto and
share this awareness with others,

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.760
that the word ghetto has
changed its meanings.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.360
Now, it's all right if a
word changes its meaning.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.780
But the problem is when the old
meanings are used simultaneously

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.880
and you have a pile of meanings
and they're all being jumbled

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.750
in together, and it's not clear
what the user is referring to.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.050
It's unclear.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:59.130
And our understanding of a
past also becomes very blurred.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:04.780
So I'm suggesting to conclude
the differentiated use

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.700
of the word ghetto will lead
to a much better understanding

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.180
of a major feature of
both Jewish history,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.470
of world history, and
-- I said both.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:17.960 position:56%
I should say all of -- never ad lib.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:23.420
Either write that out and stick
to it or ad lab completely.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.790
That will lead to a much better
understanding of a major feature

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.860
of Jewish history, world
history, and urban history.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:35.540
If I may cite the titles of one of
my articles, that while originally,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.570
while every ghetto
was a Jewish quarter,

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:43.160
not every Jewish quarter
was a ghetto.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.690
May I put in one personal
word for 15 seconds?

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:52.130 position:56%
Today marks for me a first time that
-- by which I'm greatly honored.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:56.530
I refer to a few of the
speakers wo preceded me.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:00.190
And I want to thank
everybody who came here today

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.500
and I have my dear wife
with me [inaudible].

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.000
But today marks a first in that
I have present not only my son,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.940
but also my grandson, Ethan.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.910
And assuming that he
has not left [laughter],

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.210 position:56%
assuming -- yeah, he -- there he is.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.550
He's smiling in the back.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.560
So this is the first time I've
had the privilege of hearing --

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.700
of having Ethan in the audience.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.250
And yesterday, when he went -- we
went around the Capital Building,

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:32.710 position:56%
et cetera, he asked questions of a
guide in almost every place we were.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.980
And the questions were so
good, that I'm going to step

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.710
down quickly before he gets to
ask me a question again today.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:41.010
Thank you very much.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.810
Thank you.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.810
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
We're next going to hear

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.250
from Professor Dick Schneider
about the <i>Merchant of Venice </i>,

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.400
and as many of you know, this late
16th century Shakespearean play is

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.460
often categorized as
a romantic comedy.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.020
And it is constantly being
alluded to in literature.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:14.000
<i>The Merchant of Venice </i>had
been the subject of opera,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.670
poems, novels based on it.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:23.930
Recently a novel by Nadine
Gordimer mentions the Venice Ghetto

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.600
and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>
in one of the chapters.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:32.320
But I think even more fascinating
as a tribute to the longevity

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.450
and continuing influence of
this play, is first the face

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.500
that it was the subject of
three early silent films,

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.660
which I am sure are in the
collections of the Library

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.040
of Congress -- an English, a
French, and a German silent movie.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.540
And then in a more contemporary
vein, quotes from <i>The Merchant</i>

00:48:53.540 --> 00:49:00.160
<i>of Venice </i>have been peppered in
any number of <i>Star Trek </i>episodes.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.950
So if we have any doubt of
Shakespeare's enduring legacy,

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.560
or the enduring legacy of
<i>The Merchant of Venice </i>,

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.060
we have contemporary art
and culture to point to.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:15.480
So without further ado, I'd like
to present Professor Dick Schneider

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.300
who teaches Law Literature
and Culture in addition

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.680
to his many other duties
at Wake Forest University.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.530
Professor Schneider.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.050
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider: Hello, everyone.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.500
Thank you very much
for having me here.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.000
Thanks to Roberta and
Isabella and the whole staff

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.590
of the Library of Congress.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:41.510
It's been really a pleasure to
work on this project as well

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.880
as the project which I'll
talk about in just a minute

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.690
which is the Mock Appeal of
Shylock coming up in June.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:54.560
I'm going to take now the
fictional side of things

00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:00.460
that Professor Ravid
put aside and the nature

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.000
of these remarks are going to
be completely different from his

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.550
because it's the difference between
somebody who's looking at something

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.510
as an aspect of literature and
philosophy as opposed to someone

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.040
who discusses something
as a matter of history.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.540 position:56%
Shakespeare was not writing history.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.270
Shakespeare wrote a play.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:23.070
And yet the play itself is based in
a profound understanding of history

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:27.070
and of the contemporary
nature of Venice.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.710
Shakespeare, for instance, was
very sensitive to the fact that,

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:36.730
as Professor Ravid said, Venice was
a city of laws, a republic of laws.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:41.800 position:56%
It stood or fell on the basis of its
laws which is really at the heart

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.650
of <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:50.740
So, as you know, many
Shakespeare plays have seen kind

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.920 position:56%
of post-historical kind of rewrites.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.820
For instance, in the 18th
century, it's well known

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:03.660
that <i>King Lear </i>was performed
usually with a happy ending.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.780 position:56%
King Lear survived, and Cordelia
survived and they lived happily ever

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.980
after as father and daughter.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.360
<i>Hamlet </i>was rewritten so that
Ophelia and Hamlet both end

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.490
up getting married and
live happily ever after.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:24.680
It's interesting to me that
the rewrites of <i>The Merchant</i>

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:31.280
<i>of Venice </i>seemed to be clustered
in the last 20 years or 30 years

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.160
in this country because lawyers and
law schools apparently cannot get

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.830
over the guilt that they experience
at the conviction of Shylock.

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:45.680
And so we keep giving
Shylock a second chance.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.350
And sometimes that second chance
works out and sometimes it doesn't.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.280
It depends on the lawyers
and it depends on the judges.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.920
These are the so-called
mock appeals of Shylock.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.840
One difficulty I have is kind
of assuming a certain level

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.530
of knowledge that you have of
the play because what I'm going

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.530
to be talking about is
principally the play.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:16.080
So I'll just -- in just
25 words or less, I hope,

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.520
just quickly remind you that
the play is about a Jewish --

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.010
you can call him a
banker or a usurer --

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:31.980
a Jewish money-lender who lends
money to the merchant Antonio

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.030
and instead of charging
him interest,

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:37.130
he charges him a pound of flesh.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:42.050
And if Antonio's ships don't come
back, and the time of the payment

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:47.420
of the bond passes, Shylock has the
right in his contract and his bond

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.740
to demand a pound of
flesh from Antonio.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.670
And so the heart of the play is
the working out of this drama,

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.300
will Shylock demand this?

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.970
Will he not?

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:04.590
He goes to court with the
contract out in front of him saying

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:09.180
that he should be given this
right to take the pound of flesh.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:13.720
At the last minute, Portia
comes into the action

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.980
and in a sense saves
the day for Antonio.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:23.410
She turns the tables completely
on Shylock, finds a way to kind

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:28.630
of vindicate the laws of Venice
and at the same time declare

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:31.490
that if Shylock takes
his pound of flesh,

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.620
that he better take
only a pound of flesh

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.500
and not spill any Christian
blood or he will be found

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:45.050
to have violated the Alien
Statute which requires the Republic

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.080
of Venice then to take
the life of the person

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.090
who shed the Christian blood.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.400
So she completely turns
the table on Shylock.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.940
And at the end of the play Shylock
has to forfeit all of his wealth

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.150
and he has to convert
to Christianity.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.900 position:56%
And he ends -- then end of Act IV --
there's still Act V, but at the end

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:11.870
of Act IV, he leaves the play,
you know, beaten and humiliated,

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.220
beaten metaphorically,
and humiliated,

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.490
and kind of crawls away basically.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:24.140
So that's kind of quickly in a
nutshell what goes on in the play.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:32.040 position:56%
I was involved this past summer
with -- as the Ambassador mentioned,

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.440
there have been a lot of events in
Venice relating to the celebration

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:42.490
of -- or the commemoration of the
500th anniversary of the founding

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:45.340
of the Venice Ghetto in 1516.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.200
Also, coincidentally,
it's the 400th anniversary

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.070
of the death of Shakespeare.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:54.290
And so the University
of Venice, principally,

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:59.470
and the city of Venice last summer
mounted an incredibly wonderful

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:03.480
experience for everyone who was
there at the time, including me

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.700
and a class of law
students from Wake Forest.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:11.690
We -- they did a -- as
the Ambassador mentioned,

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.580
they did a new production of <i>The
Merchant of Venice </i>in the Ghetto.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.540
It's the first time <i>The Merchant
of Venice </i>had been performed

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.950
in the Ghetto, performed outside.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.000
It was a remarkable production.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.370
There was a book launching.

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:29.270 position:56%
Howard Jacobson has recently written
a book which is kind of a rewrite

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:32.830
of <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>,
called <i>My Name is Shylock </i>.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.380
It's a wonderful book.

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.040
And I advise you to read that,

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.090
although I would say before you
read the book you should reread <i>The</i>

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:44.110 position:56%
<i>Merchant of Venice </i>because the
book will not be very understandable

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:46.710
-- it will be much
more understandable

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.000
if you've recently read
the play or seen the play.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.760
And, you know, it all culminated
with this mock appeal that we did

00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:01.670
where Justice Ginsberg
came all the way to Venice.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:05.860 position:56%
She appeared -- she taught my class.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.540
She's a wonderful, wonderfully
generous person that way.

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:16.210 position:56%
I had known her from prior
encounters with her and so it was --

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:20.540
and that was an incredible
part of the experience.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:24.450
But then, as I said, it
culminated with this mock appeal

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:30.800
where we had three lawyers
presenting arguments for Shylock,

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.920
for Antonio, and for Portia.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.630
That was the really new part
of this particular appeal was

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.500
that we added a lawyer for Portia.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:45.740
As I said, this has been done in
the past on several occasions.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.490
The Bar, the city of
New York has done it,

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:52.740
the University of Chicago
has done it.

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:56.060
There have been other places where
we've had mock appeals of Shylock,

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.620
but nobody has done it with a
third lawyer representing Portia.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.850
So that was a lot of fun.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.480
We had five judges who
heard the arguments.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.380
And at the appropriate time they --

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:16.470
we all retired and deliberated
about the outcome of the case,

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.440
which I won't talk about now.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.980
That will be going
into too much detail.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.790
But this is all going
to be re-enacted,

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:29.550
not with the same personnel, but
it will be re-enacted in spirit

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.970
on June 21 here at the
Library of Congress.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:35.590
So I encourage all of
you to come if you can.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:39.090
Justice Ginsberg will again
be the Presiding Judge.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.870
I will again be a judge.

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:46.410
We have three lawyers to
represent the three parties.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:51.230
And we have a Shakespeare expert
coming down from Columbia.

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:56.130
While the judges are deliberating
Jim Shapiro will be coming

00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:00.780
down to talk to the audience as
we deliberate about the play.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:06.830
And we hope to have some very
fine actors do very short readings

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:11.560
of Shylock and Portia's
great speeches in the play.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.160
So I think it will be a lot of fun.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.670
Now, let me get into
the into the kind

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.940 position:56%
of the more substance of my remarks.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:26.010 position:56%
And I'm going to be approaching this
issue of Understanding Seclusion,

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.580 position:56%
the title for today's two addresses.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.090
As I said, from the
standpoint of fiction,

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:35.810
it's not a little bit
ironic that, you know,

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:40.570
perhaps the most famous Venetian
is a fictional character,

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:43.980 position:56%
somebody who never existed, Shylock.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.570
And, as I make these comments
about Shylock, though,

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.760
which are all in the way
of looking at possible ways

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:59.900 position:56%
under the contemporary kind of legal
culture of Venice in 16th century

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:05.790
to defend Shylock, this is also
a way to understand seclusion

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:09.330
because defenses of
Shylock really looked

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:12.990
at from just a slightly
different angle become ways

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:17.080
to understand the seclusion
of the Jews in the ghetto.

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.620
So that's kind of a subtext
as I move forward here.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:26.650
So one of the most interesting
things that has to be

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:31.220
at least talked about before you go
into one of these mock appeals is

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.540
which law do you use, right?

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:40.100
Do you provide a kind of
new case for Shylock based

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.590
on the Venetian law that
existed at the time?

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:47.450
Do you look at the English law

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.440
that Shakespeare would
have been very familiar

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.510
with as he was writing the play?

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:55.190
It's doubtful that
Shakespeare ever went to Venice,

00:59:55.190 --> 01:00:00.450
although <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>
kind of provides a, you know,

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:05.420
a center of argument of
that because some people --

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.730 position:56%
except that some people think that
Shakespeare did not write the plays.

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:12.980
It's possible that somebody
else went to Venice.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:18.060
But that's a whole other issue.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.630
But Shakespeare probably
did not go to Venice,

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:27.520
and so he's really writing in a
sense a critique of laws in England

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.680
and the legal culture in England

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.300
through the prism of
looking at Venice.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:37.900 position:56%
So he can distance himself from
being criticized in England because,

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.300
hey, I'm just writing
a play about Venice.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.430
I'm not writing a play
about England.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:49.190
So you could look at English laws
or you could look at 20th century

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.200
or 21st century human rights laws.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.950
And that has been a
temptation of a number

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:00.380
of these mock appeals
as they've happened.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.950 position:56%
So, for instance, as I mentioned
this, the Bar, the city of New York,

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:07.760
a couple of years ago did
one of these mock appeals

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.420
and a guy named Daniel
Kornstein, who wrote a book called,

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.170
about Shakespeare and law,

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:21.160
called <i>Let's Kills All the
Lawyers </i>represented Shylock

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.730
and Floyd Abrams represented
Antonio.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.610
So that was a lot of fun.

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.280
But just to give you
a flavor of some

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.340
of these more 20th century
arguments, Mr. Kornstein,

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.820
in his arguments, made
the following arguments.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.020
That the Alien Statute raised
by Portia is unconstitutional

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.380
and denies equal protection.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.790
That Shylock's due process
rights were violated

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:49.520
when the civil trial evolved
into a criminal trial.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.610
That the penalties
leveled against --

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:55.440
levied against him constitute
cruel and unusual punishment.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.470
And the order for Shylock to
convert violated his right

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.110
to exercise freedom of religion.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:06.910
So, a lot of that, you can see,
is borrowed from our Constitution

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:11.120
and borrowed from human
rights documents

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.210
and human rights instruments
that have developed long beyond,

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:20.180
long after the 16th
century in Venice.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.070
Floyd Abrams said,
"It would be a mistake

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:25.460
to examine the trial
court's decision

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.910
through the unforgivingly
politically correct lens

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.680
of contemporary legal
and social mores."

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.630
So there's this kind of -- I guess
I would say there's this kind

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:43.910
of subtext that you
can't look at these --

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:47.320
at this decision, this
conviction in the play,

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.520
from the time of the 16th century
and come up with human rights,

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.870
with valid human rights arguments,
that you have to move forward

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:57.510
and argue anachronistically.

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:02.690
So the purpose of my remarks
in the next few minutes are

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:07.500
to really take this play and
look at it from the standpoint

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.180
of what was the legal culture
in Venice and England which,

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.500
even though England was
a common law country,

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.950
Venice was a civil law country,

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:20.140
those two traditions
are quite different.

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.500
Nonetheless, the intellectual
culture

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.690
and the legal culture
was largely shared.

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.860
They were reading the same people.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.830
They were thinking many of the same
thoughts even though they became

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:33.220
embodied in different laws.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:38.100
And so I'm just going to
suggest some ways to vindicate

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.760
or to attack the judgment of
the court, vindicate Shylock

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.560
through looking at
contemporary concepts

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.130
and contemporary understandings
of legal culture.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.210
So, first of all, I'll start off

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:55.170
with just some basic human
rights considerations.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:59.070
Shylock has not been treated
before the court like a human being

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.740
in the full sense of the concept,

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.820
nor has he been accorded human
rights in his daily life.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:11.100
These arguments have been
made, but as I've said,

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:16.580
not so much in the
context of the time.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:22.770
Those idea -- so, Shylock is in at
least two senses, inhabits a world

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.410
that is quite different
from Antonio and the rest

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:28.210
of the Christian aristocracy
of Venice.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:31.040
Because he is Jewish, he is
first subject to different

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.340
and more prohibitive laws.

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:37.640 position:56%
He is not a full member of the
society in which he lives and works.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.720
Second, as a physical
constraint of his being socially

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.900
and legally set off, he must
live in the Jewish Ghetto

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.110
where he is subject again to
harsh restrictions relating

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:52.220
to living conditions,
travel, and social relations.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.410
Yet, notwithstanding
his different status,

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:57.770
he makes one of the
greatest speeches in drama

01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.900
to assert his common
humanity with his oppressors.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.320
And you all know this speech.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:09.470 position:56%
And I can't help but just read a
little bit of it just to remind you.

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.700
This is considered to
be, by many commentators,

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.470
to be Shakespeare's great, you
know, plea for human rights,

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:19.310
a plea for a common humanity.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:22.040
So the fact that Shakespeare
makes this in a sense

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.980
in the play is the beginning
of proof that there was --

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.860
there were thoughts at the time

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.230
that Jews should not have
been treated like this.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:35.480
So, Salarino asks Shylock
what he's going to do

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.450
if he takes the pound
of human flesh.

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:40.300
What's it good for?

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.320
And Shylock responds,
"To bait fish with all.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.440
If it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.200
He hath disgraced me and
hindered me half a million,

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.220
laughed at my losses, mocked
at my gains, scorned my nation,

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:02.920
thwarted my bargains, cooled my
friends, heated mine enemies.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.240
And what's his reason?

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.540
I am a Jew.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.010
Hath not a Jew eyes?

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:14.070
Hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections,

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:19.790
passions, fed with the same
food, hurt with the same weapons,

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:25.930 position:56%
subject to the same diseases, healed
by the same means, warmed and cooled

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.410
by the same winter and
summer as a Christian is?

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:33.330
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:36.080
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.000
If you poison us, do we not die?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.900
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:47.300
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.320
Of a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility?

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.840 position:56%
Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew,

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.500
what should his sufferance
be by Christian example?

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.180
Why, revenge.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:05.050
The villainy you teach me I will
execute and it shall go hard,

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:08.320
but I will better the instruction."

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.470
So a powerful comment.

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:18.230
It's often forgotten that what
Shylock is reminding the hypocrite

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:21.560 position:56%
Christians is that he wants revenge.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.400
And if he's like them
in other things,

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.250
he's like them in wanting revenge.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:32.700
So Aristotle wrote in <i>The Politics</i>
about the impossibility for someone

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.770
to achieve his or her full humanity

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:39.420
when separated from
others in the city.

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:44.660 position:56%
The text of <i>Politics </i>was
accessible in England and in Venice.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:49.740
Aristotle famously described the
human being as a political animal.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:54.500
He wrote that, "He who is without
a city by reason of his own nature

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:59.930 position:56%
and not of some accident is either a
poor sort of being or a being higher

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:02.310
than man," meaning a god.

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.520
Clearly, Shylock is not a god.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.800
He is like the man of whom Homer
wrote in <i>Denunciation </i>, "Clanless

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.640
and lawless and hearthless is he."

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.150
So it's important that
Aristotle fixes on this idea

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:20.400
of being separated from the
city based on his own nature

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.010
and not of some accident.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.410
So here we have Shylock being
separated in the ghetto based

01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:30.370
on his nature of being a Jew.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:34.410
Alasdair MacIntyre,
interpreting Aristotle passage,

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.780
writes that "A human being,
separated from the polis,"

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.820
from the city, "is
thereby deprived of some

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.810
of the essential attributes
of a human being."

01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.950
MacIntyre aligns Aristotle
with Homer and Sophocles

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:51.700
as early thinkers who believe
that, quote, "A human being

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.420
who is separated from his
social group is also deprived

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:59.190
of the capacity for justice."

01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:02.430
He says that, according
to Aristotle, quote,

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.030
"Separated from the polis,

01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:08.750
what could have been a human being
becomes instead a wild animal."

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:12.260
So there's this idea
that the nature --

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:20.070
that separation in and of
itself creates a lack of justice

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:22.450
in the separated population.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.830 position:56%
And, according to Aristotle, this
idea that there's a fallback to kind

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:30.340 position:56%
of wild instinctual feelings instead

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.280
of being governed by
legal principles.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.140 position:56%
Shylock, being a political animal,
gets set off, exhibits the handicaps

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.890
of separation from other
members of the city of Venice.

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:47.920 position:56%
He can be hardly expected to respond
justly in contract or in court

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.940
when he is not a full
member of the polis.

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:55.010
The explicit and implicit
violence of the penalty he includes

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:59.750
in the bond is understandable
given that he has been deprived

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:05.050
of the capacity for justice and
may be closer to a wild animal.

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:08.850
For an extreme example
of this outcome

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:12.580
of exclusion you can
take a look at Barabas

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.770
in Marlowe's <i>Jew of Malta </i>, right?

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:17.460
So a lot of -- it's
possible that Shakespeare --

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.760
there were a lot of --

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.300
several things involving Jews
that were happening in England

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.070
about the time Shakespeare
wrote <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:28.970
But one of them was that
Marlowe had had a great deal

01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:31.820
of success writing
<i>The Jew of Malta </i>.

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.880
And Barabas is a very different
character than Shylock.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.330
If the court in Venice were
forced to recognize the legal

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:43.580
and physical separations
suffered by Shylock

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:47.960
and its effects it might
begin a process of enquiry

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.690
into the justification for its
laws when applied the contracts

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:55.010
between Jews and Christians.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:59.430
In any case, this might be an
approach to a kind of nascent idea

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:02.380
of a human right to a
quality of treatment.

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:06.540
So I'm putting together
Shakespeare's own speech,

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.950
which I just read to
you, and Aristotle.

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.250
All right.

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:15.460
On a slightly different topic,
Aristotle himself opens the door

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.990
to the judge acting justly.

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:22.000
What is the responsibility of the
Duke of Venice to answer justly,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.690
to act justly, and not, perhaps,
just according to the laws.

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:30.980
Another very influential
Aristotelian text

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.570
in the Renaissance was
the <i>Nicomachean Ethics </i>.

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:38.000
In it, Aristotle writes that
quote, "When people dispute

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.490
with one another they find
refuge before a judge.

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:49.440
To go to a judge is to go to the
just, for a judge wishes to be,

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.310
as it were, the just
ensouled," close quote.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.730
An effective counterargument
to using Aristotle to argue

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:01.430
for equality of treatment
might be that Aristotle --

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:03.930
so, also accept, accepted slavery.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.210
As you know, there was slavery
in the Greek city-states.

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:09.550 position:56%
And it's interesting that at this --

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:14.350
that Shylock also points out
the hypocrisy to the Christians

01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:16.240
in <i>The Merchant of
Venice </i>of the fact

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.290
that they have slaves,
that they own property.

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.830
And so, therefore, he's
saying, "Why cannot I not

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:30.760
at the same time enforce my
contract for the pound of flesh?"

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.940
Okay. Michelle de Montagne,
the great French Philosopher

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.770
of the 16th century can also be
brought to bear to demonstrate

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.900
that there was a whiff of
tolerance in the air at the time

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.820
that Shakespeare wrote
<i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:47.700
Montagne was available to the
educated and Shakespeare had access

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:52.440
to Montagne's essays as of 1580
when they were first published.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.620
He could have read them in whatever
French he had available to him.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:00.000
Of course, the essays became
fully available to Shakespeare

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.990
when they were published in
English translation in 1603.

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:07.410
But that was after the composition
of <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:09.680
The relations between <i>The
Merchant of Venice </i>itself

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.380
and Montagne are beside
the point here.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:15.020
The point is whether at the
time it would have been possible

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:19.440
in Christian Venice to see
a way toward more tolerance

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.730
with respect to laws.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.340
In fact, Montagne was at the very
beginning of the arc of toleration

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.170 position:56%
that would eventually culminate
with the "Bill of Rights" in America

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.930
and the "Declaration of the
Rights of Man" in France.

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:36.670
His famous essay, <i>Of the
Cannibals </i>specifically purposes

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:40.130
to impress Europeans with
conflicting, but legitimate,

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:45.050
claims to knowledge in practice
exhibited by non-European peoples.

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.720
In the case of the
"Essay", it was Brazilians.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.600
In John Florio's translation,
Montagne writes,

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.210
"Now to return to my purpose.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:57.700
I find as far as I've been informed
there is nothing in that nation,

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:02.740
Brazil, that is either barbarous
or savage unless men call

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:08.360
that barbarism which is simply
not common to them, as, indeed,

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:13.160
we have no other aim of truth and
reason than the example and idea

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.070
of the opinions and customs
of the country we live in,

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:22.270
where is ever perfect religion,
perfect policy, perfect

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:24.380
and complete use of all things."

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.390
So Montagne's saying that we
have to look at other groups

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.350
through an understanding that,

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:33.430
just because they do something
differently from the way we do it,

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.400
doesn't mean that we have the
right to judge them or think

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.430
that what they're doing is in
some way inferior to what we do.

01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:45.600 position:56%
Could the judges in the case of
Shylock's arguments not exhibit some

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.170
of the toleration and humanism
Montagne evidences toward peoples

01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.840
far from Europe?

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.270
Could toleration become
especially relevant

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:59.510
when Shylock's ultimate punishment,
forced conversion, is considered?

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:03.690
Okay. So, those are
[inaudible] broad human rights

01:15:03.690 --> 01:15:05.400
and toleration ideas.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.060 position:56%
To go to the ghetto more explicitly.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.620
Shakespeare never mentions
the Jewish Ghetto

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.920
in <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.650
This is one of the things that has
puzzled people who thought a lot

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:17.650
about <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:21.250
If it -- if Shakespeare
knew Venice so well,

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.760 position:56%
why did he never mention the ghetto?

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.980
There's no answer for that.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.560
Why did -- so, many -- the
question has entered into --

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.180 position:56%
well, I already mentioned that --
has entered into a small controversy

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.680
over who wrote <i>The
Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.450
To the arguments noted above under
human rights, take for granted

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:45.700
that Shylock is being treated
differently and unfairly,

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.520
but do not describe in detail
the kinds of prohibitions

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520
under which he would
have lived and worked.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.190
So as Professor Ravid
mentioned, the ghetto was located

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:56.620
in the northwest part of the
city on two small islands.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.030
The islands were linked to
the city by two small bridges,

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:03.560
always under guard by Christian
soldiers who were paid,

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.660
not by the city, but by the
inhabitants of the ghetto.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.360
Residents of the ghetto could not
leave between sundown and sunrise

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.850 position:56%
because the city closed the bridges.

01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.340
Moreover, the other parts
of the ghetto were separated

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:19.040
from the water by high walls.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.940
Finally, the Jews had to
pay the cost of two boats

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:26.010
that kept the ghetto
surrounded and under guard.

01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:28.060
If the Jews left the
ghetto during the day,

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.300
they had to wear identifying
marks, yellow badges

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.800
or skullcaps during
their stay in the city.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.560
In addition to the requirement
to live in the ghetto and abide

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.280
by its exclusions, Shylock and all
other Jews in Venice faced frequent

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.630
and significant taxation
as well as a large number

01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:49.010
of government economic regulations.

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:51.310
They could not engage
in numerous trades.

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:54.310
They were prohibited from
engaging in numerous trades.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:57.900
And limited to particular
trades like pawn shops,

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.970
second-hand clothes,
and money lending.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.180
The Catholic Church
prescribed some of the --

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.950
proscribed some of this activity.

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:14.210
So the Venetian economy needed
the participation of the Jews.

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:15.510
That was the deal.

01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.390
The Jews could live in
Venice in the ghetto

01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:19.530
if they provided those services.

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.040
So it should be obvious
at this point that there's

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.890
at least one strong reason for
Shylock to insist throughout most

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:28.830
of the trial scene on
repayment of his bond.

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:32.950
This is an individual who has very
limited rights and the according

01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:36.910
of those rights to him are
all beyond his control.

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:39.210
The city determines
what Shylock may do

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:41.500 position:56%
and what he's prohibited from doing.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:45.190
From physical movement to
business occupation to the conduct

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:48.350 position:56%
of commerce, Shylock is constrained.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:52.340
Here in <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>he
at last possesses a piece of paper,

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:55.970
a contract, a bond, that
seems to give him some rights.

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:04.210
Can he be blamed for
reading it with blinders,

01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:08.700
ignoring the larger context of
discrimination that Portia brings

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:13.330 position:56%
so dramatically to bear when she
argues her case under the Alien Act?

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:17.780
Should the court be so quick to
condemn the expressive nature

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:22.090
of Shylock's small page of freedom?

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:32.310
So, I'm arguing that Shylock has a
desire to express his own yearning

01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:37.890
for freedom through the
insistence on the bond.

01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:41.560
And now the symbolism
behind the penalty.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.140
Shylock argues that his
motive in signing the bond

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:48.040
with Antonio was not to seek
the life of any citizen,

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:51.050
even though the bond called
for the pound of flesh.

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:54.620
Motive must be important -- so
this is under the Alien Act --

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:57.350
motive must be important
because otherwise it's possible

01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:01.520
than an alien doctrine, including a
Jew who helped a Venetian citizen,

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.560
could come under the law.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.770
Likewise, an alien who accidentally
causes a Venetian to fall

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.850
and cut himself could be
prosecuted under the law.

01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.290
So motive is important.

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:15.360
But there's a better,
more compelling argument

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.420
that I don't think has been raised
anywhere else in the literature

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.630
on <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>.

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:24.270 position:56%
I would argue that the motive behind
the particular penalty demanded

01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:29.730 position:56%
by Shylock, the pound of flesh, is,
in fact, a proxy or a symbol of life

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:34.100
in the ghetto, and more
incisively, of the ghetto itself.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:39.040
The ghetto is cut out of the body
of the city of Venice and exists

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.240
within it, but separately.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.760
The pound of flesh, once removed,
interrupts the smooth functioning

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.520
of the human body just as the
distinct physical separation

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.790
of the ghetto interrupts the
continuity and the flow of Venice.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.000
So, Dr. Ravid was talking about
the need for Christians to be able

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.110 position:56%
to cross the ghetto, to come and go.

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:03.040
The ghetto interrupts
that natural flow.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.860
Shylock is showing Antonio and the
rulers of Venice through his ruse

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:11.330
of the pound of flesh just what the
ghetto's separate status is doing

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:14.010
to Venice and to the
Jews who are forced

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:17.570 position:56%
to live there in relative isolation.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:21.100
This possibility is supported
by two historical references.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:25.250
First in 1516 the decree
that created the ghetto

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.980
when the Venice City Council order
the Jews to leave other parts

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:31.030
of Venice and move into the ghetto.

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:34.790
It declared that the Jews
had to be removed [speaking

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:39.100
in foreign language] which
means they had to be removed

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.230
from the body of the city.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.680
So Shakespeare had a ready metaphor

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.580
in the legal document itself
that created the ghetto.

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.910
Second, the contemporary of
Shakespeare who travelled in Italy,

01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:57.190
including Venice, and published
a kind of travelogue in 1611

01:20:57.190 --> 01:21:00.630
about those adventures and
many others, spoke of the Jews

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:05.200
who could quote, "flay many
a poor Christian's estate

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.170
by their griping extortion,"
close quote.

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:12.870
Of course Shakes wrote <i>The Merchant
of Venice </i>earlier than 1611,

01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:16.420
but this line opens the possibility
that people at the time thought

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:19.540
of the extraction of
wealth from another person

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.600
as a kind of skinning or flaying.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.680
The relation to the pound
of flesh is obvious.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.130
Related expressions today
might include skinflint

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:33.340
or the skin off my back.

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:44.560
Okay. And just a couple of more
quick comments about defenses

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.210
that could be made for Shylock.

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:51.270
There's the idea of "the other."

01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:55.340 position:56%
Of course this is an idea which is
pursued mostly in the 20th centuries

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.280 position:56%
through a philosopher named
Emanuel Levi Nau [assumed spelling].

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.490
And I'm not applying this 20th
century idea to <i>The Merchant</i>

01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:08.870
<i>of Venice </i>, but what I am saying
is that if you look at Shylock

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:13.390 position:56%
through the lens of being the other,
though a great deal becomes clear

01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:17.870
in the play, and so I think

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:21.950
in that sense it's appropriate even
though the philosophy itself might

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:24.880
not have been in existence
at that point.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.400
Shylock is fighting back

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.520
against marginalization,
against this othering.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:34.090 position:56%
He fights back through his
negotiation of the bond with Antonio

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:36.540
and through his conduct
during the trial.

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:40.010
But he cannot overcome his
fundamental invisibility

01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:43.310
to the Christian forces
aligned against him.

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:44.950
First, the negotiation of the bond.

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:48.630
Shylock needs to bond to be an
affirmation of his own being.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.660
As noted above, it has an
expressive side wholly apart

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.660
from its legal nature.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.530
Shylock wants to be noticed and
wants his message to be understood.

01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.810
At the same time, however, the bond

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:06.310
and its penalty may be a
significant weakness for Shylock.

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:09.070
I earlier alluded to
Shylock's famous Act III speech

01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:12.210
with what I read where he seeks
common ground with Christians and,

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:14.820
in particular, with
respect to revenge.

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.020
Revenge is often overlooked
and underplayed in discussions

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:21.770
of the speech when a commentator's
emphasizing Shakespeare's empathy

01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:23.900
and compassion for Jews.

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:28.990
As Shylock says, "If you wrong
us, shall we not revenge?"

01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:32.540 position:56%
What I want to focus on is
Shakespeare's use of the word wrong.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.630
What is Shylock speaking about?

01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:39.410
A legal wrong or a moral wrong
or just a semantic wrong?

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:42.550
If a legal wrong, then we do
not question Shylock's recourse

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.150
to the legal system.

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:46.840
But if he's speaking about a
moral wrong, and the speech

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.990
as a whole is overwhelmingly
about moral wrong,

01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:51.950
then Shylock's own moral failing is

01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:57.320
that he's using the legal
system to obtain revenge.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.600
Bassanio in the very next scene
calls attention to the problem

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.820
when he says, quote, "In law,
what plea so tainted and corrupt,

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:10.860
but being seasoned with a gracious
voice, obscures the show of evil?"

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:16.270
So, Bassanio knows that law can
dress something up that is corrupt,

01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:19.570
can make it seem to be acceptable.

01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:22.930
Finally, during the
trial scene in Act IV,

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:27.670 position:56%
Shylock shows his profound blindness
to his own failing when he says,

01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:30.910
"What judgment shall I
dread doing no wrong?"

01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:34.000
He cannot see the wrong that
he does to the legal system

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.890
by making it an accomplice for
revenge notwithstanding his desire

01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:40.620
to make his bond an
instrument of descent.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:44.040
So in the process of his trying
to overcome his othering,

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:50.070
he makes other mistakes,
certainly category mistakes.

01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:53.840
Okay. And then two more points.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.220
Next, Shylock's conduct
at the trial.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:59.560
Fundamentally, even though Shylock
abides by the rules of the court,

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.810
he does not submit himself fully
to the forms of argument expected

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:06.340
by his adversaries or by the Duke.

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:11.000 position:56%
So, at least within the construct of
the play as shown by Quentin Skinner

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.840
in his book, <i>Forensic
Shakespeare </i>--

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.800
it's a really wonderful book
about taking apart several

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.080
of Shakespeare's plays and
looking at them from the standpoint

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:26.260
of rhetoric and forensics that
were available in the Renaissance.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.790
That the Duke and Portia
expected a very particular form

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:32.160
of argumentation from Shylock.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.850
They did not get it.

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:37.020 position:56%
The expected argument would
attract the rhetorical prescriptions

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.720
of classical authors such
as Cicero and Quintillion.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.720
Skinner argues that Shylock, by
straying from the prescriptions

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.990
of classical rhetoric,
hurt his own case.

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:52.030
If Shylock does not adopt the
expected rhetorical strategies,

01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:54.520
is he instead using
argument in ways attended --

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.680
intended to call attention
to his status as other?

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.880
Specifically, how much was
Shylock's rhetoric a product

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.620
of his own Jewish philosophy and
forms of Talmudic argumentation?

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.760
Was the ruling against Shylock
delivered in part out of a failure

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.570
to grasp the difference between
Western forms of argument

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.300
and Jewish forms of argument?

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.460
Without attempting anything more
than suggestion at this point,

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.640
I would direction your
attention to a work

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.900
such David A. Frank's
article, "Arguing With God,

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:28.970
Talmudic Discourse and
the Jewish Countermodel."

01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:31.600
Frank argues that the Jewish
form of argument is founded

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.550
on freedom rather than necessity.

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:39.350
He opposes the Jewish act of
argumentation, the classical forms

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:44.410
of debate, that depend rather on
apodictic reasoning or reasoning

01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:50.550 position:56%
that goes to a clear certainty, a
standard that forecloses discussion.

01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:55.210
Frank quotes two writers
on rhetoric and says,

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:58.840
"Recourse to argumentation assumes
the establishment of a community

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:05.170
of minds which, while it lasts,
excludes the use of violence."

01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:07.110
But Shylock is read --

01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:10.210
so my argument reverses
the traditional reading

01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:13.640
of the trial scene where Shylock
is read as advocating violence,

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.470
the penalty, and Portia, mercy.

01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:20.020
However, the violence of the
decision and sentence happen

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:23.800
because they're moving toward
a conclusion, in Western style,

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.010
that is, inevitably, with closure,

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:30.390
when Shylock must surrender his
wealth and convert to Christianity.

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:31.690
No one will ever be able

01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:33.730
to show whether Shylock
would have shown mercy

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:37.090
to Antonio had he won his case.

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.760
Perhaps the point would
have been made

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.630
and the discussion could
continue with mercy in the offing.

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:47.150
Ins other words, that Shylock
was arguing from a point

01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:51.600
of open-endedness rather
than closure.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.920
Okay. I'm going to skip over some
of this, and I just want to get

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:00.050
to one final thing
which is from Bocaccio.

01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:05.530
So this is an argument
focused on the systemic failure

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.800
of the Venetian state to take

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.790
into account the Jews
and their perspective.

01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:14.240
Shylock and the Jews
had no role in debating

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.250
or adopting the laws
enforced by the court.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:21.290
Is it equitable to have those laws
applied cruelly and exactingly

01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:23.660
to those excluded from the polis?

01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.010
In the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>
Aristotle wrote that

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:29.240
"what is called judgment in
reference to which we assert

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.250
that people are sympathetic
judges and have judgment,"

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:35.590
is the correct decision
as to what is equitable.

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:38.760
Madonna Filippa in
Boccaccio's <i>Decameron </i>,

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.800
written in the 14th century,

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.860
articulated very clearly the
principle that is not equitable

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.990
to hold one group, in her case,
women, accountable to laws

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:53.040 position:56%
that have been adopted without
their participation or contribution.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.780
In the case at issue, Madonna
Filippa is accused of adultery,

01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.010
but she argues that,
quote, "Every man

01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:04.610 position:56%
and woman should be equal before the
law and laws must have the consent

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:07.250
of those who are affected by them.

01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:10.000
These conditions are not
fulfilled in the present instant

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.280
because this law only applies to us
poor women who are much better able

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:18.930
than men to bestow
our favors liberally.

01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:23.760
Moreover, when this law was made,
no woman gave her consent to it,

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.710
nor was any woman ever so much
as -- even to much as consulted.

01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:33.380
It can, therefore, justly be
described as a very bad law."

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.970
So there was a very
strong historical argument

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.310
at hand for Shylock.

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:40.060
Boccaccio was well
before Shakespeare wrote,

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:43.760
and Shakespeare knew Boccaccio
-- one -- knew his writing.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.830
One has only to replace women in
Madonna Filippa's speech with Jews.

01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.510
And, by the way, Madonna
Filippa was acquitted

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:54.280
of all the charges brought
against her [laughter].

01:29:54.280 --> 01:30:01.170
So, I urge you all to come
to the mock appeal in June

01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:04.620
and see how this works
out yet again.

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.420
Thank you.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:14.710
[ Applause ]

01:30:14.710 --> 01:30:16.090
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Thank you all very much.

01:30:16.090 --> 01:30:20.010
We are going go have a brief
Question and Answer period,

01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:21.720
but I would be entirely remiss

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.380
if I didn't acknowledge the
third intellectual giant

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.300
who is not physically on the
podium with us this morning,

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.230
but who is nonetheless
pervasive throughout the program.

01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:36.030
And that is Nathan Dorn,
the Curator of Rare Books

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:38.280
at the Law Library of Congress.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.130
Nathan organized the panel.

01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:44.240
He organized the display with our
wonderful colleague Ann Brenner.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.780
And he also is the person who
created the wonderful postcard book

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:53.280
that all of you should have
received as a favor today.

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.080
And so, before I bring Professor
Ravid and Professor Schneider back

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.930
to the podium to answer your
questions, I would please ask you

01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:05.510
to join me in giving Nathan
a resounding applause.

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:11.200
[ Applause ]

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.410
And now members of the
Library staff have microphones.

01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:19.740
I must remind you that our program
is being videotaped and that

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.450
if you do ask a question
you will likely be captured

01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:24.750
on the video tape.

01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:27.780
And if that's an issue for you
then our speakers will be here

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:31.090
after the program for you to
ask them a question privately.

01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:38.170
So if Professors Ravid and
Schneider will rejoin us here,

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:41.440
we'll take questions from the
audience and then I know many

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.670
of you have to leave,
so I remind you

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:49.080
that at 2 o'clock we'll be
showing the movie, the documentary

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.390
about the Venetian Ghetto
right here in this room.

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:57.020
And there's a wonderful cafeteria
just behind us if you need

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.660
to refresh yourself in-between.

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.960
So please join me.

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:19.630
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: I
am good, good, good.

01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:20.930
Thank you.

01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:24.160
&gt;&gt; I'd like to know whether
ghettos were prone --

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.810
since they were solidified
Jews, whether they were prone

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:33.040
to attack rather than protected.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:42.910
Were they closed off at night in
order to avoid carnal relations?

01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:47.540
I believe the Pope
specifically objected

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:54.350
to carnal relations [laughter]
between Jews and non-Jews.

01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:59.490
The very fact that <i>The Merchant
of Venice </i>has that title is

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:04.630
because Jews -- wasn't it because
Jews were forbidden to participate

01:33:04.630 --> 01:33:10.730
in any guilds or to own land
in most of that time period?

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:15.050
And, finally, weren't
ghettos such as the one I saw

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:21.240
in Paris not allowed to expand
outward, but only upward

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:28.900
so that there was very closed
and crowded conditions?

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.200
Thank you.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.500
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Thank you.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:34.770
I think, Professor Ravid,
that is more your question.

01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:37.900
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid:
Well, well, I'm sorry.

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:41.280
My short-term memory is going,
but let me try to remember some

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.620
of the points that you asked.

01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.340
Number one, there are
many kinds of merchants.

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:50.750
You have merchants who are
engaged in local trade.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.540
You have merchants who own stores.

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:55.690
You have merchants who engage
in long-distance trade.

01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:59.110
You have merchants who
engage in maritime trade.

01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:05.030 position:56%
And I very -- in one lecture, indeed
I speak about the Jewish merchants

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:09.760
of Venice because Venice
specifically welcomed Jews

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.790
who can gauge in long-distance
maritime trade.

01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:17.530
And as I've shown, one of
the greatest department --

01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:24.050
the departures in Venetian law
was allowing former marranos

01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:26.640
who had been -- that is
Jews who in -- Christians --

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.500
Jews who had been baptized as
Christians to revert to Judaism

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.680
in violation of canon law and to
instantly be allowed to engage

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.720
in the [inaudible] trade
which Christians --

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.350
for which Christians normally had

01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:42.130
to wait 25 years before
they could do it --

01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:46.720
because of the economic
necessity for Jews to help

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.690
out international Jewish
merchants, [inaudible],

01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:53.380
many of them to help Venice
with its declining commerce

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.680
for various reasons.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.980
So I think we have to differentiate

01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:00.070
between various kinds
of -- of merchants.

01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:04.100
And I would say that at the
time Shakespeare wrote his book,

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.330
the Jewish merchants in
Venice had just been given

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:12.220
that unique charter allowing them
to convert, allowing converted Jews

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:16.310
to revert to Judaism openly in
the ghetto which, fortunately,

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:20.820
had been burnt in Rome, and
they would have been allowed

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:24.370
to immediately engage in
trade with the Levant rather

01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:26.190
than waiting for 25 years.

01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:28.260
So when we talk about
Jewish merchants we have

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:30.350
to ask what kind of
Jewish merchants.

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:34.610 position:56%
And, ironically, moneylending at the
time Shakespeare wrote his <i>Merchant</i>

01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:39.510
<i>of Venice </i>was no
longer entirely --

01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:43.500
there was no longer at all the
provenance of individual Jews

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:46.640
but rather the Jewish
community ran loan banks

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.820
that operated lending money under
government control at the low rate

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:55.370
of 5% which was economically
unviable.

01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:58.920
So if anybody was the
Jewish merchant of --

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.150
if anybody was a merchant of Venice

01:36:01.150 --> 01:36:04.150
at the time Shakespeare wrote
the play, you could make the case

01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:06.510
that it was equally the Jews.

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:08.480
Moneylending is something else.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.150
It was so stereotyped, erroneously.

01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:16.910
Italian Jewish moneylending was
really small-scale pawn-brokering

01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:18.210
for the sake of the urban poor.

01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:21.220 position:56%
I'm sorry, could you give me a
couple of the other questions again?

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.690
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: She
asked about the violence.

01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:24.250
Was there violence?

01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:25.700
&gt;&gt; Punished for leaving --

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.000
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Sure.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.300
&gt;&gt; Were they punished for leaving?

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.430
Were they punished
for leaving at night?

01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:31.730
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Oh
yes, absolutely, yes.

01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:35.490
&gt;&gt; Would you address the
Pope's refusal [inaudible] --

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:37.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Well, I'll tell
you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you --

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.820
&gt;&gt; -- between Jews and non-Jews?

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.120
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid:
Well, I'll tell you.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:43.340
I'd rather stay out of the Popes
today, but I'll be happy to talk

01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:46.360
with you about that later
since we're sticking to Venice.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.660
&gt;&gt; Excuse me.

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.100
Are you still talking about
different kinds of trades

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:55.890
and not the fact that Jews
were not allowed to participate

01:36:55.890 --> 01:37:00.150
in owning land or joining guilds?

01:37:00.150 --> 01:37:02.120
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Jews
were forbidden by law

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.970
to own any land anywhere in
the Venetian state as of 1443.

01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:11.410
Jews -- it was not necessary
to have a law forbidding Jews

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:15.600
from joining guilds because the
guilds were so Christian in nature

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.650
with Christian services,
Christian initiations in chapels

01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:22.340
and what have you, that you did
not need a law that no Jews may --

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:27.130
de factor -- the Jews
did not join the guilds

01:37:27.130 --> 01:37:30.880
and Jews had their own
separate but -- separate guilds.

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.540
There was one thing that
the Jews were allowed to do

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:36.990
and that was the sale
of second-hand goods

01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:40.360
which were very important back
then in the pre-industrial age

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.650
because everything had
to be made by hand.

01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:46.870
So furnishing them rugs and
clothing et cetera was custom-made

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:48.870
for the individual who ordered it.

01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:51.540 position:56%
Jews had a major role in that trade.

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:55.520
Jews had their own guild
of second-hand dealers.

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.890
Now the Pope set the
rules supposed --

01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:03.390
the Pope did not legislate
for anywhere outside of Rome.

01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:09.570
Each country, each country
-- and we call Venice,

01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:11.370
Florence, Milan countries.

01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.470
Each one of them had
their own government.

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:16.160
And in Venice the church
did not legislate.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.220
The government legislated.

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.650
But the government happened
to be a Catholic government

01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:24.560
so the government did accept much

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.320
of the general Christian
legislation on the Jews.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.950
Technically speaking, the
Jews in Venice came eventually

01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:36.300
to wear red hats and the Levantine
Jews only apparently were --

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.600
no, I'm sorry.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.970
The native Jews of Venice
were wearing red hats, yes.

01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:43.120
And the Levantine Jews
were wearing yellow.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.950
So we have two colors
going systematically.

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:48.690
So if we're talking about Venice
and the government of Venice,

01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:53.130
let's forget about the Pope unless
we're talking about a comparison

01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:55.750
between the traditional
demands of Christianity

01:38:55.750 --> 01:39:00.140
and their implementation by the
secular rulers in every country,

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.170
because they enacted the laws.

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:03.470
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.770
The, the --

01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:06.070
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Let's let see
if Professor Schneider has anything

01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:10.680
to say and maybe move on because
we're a little constrained by time.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.980
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider: Yeah.

01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.550
I was just saying that at
the heart of <i>The Merchant</i>

01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.590
<i>of Venice </i>is the romance
between Jessica and Lorenzo.

01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:20.680
So, you know, there's
the Christian and the --

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.860
and Shylock's daughter, Jessica.

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:27.650
And so, you know, Shakespeare
certainly gets us into that issue

01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:31.680
of carnal relations
between Christians and Jews.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.980
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Sure.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.280
&gt;&gt; One may --

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.580
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Do we
have some other -- I'm sorry.

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.880
We have some other questions.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.040
We'll take these two.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.340
&gt;&gt; Hi. Yeah.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.150
I'd like to -- if you can talk a
little bit more about the context

01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:45.200
in which -- at the time
the ghetto was established.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.840
Was anything going on in
particular in the early century

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.970
that would cause the city of
Venice to establish the ghetto?

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.340
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Basically,

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.210
basically Jewish moneylenders had
been expelled from Venice in 1397.

01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:04.820
They could only return
for 15 days at a time.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:07.940
But there was a war on the
Venetian mainland known as the War

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.510
of the League of Cambrai
in which much

01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:13.770
of Europe was organized
against Venice.

01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:15.590
There were Jews on
the Venetian mainland,

01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:18.150
Padua [inaudible] et cetera,
who were moneylenders.

01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:23.260 position:56%
They fled into the city of Venice
across a lagoon, into Venice itself.

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:24.690
They were supposed to go back home.

01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:25.990
They argued, "We can't.

01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:27.470
Our houses are destroyed."

01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:28.770
They were in Venice.

01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:30.980
They suggested that the
Venetian government let us stay

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.940
because we can lend money
and we can give you loans.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.240
And the government said okay.

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.340 position:56%
And that's what led the Jews in
1513 to be allowed to stay in Venice

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.640
on the basis of a charter.

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.500
However, the government tried.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:47.680 position:56%
Realized it was not appropriate for
Jews to be living all over the city.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.000
Fifteen-fifteen, an
attempt to confine them

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.050
to a segregated area did not pass.

01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:53.890
Fifteen-sixteen, it did.

01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:56.760
So I would say that the
ghetto in one sentence

01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.740
that the ghetto was a compromise

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:02.680
between having the Jews living
freely all over the city

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.680
or expelling them once
more as they had in 1397.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.190
And it decided because of the
economic utility of the Jews,

01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:11.930
it would allow them to stay.

01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:15.030
But they had to be segregated.

01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:17.690
That was the deal until
the end of the republic.

01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:18.990
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Professor Schneider,

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:20.350
do you want to [inaudible]?

01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:23.250
I think we have one more --
oh, okay, two more questions.

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:24.990
One right here and
then one in the back.

01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:28.440
And then we'll invite you
to return at 2 o'clock.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.870
&gt;&gt; Hello. Professor
Schneider, you were --

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:34.620
I sense you're avoiding this, but
I'm going to ask it to you anyway.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.190
In the '30s a famous Jewish
scientist named Sigmund Freud wrote

01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:44.630
a paper, a classic paper,
that there was no Shakespeare.

01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:46.620
It was the Earl of Oxford.

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:51.500
Because Shakespeare never
left England and so a lot

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.460
of people wrote papers on this.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.630 position:56%
And I see you were sort of talking
about that as a controversial issue.

01:41:57.630 --> 01:42:03.280
Do you know anything about
the antisemitism of people

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.830
in that period, the Earl
of Oxford and others?

01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:14.530
That caused the creation of
that play and the point also

01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:19.090
that if you're a playwright you can
see things and get away with it.

01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:23.790
And so he didn't probably want
his name up there so he made

01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:26.200
up the name Shakespeare [laughter].

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.390
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider:
Well, I mean I'm not --

01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:31.940
I would say if there's
a Q&amp;A in June,

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.080
you should ask Jim
Shapiro that question.

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.810
He will, first of all be angry

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:39.270
but then he'll answer
the question [laughter].

01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:44.170
No, I don't really -- I don't want
to get into the authorship issue

01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:45.470
because that's just
such a huge issue.

01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:48.060
But I would say that, you
know, apart from the <i>Jew</i>

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:52.010
<i>of Malta </i>being very
popular and it is --

01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:54.260
people do question whether
Shakespeare could have written the

01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:56.410
plays because of -- he
didn't go to this place,

01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:58.880
he didn't go to that place,
he didn't read this language,

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.450
he didn't read that language.

01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:04.580
But I'm personally convinced that
Shakespeare was one of those kinds

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:09.000
of absorptive geniuses who
didn't have to do a lot of things

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.990
that other people have to do
in order to capture a place

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:15.480
or a people or something like that.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.380
That he was just -- that was the
part of the nature of his genius.

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:21.410
The other thing that was
going on with respect

01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:23.380
to the Jewish relationships

01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:29.820
at the time was there was a very
famous trial involving the personal

01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:33.400
physician of Queen
Elizabeth who was Jewish.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.790
And there was an allegation
that he was involved

01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:40.980
in a spy plot against the crown.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:46.930
And so -- and basically it became
a show trial and he was beheaded.

01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:49.490
And so this was --
this brought attention

01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.950
to the Jewish plight because,
you know, the Jews were kicked

01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:55.490
out of England in the 13th century.

01:43:55.490 --> 01:44:00.800 position:56%
And so they were not allowed, you
know, there were very few, you know,

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.490 position:56%
Jews that Shakespeare would have
really come in contact with, if any.

01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:12.450 position:56%
So there were things going on at
the time that maybe brought this up.

01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:15.820
But the subject allowed him --
you know, the thing that's --

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:19.010
that obviously is ironic and
very -- well, ironic for us,

01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:21.280
but not for them at the
time, is that, you know,

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.170
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>
is a comedy.

01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:24.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:25.770
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider:
It's not a tragedy.

01:44:25.770 --> 01:44:28.080
You know, we tend to think of
it as a tragedy because of the,

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.070
the way Shylock is treated.

01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:35.220
But it was a comedy
because it ended happily.

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:37.370
He converted to Christianity.

01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:39.610
What better result could there be?

01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:44.870
And so, you know, it's a very --

01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:47.170
it's a difficult thing for
us to put ourselves back

01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:51.580
into that time, but I was just --

01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:53.740
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: We'll take
our final question in the back.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:56.450
Please wait for the microphone.

01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:57.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:44:57.750 --> 01:45:01.620
I have a question for
both of you [inaudible].

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:07.900
Prior to 15th century you mentioned
that the [inaudible] Vecchio,

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:12.100
which was producing
bronze and other things

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:16.020
for armories was moving
to the mainland.

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:20.500
At that time where the Jews
involved in the production

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.790
of [inaudible] armories and bronze.

01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:28.890
And if that is the case, did
they move also to [inaudible]

01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:31.970
to other places along with this?

01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:38.730
And if that is the case, was
the law, the Venetian law

01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:46.740 position:56%
of excluding the Jews into the camp,
came after that, after that period.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:50.980
That is something which
you may reflect on or --

01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:53.400
my understanding may be wrong.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:02.240
Professor Schneider, I have -- when
I started Shakespeare [inaudible],

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:07.040
the idea was from the
social point of view --

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.950
how much greed was there
with the moneylenders?

01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:21.230
The way we understood that play was
-- there was a very big [inaudible]

01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:25.010
and that was how it was
being portrayed and even

01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:28.310
at a later stage antisemitism
was building

01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:34.580 position:56%
on such anti-Jewish greed that came.

01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.560
Now your excellent presentation --

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:41.990 position:56%
in fact, I am looking from the other
point of view, the revenge point

01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:45.120
of view, within the
context of the Venetian law.

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:50.670
And then now that I -- there is
a revised play, is this revising

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:55.240
or giving us different
perspective of revenge in the plays

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.490
that you mention in June.

01:46:57.490 --> 01:47:03.790
Would that make us understand
the other side of the story?

01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:05.940
Thank you.

01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:08.680
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider:
Do you want me to --

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:09.980
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Why don't you go.

01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:11.280
&gt;&gt; Dick Schneider: Yeah.

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:16.270
I didn't go into the question or
the controversy or the discussion

01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:18.750
of whether <i>The Merchant of
Venice </i>is a specifically

01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:20.650
anti-Semitic play.

01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:23.750
I mean, that's something
that a lot of people --

01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:25.720
you know, using the
speech that I read,

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.800
people point to that
and say, well, no.

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.820
Shakespeare's writing a play
that in a sense ennobled the Jew

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:35.680
and ennobled Shylock so
that we can see, you know,

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.050
and feel more sympathy when he's
convicted and forced to convert.

01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:43.920
Other people argue no, that
he is adopting stereotypes

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.290
and using the Jew just for dramatic
effect and that it's, in fact,

01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:52.600 position:56%
you know, an entirely anti-Semitic
play because of the fact that it is,

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.170
you know, it ends happily from
the standpoint of the Christians,

01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:59.650
that he successfully
silenced Shylock.

01:47:59.650 --> 01:48:05.610
They managed to clear the decks of
his legal claim and save Antonio

01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:12.650
in a way that doesn't seem to
shed any real negative consequence

01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:16.850
on the Christian community.

01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:19.190
So there's a real debate
about, you know,

01:48:19.190 --> 01:48:21.970
whether the plan is
anti-Semitic or not.

01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:25.850 position:56%
I think that, from the standpoint --
you know, another part of the answer

01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:29.660
to the question is that
this play has really been --

01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:32.370
the production history of
this play is fascinating.

01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:34.660
And after World War II, you know,

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:40.530 position:56%
many places will not produce the
play because of the fact that it has

01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:44.990
such resonance now, given
what happened under --

01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:48.020
with the Holocaust and
the fate of Jews in Europe

01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.150
and in other parts of the world.

01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:56.480 position:56%
So, it's something that has actually
made the play more sensitive

01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.490
to people, which is part of the
reason that I think, you know,

01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:02.430
that the trial, the
appeal that we have

01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:04.180
in June will be very interesting,

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:06.650
whether we'll answer
these questions.

01:49:06.650 --> 01:49:08.810
I mean, that partly -
I mean, one of the ways

01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:12.850
that you can answer the legal
side of it is to look back

01:49:12.850 --> 01:49:18.080
at the Venetian laws and say, would
it have been acceptable or legal

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.150
for somebody to demand a pound of
flesh instead of an interest rate?

01:49:22.150 --> 01:49:26.890
And for that you really
need a lot of expertise

01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:32.280
in contemporary Venetian and
civil, you know, Roman civil law.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:36.720
But so I don't think we're
going to go down that route,

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.740 position:56%
particularly on the actual interests

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.270
and the usury and that
kind of thing.

01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:45.520
But I do believe that the
appeal will shed a lot of light.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.580
And I think Jim Shapiro's talk will
also address some of these issues.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.190
So I don't know if that's
an answer, but okay.

01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:55.490
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
[Inaudible] quickly.

01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:56.790
&gt;&gt; Benjamin Ravid: Yeah, yeah.

01:49:56.790 --> 01:50:00.960 position:56%
I would give a very, very resounding
yes echo to what you said,

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.900
that the issue is not
so much Shakespeare

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.400
but rather what later
generations saw in it.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.290
Very, very briefly, it's been
argued that an anti-Semite,

01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:16.280
a real anti-Semite -- or we should
use the word anti-Jew, anti,

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.530 position:56%
anti-Judaism because -- and the
word anti-Semitism shouldn't be used

01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:23.260
before the concept of Semitism
came up and all that and so on.

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:27.460 position:56%
And the problem in Shakespeare's day
was the problem of the Jew religion

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:31.110
and the religion you could
say to yourself by conversion

01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:36.300 position:56%
and Shylock's conversion was seen
as said as a victory for Catholicism

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.640
and also was seen as
being good for Shylock

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:43.880
because by converting he would
be saved on the Day of Judgment.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:47.570
So converting to Christianity was
something that Christians also saw

01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:50.890
as benefitting the immortal
soul of the Jew who had not gone

01:50:50.890 --> 01:50:52.640
to Purgatory as a result.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.800
The reaction of the Jew is
another thing [laughter].

01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.740
Now I think it's -- I think
the problem is that the image

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:04.590
of Shylock became the
image of the Jewish usurer.

01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:08.820
And the key thing is the portrayal
of Shylock on the stage, you know,

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:12.010
does he have a big hooked
nose and hunched over

01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:13.910
and the way he pronounces things

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:17.940 position:56%
in the Eastern European Yiddish type
accent which was un -- relative --

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.570
almost unknown in Venice.

01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:24.170 position:56%
How you portray him, how is it the
play directed indicates whether it's

01:51:24.170 --> 01:51:26.340
anti-Jewish/anti-Semitic or not.

01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:29.980
Had Shakespeare even a really
anti-Jewish we would have had more

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:35.260 position:56%
Jewish figures in his plays and they
all would have been nasty bad Jews

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:37.970
because the anti -- the
real anti-Semite usually --

01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:39.860
or anti [inaudible] will point

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.160
to negative aspects of
the Jews everywhere.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.460
So that's one.

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:46.730
Number two, regarding Jews
moneylending, et cetera --

01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:49.350
the word moneylending
-- the word bankers --

01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:51.970
forget it except for
maybe the Rothschilds.

01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:56.340 position:56%
Moneylending is not always accurate
because Jews very often were limited

01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.080
to pawnbroking and in
the case of [inaudible]

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.970
and the low rates of interest.

01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:05.210
This might cause anti-Judaism for
the very simple reason that just

01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:08.640
as we do not like our
credit cards and our banks,

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.800
when they say you missed a payment,
or you didn't pay everything,

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.820
therefore you'll pay 18%
a year, and, therefore,

01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:21.220
we say expletive deleted you,
because we do not like our bank --

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:24.940 position:56%
they charge us the penalties, they
charge us interest rates, et cetera.

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:30.310 position:56%
So you -- it is a pleasure to be
able to borrow money that helps you.

01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:32.370
Returning money does not help you.

01:52:32.370 --> 01:52:34.310
So even if the Jews
are only paying --

01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:36.620
only charging decent
rates of interest,

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.250
that leads to sentiments
against the Jews.

01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:42.010
That combines with
Christian anti-Judaism

01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:43.750
because their religion is off.

01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:48.460
Combines with the dislike
of the perceived oppressor

01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:51.990 position:56%
who is charging high interest rates,
et cetera, allegedly high rates.

01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:55.860 position:56%
But you have to return anything --
if you're borrowing, you need money.

01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.100
So returning more than
you borrow, returning --

01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.200
but borrowed is hard enough.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.870
Having to return interest
on top of it is even worse.

01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:07.990
That plus racial anti-Semitism
is another component.

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:11.530
So that strengthens the
argument that the question is,

01:53:11.530 --> 01:53:15.170
how is the play directed
and what is a view of it?

01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:18.160
So I would come down on the
side the play's not anti-Jewish.

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.080
Is that wonderful quote that you
gave, the context of the times --

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.230
anyways, okay, thank you
very much [laughter].

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:28.860
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So rather
than ending on expletives,

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:33.000
let's end extraordinarily and
give a very, very large round

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.460
of applause [applause] to Dick
Schneider, Benjamin Ravid,

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:42.920
and Nathan Dorn and the
Library's, small library staff.

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:46.580
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
