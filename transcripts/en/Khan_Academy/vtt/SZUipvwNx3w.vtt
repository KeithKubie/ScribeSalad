00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:02.997
- [Instructor] In other
videos we have talked about

00:00:02.997 --> 00:00:05.299
the various empires of India

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.446
as we exit the Vedic period.

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:09.767
We talk about the Maurya Empire

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.319
famous for the ruler Ashoka who converts

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.246
and then spreads Buddhism.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.771
As we get into the Common Era

00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.447
we've talked about the Gupta Empire

00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:21.614
that once again unifies much of India,

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:26.916
and is considered a golden
age in India's history.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:31.083
But after the fall of the
Gupta Empire India fragments

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:34.140
and you could roughly consider this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.354
to be the Indian medieval period.

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.776
This is what India looks
like in the year 1000

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:44.007
where you have multiple Hindu kingdoms.

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.716
Now as we get into the second
millennium of the Common Era,

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:51.639
you start to have
significant Muslim influence.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.617
At first in the northwest

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:58.545
but as we get into the late
12th and early 13th century

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:01.774
you have the establishment
of the Delhi Sultanate

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:04.926
and once again North India is now unified

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:08.084
under Muslim rule which
will continue for some time

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:10.972
under both the Delhi Sultanate
and the Mughal Empire

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:12.313
until the British show up.

00:01:12.313 --> 00:01:14.419
And then eventually in 1947,

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:17.564
India becomes an independent country.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:20.224
But as much transformation as there is

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:24.626
depicted in this map in terms
of various empires and rulers,

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.143
you also see a transformation

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.310
in the nature of Hinduism.

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.858
In other videos we have
talked about the Vedas

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:38.520
composed over 3,000 years ago

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.877
in the subset that is
focused on the metaphysical,

00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:44.840
on the spiritual known as the Upanishads.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.204
And this is an excerpt
from the Isha Upanishad

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:49.191
which is considered one
of the most important

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.906
that emphasizes this
notion of our inner Self,

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:55.482
capitalized with an S, atma or atman

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.222
and how it is of the
same substance as this

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:00.590
formless, nameless ultimate reality

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.164
sometimes referred to as Brahman.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.722
The Wise man, who realizes all beings

00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:09.292
as not distinct from his own Self, atman,

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:12.238
and his own Self as
the Self of all beings,

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.946
does not, by virtue of that
perception, hate anyone.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:19.728
What delusion, what sorrow
can there be for that wise man

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:22.457
who realizes the unity of all existence

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:25.874
by perceiving all beings as his own Self?

00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:29.310
And so you have this very abstract idea,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.684
some folks would call it monistic.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.601
All is one.

00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:37.993
Your true self is of the same
substance as my true self

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:41.411
which is of the same substance
and is the same thing

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.063
as the ultimate reality.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.601
But the Vedas also focus on rituals

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:49.680
and there are also gods in the Vedas.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.264
In particular some of the gods

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.221
that are mentioned most frequently.

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:56.201
You have Indra who is the god of lightning

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:58.339
and the god of storms

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.779
also referred to in the
Vedas as the king of gods.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.148
You have Agni, the god of fire.

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:06.498
It come from the same root word as ignite.

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:09.435
You have Varuna, the god of water.

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:12.604
But a question, how do we
bridge that to the gods

00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:16.437
and the practices of modern Hinduism?

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:20.289
As we've talked about in
other videos on Hindu deities,

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.456
most Hindus today view
themselves as devotees of Shiva

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.403
or devotees of Vishnu.

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:32.777
And even though Vishnu is
mentioned in the Vedas,

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:35.253
he is by no means the focus.

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:39.767
Modern Hindu practice is
really focused on devotion

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:43.934
to Shiva and/or Vishnu or aspects of them

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.832
or incarnations of them.

00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:49.249
For example, Rama or Krishna.

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.704
How did Hinduism evolve in this way?

00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:56.824
And the answer is the Bhakti movement.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:00.036
And the word Bhakti can be translated as

00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:02.985
devotion or devotional love.

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.360
And it's believed to have
come out of South India

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.853
in the seventh century.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:10.164
Some people would call
it a reform of Hinduism

00:04:10.164 --> 00:04:13.047
that up until that point focused on

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:16.442
the somewhat arcane rituals of the Vedas.

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:20.225
And the Bhakti movement
provided an alternate path,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.103
a path of devotion

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:25.125
Through devotion through a deity

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.063
one can achieve that moksha.

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:30.401
Some people would consider
it a reform movement,

00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:32.930
some people would say it was always there.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.735
Some historians think that

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:37.768
it might have even been in
reaction to Muslim influence

00:04:37.768 --> 00:04:39.108
where there was this devotion

00:04:39.108 --> 00:04:41.855
or this surrender to a notion of god.

00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:44.833
Some historians think that it co-developed

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.815
with Sufi Islam which is all about

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:49.489
devotional love for God.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.174
But needless to say,

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.417
as we go through the Indian middle ages,

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:58.112
the Bhakti movement gains
more and more momentum

00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:02.279
and it's really the defining
movement for Hinduism today.

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:07.285
And just to get an appreciation
for some Bhakti text

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:11.487
here is an excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita

00:05:11.487 --> 00:05:13.801
which is considered by many modern Hindus

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:17.083
to be one of their most
central scriptures.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.925
It was likely written over 2,000 years ago

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.889
and really came into its final form

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.589
during the Gupta Empire.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.186
But the Gita is considered one
of the central Bhakti text.

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:30.803
And even though the Gita does focus a lot

00:05:30.803 --> 00:05:33.598
on notions of realizing the self

00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:37.036
and the ultimate reality and
the importance of meditation,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.557
it also makes clear that there's a path

00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:44.300
to self-realization through
love, through devotion.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.284
This is Krishna, the eighth
incarnation of Vishnu

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:52.271
talking to the archer Arjun
as he goes into battle.

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.013
It's a bit of a repudiation

00:05:54.013 --> 00:05:56.443
of what at the time in medieval India

00:05:56.443 --> 00:06:00.169
was becoming a more and
more rigid caste structure.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.288
I look upon all creatures equally

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:05.408
none are less dear to
me and none more dear.

00:06:05.408 --> 00:06:07.449
And it is also very inclusive.

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.052
It is not saying that one
needs to only worship Vishnu

00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:12.721
or only worship Shiva.

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:16.190
Those who worship other
gods with faith and devotion

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.523
also worship me.

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:21.621
Not a fixation on being absolutely true

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.548
to all of the rituals in the Vedas.

00:06:24.548 --> 00:06:27.531
Whatever I am offered in
devotion with a pure heart,

00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.089
even if it's a leaf, a
flower, a fruit or water,

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.247
I accept with joy.

00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:35.233
With that, I'll leave you with a bhajan,

00:06:35.233 --> 00:06:37.046
a big part of the Bhakti movement

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:41.058
of this notion of devotional
love to God is singing.

00:06:41.058 --> 00:06:44.891
(singing in foreign language)
