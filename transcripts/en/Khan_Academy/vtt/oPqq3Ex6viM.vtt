00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
We've already spent a lot of time

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.440
talking about how neat carbon is for

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.259
life and for biology and for chemical

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.610
reactions so much so that there's a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.730
whole field of organic chemistry devoted

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.830
to studying the chemistry of molecules

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.320
that involve carbon and one of the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.970
things that carbon - or two of the things

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.619
that carbon will often bond with are

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.070
itself and with hydrogens so much so

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.390
that there's an entire class of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.910
molecules that are only made up of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.039
carbons and hydrogens and we call these

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.289
it's a very creative name we call them

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.920
hydrocarbons - hydrocarbons and you will

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.230
see many many types of pure hydrocarbons

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.850
and you'll see many other types of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.739
molecules that at least are partially

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.899
hydrocarbons or are based on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.219
hydrocarbons so it's a really

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.280
interesting thing to study here's three

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.530
examples of hydrocarbons these all have

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.079
the prefix eth- in the beginning of them

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.539
because they have a chain their longest

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.940
chain has two carbons and if you want to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.059
study how to name hydrocarbons or

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.980
actually organic compounds in general I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.809
encourage you to look at the organic

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.270
chemistry section of Khan Academy where

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.770
we go into depth on it but this is just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.630
going to get you just kind of dip our

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.070
toe in the water just so we get a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.720
bit familiar so these all have the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.549
prefix eth- which says our longest

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.689
chain of carbon we're gonna have two

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.939
carbons over here but then we see that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.759
the ending is different over here we

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.150
have ethane and it's it's an ane because

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.330
we have a single bond over here this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.150
over here we have an ene and that's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.220
because we have a double bond we have at

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.170
least one double bond in that chain that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.150
and the carbon chain is only two carbons

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.229
over here and it's ethyne here because we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.020
have a triple bond the general term for

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.750
a carbon chain that has no double or

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.060
triple bonds is an alkane this is a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.460
specific form of an alkane ethane that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.700
has two carbons if the general form for

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.619
carbons that have a double bond that's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.810
an alkene actually let me write these

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.219
general terms down so I could write al

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.920
alkane alkane is the general term for a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
chain of carbons that has no double or

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.289
triple bonds and specifically this is

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.750
ethane if I were generally here and say

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.890
alkene now it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.010
alkine right over here let's think a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.870
little bit about how this bond effects

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.870
effects its shape well here I have a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.060
single bond so it essentially forms two

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.430
tetrahedrons with one of the carbons at

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.569
each of the centers of those

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.910
tetrahedrons for example on the left

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.250
hand side here when I when I draw this

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.320
bond popping when I draw it like this it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.880
means that it's popping out and when I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.290
draw it like this with these lies that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.410
means it's going into into the screen so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.910
I could draw a tetrahedron that looks

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.580
that looks like this that's the base of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.620
it and then the top of it is that this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.530
other carbon and it has it has this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.690
carbon at the center and I could also

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.730
draw another tetrahedron that has this

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.130
carbon at the center this carbon at its top

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.500
and it would look it would look

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.310
something it would look something like

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.440
it would look something like this so for

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.880
at least for this molecule you have the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.120
shape is kind of it looks like these two

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.660
tetrahedrons that are kind of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.730
overlapping with each other and because

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.980
these carbons are they have a single

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.140
bond in between them they these two

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.079
tetrahedrons can rotate so they could

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.620
rotate they could rotate around they

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.310
could rotate around that single bond now

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.450
things are a little bit different when

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.130
you have a double bond when you have a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.900
double bond like this it actually forces

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.209
all of these all of these atoms in this

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.329
molecule to be in the same plane so this

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.400
right over here this ethane this is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.860
planar this is planar right over here

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.620
and these this double bond locks it into

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.329
place there's not going to be any

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.329
rotation when you have a triple bond not

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.350
only are you not going to have any

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.880
rotation but it's gonna make the whole

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.530
thing it's going to make the whole thing

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.750
a linear molecule so when we're talking

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.860
about its shape we're talking about

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.200
these molecules their conformation how

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.900
do they arrange themselves in three

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.250
dimensions and if you're curious what

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.650
these are ethane is a component of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.570
natural gas most of natural gas is

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.530
methane methane is just so if I were to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.769
write methane most of natural gas is

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.829
methane which is just one which is just

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.190
one carbon bonded to four hydrogens

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.229
that's methane right over here this is

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.979
most of this is the biggest constituent

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.650
of natural

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.000
gas but you're going to find a little

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.820
bit of ethane in there ethene which is

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.040
often known as ethylene this has many

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.169
industrial uses but maybe most

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.449
interestingly it can be used as a plant

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.380
hormone that can be used to ripen fruit

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.740
ethyne a lot most commonly known as

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.449
acetylene this can be used because it

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.789
burns very very hot it can be used to

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.860
fuel blowtorches so once again you know

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.750
these are they seem similar but there

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.400
can be used for very very different

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.740
things and I could go all day showing

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.600
more and more different types of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.160
hydrocarbons but here's just a little

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.870
bit more variety just so we can think

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.100
about how they're named and the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.139
different forms they take and these are

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.880
just three of the different types of

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.620
molecules you might find in the gasoline

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.669
that you have in your car and there's

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.070
many many more than just these and

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.870
that's because you mix them with oxygen

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.940
put them in an engine and and and spite

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.979
and spark them right that they burn well

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.139
there they're good fuels to to power

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.180
cars but just so get familiar with the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.070
naming mechanism a little bit more this

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.410
is pentane it's an alkane with five

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.300
carbons one two three four five carbons

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.190
in its longer longest chain that's why

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.010
it's called pentane because hydrogens

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.150
are all of the other bonds that a

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.070
carbons are forming sometimes you'll see

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.510
a shorthand where something like a

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.949
pentane instead of drawing all the Cs

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.530
and Hs it would be drawn like this it

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.449
could be drawn like this where you

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.919
assume that there's just a carbon at

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.199
each of these points over there so you

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.610
actually don't have to draw the carbon

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.590
and then if you don't see if you don't

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.180
if something's not bonded to a carbon it

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.580
there's no other atom that is drawn in

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.620
that the carbon is bonded to you assume

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.720
it's just a bunch of hydrogen so this is

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.030
a shorthand for pentane which is exactly

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.650
this molecule here and you see it has

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.599
this kind of it has this bend shape

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.729
because carbon is each of the carbons

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.560
are trying to get to that tetrahedral

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.940
type of shape now this this is

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.370
cyclohexane once again it's an alkane we

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.159
have no double bonds here hex- is the

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.620
prefix because you have six carbons in

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.139
your longest chain one two three or you

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.750
could say your cycle in this case 5 6

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.210
and the cyclo is because instead of it

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.159
just being a instead of it being an open

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.779
instead of it just being an open chain

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.669
it's connected at the end it forms it

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.300
forms actual cycle this over here looks

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.540
a little

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.660
more complex you see the -ene at the end

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.970
and that's because the longest chain has

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.940
a double bond right over here and the

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.210
but- this is the prefix for four this

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.160
means that our longest chain has four

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.250
carbons and you see that one two three

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.100
four carbons but then on this number two

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.530
carbon not only did you have your double

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.410
bond there but you also have a methyl

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.170
group a methyl group 1 carbon meth- is

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.020
the meth is the prefix meth- is the

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.540
prefix for one so anyway the goal of

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.680
this video is really just to give you a

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.020
little bit familiar with with

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.120
hydrocarbons and and to think about how

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.940
they'll be useful in chemistry and parts

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.950
of and and and you'll see many molecules

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.260
in biology that have hydrocarbon parts

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.790
that have chains of hydrocarbons

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.320
attached to them so we can think about

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.940
the properties associated with them.
