00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.083
(birds chirping)

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.872
- Valor is fifth through seventh grade

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:19.531
at two different middle
schools on the same campus.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.753
Our kids are at the
highest academic scores

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:26.007
in the state, top 1% for
growth and achievement.

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.002
We think really strong SEL
work is very advantageous

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.319
to kids also doing well
academically in school.

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:34.015
- [Teacher] Everyone figure this out.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:35.183
- Scholars, in order to really

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:36.762
learn, they have to be vulnerable.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.813
By developing really strong SEL practices

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:42.158
with our scholars we build a lot of trust

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:44.837
and so they're much more
likely and get their hand up

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:47.172
or they go to their peers and ask for help

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.527
because they feel comfortable being okay

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:51.357
that they don't know everything.

00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:52.958
So that's been one of the most

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.625
tangible things that we've seen.

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:01.105
- Some of the core elements
that we have here at Valor

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:04.548
came directly out of my work at Seneca.

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:06.276
- Daren was working at Seneca Center,

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:07.786
which is a non-profit that works

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:10.185
with some of the most disadvantaged youth

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:12.094
in the Bay area and he developed

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:15.279
a process called circle
with them over many years.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:16.949
I went to visit once and saw the

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:18.717
social emotional learning development

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:19.813
that he's doing with these kids

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.063
and it really blew my mind.

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:26.435
- And that's what sparked
the ah ha of starting Valor.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.324
Thinking about could we
take some of those practices

00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:30.899
that push and develop all of us to grow

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.649
and make it a centerpiece
of a public school.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:51.639
- So we are the first school
in the state of Tennessee

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.488
to open an intentionally diverse school.

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:57.071
- [Todd] We target about
50% free and reduced lunch.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:59.232
We also don't have any majority

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:01.143
race or ethnicity in this school.

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:04.023
- We believe that for
our kids to be successful

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:08.343
we need to learn with and from
people that are different.

00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:10.651
- I've been incredibly
inspired about the importance

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.055
of helping people reach
across the lines of

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:16.250
difference and adapt
diversity of perspective.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.654
We wanna hear people
have different opinions

00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:19.976
'cause that's actually
what makes us stronger.

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:22.179
So I think an intentionally
diverse community

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:26.512
creates a really powerful
opportunity for that year.

00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:30.756
- Pride groups are single gender

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:33.452
groups of about 20 or so students.

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:37.184
Led by their pride leader
and their mentor teacher.

00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:39.240
- It's comparable to, I
guess, an advisory group

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.610
in some schools, they
meet in the mornings.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.377
We're kind of the closest
family unit in the school

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:47.633
and we do a lot of our
character work with them.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.182
My expectations for you are that you are

00:02:50.182 --> 00:02:52.592
working on your Phase packet.

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.509
(students talking)

00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:00.154
- Through our pride
groups we do Phase work

00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:03.683
that develops sharp mind, big hearts,

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:07.137
noble purpose, and aligned actions.

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:09.839
Each phase has activities that

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.334
align to those character strengths.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:13.667
And so in the packets there's

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:16.397
reflections, and guided questions.

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:18.956
They're working on things like challenges,

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:20.736
they work on community service,

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.554
they do interviews with each other.

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.507
So, it's really an opportunity for them

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:29.022
to connect in multiple
ways with multiple people.

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:31.023
- It's just asking me my stories.

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:33.841
I had to do a 60 day challenge and we did

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:37.396
10 anonymous acts of
kindness toward someone.

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:39.701
- Think about who you
want to do that with.

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.393
- Without Phase work I probably wouldn't

00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:44.017
be thinking about those things very much.

00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:45.125
- [Teacher] Has it been easy for you

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.468
to answer these questions?

00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:47.301
- No.

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:48.839
- Girls are still getting
to know themselves

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.478
and aren't really sure how to approach

00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:52.577
work that's so introspective.

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:54.706
Like, What are my personal values?

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.128
You only have to put as much on the

00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:58.295
page as you feel comfortable. Okay?

00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:00.493
And so, we need to be
making sure that they feel

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:03.392
successful and confident
in what they're working on.

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:05.395
- Do you feel like you got
better at it as you went?

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:06.891
- Yeah, I definitely got better.

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:07.724
- Okay.

00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:10.363
- Phase work helps you meet your goals

00:04:10.363 --> 00:04:12.155
and it helps you form relationship

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:16.439
with other people from
different religions, race.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.725
Helps you know them better in
ways you probably never would.

00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:22.045
Yeah, that sounds good.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.835
- [Matt] That kind of questioning,
that kind of reflection

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:25.446
is what helps us become
more well rounded and

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:28.060
realize that we have to continue to grow.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.337
(people talking)

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.584
- [Daren] It all kinda culminates in

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:33.929
the circle practice that we do.

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:36.679
(people talking)

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:40.708
Our circle model is something
that both our adults

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.728
and our scholars do
every week for an hour.

00:04:44.728 --> 00:04:46.720
Circles are a time for the community to

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.773
come together and develop themselves as

00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:50.506
individuals, develop their relationships.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:52.504
Is there more you need to talk about?

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:54.200
Circle is done in a ritualistic and

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.505
kind of structured manor.

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.870
Every circle would follow
the same basic cadence.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.377
- All right, we're going to
start by doing our true north.

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:04.776
- [Daren] It'll always start with

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:06.013
a mindfulness based practice.

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:10.135
- Start by taking one,
silent, deep breath in.

00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:12.108
And then, slowly letting it out.

00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:13.766
- It's an invitation for everybody

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.927
to let go of the busy day and really

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:18.001
focus their attention on each other.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.341
- [Matt] We are going to
do a weather check-in.

00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:21.811
- [Daren] Then it moves into a check-in.

00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:23.525
- I feel sunny because it's Friday.

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:25.811
- [Daren] It's helpful for
a community to hear where

00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:29.450
everybody is, and know the
emotional tone of the group.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.304
And then we move into what we call work.

00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:34.275
- [Matt] So, Eric, are you
ready to do your presentation?

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:37.041
- The topic I investigated was religion.

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:38.567
- [Daren] They will present their Phase

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.125
work as part of their circle work.

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:41.958
- [Eric] We're supposed to research and

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.698
write three opposing opinions on the topic

00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:47.858
and three supporting opinions.

00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.817
This experience helped me
learn that I can be kinder

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.422
to people with different perspectives.

00:05:53.422 --> 00:05:55.714
- Circle is a space
that's safe enough that

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:59.064
they get to share who they
are, what they dream about,

00:05:59.064 --> 00:06:02.180
what their cultures are like,
what they're frustrated by.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.575
It also builds relationships
that help us become

00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:08.092
better teachers, help them
become better learners.

00:06:08.092 --> 00:06:11.131
- Whether it be somebody
telling about hardships

00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:13.522
they've been through
or somebody who's going

00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:15.996
through things right
now and needs support.

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:18.025
I've seen girls grow in circle, and

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:20.602
I've seen girls help each other grow.

00:06:20.602 --> 00:06:21.481
- [Teacher and Students] Be good,

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.562
do good, stay fierce and keep roaring.

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:27.395
(student roaring)

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.485
- I think having the adults do the

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.336
practice themselves and really know the

00:06:32.336 --> 00:06:35.586
importance of it is our main strategy.

00:06:35.586 --> 00:06:39.530
Adults drive this type
of work in the community.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.414
- [Woman] Steven would
you mind kicking us off?

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:44.108
- Some work that I've done with kids in

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.646
this past week that I
need to bring to circle.

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:48.151
In circle today I did a process

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:50.045
called taking responsibility.

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.469
Which is used for repairing a relationship

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.488
with the community as a whole.

00:06:55.488 --> 00:06:58.605
Moving forward I commit
to like, using the systems

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.741
that are in place and thinking
before I act in such a way.

00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:04.423
I ask kids to do it every day.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.348
And I think that's why Valor works.

00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:08.232
It's because like everything
the kids are asked to do,

00:07:08.232 --> 00:07:11.718
the adults are expected to do as well.

00:07:11.718 --> 00:07:13.203
- It helps a lot because they also

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:14.418
know what we're going through.

00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:16.237
Other schools can say,
like, you don't understand

00:07:16.237 --> 00:07:18.219
to your teachers, but
like, we can't say that

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:20.228
because they do the same thing as us,

00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:22.933
and they know what we're going through.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:24.758
- [Daren] You guys did a really good job.

00:07:24.758 --> 00:07:26.532
Appreciate yourselves for that.

00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:28.566
Kids will succeed more
academically because

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:31.400
they feel safe and they're
in trusting relationships.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.130
And they feel inspired and have a purpose.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.086
- [Student] I appreciate you being kind

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:39.244
to me and all of our scholars.

00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:40.077
Thanks.
