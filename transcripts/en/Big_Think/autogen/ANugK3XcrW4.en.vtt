obviously of mortality but you can think
of other areas where humans have to face

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.260

that humans have and that require

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270
that humans have and that require
 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.090
that humans have and that require
something more something meaningful and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
something more something meaningful and
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700
something more something meaningful and

people's lives and I don't think we can
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.350
people's lives and I don't think we can
really reduce why people are religious

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
really reduce why people are religious
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540

kinds of religious messages that I think

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
kinds of religious messages that I think
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.440
kinds of religious messages that I think
are just as powerful for people in their

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
are just as powerful for people in their
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.559
are just as powerful for people in their
everyday lives as the usual suspects of

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569
everyday lives as the usual suspects of
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.620

that nature people are very concerned
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.280
that nature people are very concerned
and preoccupied with longevity and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
and preoccupied with longevity and
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.530
and preoccupied with longevity and
especially in the society we live in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
especially in the society we live in
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690
especially in the society we live in
today when we have certain medical

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
today when we have certain medical
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.330
today when we have certain medical
technologies that can really prolong

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
technologies that can really prolong
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.030
technologies that can really prolong
life in ways that we never imagined in

people's life spans have grown

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319
people's life spans have grown
 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.259
people's life spans have grown
dramatically you know especially in the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
dramatically you know especially in the
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.130
dramatically you know especially in the
last few decades and all of that really

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
last few decades and all of that really
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.360
last few decades and all of that really
is speaks to great advances and I think

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
is speaks to great advances and I think
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.849
is speaks to great advances and I think
it also speaks to an underlying fear of

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859
it also speaks to an underlying fear of
 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.830
it also speaks to an underlying fear of
death as well we want to live as long as

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
death as well we want to live as long as
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.509
death as well we want to live as long as
we can we certainly don't want to face

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
we can we certainly don't want to face
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.509
we can we certainly don't want to face
our end for as long as we can put it off

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
our end for as long as we can put it off
 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.370
our end for as long as we can put it off
but part of that obsession with

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
but part of that obsession with
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.309
but part of that obsession with
longevity and long life I think also has

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319
longevity and long life I think also has
 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.130
longevity and long life I think also has
to do with our obsessions with youth and

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
to do with our obsessions with youth and
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.629
to do with our obsessions with youth and
our desire not just to age well but to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639
our desire not just to age well but to
 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.420
our desire not just to age well but to
overcome age and to maintain a youthful

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
overcome age and to maintain a youthful
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.340
overcome age and to maintain a youthful
spirit I mean these are certainly

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350
spirit I mean these are certainly
 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.680
spirit I mean these are certainly
cultural messages that we receive every

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
cultural messages that we receive every
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.400
cultural messages that we receive every
day and that makes growing old in our

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
day and that makes growing old in our
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.840
day and that makes growing old in our
society actually quite difficult

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850
society actually quite difficult
 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.160
society actually quite difficult
compared with other cultures

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170
 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.449
unfortunately religion can be both a

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459
unfortunately religion can be both a
 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.849
unfortunately religion can be both a
inspiration for great works and all

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859
inspiration for great works and all
 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.960
inspiration for great works and all
kinds of altruistic activities but on

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970
kinds of altruistic activities but on
 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.270
kinds of altruistic activities but on
the other hand it can also lead to the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
the other hand it can also lead to the
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.979
the other hand it can also lead to the
most aggressive and violent and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
most aggressive and violent and
 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.820
most aggressive and violent and
destructive actions imaginable

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830
destructive actions imaginable
 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.650
destructive actions imaginable
throughout history you can find all

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660
throughout history you can find all
 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.130
throughout history you can find all
kinds of evidence of this fundamentalism

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140
kinds of evidence of this fundamentalism
 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.310
kinds of evidence of this fundamentalism
may not be the appropriate word but you

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
may not be the appropriate word but you
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.160
may not be the appropriate word but you
can certainly say most religious

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170
can certainly say most religious
 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.090
can certainly say most religious
traditions have extremists that can

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100
traditions have extremists that can
 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.240
traditions have extremists that can
really take the teachings of the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
really take the teachings of the
 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.930
really take the teachings of the
religions and transform them into

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940
religions and transform them into
 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.760
religions and transform them into
reasons to kill and reasons to harm

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770
reasons to kill and reasons to harm
 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.610
reasons to kill and reasons to harm
reasons to cause suffering and I don't

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
reasons to cause suffering and I don't
 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.380
reasons to cause suffering and I don't
think any of the religious traditions

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390
think any of the religious traditions
 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.080
think any of the religious traditions
are immune from from that side of

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090
are immune from from that side of
 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.040
are immune from from that side of
religion the Bush administration really

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
religion the Bush administration really
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.260
religion the Bush administration really
is gets failing grades in how they've

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270
is gets failing grades in how they've
 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.260
is gets failing grades in how they've
taken care of religion and the kind of
