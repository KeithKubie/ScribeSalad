there are two reasons why why they've

there are two reasons why why they've
developed such a growth one is simply

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840
developed such a growth one is simply
 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.650
developed such a growth one is simply
because they've done door-to-door

talk about what that right technology

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.380
talk about what that right technology
 

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.830

drill down the risks associated with it

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.230
drill down the risks associated with it
 

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.830

the actual requirements and the goals

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:00.840
the actual requirements and the goals
 

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.650
the actual requirements and the goals
that they have might vary so your

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660
that they have might vary so your
 

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.410
that they have might vary so your
technology and you know there's one

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420

them when you think about this and
 

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.350
them when you think about this and
that's the need for energy that is

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360
that's the need for energy that is
 

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.550
that's the need for energy that is
available to them at all times so in my

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560
available to them at all times so in my
 

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.220
available to them at all times so in my
mind when you say energy it's not just

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.230
mind when you say energy it's not just
 

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.230
mind when you say energy it's not just
electrical energy or it's not just

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240
electrical energy or it's not just
 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.600
electrical energy or it's not just
mechanical energy it's both you have to

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:23.610
mechanical energy it's both you have to
 

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.910
mechanical energy it's both you have to
consider both in tandem because when you

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920
consider both in tandem because when you
 

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.800
consider both in tandem because when you
look at your customers what you see is

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:27.810
look at your customers what you see is
 

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.840
look at your customers what you see is
these are people who are using both

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:29.850
these are people who are using both
 

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.150
these are people who are using both
electrical energy and thermal energy and

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160
electrical energy and thermal energy and
 

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.560

on yet another aspect look at the

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880
on yet another aspect look at the
 

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.450
on yet another aspect look at the
thermal

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:54.460

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.480
thermal
of these systems and layered that in now

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:57.490
of these systems and layered that in now
 

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.850
of these systems and layered that in now
your options are even larger now you can

00:10:59.850 --> 00:10:59.860
your options are even larger now you can
 

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.260
your options are even larger now you can
think of having a combined heat and

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:01.270
think of having a combined heat and
 

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.670
think of having a combined heat and
power system you can think of district

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680
power system you can think of district
 

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.920
power system you can think of district
energy systems you can then layer that

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:04.930
energy systems you can then layer that
 

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.610
energy systems you can then layer that
on with PV potentially so the technology

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:08.620
on with PV potentially so the technology
 

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.070
on with PV potentially so the technology
options start broadening as you start

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.080
options start broadening as you start
 

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.600
options start broadening as you start
thinking of energy not just as

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:12.610
thinking of energy not just as
 

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.160
thinking of energy not just as
electrical energy but it's electrical

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.170
electrical energy but it's electrical
 

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.940
electrical energy but it's electrical
energy and thermal energy and so then

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:17.950
energy and thermal energy and so then
 

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.310
energy and thermal energy and so then
what happens is you have this wide array

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320
what happens is you have this wide array
 

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.340
what happens is you have this wide array
of options now available to you you can

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:23.350
of options now available to you you can
 

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.670
of options now available to you you can
have solar you can have energy storage

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680
have solar you can have energy storage
 

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.470
have solar you can have energy storage
you can have combined hidden power you

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480
you can have combined hidden power you
 

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.840
you can have combined hidden power you
can have thermal energy and all of this

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:30.850
can have thermal energy and all of this
 

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.120
can have thermal energy and all of this
together is what and the right

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.130
together is what and the right
 

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.590

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.210
kid I think we talked about that less
and less partly because of the modes of

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220
and less partly because of the modes of
 

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.280
and less partly because of the modes of
using the battery and when it needs to

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:07.290
using the battery and when it needs to
 

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.800
using the battery and when it needs to
be available how to be managed but also

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:09.810
be available how to be managed but also
 

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.230
be available how to be managed but also
because storage is dropping and writes

and when we had you know inverter

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:16.470
and when we had you know inverter
 

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.040

able to do the same thing with batteries

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:26.550
able to do the same thing with batteries

course you can sell the batteries the

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:37.350
course you can sell the batteries the
 

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.600

question of course is how do you make

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.610
question of course is how do you make
 

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.360
question of course is how do you make

theme that emerges and that is not has

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260
theme that emerges and that is not has
 

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.600

been less of an issue in large-scale
 

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.370
been less of an issue in large-scale
projects but I think in smaller scale

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380
projects but I think in smaller scale
 

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.470

whole lot of that and so what are the

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:29.670
whole lot of that and so what are the
 

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.210

I think is also because the technology

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900
I think is also because the technology

I think is also because the technology
has been dear risk at this point and is

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240
has been dear risk at this point and is
 

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.780
has been dear risk at this point and is
also becoming cheaper more commonplace

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:20.790
also becoming cheaper more commonplace

the financing is a lot easier so we're

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700
the financing is a lot easier so we're
 

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.250
the financing is a lot easier so we're
going to see third-party ownership being

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260
going to see third-party ownership being
 

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.200
going to see third-party ownership being
being available and certainly is

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.210
being available and certainly is

management and the de-risking of the
 

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.110
management and the de-risking of the
operation of the battery then is going

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120
operation of the battery then is going
 

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.570

00:35:27.789 --> 00:35:27.799
research there they can't let the
 

00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:32.049
research there they can't let the
electricity go down they there's certain

00:35:32.049 --> 00:35:32.059
electricity go down they there's certain
 

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:33.670
electricity go down they there's certain
things that probably shouldn't get

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680
things that probably shouldn't get
 

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.430
things that probably shouldn't get
unfrozen diseases and other things so

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440
unfrozen diseases and other things so
 

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.510
unfrozen diseases and other things so
they got to make sure that they have

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520
they got to make sure that they have
 

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.700
they got to make sure that they have
absolute resilience at all times

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:39.710
absolute resilience at all times
 

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.890
absolute resilience at all times
and never go down they don't have a

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:41.900
and never go down they don't have a
 

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.720
and never go down they don't have a
battery on-site if I put a battery

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:43.730
battery on-site if I put a battery
 

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.520
battery on-site if I put a battery
on-site I'm like actually be able to

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:45.530
on-site I'm like actually be able to
 

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.410
on-site I'm like actually be able to
optimize this system so I don't have to

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:47.420
optimize this system so I don't have to
 

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.329
optimize this system so I don't have to
do spinning reserves I'm gonna save them

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:49.339

that is my capex in my op X and then I'm

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:17.540
that is my capex in my op X and then I'm
 

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.020
that is my capex in my op X and then I'm
building that into the rate that they're

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.030
building that into the rate that they're
 

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:23.140
building that into the rate that they're
paying so maybe they can save money by

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.150
paying so maybe they can save money by
 

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.359
