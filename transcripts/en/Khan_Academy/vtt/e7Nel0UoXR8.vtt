00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.352
- [Voiceover] So we've just
computed a vector-valued

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:05.564
partial derivative of a
vector-valued function,

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:06.940
but the question is What does this mean?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.211
What does this jumble
of symbols actually mean

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.422
in a more intuitive geometric setting?

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:13.755
And that has everything to do with

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.410
how you visualize the function,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.961
and with this specific function,

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.545
given that the input is two-dimensional

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.233
but the output is three-dimensional,

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.648
meaning the output has more
dimensions than the input,

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.802
it's nice to visualize it
as a parametric surface.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.097
And the way that I do that,

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.590
maybe you could call this visualizing it

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.264
as a transformation also

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:35.253
'cause what I want to do is
basically think of the TS plane,

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:37.003
think of the TS plane

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:40.226
where all these input values live

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.350
and kind of think of how that's gonna map

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.347
into three-dimensional space,

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:47.131
but when I do that, I'm actually
gonna cheat a little bit.

00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:48.949
Rather than having a
separate plane off there

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.357
as the TS plane, I'm
going to kind of overwrite

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:54.175
onto the XY plane itself

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:57.212
and plop the TS plane down like this,

00:00:57.212 --> 00:00:58.473
and this isn't the full TS plane.

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:00.976
This is actually supposed to represent

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:05.155
just values of T that range
from zero up to three,

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:08.035
so each tick mark on the graph
here corresponds with a half.

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:12.348
So this is one, that's two,
and then up here is three.

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:13.181
Same with S.

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.413
S also ranges from zero to three,

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:16.430
and the reason that I'm plopping it

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.178
inside three-dimensional
space to start with,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.436
kind of overwriting the XY
plane with the TS plane,

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:23.655
is just to make the animating
a little bit easier.

00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:25.905
You could call it laziness.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.944
But the benefit here is what we can do

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:31.888
is watch each point, and
each one of these points

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:35.808
you're thinking of is corresponding
to some kind of TS pair,

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:38.443
an input point, which is
just a pair of numbers,

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:40.296
and we're gonna watch
each one of those points

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.358
move to the corresponding output.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:44.728
The output is a three-dimensional value,

00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:45.966
a three-dimensional vector or point,

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.846
however you wanna think about it,

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:52.013
and what that looks like when
we animate this actually is

00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:56.609
each one of those points
in our square of TS plane

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.792
moves to the corresponding output,

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.484
and you end up with a certain surface.

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:02.655
And just to make it a
little more concrete,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.409
what's actually going on here,

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.812
let's focus in on just one point,

00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:07.922
and we'll focus in on this point

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:09.752
not just for the function visualization

00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:12.069
but for the partial derivative as well,

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.386
and the function, or the point rather,

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.732
that I care about is gonna be at one, one.

00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:20.360
So this point right here represents

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.527
the pair of TS

00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:26.078
where each one of them is equal to one.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:26.911
One, one.

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:30.067
And you can start by
predicting where you think

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.711
this is gonna get output,

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.260
and to do that, you just
plug it into the function.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.789
This is kind of what
the visualization means

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.358
as we're plugging this in,

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.818
and for T and S, we're gonna
plug in just one and one.

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:43.439
So that top part is gonna
look like one squared

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.457
minus one squared, which becomes zero.

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.040
That middle part is gonna be
one times one, which is one,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.113
and then over here we're gonna
have one times one squared,

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:54.186
which is one minus one
times one times one squared,

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:55.591
which is, again, one.

00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:57.530
And you can probably see,
'cause of the symmetry there,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.230
those also cancel out, you get zero,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.505
which means the output
corresponding with this input

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:05.433
should be the vector zero, one, zero,

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:08.486
a vector that's of unit length
pointing in the Y direction.

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.508
So if we look here, this is the X axis.

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:12.349
This here is the Y axis.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.352
So you would think it should be a vector

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.907
that looks kind of like this.

00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:19.392
Unit vector in the Y direction,

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:20.848
and the point of the
surface is what corresponds

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.744
to the tip of that vector.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.473
This is how we visualize
parametric things.

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.273
You just think of the tip of the vector

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:28.801
as kinda moving through space
and drawing out the thing.

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:31.143
In this case, the thing
it's drawing is a surface.

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.669
So if we watch that animation again

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.986
and we let things play forward,

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:38.251
that dot corresponding
with the input one, one

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.160
does indeed land at
the tip of that vector.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.479
So, at least for that value,

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.384
you can see that I'm not lying
to you with the animation.

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:48.780
And in principle, you could do
that for every single point.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.933
If any given input point, you
plug it through the function,

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.232
and you draw the vector in
three-dimensional space,

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:55.440
as you watch this animation,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.320
it'll land at the tip of that vector.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.153
So...

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:02.078
Now, if we want to start thinking about

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:04.366
what the partial derivative means,

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:07.212
remember this little DT, this partial T,

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.894
is telling you to nudge
it in the T direction.

00:04:09.894 --> 00:04:11.389
So what does movement,

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.525
not even nudges but just
movement in general,

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:17.892
look like in the T direction
for our little snippet

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.070
of the TS plane here?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.903
Well, the T direction,

00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:24.755
I'm saying is in this direction here

00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:29.047
where this represents one,
two, three of T values,

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:32.886
and this line here represents
the constant value for S,

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.393
so this would be S
constantly equaling one,

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:37.332
which you can know because
it's passing through

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:39.246
the point one, one.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.816
And then otherwise you're
just letting T range freely.

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:43.936
And if we watch how this gets transformed

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:45.890
under the transformation,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.601
under the mapping to
the parametric surface,

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.804
you can get a feel for
what varying the input T

00:04:51.804 --> 00:04:53.887
does in the output space.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:57.325
So this whole pink line
is basically telling you

00:04:57.325 --> 00:05:00.571
what happens if you let
S constantly equal one

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.288
but you let the variable T,
the input T, vary freely,

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:07.562
and you get a certain curve
in three-dimensional space.

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.042
And if you had a different constant for S,

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.013
it would be another curve,

00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:12.993
and maybe you can kinda
see on the grid lines

00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:14.451
what shape those other curves would have,

00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.407
and they're all, in a sense, parallelish

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:21.107
to this curve corresponding
to S equals one.

00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:24.129
So if, instead of thinking
about movement of T as whole,

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.964
you start thinking about nudges,

00:05:26.964 --> 00:05:28.631
this whole partial T

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.176
is something where we're just imagining

00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:33.849
a tiny, tiny, little
movement in the T direction.

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.602
Not really that much,
just a tiny, little move.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.451
It's like you're recording
its value as partial T,

00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:40.053
so maybe, if you're being concrete,

00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:43.548
you'd say partial T would
be something like 0.01.

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:44.890
And really it's gonna
be a limiting variable

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.069
that gets smaller and smaller,

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.131
but I find it's kind
of nice to think about

00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.376
an actual value like one one-hundredth.

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:52.217
And then if you let this whole thing

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:53.280
undergo the transformation

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.470
and we kind of watch the input point,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.124
watch the line representing T,

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.015
that little nudge, that little nudge

00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:01.953
is gonna get maybe stretched or squished,

00:06:01.953 --> 00:06:05.035
and it's gonna result
in some kind of vector

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:06.551
pointing along that curve,

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.676
and it'll be tangent to that curve.

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.471
The vector that tells you how you move

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:12.242
just a tiny, tiny little bit

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:14.022
will be tangent in some way,

00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:17.726
and that vector, that output nudge,

00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:20.479
is what you're thinking
of as your tiny change

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.173
to the output vector, that partial V.

00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:24.898
And when you divide it by the tiny value,

00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:27.685
if your tiny value was 0.01
and you divide it by that,

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:29.135
it's gonna become something bigger,

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:32.403
so the actual derivative isn't gonna be

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:33.977
just some tiny, little nudge

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.724
that's hardly, hardly visible,

00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:40.163
but it's gonna be that nudge
vector scaled appropriately.

00:06:40.163 --> 00:06:41.969
In this case, it would be
divided by one one-hundredth

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.047
and multiplied by 100,

00:06:44.047 --> 00:06:47.031
and it would be something that
remains tangent to the curve,

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.331
but maybe it's pointing big.

00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:52.314
And the larger it is, the longer it is,

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.630
that's telling you that as you let T vary

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.964
and you're kind of moving
along this pink curve,

00:06:56.964 --> 00:06:59.745
tiny nudges in T correspond
with larger movements.

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:02.030
The ratio of the nudge size is bigger.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.216
So if you were to have a very
long partial derivative vector

00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:08.069
that's still tangent but
really goes out there,

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:09.422
that would tell you that as you vary T

00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:12.368
you're zipping along super quickly.

00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:15.435
And if we just look at this particular one

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.631
that's zooming off of one,

00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:18.669
you kind of get a feel for
the curve around that point.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:19.502
You say, "Okay, okay."

00:07:19.502 --> 00:07:22.108
And that curve, you're moving
positively in the X direction.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.998
You're moving to the right.

00:07:23.998 --> 00:07:26.493
You're moving positively
in the Z direction.

00:07:26.493 --> 00:07:27.813
Not Z, sorry, the Y.

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:31.089
Positively in the Y direction up there.

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.602
And the Z direction is
actually negative, isn't it?

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.802
This curve kind of goes down
as far as Z is concerned.

00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:37.504
So before even computing it,

00:07:37.504 --> 00:07:38.915
if I were to tell you
that I'm gonna plug in

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:41.412
the value one, one to
this partial derivative

00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:43.880
that we computed in the last video,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.562
you would say, "Oh, well,
just looking at the picture,

00:07:46.562 --> 00:07:47.985
"you can kind of tell that the X value

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:49.408
"is gonna be something positive,

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:51.068
something greater than zero."

00:07:51.068 --> 00:07:53.448
The Y value is also gonna
be something positive,

00:07:53.448 --> 00:07:55.807
and, again, that's because
the movement is to the right,

00:07:55.807 --> 00:07:56.859
so positive X.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:58.649
It's moving up, so positive Y,

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:01.031
but the Z value should actually
be a little bit negative

00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:03.075
because as you look at this curve,

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:05.919
it's going down in a sense.

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.327
And with that being our prediction,

00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:11.077
if you start plugging
in one, one to T and S,

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:16.585
what you'll see is that
two times one is two,

00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:18.605
S equals one, so that's just one,

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.062
and then over here this
looks like one squared

00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:23.948
minus two times one times one,

00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:25.655
so this will be one minus two.

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:28.407
That's negative one, so
it is in fact that kind of

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.611
positive, positive, negative
pattern that you were seeing.

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.035
And maybe even from this curve,

00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:34.185
you can get a feel for why the
movement in the X direction

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:36.878
is twice as much in the movement in the Y.

00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:38.258
It's moving more to the right

00:08:38.258 --> 00:08:40.552
than it is up in the Y direction.

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.370
Then, again, in principle
you can imagine doing this

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.198
not just at the point one,
one but at any given point,

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:46.633
maybe any given point along this curve

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:48.759
or any given point along the surface.

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:50.930
And the corresponding movement,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.445
the direction that nudges
in the T direction,

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.127
will give you some vector
in three-dimensional space,

00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:57.265
and that's the interpretation.

00:08:57.265 --> 00:09:01.456
That is the meaning of
the partial derivative

00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:04.373
of the vector-valued function here.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.562
And, again, it's not the
actual nudge vector itself,

00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:11.022
when you nudge the input

00:09:11.022 --> 00:09:14.093
and you get just a little
smidgen in the output space here,

00:09:14.093 --> 00:09:16.756
but it's that divided by
the size of the nudge,

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.493
so that's why you'll get
kind of normal-sized vectors

00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:20.434
rather than tiny vectors.

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.205
And in the next video, I'll
do kind of the same thing

00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:24.708
for what happens when you
nudge in the S direction

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:26.782
just to get a better
feel for what's going on

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:28.115
in this example.
