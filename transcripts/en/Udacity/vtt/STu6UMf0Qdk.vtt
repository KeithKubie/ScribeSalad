00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's now talk a little bit about web content

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.140
distribution networks or CDNs. We'll first talk about what

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.820
a CDN is and why a content provider might

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.280
want to use one. We'll then talk about how service

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.090
selection works in CDNs and how clients get redirected

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.690
to the right server. So first of all, what is

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.220
a content distribution network? It's an overlay network of

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.690
web caches that's designed to deliver content to a client

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.150
from the optimal location. Now, in many

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.180
cases, optimal means geographically closest but, sometimes,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.680
optimal is not the geographically closest cache

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.100
and we'll see some examples of when that's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.060
the case. CDNs are made of distinct

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.510
geographically disparate groups of servers, where each group

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.750
can serve all the content on the CDN. These CDNs can often be quite extensive.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.560
Here is a global map depicting the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.490
deployment of the Google cache servers, around

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.840
the world. As mapped in a recent

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.890
project, by researchers at the University of Southern

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.380
California. As you can see, these Web caches can be quite extensive and in many

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.610
cases there's a concerted effort to place

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.600
caches as close as possible to users. Some

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.480
CDNs are owned by content providers such as Google and others are owned and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.600
operated by networks such as Level 3, Limelight and AT&amp;T. Still others such

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.890
as Akami operate independently. Non network CDNs, such as Akami and Google, can

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.340
typically place servers in other autonomous systems

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.645
or ISPs. The number of cache nodes

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.680
ind a large content distribution network can vary. For example, in the Google

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.120
Network, the USC researchers found that there

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.450
were about 30,000 unique front-end cache nodes.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.990
As of about two years ago, the Akamai Edge platform reported about 85,000

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.170
unique caching servers, in nearly 1,000 unique

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.780
networks around the world, in 72 countries.
