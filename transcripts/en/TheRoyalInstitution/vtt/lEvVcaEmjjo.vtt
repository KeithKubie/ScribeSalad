00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.654
It's a very weird
liquid, this.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.610
On the scale of 1 to
10 of weirdness

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.460
this comes about 433.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.860
Is it the blood of some strange
machine, you ask?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.082
Do you ask that?

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:46.332
I ask that.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.320
No, it's not.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.570
This stuff is very odd.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.710
It's called a ferrofluid, or a
magnetic liquid, and what's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.290
happening here is there's a
magnet down there and a bolt

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.710
in which the magnetic field's
been channelled through.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
And the liquid is reacting
to the magnetic field.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.489
That's really odd.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.900
Not many liquids do that.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.280
That's because this liquid has
got tiny nanoparticles,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.250
magnetite, in it.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.720
Now, normally if you put that
kind of particle in a water

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270
solution, it'll just
get ripped out by

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.520
the magnetic field.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.550
In this case, it's been coated
with a surfactant, and that

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.820
surfactant is an interface
with the water,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.130
which loves the water.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.480
So they're held into the water,
and that makes the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.000
liquid behave as if
it's magnetic.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.020
It's pulled along with the
particles and so it's kind of

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.692
channelled into these different
shapes, which are

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:49.570
all defined by the
magnetic field.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.270
So you can confine a liquid with
a magnetic field just by

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.400
putting these tiny little
magnetic particles in there.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.275
So nanotechnology, at
its most beautiful.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.970
Car manufactures have used it
because, in a way, what you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
can do is you can kind of
confine a liquid and make it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.650
either viscous or quite runny
with just controlling an

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.080
electromagnet.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.380
And that means you can make a
car suspension either very

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.290
hard or very soft at the
touch of a button.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.970
Now, that sound's like quite a
cool application, I agree,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.680
but, I think, we can come up
with something better.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.170
Although personally, I haven't
yet, except for the bolt.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.090
It's pretty cool.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:03:10.143
