00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:02.116
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:05.533
is talk about the idea of a residual plot

00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:08.658
for a given regression

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.940
and the data that it's trying to explain.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.183
So right over here,

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:16.499
we have a fairly simple
least squares regression.

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.508
We're trying to fit four points.

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.657
And in previous videos,
we actually came up

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:25.674
with the equation of this
least squares regression line.

00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:27.100
What I'm going to do now

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.617
is plot the residuals
for each of these points.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:33.691
So what is a residual?

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:35.633
Well, just as a reminder,

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:36.716
your residual

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.208
for a given point is equal to the actual

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.716
minus the expected.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.458
So how do I make that tangible?

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:53.324
Well, what's the residual for
this point right over here?

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.596
For this point here,

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:58.013
the actual y when x equals one is one,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.142
but the expected, when x equals one

00:01:02.142 --> 00:01:04.149
for this least squares regression line,

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.149
2.5 times one minus two,

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.308
well, that's gonna be .5.

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:12.554
And so our residual is one minus .5,

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:14.387
so we have a positive,

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.233
we have a positive 0.5 residual.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:22.545
Over for this point,
you have zero residual.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.374
The actual is the expected.

00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:27.583
For this point right over here,

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:31.500
the actual, when x
equals two, for y is two,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.009
but the expected is three.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.283
So our residual over here,

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:40.450
once again, the actual is y equals two

00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.987
when x equals two.

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:47.410
The expected, two times
2.5 minus two is three,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.692
so this is going to be two minus three,

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:54.479
which equals a residual of negative one.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.441
And then over here, our
residual are actual.

00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:00.333
When x equals three is six,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.916
our expected when x equals three is 5.5.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.642
So six minus 5.5,

00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:09.758
that is a positive 0.5.

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:14.208
So those are the residuals,
but how do we plot it?

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.708
Well, we would set up or axes.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:21.210
Let me do it right over here.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.626
One,

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:24.233
two,

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:25.833
and three.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.579
And let's see, the maximum
residual here is positive .5

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.734
and then the minium one
here is negative one.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:35.264
So let's see, this could be .5, one.

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:37.025
negative .5, negative one.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.800
So this is negative one.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.399
This is positive one here.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.161
And so when x equals one,
what was the residual?

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.744
Well, the actual was
one, expected was 0.5,

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.994
one minus 0.5

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:51.827
is 0.5.

00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:56.953
So this right over here, we
can plot right over here.

00:02:56.953 --> 00:02:58.620
The residual is 0.5.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:04.704
When x equals two, we
actually have two data points.

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:06.815
First, I'll do this one.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:09.867
When we have the point two comma three,

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:12.254
the residual there is zero.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.957
So for one of them, the residual is zero.

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:19.099
Now for the other one, the
residual is negative one.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.082
Let me do that in a different color.

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.445
For the other one, the
residual is negative one,

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:26.834
so we would plot it right over here.

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:28.533
And then this last point,

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:30.866
the residual is positive .5.

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:34.528
So it is just like that.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.750
And so this thing that
I have just created,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.962
where we're just seeing,

00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:42.141
for each x where we have
a corresponding point,

00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:45.102
we plot the point above or below the line

00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:46.892
based on the residual.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:49.246
This is called a residual plot.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:50.891
Now, one question is why do people

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.207
even go through the trouble

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:55.957
of creating a residual plot like this.

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:59.733
The answer is, regardless of
whether the regression line

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.570
is upward sloping or downward sloping,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.699
this gives you a sense
of how good a fit it is

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.232
and whether a line is good at explaining

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:11.621
the relationship between the variables.

00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.092
The general idea is if you see the point

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.383
pretty evenly scattered
or randomly scattered

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:17.432
above and below this line,

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.450
you don't really discern any trend here,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.908
then a line is probably a
good model for the data.

00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:26.708
But if you do see some type of trend,

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:29.105
if the residuals had an
upward trend like this

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.249
or if they were curving
up and then curving down,

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:32.857
or they had a downward trend,

00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:35.192
then you might say, "Hey,
this line isn't a good fit,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:38.925
"and maybe we would have
to do a non-linear model."

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:41.300
What are some examples
of other residual plots?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.300
And let's try to analyze them a bit.

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:47.166
So right here you have a regression line

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:48.846
and its corresponding residual plot.

00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:50.414
And once again, you see here,

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:52.683
the residual is slightly positive.

00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:54.999
The actual is slightly above the line,

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.291
and you see it right over
there, it's slightly positive.

00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.650
This one's even more
positive, you see it there.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.024
But like the example we just looked at,

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:04.890
it looks like these residuals
are pretty evenly scattered

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.066
above and below the line.

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.232
There isn't any discernible trend.

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:10.590
And so I would say that
a linear model here,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.558
and in particular, this regression line,

00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:15.058
is a good model for this data.

00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:19.157
But if we see something like this,

00:05:19.157 --> 00:05:22.309
a different picture emerges.

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.807
When I look at just the residual plot,

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:26.599
it doesn't look like
they're evenly scattered.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.607
It looks like there's
some type of trend here.

00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:30.574
I'm going down here,

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:33.141
but then I'm going back up.

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.542
When you see something like
this, where on the residual plot

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:38.659
you're going below the
x-axis and then above,

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.380
then it might say, "Hey, a linear model

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.684
"might not be appropriate.

00:05:41.684 --> 00:05:44.236
"Maybe some type of non-linear model.

00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:46.633
"Some type of non-linear curve

00:05:46.633 --> 00:05:48.217
"might better fit the data,"

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:51.742
or the relationship
between the y and the x

00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:52.909
is non-linear.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.082
Another way you could think about it

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:57.116
is when you have a lot of residuals

00:05:57.116 --> 00:06:00.433
that are pretty far away from the x-axis

00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:02.783
in the residual plot, you'd also say,

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:05.107
"This line isn't such a good fit."

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:07.474
If you calculate the R value here,

00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:09.711
it would only be slightly positive,

00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.677
but it would not be close to one.
