&gt;&gt; Carlos Díaz-Rosillo:
All right, thank you.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.860
Welcome to the 18th Annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.160
My name is Carlos Díaz.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.150
I'm the senior deputy chairman
of the National Endowment

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.320
for the Humanities and
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.080
Hey.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.540
[ Applause ]

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.710
I'm thrilled to be here
and the NEH is thrilled

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.320
to be sponsoring this year's
Understanding Our World Stage.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.830
As you all know, an independent
federal grant making agency,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.210
the NEH supports museum
exhibits, documentaries,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.920
and books that bring history
literature, philosophy

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
and a lot more to the
public, funds the preservation

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
of historic records,
collections, and objects,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.400
sponsors educational
opportunities for teachers

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.150
and students in the humanities,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.100
and underwrites fundamental
research across all disciplines

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.940
within the humanities.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.550
And, so I'm here with James
and Deborah Fallows to talk

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.610
about their book "Our Towns,
a 100,000-mile Journey

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.510
into the Heart of America".

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.900
Let me give you a
little background.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.510
A little over five years ago,
Jim and Deb posted a message

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.680
on the Atlantic Magazine
website.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
They asked readers to come to
recommend small towns and cities

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.590
across the US that
were experiencing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.420
economic recoveries.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.680
Flooded by responses,
they narrowed the list

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.810
to about 30 places which
they proceeded to visit

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.520
over the next few years.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.080
These visits were not
just casual drop-ins.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.940
They came, stayed, and
in many cases came back

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.510
and stayed again, searching for
what might be called the source

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.050
of a new American prosperity.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.950
Their book is the subject
of today's conversation.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.900
No stranger to Washington DC,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.550
Jim worked in the
Carter Administration

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.070
as chief speechwriter.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.340
He has been writing for the
Atlantic since the late 1970s,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.780
and he's the author
of over a dozen books.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.020
He has written extensively
on foreign policy, China,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.890
and many issues of
national politics.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370
He and his wife Deb have
spent many years abroad living

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.370
in Japan, Malaysia, and China.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.430
Deb, who is a trained linguist,
is the author of "Dreaming

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.440
in Mandarin", an account of her
journey into Chinese language

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.550
and culture during
their most recent stays

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.270
in Shanghai and Beijing.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.400
So, if you're ready,
we can start now.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.700
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: We're ready.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.500
&gt;&gt; Carlos Díaz-Rosillo:
All right.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.080
So, the first -- and by the
way, I'll ask a few questions

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.410
and then I'm sure your
questions are going

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.710
to be better than my questions.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.740
So, we'll leave a few minutes
for Q and A from the audience

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.570
so you can ask them
any questions you want.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.010
Many accounts of American life
have been written, of course,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.750
but yours is the only
one that I've read

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.230
where the authors
travel by plane.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.860
You travel in a very
small plane,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.240
couple of seats,
throughout the US.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.610
So, I want to ask you,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.570
what would you say
makes your book unique?

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.510
What is the uniqueness
of your book

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.220
that will make everybody
rush out and buy the book?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.510
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: Maybe that
we're still married after it.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.180
[ Applause and Laughter ]

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.480
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: And,
we've been together

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.250
since we were age 18, which is
longer ago for me than for Deb,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.330
but we've been together
all those times.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.630
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: But--

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.930
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: So, there --

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.230
so first Carlos,
thank you so much.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.320
Thanks to the Library of
Congress, thanks to the NEH,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.730
thanks to the book festival,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.290
thanks to you all
for coming here.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.650
We're really honored to be
back here in our hometown.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.950
We've haven't been
for a long time,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.350
talking about what we've seen
while we've been on the road.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.550
Anybody who has read in
American history and literature,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.890
as you all have, know that the
road trip or the Pirogue trip

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.610
or the ox cart trip or the other
kind of trip is a main motif

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.010
and schtick for understanding
America.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.860
And, there's a reason for that.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.400
It's a big dispersed country
with a huge extent from side

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.690
to side and north to south,
and so there's a good reason

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.300
that so many Americans --
sagas Americana or road trips

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.690
of one kind or another.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.600
We -- because we had
before we lived in China,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.050
been around the country a fair
amount in our little tiny,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.240
essentially flying car kind
of an airplane, a Sirius SR22,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.690
which has a parachute
for the entire airplane.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.090
Whole different topic
we can get into.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.260
We knew how -- we know both how
interesting the landscape was

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.290
as you see it unfold at low
altitude from 2000 feet up,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.300
but also how much of the
country is accessible this way.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.120
So, I think that the one
perspective that's different

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.660
in this book is that it's
a low altitude aerial means

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.630
of transport and one
counterpart I can think

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.720
of is is a marvelous book
called "Flight of Passage"

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.810
by Rinker Buck maybe ten
years ago or so about his

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.710
and his brother's flight across
the country in a small plane.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.280
But, even more, I think
we were trying to contrast

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.940
at this moment in media

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.040
and political history how the
US looks at the cellular level

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.680
from the bottom up
versus how it looks

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.350
when you turn on cable news.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.770
And, so I think that
contrast of a sense

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.490
that the US actually is doing
better than most people think

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.860
at the city by city and
even state by state level,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.950
that's I think the distinctive
aspect of our message.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.330
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: And, Jim and
I both grew up in small towns

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.660
so it was a really natural
move for us to look at smaller

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.050
and medium sizes towns.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.350
They were places where we felt
comfortable and had our own kind

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.750
of history in how towns work.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.760
So, it was -- it just felt like
a very natural approach for us

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.780
to do it that way, and we read
all the accounts, you know?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.440
"Travels with Charlie" and
William Lease Tate Moon and back

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.820
to Mark Twain, and
they were a wonderful

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.120
and humbling beginning.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.660
And, we also learned some
lessons from them on how

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.610
to do it, how to drop into
places and get a good start.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.030
But, also how to stay for
-- we stayed for a while.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.120
I suppose Mark Twain
had to stay for a while

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.640
because it took longer to
get places back in the day,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.470
but that was an extremely
enjoyable part of our life

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.750
to feel like we got
a sense of the spirit

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.110
of the places where we were.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.770
&gt;&gt; Carlos Díaz-Rosillo: So, you
got hundreds of recommendations.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.810
How did you narrow the
list down to 30 cities?

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.410
&gt;&gt; James Fallows:
It was a combination

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.180
of science and happenstance.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.100
When we started doing
this, we just --

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.970
we wanted to go to
a couple of places

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.610
where we had little tendrils
of connection like Sioux Falls,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.460
South Dakota, which is a
huge and fascinating place

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.310
that I had never been before,
and you'd been there once

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.630
at some event at
Augustana College.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.740
So, we thought let's -- there's
lots going on in Sioux Falls.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.040
Let's try that.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.070
We had somebody we knew
in Holland, Michigan.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.800
We had people we knew
in Eastport, Maine,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.170
and we were looking for
regional representation.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.740
We -- each place we went we
sort of changed the focus

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.330
of where we might go later on.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.280
We wanted to be not
scientifically sampling,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.810
but sort of crudely
representative of far Northeast,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.270
far Southwest, Great
Plains, Deep South.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.610
And, as time went on we went
to places that were more

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.900
and more economically
troubled, like San Bernardino,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.710
which is right next
to where I grew up.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.160
And, a long time in
Mississippi and--

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.460
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: Allentown.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.620
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: Allentown
and Erie and western Kansas.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.540
And, so we felt as if we
started out looking at places

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.690
that were known for
being successful,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.980
and gravitated towards places
that were earlier on the dealing

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.340
with our challenges for--

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.640
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: And,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.940
occasionally it was
really opportunistic.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.240
We had been in Greenville,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.090
South Carolina looking
at a lot of things.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.140
But, one thing we wrote about
on a blog along the way was this

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.090
amazing governor's school,
which is a public school,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.370
that was focused on the arts
and humanities in Greenville.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.910
And, so we wrote these
kind of glowing reports.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.690
It was an amazing
school, and the next day

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.960
in my inbox I got a message
from a teacher in Columbus,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.380
Mississippi who was

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.630
at the Mississippi Governor's
School for Math and Science.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.620
And, it was essentially kind
of throwing down the gauntlet,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.550
and said, "You think
that's school is

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.850
so great in Greenville.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.560
You have to come and see
ours in Mississippi."

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040
So, it's like, "Okay.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.340
That's it.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.640
That's what we're looking for."

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.890
Just the sense of energy
and kind of mission

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.700
in the great unknown
of what we would find.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.050
So, we headed off to the
heart of Mississippi.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.550
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Wow, so
as a non-journalist I'm curious

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.440
as to how you go about reporting
it, and capturing the essence

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.970
of a town that you haven't in
many cases ever been to before?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.340
&gt;&gt; James Fallows:
I'll say something

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.420
about the national media
since we're here in DC,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.770
and there's other national
media people, and I've worked

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.070
for The Atlantic
for a long time,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.820
and then just about
human nature.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.650
From the national media point
of view one reason we wanted

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.570
to do this project is a
sense of the imbalance

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.170
between how a handful of cities
are portrayed, and how the rest

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.770
of the US is portrayed.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.050
And, what I mean is that
if you think of New York,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.580
those of us who are
not New Yorkers,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.720
we know what ever
block looks like there

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.390
from movies and from TV shows.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.850
Same is true of San Francisco.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.340
It's true of DC, etcetera, but
most of the rest of the country,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.650
the national media show up only
when there's a primary election

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.830
or a tornado or a
shooting, or a concept story

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.860
on how people are feeling in
Kentucky or whatever as opposed

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.970
to dealing with these places

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.860
on their own three
dimensional terms.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.590
So, one thing we wanted to do
as Deb said, because we think

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.070
of ourselves as small
town people, is just say,

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.620
"We're here to ask the
story of Duluth, you know?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.190
What's happening in Duluth
for better or worse?"

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.190
Not how Duluth is going
to vote next time.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.680
Not how -- not that sort of
national media narrative.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.560
So, one thing was
approaching them

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.520
as if their own city
stories were interesting.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.810
The other is that my
experience in the long years

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.710
in journalism is
that people basically

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.570
like talking about themselves.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.650
And, they like talking about
their story of their family

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.630
and of the company and of their
community and of their hopes.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.140
So, if you just have
open ended questions of,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.440
what's going right here?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.740
What's going wrong here?

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.090
What do people care about?

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.150
What do people not know?

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.480
What do people miss
about your town?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.450
You know, what is
something that we

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.100
as short term visitors
are likely to miss?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.460
You'll often get interesting
answers if you go that way,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.510
and that's a -- that
was how it went.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.880
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows:
And, on a very nuts

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.580
and bolts level usually we would
arrive on a Sunday or a Monday,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.620
and kind of crossing our
fingers saying, you know,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.920
"I hope this works out.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.660
We're committed here
for the week."

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.830
And, we would go see what we
fondly call the usual suspects

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.510
in town at first to go
together to stop and see

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.190
if there was a newspaper.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.970
We'd go to see the editor
of the staff, and if --

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.980
we'd try to connect with
somebody in the school system,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.990
somebody with the chamber of
commerce and local government.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.000
Dropping at the library,
because it's

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.690
such the heart and
soul of the town.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.870
You could always find out
what's really happening

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.230
if you talk to a librarian.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.030
Applause line there.

[ Applause and Laughter ]

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.380
And, that was usually
the first day,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.450
and then the second day we would
go in our different directions,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.150
and our kind of different
skill set

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.770
or interest of what we followed.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.270
And, round about
Wednesday we'd think,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.910
"There's no way we're
ever going to get

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.020
through everything we need
to find in this town."

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.540
It was just following
a breadcrumb trail,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.790
and as Jim said people were
extraordinarily generous

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.860
in talking with us
about their towns.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.720
We went in with a
very small footprint.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.170
Just -- just, you know,
generally unannounced

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.280
with our notebooks and started
to ask things, and we ended

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.330
up inside classrooms, you
know, inside people's offices,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:11.090
at brew pubs, on the
street, at local events

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:16.170
like the sports events or
town concerts or the plays.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.160
We tried to spend as much time
with as many people of all sorts

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.020
as we possibly could, and
then we'd often get to the end

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.130
of the week and think,
"We'll stay."

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.050
or, "We'll come back," because
there just wasn't enough time.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.350
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: I'm
glad you mentioned libraries,

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.850
because you talk a lot about
libraries in your book,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.850
and I'm sure all of us here
care deeply about libraries.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.510
I know that all of that

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.040
at the NEH care very
much about libraries.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.420
What is about libraries
that struck --

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.720
that, yeah, struck you?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.360
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: It
was such a surprised,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.040
and I'm actually embarrassed

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.090
that I didn't know
this five years ago,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.640
because I thought
libraries were the same kind

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.260
of institution that
I grew up with.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.100
Where you went in kind
of tiptoeing very quietly

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.850
and were told to shush,
and find your corner

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.650
in the back of the room.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.240
Now I've learned from
being in libraries in just

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.510
about every city we covered that
they are the place that fill

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.790
in the gaps that is
needed by the town.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.050
Whether it's an education
starting

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.540
from preschool skills all the
way up through adult literacy,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.540
or if it's in technology,
providing Wi-Fi access.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.750
I used to work in the Pew
Research Center and know

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.500
for a fact that 25 percent

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.280
of the country doesn't
have fast Wi-Fi at home.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.160
And, often even -- even
computers, so it's a --

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.550
it's the go to place to remain
connected with the world,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.060
and also as civic
and social centers.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.550
Not only for ESL classes,
or how to become a citizen,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:50.060
but for fun stuff like
do yoga, get a latte.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.220
For very responsive stuff
they're always the institutions

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.520
that stay open.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.910
In Ferguson, Missouri
after Hurricane --

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.490
the one in New Jersey,
after Hurricane Harvey,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.960
and in Houston they
are the, "We are open.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.490
We will be here for you.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.970
Tell us what you need."

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.730
Over the door of the
main library in Columbus,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.790
Ohio it says, "Open to all."

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.600
And, that, you know, really hit
home when you go there at 10:00

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.360
to 9:00 in the morning and see
the homeless people waiting

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.270
to go in to a safe haven.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.980
Or, when you stay there all
day and see the kind of hordes

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.180
of people moving in and
out for whatever they do.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.090
So, we became complete
evangelists

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.510
for how public libraries
have -- what they've become.

libraries, were there any

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.710
of institutions that taught
you something about America

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.610
that you didn't know already?

to say I didn't know
this before discovery

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.800
for Deborah libraries
is community colleges,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.600
and I say that because -- yeah.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.780
So, we've spent, as
Carlos said, we spent a lot

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.080
of our life overseas and
seeing the US from afar,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.080
and from an overseas
perspective even more

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.580
than from a domestic
perspective.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.760
You know, the research
universities are of course

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.970
so crucial to American
leadership and future economic

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.440
and other prospects, etcetera.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.870
And, that is true, but I had
no first hand appreciation

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.100
of how crucial community
colleges are right

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.030
at this moment of
economic history

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.640
and of cultural history
in this way.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.450
We went to a lot of places
where there'd been some kind

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.750
of historic economic shock.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.310
In Erie, Pennsylvania the
big GE plant is closing down.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.580
In Allentown, of course
the steel mills have gone

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.880
away there.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.180
In south -- Greenville,

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.560
South Carolina the textile
industries have gone away,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.890
and there's a -- you know,
a giant list of places

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.700
that have been through
those phase shifts

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.840
that are a recurring part
of world economic history.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.810
And, you could see that in those
places students whose parents

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.550
might have worked
in the big factory,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.520
and who themselves
were not going to work

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.100
in the big factory, because
the big factory was gone

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.920
and was not going to come back.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.880
The opportunities for those
students, you know, the children

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.230
of the big factory workers
actually do exist in welding

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.960
and in clean energy
and in construction

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.530
and in healthcare
and in robotics.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.930
And, lots of skilled technical
jobs that are the equivalent

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.240
of the old factory jobs.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.950
Just they're not in a giant
factory, and there's, you know,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.270
almost any of those fields
they are desperate for people

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.550
who have those skills for
relatively good paying jobs.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.330
The community colleges among the
things they do is connect those

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.350
students with those
opportunities.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.150
We saw those in a
million places.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.000
I'll just give one
illustration, and I'll give two

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.580
for each illustration,
both in the south.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.950
One, it was in coastal Georgia
in Camden County, Georgia,

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.610
Saint Mary's in Kingsland.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.190
Their high school there has this
really advanced career technical

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.490
training program.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.130
Every high school
student gets a quote,

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.580
"Normal" high school
course, and they have AP

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.930
and everything else,
but also they have one

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.880
of five vocational tracks
they have to go through.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.970
And, they come out with licenses
in welding, or certificates

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.270
in nursing or whatever.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.520
So, they come out
qualified for actual jobs.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.350
The other is in the so called
Golden Triangle of Mississippi

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.700
of Columbus, West
Point, and Starkville.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.700
The East Mississippi Community
College is training people

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.760
who have never worked,
who've been in prison,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.070
who've been on welfare
or whatever,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.610
for these new factory jobs.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.050
They are -- creating
there, so I now think

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.450
that community colleges
are the most important part

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.510
of the American educational
system right now.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.700
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
If I may, let me ask you

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.270
about another set
of institutions,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.570
cultural institutions.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.530
As the representative of the
NEH I feel I have to ask you

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.310
about the health
and the vitality

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.610
of our cultural institutions.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.910
How are we doing?

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.350
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: So--

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.480
[ Laughter ]

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.280
So, we saw -- Deb and I are
both sort of philistines,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.570
so we had not paid that
much attention to public art

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.120
in general, or the
institutional,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.990
cultural patrimony that you
all are creating in others.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.950
And, we come away being
really impressed by that to.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.540
That the sense of local
patriotism, local place,

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.410
local engagement, that comes
from libraries and from museums

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.270
and from public places
of all sorts.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.120
I'll again -- I'll give an
illustration from Mississippi U

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.510
and maybe one from Duluth.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.410
So, -- for another one, so
in the East Mississippi --

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.270
or, Mississippi School
of Math and Sciences

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.300
that Deb was mentioning, this
is from a place obviously --

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.650
everything about Mississippi
is burdens shaped and seamed

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.430
to the legacy of
slavery and race there.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.700
And, this part of Mississippi in
particular was the hospital town

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.760
for the Battle of Shiloh, and
they had lots of plantations

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.680
around there in the
slavery days.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.170
And, the whole mission of the
Mississippi School of Math

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.980
and Sciences, despite its name,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.750
is essentially teaching
the history

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.140
and the culture of the region.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.750
They do reenactments of every
stage of the area's history

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.430
with a mixed race cast of
the school students from all

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.260
across the state
playing plantation owners

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.500
and enslaved people and people
during the reconstruction era

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.330
and every stage of
the city's history.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:40.400
And, so it's a crucial part
of that area's identity.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.650
The humanity's formation
they're all getting.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.700
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows:
And, two other examples

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.780
from opposite ends of the
country, and let me start

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.790
by saying that institution
feels like a really big word

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.120
when you're in a small town.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.230
So, I would shrink that
down to the local theater

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.930
or the local art
gallery or, you know,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.870
the local performing
arts center.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.080
We saw two towns in
particular that seemed

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.570
to be recreating
themselves with the core

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.460
of being their arts programs.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.550
Their arts' art in
some way or another.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.560
Ajo, Arizona, which is a
small former mining town

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.320
in southwest Arizona.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.190
Eastport, Maine which is
far down east as you --

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.660
across from Campobello Island.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.240
It's way out there.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.850
In Eastport in particular
everything

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.320
in the town is starting
to be organized

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.860
around the arts in some way.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.990
The main street redevelopment
of the town, which is anchored

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.680
by a former bank
building, which is now --

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.970
it's called the Tides
Institute and Museum.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.060
It's all of the history of
the town in museum form.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.760
Everybody's everything from this
old fishing town that's ever

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.980
existed in a lovely way.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.190
All along the main street
are galleries and studios,

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.600
and there art walks every night,
because everyone in town seems

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.150
to be an artist of some sort.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.140
The light, it's about
the light both --

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.040
they said in both
of those towns.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.560
In Eastport, Maine, which it
has 1400 people, everybody has

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.910
to be part of this, otherwise
the town just won't work.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.940
We went to a performance
one night in the old --

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.090
in what's their art center,
it's a civic building,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.470
of The Glass Menagerie.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.160
Three people, they can't
have big productions.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.150
The stage manager was also
the barista in the coffee shop

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.500
and the nephrologist
and the clinic,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.740
and she just had purchased
a dog kennel where,

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.040
you know, people would go.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.560
Mixed and matched somehow.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.080
The guy taking tickets for
the performance was the editor

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.500
of the newspaper.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.430
So, you were really a slacker
if you didn't wear three hats,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.890
and one of them had to be
something about promoting

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.850
and sustaining the
arts in that community.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.150
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Great.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.740
So, you met hundreds
and hundreds of people.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.910
Was there any one person
that you said, "Wow,

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.020
everybody should
meet this person,"

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.230
and can you describe
this person?

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.530
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: Okay.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.830
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: Go you.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.130
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: I'm going
to lead with one person,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.840
and it's a -- there is a
young guy in his mid-30s

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.360
in Erie, Pennsylvania.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.630
His name is Ferki Ferati.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.810
It's Ferki -- last
name F-E-R-A-T-I.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.110
Ferki Ferati.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.410
He is a refugee.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.810
He's a -- from--

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.110
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: He's
an Albanian Kosovar.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.920
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows:
An Albanian Kosovar.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.720
He, blah blah blah,
troubles in the country.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.220
When he was 15 years old
he came with his family,

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.930
it was 20 years ago
roughly, to the US,

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.790
and a story he has told
I'm sure many times.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.080
I can't tell as well as he
does, but when they were --

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.290
ended up in New York
they asked the family,

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.070
"Where would you like to go?"

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.050
And, they said, "Well, we'd
like to be near New York."

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.600
Meaning, New York City,
and they said, "Great,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.900
we've got the place for you.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.200
Erie, Pennsylvania.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.900
It's right next to New York."

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.290
[ Laughter ]

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.570
And, Ferki has said that was
kind of the greatest thing

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.120
that went wrong and
then right in his life,

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:22.940
because he was mentored -- ten
percent of the people in Erie,

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.820
Pennsylvania are refugees,
just flat out refugees.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.190
And, they have an amazing
system of how to embrace

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.890
and incorporate this
population into the town,

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.650
which has been the secret to the
economic success of the town.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.070
Ferki himself, you know,
came as a 15 year old.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.720
He went into a high school.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.020
Then he went to college.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.120
There are four colleges
in Erie, Pennsylvania.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.880
Who knew? We all know now.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.100
He just earned his PhD from --

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.630
at the University of
Pittsburgh, I think.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.210
&gt;&gt; James Fallows:
I think so, yeah.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.040
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: In US
studies, and, you know,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:07.370
if this kid had been born
in the US we would end

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.700
up knowing a lot more about him.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.490
He would be -- he is
a player in this town.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.250
He now runs what is the
equivalent of Brookings AEI.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.270
[Inaudible] Institution,
an intellectual

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.490
and civic institution in town.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.790
He's gorgeous.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.400
He has a--

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.710
[ Laughter ]

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.200
Charismatic.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.630
Has a young Russian wife
whom he met on a year abroad.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.160
They have become a core of
the town, and you think,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.920
"This is great, because
it's Ferki.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.340
He's just who he is, and this
is great, because it's America.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.250
And, this who we bring here, and
this is what they can do here,"

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.050
so he's my number one.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:57.510
[ Applause ]

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.130
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: So,
further to Deb's point

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.580
about the gorgeousness of Ferki.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.100
He points out that he is the
blondest, most blue eyed,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.840
Muslim refugee you're ever going
to see in Erie, Pennsylvania.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.230
So, I've been thinking about
a lot of sort of larger

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.310
than life characters we met.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.810
For example, Captain Bob Peacock
of Eastport, Maine who was sort

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.480
of this world roving sea
captain who's come back

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.780
to try to save the time.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.930
Or, Joe Max Higgins and Brenda
Lathen [assumed spellings]

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.900
in Mississippi who've
willing their way to six

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.280
or seven billion dollars'
worth of investment.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.580
Or, a guy name Mike
Gallow [assumed spelling]

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.060
in San Bernardino who
is a politically very,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.910
very conservative defense
contractor guy who decided

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.280
that his mission in life was

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.460
to improve the San
Bernardino public schools.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.760
He's now chairman
of the school board

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.240
and spends all his
time doing that.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.700
But, I'm going to not talk
about any of those larger

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.360
than life characters, and
talk about somebody who has --

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.420
I wish people would meet,
because of her relevance

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.590
to modern America's future.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.540
This is a woman named
Ashley Swearengin

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.500
who has just been timed out
after two terms as the mayor

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.980
of Fresno, California.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.450
Those of you who are from
California like me know

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.470
that Fresno is the least
stylish part of the state.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.070
As part of the inland
California where I'm from,

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.850
this sort of looked down --
looked down by the coast.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.030
Fresno is part of a very
important agricultural region,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.110
but its downtown has been
devastated by [inaudible]

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.380
in the way that many
downtowns have been.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.380
And, Ashley Swearengin, in her
two terms as a Republican mayor

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.330
of Fresno, which has a
heavily Latino population,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.340
and a lot of poverty in
Fresno, was the center

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.870
of this urban redevelopment
effort of --

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.170
which has seemed

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.910
to be successfully
recasting Fresno as,

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.850
number one, a center
of the arts.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.230
Because, the real
estate cost there is

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.930
like one-fifth what it would
be a hundred miles away

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.230
in the Bay area.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.100
So, they're trying --
they're having arts there.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.960
They're having agricultural,
science, and technology.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.220
They're -- the beginning of
the high speed rail system

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.780
for California is there.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.440
Side note, people in LA
and San Francisco said,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.540
"The California high
speed rail is being built

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.470
in the middle of nowhere."

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.380
So, Fresno said,
"Welcome to nowhere."

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.150
You know, "This is
where we are,"

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.280
and they're changing their
motto to, "Fresyes from Fresno."

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.750
So, I think Ashley Swearengin

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.450
who now runs the community
foundation in Fresno is sort

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.340
of an illustration of the,
apart from the polarization

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.830
of national politics,

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.380
practicality you can
find on a local level.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.680
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Great.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.980
I'm going to read
the next question,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.280
because it has a
quote from your book.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.760
I want to make sure I
get the quote right.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.370
Your book touches on
some hot button issue,

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.210
but you're not writing
a political argument

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.510
of the usual kind.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.040
In fact, you say, and
this is the quote,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.760
"Overwhelmingly the focus

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.680
in successful towns was not an
insoluble national division,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.990
but on practical problems
a community could address.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.040
The more often national
politics came

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.700
into local discussions the
worse shape the town was likely

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.000
to be in."

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.670
Can you elaborate a
little bit on that?

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.970
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: Yes.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.790
I will stipulate within this
room or with any gathering

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.480
of Americans there's a range
of views on national politics.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.900
And, I will also
stipulate from observation

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.480
that there's almost
nothing interesting that any

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.270
of us can say to
anybody else on the front

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.870
of national politics anymore.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.940
Sort of all grievances, all
concerns, all differences

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.240
of perspective, if you
haven't voiced them yourself

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.680
or heard them, if you turn
on cable TV, you'll hear them

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.980
in the next ten minutes.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.280
And, that's essentially

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.020
that national politics has
become a kind of polarized

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.340
and difficult ritual
that's disconnected

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.790
from a lot of daily life.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.080
Obviously it matters.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.880
Obviously it's of
crucial importance.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.180
Obviously in the saga

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.130
of American history national
government have made big,

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:58.690
big switches one way or another,
but the temper of discussion

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.920
of national politics
is really difficult.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.230
We found we went to
towns we never, ever,

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.670
ever asked people,
"Do you like Obama?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.970
Do you hate Obama?

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.270
Do you like Trump?

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.570
Do you hate Trump?"

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.870
We'd ask them, "What's
happening in this town?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.360
What -- how do you
work with people

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.660
from different perspectives?"

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.390
And, we found that what you
would like to think to be true

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.030
of America, that we all
have our differences,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.320
but you actually can find
areas of discussing them.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.200
And, finding practical
compromised solutions,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.050
and making plans for
20 years from now

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.220
that have some chance
of coming true.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.510
That those things still are
largely true at the local level.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.740
[ Laughter ]

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.150
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Deb, let
me ask you a question if I may.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.510
You're a trained linguist,

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.450
so as you were traveling
you were taking notes

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.680
on variations in
American speech.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.980
What were you trying
to find out?

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.000
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: Yeah, so
one of the questions that was

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.870
on my mind when we started
was just how people speak

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.170
these days?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.690
Has the -- are there
regionalisms,

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.740
or has everything
been flattened?

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.620
And, I think that
the answer is yes.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.910
That it's been flattened
in the sense

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.660
that we all listen
to the same media.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.130
We all pick up on the same
things, and now I'm going

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.430
to ruin your day by
one thing that I heard

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.240
that just drives me crazy, and I
promise you're going to hear it,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.070
and it will drive you crazy.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.990
If you listen to any pundits

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.100
or any radio shows
people will often begin

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.160
with a phrase I heard and
first started noticing

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.050
in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.390
Let me be honest.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.120
I have to be honest
with you, or honestly.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.170
I'm thinking, "South
Dakota, you have to tell me

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.470
that you're going to be honest?

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.090
I mean, we know you're
going to be honest."

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.660
That -- a version of
that phrase now begins --

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.640
I promise you'll hear it
on any kind of nation media

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.180
that you turn on or
tune into or listen to.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.660
So, there is that kind
of flattening everywhere.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.350
A really fun thing that we
noticed first in Greenville,

call the second question.

If you're in a crowd like
this, except maybe it's not --

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.580
it's less of a Washington crowd.

"Where do you go to church?"

that I was, "Whoa.

a little personal,

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:14.340
We have the authority
and the obligation

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.010
and we can individually,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.690
and then better collectively
make an impact that's kind

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.590
of beyond our differences.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:29.660
And, one proof of how deeply
that goes comes from Columbus,

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.170
Ohio where there's so
much collaboration going

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.420
on that they've shortened the
word collaborate to just collab.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.440
Collab, because it
takes too long, so.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.740
There you go.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.040
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
All right.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.340
So, if there are any
questions there are a couple

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.150
of microphones up here in the
front, and I'll ask that --

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.220
for you to please say your
name, where you're from.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.040
And, remember that
questions should be brief,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.930
and end in a question mark.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.230
All right.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.000
&gt;&gt; My name is Lisa.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.530
I'm originally from
Philadelphia, and I now live

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.450
in Arlington, and my
question is I know

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.430
that you have both
traveled so much in Asia.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.270
And, I was just wondering, and
obviously you've probably went

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.480
to a lot of small
towns in China and Asia

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.800
and other places
you've traveled in.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.250
If you found any sort of obvious

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.520
or significant cultural
differences from all

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.370
of your travels, you know,
between Asia or the east

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.370
and the small towns you went
to here in America, in term --

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.550
you know, in terms
of perspectives?

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.850
&gt;&gt; James Fallows:
So, the question's

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:33.200
about small town differences
between Asia and the US.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.300
And, instead of giving
the 20 hour answer

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.560
to that I'll give the
two sentence answer

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.860
from my perspective, which is

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.250
that the US is almost
uniquely positioned in terms

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.720
of really powerful small
town possibilities.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.760
In China, there is the famous,
the further away you are

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.780
from Beijing the more sort of
chaos and independence you have

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.320
at the small town level,
But, it's more getting away

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.380
with things as opposed
to sort of the diaspora

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.580
of genuine local renewal we
seem to see around the US.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.220
So, then that's the
shortest answer

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.780
for a really interesting
question.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.130
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
Right, up here.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.390
&gt;&gt; Antoine van Agtmael.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.750
Like you I've made
this road trip,

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.570
and what has exasperated me
is the collaboration I've seen

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.790
locally, and the
lack of it here.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:26.430
And, I keep thinking
why is that?

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.570
Did you find any
answer on your trip?

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.370
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: So, the
question from the author

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.560
of a wonderful book that
we cite in our books,

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.860
Smartest Places on Earth.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.290
Right? Smartest Places is
by Antoine van Agtmael,

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.990
is why there's so much
cooperation at the local level

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.720
and so little at
the national level?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.800
I think the -- the roots --

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.950
the local level cooperation
I think is a cultivated

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.330
and developed skill.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.440
You know, that's easier when
you can see the consequences

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.140
of your work locally, and
you see the people you're

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.440
dealing with.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.940
But, places that are
good at this work at it.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.880
It's not just something
that happens by accident,

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.390
and I think that there has been
for various reasons we can get

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.140
into in another 30
hour conversation,

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.350
of why that has atrophied
so much.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.460
And, sort of deliberately
undermined the national level,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.770
but my hope is that
the next wave

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.110
of national politics will be
somebody who has risen up,

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.130
or people who've risen up
with this local level culture,

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.950
and say, "Look, we're
better than this nationally.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.510
We can do things the way we've
done around the country."

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.390
[ Applause ]

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.690
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Andrew
Mingus [assumed spelling]

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.990
from outside of New York.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.290
Now I live in DC.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.770
Seems like a large
intention from the book was

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.130
to experience places obviously

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.310
that you haven't
experienced before,

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.400
and convey that to other
people through the book.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.040
Something that really sort
of thing is the debate

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.150
for mandatory national
service, and I was wondering

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.880
if you thought about that at
all, or fall for or against?

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.300
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: So,
could you say the last part

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.600
of the question again?

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.140
It sort of reverberated.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.440
[Inaudible]?

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the debate for
mandatory national service,

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.970
whether that's not -- military
or service or any iteration?

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.540
&gt;&gt; So, on the national
service question.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.840
I think it would be
better for the country

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.860
if there were more
ways for people both

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.680
to serve just for service.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.390
So, it's good for
the person doing it.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.380
It's good for the country, and
it's good in unexpected ways.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.300
For example, when in Ajo,
Arizona we wrote about this team

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.590
of sort of the modern
civilian conservation core

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.670
who were rebuilding
things in Ajo.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.970
And, they were from
all over the country,

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.660
and it was really
changing their lives.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.290
I think the mandatory
part is just not going

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.590
to happen in modern America.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.950
So, I would be in favor of ways

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.810
to make this much more
attractive, expected,

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.460
culturally, financially,
in other ways encouraged

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.550
and supported as this is good
for everybody who's doing it,

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.140
for the country and for them.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.550
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: And, I think
we saw little versions of that

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.220
in many of that towns that --

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.840
and, again, take it out of the
politics, or the mandatory-ness

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.540
of trying to attract
young people to their tow.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.330
Whether it was through artists
and residents, whether it was

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.740
through some kind
of teacher exchange,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.630
or bringing in AmeriCorps
kids, or trying to lure doctors

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.270
to their town by paying for part

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.240
of their medical school
through the state.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.160
We saw some of this in Wyoming,
but getting to the same answer

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.340
from a lot of different
ways was something that --

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.000
that so many people
were voicing.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.940
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
Thank you.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.240
Up here.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.840
My name is Matt Pricket
[assumed spelling].

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.630
I'm from a smaller town
than either of you.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.100
I'm from Homer, Georgia.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.640
You seem to know where that is.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.920
You work for [inaudible] Carter.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.220
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: Yes.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:58.350
&gt;&gt; Most of the stories you've
told about rejuvenation,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.800
Atlanta, resurgence, you know,

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.120
after it burned down,
or whatever.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.650
It was burned down, came back,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.570
and that's been the
story there forever.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.220
The stories you've
shared have been

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.130
about those same
kinds of places.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.680
I'm a recovering
alcoholic and drug addict,

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.320
and my recovery depended

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.350
on hitting a bottom
place and coming back.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.010
I just celebrated three
dozen years clean and sober.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.920
[ Applause ]

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.820
I didn't do it.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.390
I couldn't do it by myself.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.600
Anyway, do you think that
that's necessary for the kind

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.570
of renewal you're
-- you've seen?

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.610
Big cities like LA,
New York, Washington,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:44.430
I don't think the construction
crane was ever endangered here

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.850
during the financial crisis.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.550
So, how do you feel
about where people have

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.560
to be before they're
willing to come back?

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.220
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: That's another
deep and fascinating question,

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.680
and the short would
be we've seen a number

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.980
of different paths.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.340
One path is some
communities, like some people,

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.640
bottom out and don't recover.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.210
You know, the story of
the US since the time

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.510
of the Civil War is a lot

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.080
of really small communities
just have gone away,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.820
because some are just too small.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.260
There are some communities that,
as you say, they need a crisis

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.560
to get their attention.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.960
San Bernardino has been in
sort of perpetual crisis,

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.800
and they are coming back
now and in a slow way.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.280
Erie is in the middle
of doing that right now.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.060
There are other places we
saw that were able to sort

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.060
of anticipate their crisis, and
I put Greenville, South Carolina

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.360
at the top of that list.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.200
They saw 25 years ago that
textiles, which were most

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.550
of their economy were going
to be none of their economy,

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.850
which is the case now.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.260
And, they were able to sort of
get ahead of the curve there,

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.460
so I think that as with
human beings there are these

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.760
different paths.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.060
For some people it's
a healthy tonic.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.360
For some it's too much.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.660
Some people can avoid it.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.960
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: I think
I'm going to have to wrap it up,

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.560
so time for one more question.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.860
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: Yeah.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.300
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm visiting here
from Orlando, Florida,

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.860
and I've been a nurse and nurse
practitioner for 40 years,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.620
and I was wondering if you
had an opportunity to talk

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.760
to doctors, hospital
administrators, nurses,

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.870
in the locations you went?

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.280
And, what healthcare
is like out there?

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.580
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: I'm
going to talk about --

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.070
so, so I'll just answer
briefly and give it to Deb.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.130
So, obviously healthcare is a
very important part both of life

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.710
and of the economy in many
of these places, in good ways

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.930
and in troubling ways
on budgetary issues.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.000
And, also in drug treatment,
so yes we tried to spend a lot

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.340
of time learning about
the healthcare situation.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.960
You can talk maybe about, "Hell,
it was just one illustration."

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.560
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: The
rural, very hard word to say,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.280
healthcare situation was
the most dramatic to.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.080
In a town like Ajo there was one
clinic that had to be prepared

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.270
for everything from, no
kidding, Ebola outbreaks,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:53.190
to electricity shortages
or cutoffs.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.160
And, everyone in that town
was worried about what happens

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.250
when the one doctor retires,

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.310
or the one nurse
practitioner retires?

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.890
How are we going to get
somebody else back to that town?

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.310
And, it's a serious
issue, because it's --

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:10.740
well, it's the major health
resource for the whole town.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.400
Nearest hospital 80 miles away.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.160
A lot of things like prenatal
care just don't exist.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.820
It -- it -- it's in jeopardy,
and you basically don't live

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.680
in that town if you
have some health issues

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.980
that you're worried about.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.250
So, we saw people
struggling over it

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.490
and working the system
every way they could to try

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.620
to get more support for their
clinics and healthcare services.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:43.180
On the good side we also saw so
many nursing programs where men

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.390
and women saw this as
a professional career

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:51.570
that they could access, and
would give them a reliable,

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.320
strong, worthy profession.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.920
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
Thank you.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.450
Before concluding I just want
to highlight the fact that Jim

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:01.680
and Deb are going to be signing
copies of their book at 2:30.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.170
Locations are post
throughout the building.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.860
Any concluding thought
before we thank you?

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.950
&gt;&gt; James Fallows: We're so
grateful for your attention

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.430
and for your wonderful
questions.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.150
For all of your questions,
so thank you.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.450
It's a real honor to be here.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.750
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
Thank you.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.050
&gt;&gt; Deborah Fallows: Thank you.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.850
&gt;&gt; Carlos Diaz-Rosillo:
Thank you.
