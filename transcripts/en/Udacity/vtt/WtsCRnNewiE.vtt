00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's take a look at
a few code snippets.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.990
And I want you to tell me if you
think they're responsive or not.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.150
Which of these elements, will work
well within a responsive layout?

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.320
In other words which of these elements
could look great on any device?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.460
If you're not sure about a code snippet.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.960
Open it up in a browser and
see what happens.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.560
Make sure you test on
several different devices.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560
When you're done,
check the check boxes for

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.010
the ones that you think are responsive
