00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.140
SUBJECT 1: Let me
start out by saying

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.206
this isn't an oil
painting, nor is

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:06.510
it a work of stained glass art.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.240
This is a photograph of
rice fields in rural China

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.870
during what can only be one of
the most beautiful sunsets I've

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.150
ever seen.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.170
This is definitely a
different side of China

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.170
than I'm used to seeing.

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:23.340
THIERRY BORNIER: Hi.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.410
My name is Thierry Bornier.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm a French photographer--
specialist of China Iandscape.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.670
I captured this image
in China Yunnan Province

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.325
in the country of Tuantang
in February, 19, 2014.

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:37.700
SUBJECT 1: You
may not have heard

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.330
of the remote Chinese
county of Tuantang,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.890
but it's famous for
pictures like these.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.610
Photographers flock to
this area to capture images

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.470
of these terraced rice fields.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.400
Farmers builds steps into the
sides of mountains or hills

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.280
in order to take advantage of
the otherwise un-farmable land.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.070
This system helps
catch rainwater

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.550
that helps keep the
nutrients in soil.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.979
And the resulting
landscape is breathtaking.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.020
THIERRY BORNIER: This
image is about a rice field

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.980
in Yuangyang, the
biggest one in China.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670
I was very lucky because
the mood of the sky perfect.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.520
Harmony between
clouds and sunset.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.270
To give the final mood
of "God's Palette."

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.650
SUBJECT 1: And China is
full of beautiful landscapes

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.680
like these.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.310
Many times when
you hear of China,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.640
it's about its major cities,
polluted and overcrowded.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.250
But there is a wild China, full
of amazing, natural wonders

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.040
and stunning panoramas.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.390
You can travel to see wild
pandas, tigers, monkeys,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.560
and wolves.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.070
Experience stunning mountains,
rivers, lakes, national parks,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.290
and of course, rice fields.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.430
THIERRY BORNIER: When I
take image about landscape,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.820
I'm very concerned
about the future.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270
It's why I try to
capture them the most

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.290
authentic with the best
scenario of lighting

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.200
to be sure they will never
be forgotten from our memory.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.680
We live in the world where
climate change and modernists

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.880
make them disappear
step by step.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.240
It's a huge beautiful
country full of diversity.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.550
And so exciting
because I can always

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.490
meet new people from
a different ethnic

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.560
and with different culture,
including dialect and food,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960
as example.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.330
But when I arrive
in a magic place

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.860
I know I need to stay
there as long as I need.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.120
I am so happy to
have found my passion

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.931
and to be free to do
what I want in my life.

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:26.680
SUBJECT 1: Want more
that's happened here?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.580
Check out this episode on
these mysterious toxic pools

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.170
you can only see from a plane.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.940
SUBJECT 2: These
uniquely colored pools

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.820
sitting in what looks like
the literal middle of nowhere

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.282
are no doubt strange, but
they're also somewhat familiar.

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:40.990
SUBJECT 1: And don't
forget to subscribe.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.050
Thanks for watching.
