1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.720
Okay.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.740
It's Bill Burr it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:09.700
September 17th,

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.750
2018 how's it going?
How are you?
What's up with you?

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.940
Um,
how was your football Sunday?
I know what's going on with me.

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.170
I felt like I had a cold.
Now I don't know what I have.
And,
uh,
my wife's like,

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.220
well,
maybe you have allergies.
It's like,
I don't have allergies.

9
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.640
I've never had allergies in my life.
And she's just like,
well,

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.690
sometimes there's,
there's late onset allergies.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
So she's got me thinking I have allergies.
I never,
you know,

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.670
I thought allergies for like,
people who had like inferior DNA,
you know,

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:47.700
just like weak people,
you know,

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.180
like the kind of puppy that the mother big knorrs and just let you die.

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.210
It doesn't let it,
let it get any milk,
you know?

16
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.400
But we're human beings and everybody's special.

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400
So you keep these people going and then they just walk around constant state of

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:06.180
like,
you know,
listening to the nasally voices.
Oh my God.

19
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:08.940
Did somebody eat lobster in the last month?

20
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.840
And then you got to like fucking vaccinate your house,
whatever it is,

21
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.160
d fumigate your house because somebody with allergies comes by

22
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.240
know.
But evidently I'm one of those people,
you know,

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.280
my mom should have ignored me.
Who Knew?

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.090
Who knew I maybe I have late onset.

25
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.850
Who the fuck gets allergies at 50?

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.560
You what's funny about all your other nonmedical people out there right now?

27
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.590
What are you doing?
You listen to this podcast and now you're googling the shit,

28
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.860
right?
Everybody's just a dick to them.
I couldn't get the answer right now,

29
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.650
you know?
Do you ever,
do you ever consider the source,

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.310
not to mention the,
the,
the,
the,
the fucking guy who's a,

31
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.930
you know,
looking for the information,

32
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.250
being you not having a fucking medical degree.
All of a sudden you're,

33
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.890
you're like some doctor.
I do it all the time.

34
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:06.380
That's why I got a nutritionist because I was trying to learn about food.

35
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:10.940
I just couldn't figure it out.
And everybody just,
you know,

36
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.510
at a conflicting opinion,
it was like this Guy Damn,
uh,

37
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160
feminists and uh,
the guys with the date rape drug,

38
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.810
they just can't seem to get on the same page.
No,

39
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.880
it's like Democrats,
Republicans,
you know what I mean?

40
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.060
They all agree on what the problems are.

41
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.050
They just sitting there pointing fingers at each other.
These fucking people in,

42
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.400
in the food industry,
it's the same thing.
You know,

43
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.780
I got the fucking giants cowboys game on and there's some fucking asshole.

44
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.410
He literally is sitting on the field at a little too top table.

45
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.720
How much of those tickets,

46
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.900
these guys are running around fucking smashing their brains out,
right?

47
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.780
And that's an incomplete pass.
And they,
the guy puts his hands up like,

48
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:55.380
where's the flag sitting there?
Like fucking Julius.

49
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.630
What does he see?
A high ranking official at that,
the,

50
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.030
the Home Depot corporate office.

51
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.540
You mentioned like the jobs that we have nowadays.

52
00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:13.070
Can you fucking imagine if you just met people from the past and they're just

53
00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:16.650
looking at you like you do what,
what do you do?

54
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.980
And we'd all be saying this shit.
And then just be like,

55
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.470
they would all be just looking at it.
You don't do anything

56
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.200
and your wife does.
She was like,

57
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.220
the whole fucking nothing would make sense.
You know?

58
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.490
I wonder if it's going to be like in a hundred years,
like we can actually,

59
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.710
you know,
if we were still around a couple of hundred years,

60
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.240
we could just fucking look down on people and what their jobs are because robots

61
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.720
are now fucking,
I dunno,
entering data.
I Dunno people.

62
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.880
I don't pretend to understand.

63
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.850
But how did you guys in shambles your second week of football?

64
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.010
Mine was a,
you know,
I mean,
we lost,
it wasn't that big a deal though.

65
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.150
Everyone's gonna make a big deal.
I know.
Edelman's not back yet.

66
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.220
The second week of the fucking season,
you know,
you know what?
What do you,

67
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.860
what do you know?
Why?
What the fuck you can't go fucking Jacksonville.

68
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.050
They're all going to be fucking freaking out.
Oh my God,

69
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.430
we finally beat the Patriots.
Does this mean we win the Super Bowl?
Right?

70
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:19.630
That's what everybody does.
Everybody gets all fucking excited.
Like,
you know,

71
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.290
when you watch an action movie,
you know the Rambo Guy,

72
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.860
is he freaking out now the Chuck Norris Freak out.
Now,
you know,

73
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:31.840
freaks out the guy who's going to fucking die that suits everybody.
Relax.

74
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.090
You know,
jets fans.

75
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.390
How many times are you going to get the ego to let the Lazy New York sports

76
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.850
media fucking gas up another guy?

77
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.620
All right.
He said to fucking solid weeks.
He's gone.
One and one.

78
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.040
He's throwing for 300 yards.
Whatever.
Fucking uh,
both weeks.

79
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.800
Very impressive.
You know,

80
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:58.060
but you don't become a legend in September.

81
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.660
I know you're hopeful.
I mean,
even the firemen came back.
What?

82
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.480
Where did he come back?
You guys were such conch.

83
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.090
You know what the fuck is wrong?
The jet fans steed,
they chased a fireman.

84
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.870
How long have you cursed for post nine 11 in New York,

85
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.250
you chased a fireman out of your own fucking stadium and you got the balls to

86
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:28.030
think that a couple of decent weeks of football.

87
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.890
Then all of a sudden you're walking down the street talking to the camera,
talk,

88
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.210
calling out Tom Brady,
Tom Brady,
the man,

89
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.310
you guys all we all wanted to be Tom Brady.

90
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.230
We all want to be good looking be the quarterback barriers supermodel.

91
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.390
Have a nice fucking dimple in our chin.
Full head of fucking hair.

92
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.460
Mary and I already said that part right?
Fucking white.

93
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.310
When five fucking super bowls,

94
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.050
get a respectful fucking nod from Montana's.

95
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.560
You're putting on your yellow fucking jacket,
right?

96
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.480
We all wanted that.
All right,

97
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.921
well guess what?

98
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:12.700
Despite all these fucking Instagram accounts out there that are telling you,

99
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:17.701
you can do a then you want everybody's fucking specially reality is there's only

100
00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:20.980
one Tom Brady.
All right,

101
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.520
so are you green couch down there?
I'm happy for you.

102
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.940
I'm happy that you're excited,
but you might want to reel it in a little bit.

103
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.050
You know you have to have a friend of yours every time he fucking made to check.

104
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:35.970
He thinks that's the one
you know and you just go lock.

105
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.350
I'm about to pick this guy up off the fucking Matt again.

106
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.560
How many times can I sit across from,
you should cry it and you fucking beer.

107
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.220
All right.
What are you just going to fuck a broad and move on?

108
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.420
That's the problem.
These jets fans,
they're fucking romantics.

109
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.460
Oh,
they fell as he live right there.
Let's see.
I know.

110
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:03.750
Thrown for a touchdown with a minute.
I have left too little too late.
You know,

111
00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:05.310
they probably let them go right down the field.

112
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.360
<v 1>I love listening to spa.
People flip out this time of year.
You know I'm,</v>

114
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.830
I'm actually,
okay.
I'm taping this Sunday night.
All right.

115
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.270
I'm going to predict.
Let me just get to go around the league.

116
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.240
Look at the scores here,

117
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.000
and I'm going to predict the fucking overhyping me with my fucking 50 year old

118
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.780
allergies.
I have allergies.
I can't,
there's no Fido.
I won't allow it.

119
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.280
Very have a varicose vein.
I can't,
I can't fucking compound that with an allergy.

120
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.843
<v 3>MMM.</v>

121
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.300
<v 1>Anyways,
when I had it right here,
I had the NFL scores,
didn't I?</v>

122
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.380
Isn't that what happened now?
Now why wouldn't you go for two there

123
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.310
then you're really doubt by nine.
That's just three.

124
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.650
Three drives with three field goals you could get back in.

125
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:54.440
This came with the mid 28 left and we each got to.

126
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:58.330
How are you gonna have to fucking questions to answer after this game by people

127
00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:59.770
who never got picked in gym class.

128
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.213
<v 3>MMM.</v>

129
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.110
<v 1>All right,
let's go around the league.
Here we go.
The scores here.
All right.</v>

130
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.900
This is what,
this is what my predictions are going to be.
All right.

131
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.780
The chiefs I made,
I'll tell you right now,

132
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.000
I see a lot of people the duly,
what does Patrick,
my home age,

133
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.200
however you say his new homes.
I mean dish guy.

134
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.060
If he keeps this shop

135
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.270
kg shitty will be undefeated.
Yeah,
they were.

136
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.060
When you first Superbowl Superbowl for

137
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.680
Ed Patrick Coho days is going to have the greatest season ever read the history

138
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.560
of the NFL.
I do have to tell you though,
if Patrick,

139
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.950
my homeys what my homes was fucking doing this shit for the jets or anywhere in

140
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:46.760
New York.
Good Lord,

141
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.870
they would have declared a fucking state of emergency on side.
Kick the giants.

142
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:55.580
Get the ball.
Look at this.
Here we go cowboys ago.

143
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.320
There's still not enough.
I can time lift.
Um,

144
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.980
but this is when you as a gambling man,
you like,
this is fucking fixed,
right?

145
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:06.660
Flipping out.
Although I think the jokes were favored by wrong.
I have no idea.
Um,

146
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.300
<v 0>okay.</v>

147
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.170
<v 1>They're going to fucking sit there and freak the fuck out.
Uh,</v>

148
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.410
Ryan Fitzpatrick,
I obeyed your pocket.
Is Jesus fucking Christ?
Get to it.
Oh,

149
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:22.411
the first job since fucking 2014 is this going to be their year?

150
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.600
I don't know shit about anything at this point.

151
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:29.420
All I could say about the bucket ears is there too.
And Oh,

152
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.170
they've scored 75 points and they've led up 61.

153
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.530
All right.
40 of those fucking points where the goddamned sates.

154
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.120
So you know,
I dunno,
you know,
you know,
you know,

155
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.080
fucking wind games,
48 40 and shit like that in the,
uh,

156
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.490
in the playoffs.
So I would be relaxed with them.
You know who,

157
00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:56.090
obviously the most impressive team in the league has gotta be the fucking ramps.

158
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.480
This scored 67 points and only let up 13.

159
00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:04.540
I know they played the fucking Raiders day bucket.
They could day,

160
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:08.170
but they did what they were supposed to do.
They beat the shit out of him

161
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.790
after all locked Gloucester first fucking half a Jaguar's looked good though.

162
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.500
Good.
Anytime he got Tom Kaufland anywhere near it,
you're going to win.

163
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.260
They look good.
Uh,
patriots,
you know,
who knows.
I Dunno.
Maybe

164
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.250
we'll see.
We'll see what happens with Edelman comes back.

165
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:31.130
We had a couple of fucking injuries I don't believe are the dolphins,

166
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.870
even though they're 2.0 I feel bad for the bills.
Uh,
the chiefs,

167
00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:37.070
God knows the chiefs,

168
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:41.870
the chiefs love nothing more than fucking fucking stroke and their fans,

169
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.880
it's September.
We'll the Fed's finally get to bust and not come play off time.

170
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.380
Or were they once again go home with fucking blue balls.
Okay.

171
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.860
Um,
what else?
I think that's fucking it.

172
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.480
Most of the little packers are,
I liked the packers.
I like the rims.

173
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.310
And then I liked the direction the Jaguars are going in and the chiefs,

174
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.000
I just too many fucking times they did it last year.

175
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.630
Everybody gets all fucking excited and

176
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.990
[inaudible] and the holidays come of log in right there.

177
00:11:16.991 --> 00:11:20.800
They all start dressing up like fucking date of Americans,
you know,

178
00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:24.580
the too much pumpkin bread and then the digit shit,
the bed and fucking November.

179
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.260
I have no idea.

180
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.360
And basically I'm judging the entire franchise and what they'd done in the past,

181
00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:31.270
even though they probably have brand new personnel.
I still believe,

182
00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:32.710
I still believe in John Ruetten

183
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:39.130
despite all these people that you get g g is it all Getty tied for concern?

184
00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:43.550
I mean if they go,
only three is John Cruden on the hot seat.
See,

185
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.290
uh,
I know they were waiting all day today and then they lost in the end.

186
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:53.291
But this is a fucking franchise that has been fucking lost at sea for a long

187
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:58.320
time.
I've been impressed with John Cruden played a great,
they,

188
00:11:58.321 --> 00:12:01.470
his team played a great first half against the best team in the league,

189
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.880
I think the fucking rams.

190
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.630
<v 3>MMM.</v>

191
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.720
<v 1>Oh,
the most impressive teams so far.
And uh,
you know,</v>

192
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.880
play damn good against the Broncos.
Not good enough,
long enough or whatever.

193
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.580
I still believe in this guy.
So they had today's my two sets.

194
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.440
There's my fucking white noise,

195
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.350
no pun intended to a lie goes DP,
ah,

196
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.800
and complete.
Um,

197
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.680
you know what they said when I was watching the Patriots game,

198
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.453
<v 3>uh,</v>

199
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.100
<v 1>what's his face there?
Tony Robot,
another fucking gem.</v>

200
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.140
Another gem.
Like he just like every,
it's like the psycho flying.

201
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.000
Every time you fly you learn something.
Right?

202
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.320
Every time you listen to a game it Tony Romo is,
is doing the color.

203
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:51.050
You fucking learned something.
He,
there was a guy in the Jaguars,

204
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.150
he had our guy beat,
Eddie was running along.
There was,
you know,

205
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.780
Burt along the sideline when to be call that fucking pattern and he was right on

206
00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:04.781
the sideline and Tony said if he ran two yards more in like more towards the

207
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.530
field,
it's such an easier throw for the quarterback.

208
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:13.180
He said he actually ran the root wrong.

209
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.060
And I don't know if he got forced outside,
but just,
you know,

210
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.730
totally is also gonna sub side with the fucking quarterback.

211
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:20.380
But it was so fucking interesting.
Oh yeah.

212
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.860
Because then he can maybe throw to the outside of the shoulder.

213
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.680
That case still has a step or a step and a half to adjust to the ball.

214
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.680
If you just run right on the sideline,

215
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.400
the fucking guys like a half step behind you.

216
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.380
Now he has to throw a goddamn strike.

217
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.050
What is the Eli Manning and the the fucking last drive of a super bowl.
Uh,

218
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.190
all right,
enough of that fucking talk.
Uh,
it's still really early.
Um,

219
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.190
I called the my bookie people,
I pick the Jaguars.

220
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.173
<v 3>MMM.</v>

221
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.160
<v 1>I talked to Paul Versey.</v>

222
00:13:52.161 --> 00:13:57.161
I picked the lions is lock of the week was San Francisco and I was like,

223
00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:02.660
I don't think,
I don't think the fucking lines are as bad as that first game.

224
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:05.420
That's the thing when you shit the bed the first fucking week,

225
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.300
cause you gotta have a game where you just suck

226
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.620
when he is 60 games just going to come out flight.

227
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:13.600
You're just gonna fucking suck.
Right.

228
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.910
But when it happens the first week of the year,

229
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.710
everybody looks like it's just what they're going to do all year round you up

230
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.860
and we get you got you made your point.
All right.
Whatever.

231
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.023
<v 3>MMM.</v>

232
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.170
<v 1>I picked the giants.</v>

233
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.290
I'm going to lose this one and I had one other one I think I went to and one I

234
00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:31.440
went to and one the first week with my book and I think it went to one this
week.

235
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.220
Um,
I call him in every week and call the sports gambling podcasts or not.

236
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.210
I give you my pics,

237
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.063
<v 3>uh,</v>

238
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.650
<v 1>in my locker.</v>

239
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.270
The week was that somebody was going to get fired for criticizing the,

240
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.170
the woman that did the play by play and I was fucking wrong.

241
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.430
I thought someone was going to do,

242
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.820
someone was going to fucking jump on that fish hook and that was going to be at,

243
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.610
um,
anyways,

244
00:14:55.611 --> 00:15:00.170
congratulations to frank or passing Curtis Martin very quietly.

245
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.660
The guy's forth all time.

246
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.690
I don't know if you get to see too many more of these guys,

247
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:08.870
the way they fucking throw handoffs now.
Uh,

248
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.420
the only people in front of them now is Walter Payton,

249
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:13.940
Barry Sanders and I at Smith.

250
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.810
And I don't think anybody's ever going to catch em at the way the game has

251
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:21.200
changed.
Uh,
and that's it.

252
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.740
There you go.
There's my,

253
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.940
there's my fucking take all the whole fucking thing for this week.

254
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.770
All right.
How long,
how long did that burn up?

255
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.760
15 and a half minutes of your life that you never got to get back.

256
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.460
Um,
all right.
This weekend I am scheduled to be out in Virginia.

257
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:45.110
I think those gigs will be good.
Uh,
and then I'm in South Carolina.

258
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.090
I haven't been keeping up too much on the hurricane.
I just keep seeing.
Yeah.

259
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:53.150
I hate to see,
you know,
who the fuck wants to watch people losing their houses?

260
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.180
I don't get,
why do I want to watch that?

261
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.390
We'll save it.
Hurricane Florence,
hurricane Fitzpatrick,

262
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.113
Hurricane Florence,

263
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.770
hurricane flo Jo,
Hurricane Florence.

264
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.290
Florence wreaks havoc in north and South Carolina.
All right,
so Virginia's okay.

265
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.600
So I got two gigs there.
Now,

266
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:22.310
this is the hardest thing after a hurricane happens,

267
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.890
is who do you give your money to?

268
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.930
You know what I mean?
I do.

269
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.940
I make sure the money that I'm going to donate gets to the right fucking gets to

270
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:38.300
that person of seed on TV.
By the way,
you see all these people getting rescued,

271
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:41.630
all those old people,
people in wheelchairs,
fucking broke ass people.

272
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:44.090
That's what I was talking about.
People who do you get the fuck out of there?

273
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.100
A lot of them can't.
Lot of them can.
Um,
Oh man,

274
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:51.380
look at that.
Jesus fucking Christ.

275
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.670
Do you see that thing that Rogan fucking posted on uh,
Instagram?

276
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.863
Who that guy was,

277
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.720
he was doing this weird thing was he's trying to act like he was leaning into

278
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:01.100
the wind and it just didn't look real.

279
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.130
And then two people walk by in the background,
like totally normal.

280
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.150
I love when that fucking outfits the best.

281
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:13.130
Whatever's where the guy was in the boat and then people just walked by.
Uh,

282
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.890
and then what are you going to do with it at that point?

283
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:17.360
Is he gonna get out of the boat?

284
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.900
I like the camera man to how he zoomed into the gay,

285
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:26.030
tried to do a solid must be his drinking buddy or something like that.
Uh,

286
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.050
so anyways,
alright,
well,
Hurricane Florida,
hopefully,
uh,

287
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.350
the waters will recede at an event.
I don't want,

288
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.240
I don't know.

289
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.690
I got checked with my agent to see if the South Carolina was still going on.

290
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.360
Jesus Christ.

291
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.950
I wonder if those fucking bankers that main off all that fucking money offer

292
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.570
those people in that you'll watch them lose their house if there's even there.

293
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.890
You know,
there's not an ounce of fucking guilt too.
Yeah,
yeah.
You,
you did that.

294
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.790
If they don't give a fuck,
they don't give a fuck.

295
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:00.780
Here we are going after fucking isis where these fat fucking cons.

296
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.110
Who fucked everybody?
Their own countrymen.

297
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.270
At least isis has the decency to go after people that had that,

298
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.550
that aren't their own countrymen,
these fucking bankers that God,

299
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.830
they're committed treason.

300
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.930
I don't know much about the world,

301
00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.630
but I believe if you did what they did here in Southeast Asia,

302
00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:22.640
you get put to death.
What are those fucking countries?

303
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.643
<v 3>Uh,</v>

304
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.870
<v 1>who the fuck is the coach of the giants?</v>

305
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.760
Did they get rid of that fucking fat guy?

306
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.110
That guy who looked like they just took them out of the fucking mezzanine level.

307
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.653
<v 3>Uh,</v>

308
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.920
<v 1>wait a second.
Did they get rid of that guy?</v>

309
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.510
Giant's head coach.
All right,
let's see.
Oh,

310
00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:52.440
he is.
Ah,
why does it always go to Wikipedia now?

311
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.700
All right.
Wait a second.

312
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.350
Tom carper that they had Bob Mcadoo,

313
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.620
Ben Mcadoo and they were like,
Ben Mecca,
don't get the fuck out of here.
Sorry.

314
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.960
Then Steve Spag a new low,
eh,

315
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.350
he was the interim coach and now they got pat show

316
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.610
that shoe,
it looks like a winter.
He would go there fucking open toe.

317
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.020
Gotta love it.
Older guy that keeps himself in shape,
you know,

318
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:33.510
now here he doesn't have fucking white hair.
I Dunno who he was.

319
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:35.670
I don't know who fucking guy was anyone's that's going to get on with the

320
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:37.980
podcast here.
Um,

321
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.460
I didn't do shit this week and I'm such a fucking weird weekend.

322
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:45.390
I thought I was going to be on the road and then Mother Nature Cape fucking

323
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.900
scream it in.
Is that going to be another hurricane behind this one?

324
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.070
Over that parade of horrors last year,
like fucking 20,

325
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.390
20 hurricanes that are rob spice feminist.
They'd get upset by that,
you know,

326
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.760
<v 4>to constantly name them by women's names insinuates that we cause problems</v>

327
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.680
in men's lives.

328
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.630
<v 1>Um,
I don't even know what to fucking say.
No,
I actually did a Gig the other day.</v>

329
00:20:13.631 --> 00:20:14.101
I did a,

330
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:19.101
a benefit Thursday night the last time I was on stage and uh,

331
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.690
you know,
I gotta be honest.
It was one of these,
you know,

332
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.990
they had like a red carpet and all this shit and I was just,

333
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.790
I saw some of the people,
I was like,
Oh man,

334
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.240
I got go fucking Bob on this one.

335
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.060
It was the exact opposite.

336
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.600
That's like one of the hardest I've ever gone on stage and recent fucking memory

337
00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:40.480
as far as like,
fuck it,
I'm going to say this fucking,
I'm going to say that.

338
00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:44.320
And it went great and everybody was flipping out.
Fuck it.
Enjoying it.
Laughing

339
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.470
budget.
Women came up to be meaning for saying how fun did they thought it was.

340
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.950
And I gotta be honest with you,
I think the same way

341
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.510
the mass media misread this last election,

342
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.100
they are misreading

343
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.770
where like people's idea of what is funny and what isn't.

344
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.030
Because I was in Hollywood people,
liberal ground,

345
00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:14.900
fucking zero and all those jokes killed and everybody thought it was funny and I

346
00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:16.680
was sitting there,
you know,
after every other fucking,
yeah.

347
00:21:16.681 --> 00:21:18.350
Was that the one that's gonna to get me in trouble?

348
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.090
Is this the fucking [inaudible]?
Am I going to have to fucking,
you know,

349
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.450
it's fucking unbelievable now.
Yeah.

350
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.780
Like you can't even have like an opinion.

351
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.750
That's what kills me is that that you did something.

352
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.620
If you just have an opinion that does not agree with them,

353
00:21:37.621 --> 00:21:41.460
then all of a sudden you have to go on TV and you have to fucking apologize.

354
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.630
I,
I don't,
I don't know.
This is it.

355
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.230
I really feel that they're going to make a movie about this era.
It,

356
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.710
it's going to be like,
uh,
the red scare.

357
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:57.770
Like McCarthyism meets like fucking my space or something.

358
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.710
Who's going to be in it?
You know,
whether they should.

359
00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:06.711
People consider how many more innocent men are we gonna let suffer?

360
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.660
Well,
don't try to say you can't say anything.
Oh my God.
What is this guy wearing?

361
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.700
His wearing a fucking sports bra.

362
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.650
I am watching the Dallas cowboys right now in this guy just came out wearing a

363
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.513
fucking,

364
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.800
I have shirt slash sports bra from the fucking 1980s.

365
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.610
Did he steal that from one of the cheerleaders?

366
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.340
It's not even a half shirt.
He's,
it's a bra.
He's covering his,
his mail.

367
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.050
Pictorials yeah.

368
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.843
<v 3>MMM.</v>

369
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.090
<v 1>There's
Zubin Way Zach Prescott.
Right.</v>

370
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.480
And then you know what's going to happen.
There's gotta be a bunch of people who,

371
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.190
uh,
like to wear a male sports bras that are going to be offended.
It'd be like,

372
00:22:56.191 --> 00:23:00.570
why did you zoom in on his madly beard when you could've showed this other guy

373
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:05.340
who's essentially dressed like a spice girl?
Oh my God.

374
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.660
Ah,
God bless them.
I'd love to be that fucking ripped.

375
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.540
I don't know if there was ever a point in my life,

376
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:19.380
I could fucking pull off what this guy's pulling off.
Holy fucking shit.

377
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.500
Oh my God.
God bless him.
God bless him.
Uh,

378
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.720
anyways,
I really am old.
I'm an old man now.
Christ.
What are these kids where it,

379
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.030
you know,
I actually,

380
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:38.410
I should be in full support of this cause we wore have shirts in the 80s.

381
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.860
I never had the nerve to where one outside of the house.

382
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.803
<v 3>Um,</v>

383
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.680
<v 1>yeah,
no,
I was just too pasty.
I never thought I had fucking abs enough to do it.</v>

384
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:51.514
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

385
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.163
<v 3>And uh,</v>

386
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:54.551
<v 1>I didn't,
you know,</v>

387
00:23:54.551 --> 00:23:58.960
a few things I never thought would come back half shirts and fucking Larry Bird

388
00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:02.350
short shorts and they are back with the fucking vengeance.

389
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

390
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.750
<v 1>It really is.
Does anybody look worse than a fucking football helmet?</v>

391
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:10.070
They need lie Matick I mean,

392
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.600
he's first ballot hall of fame quarterback and first ballot hall of fame.
Like,

393
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.590
I don't know.
How much more does that guy have to win before you,
you,
you like,

394
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.580
you could look at him wearing a helmet.
There's just something about it.

395
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:26.750
He looks like he's sitting between two fucking muscular people on a plane.

396
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:30.260
He like,
he got the middle seat,
the shoulders or motion,
his face together.

397
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.690
<v 3>MMM.</v>

398
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.880
<v 1>I got a lot of balls considering the way I fucking look.
Huh.
Anyways.</v>

399
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.830
Anyways,
I fucking ran out of batteries.

400
00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:42.420
You wouldn't know because I just said anyways,

401
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.980
cause it magically ended with me saying anyways.
But I did,
I just did.

402
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.340
I just said like another 10 minutes of the podcast after.
Okay.

403
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.650
I was talking about Eli sitting between two muscular guys on a fucking plane and

404
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.020
uh,
I dunno,
you know,
I got to read these.
God Damn,

405
00:24:56.021 --> 00:24:59.800
I gotta read the fucking advertising against.
So no,
this all right.

406
00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:02.710
This is my second.
I've already read these one time,

407
00:25:02.711 --> 00:25:07.180
so I should breeze through these.
I should breeze through these.

408
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.290
Um,
anyways,
my bookie.
Yeah,

409
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.820
that cricket is a loud ass.
Fucking cricket was,

410
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.720
maybe that's the amount of people leaving the podcast at this point.

411
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.820
I have no idea.
My bookie,
uh,
you know,

412
00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:25.000
ever since I started this podcast,

413
00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:28.600
people have been asking for my advice,
asked me,
you know,

414
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.650
ask me what team do I bet on?
The truth is,
I don't know who's got a win.

415
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.700
That's the truce piece of advertising that's ever been written for me to say.

416
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.470
I don't know who's going to win,
but if you think,
you know,

417
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.480
you got to check out my bookie,
okay.

418
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.560
Remember who you're betting on is just as important as who you bet in with.

419
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.040
That's why this fucking crickets going to drive me crazy.

420
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.060
That's why I always tell people to bet with my bookie.
Do I,
I guess I do.

421
00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:57.010
According to the copy.
Trust me guys,
they are your best bet this season.
Uh,

422
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.440
they'd been in business for years.
Um,

423
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.650
have great reviews online and their mobile site is easy to use.

424
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.490
Listen to that cricket start and get his fucking bed in for the Thursday

425
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:10.990
afternoon,
Thursday night gig.
My bookie,
you when they pay.

426
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.240
So like these other plugin bookies were you when you pay,

427
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.710
listen,
if you,
when they pay,
if you lose,
you have to pay.
Don't ever forget that.

428
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.633

<v 3>Yeah.</v>

571
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.940
<v 1>Like when I was doing on the opiate Anthony Show,
they had a bunch of people out,</v>

572
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.180
listeners that we're fucking smart.
But whenever you did a remote,

573
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.170
the fucking animals that showed up and it's the same fucking thing.

574
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.640
Would politicians go on the road?
You know,

575
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.010
they're running for those primaries and stuff and you just look at the people in

576
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:48.560
the fucking crowd,
you know?

577
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:49.980
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

578
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.920
<v 1>Inherently they gotta [inaudible] they don't have a fucking job.
Right.</v>

579
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:53.760
What are they doing there?

580
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.333
<v 3>Okay,</v>

581
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.270
<v 1>well maybe they're down there cause he needed a job and they believe in that kid</v>

582
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.370
candidate.
Well.
Yeah,
I full just full fucking vote for him.

583
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.680
Then the big time go go fucking

584
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.220
hit the bricks and try to find a job.
Oh,
Bill,

585
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.670
what are you going to stop over simplifying things and actually try to read up

586
00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:17.140
on stuff?
I don't know.

587
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:18.703
<v 3>Okay.</v>

588
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.720
<v 1>Did a lot of the charm of the podcast be gone?
If I did that,</v>

589
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.143
<v 3>you know,</v>

590
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.510
<v 1>is it me or is the sound of that cricket?
Fucking definitely.</v>

591
00:35:30.511 --> 00:35:32.970
It's like it's in here.
It's like,

592
00:35:32.971 --> 00:35:36.930
it's slowly sneaking up on me to fucking,

593
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.020
you know,
is that the latest?
Uh Oh my God.

594
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:46.590
Look at that.
Two young kids playing guitar.
Holy Shit.

595
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.110
Did they play the national anthem?
Oh thank God.
There's hope.

596
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.890
There's hope.
They keep playing a Gibson Les Paul,

597
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.710
you spoiled God set up the phone
that's going to save the fuck

598
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.770
the rich kid.
You know,
rich kid goes to the concerts like,

599
00:36:05.771 --> 00:36:08.620
I like that drum kit and the parents go out and buy the exact one.
You know?

600
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.610
Does that kit ever make it

601
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.623
<v 0>okay?</v>

602
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.420
<v 1>Did he ever beat one rich kid that made it?</v>

603
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:24.000
Can you say Donald Trump made it?
You have to,
even though he was rich,

604
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:27.630
he turned the millions into billions and then he,
but he,
he's,

605
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:29.940
he's fucking president of the United States.

606
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.720
No matter how much you hate the guy,
you got a video,
he made it.

607
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.420
He is a fucking American success story.

608
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.990
Like if you were at the track.
Okay.
And you,
I mean,

609
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.880
if he was the odds,
what would the fucking odds,

610
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.530
I can't imagine.
I can't imagine.

611
00:36:50.531 --> 00:36:53.140
I still cannot fucking believe that guy pulled that shit off.

612
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.693
<v 0>Yup.</v>

613
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.450
<v 1>It's like watching Tom Brady throw for 500 yards at a super bowl is still</v>

614
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.550
somehow losing.
Like how does that happen?

615
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.710
All right.
So I've been under the weather the last couple of days,

616
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:09.270
but I stayed on the,
uh,

617
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:15.750
I stayed on the Diet and,
uh,
oh,
do I have a fun,

618
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.780
I have a story,
but I can't tell it right now.
I have to wait.

619
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:23.940
I get a weight of like months from now or I feel like I can tell the fucking

620
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:28.800
story.
But,
uh,
anyways,
I watched that boxing match,

621
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.790
you know,
triple c guy where I don't know any,
I,

622
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.030
I've been away from boxing for so fucking long.

623
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.650
I just got so fed up with how fucking corrupt it was.
Uh,
just getting burned.

624
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.250
Yeah.
On paper views.
You know what I mean?

625
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.220
Like I really feel like Floyd Mayweather,

626
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:51.660
the people that I'm still won't give it up.

627
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.370
How great that guy is.
Like,

628
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.560
it's just a fucking shame that that guy didn't fight Pacquiao in the two

629
00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:00.850
thousands,
you know?

630
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.450
And then we all got taken for a fucking ride when he did and now I'm seeing that

631
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:09.290
he's going to fight him again and
lead.

632
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:11.150
Personally,
I think that guy is undeniably,

633
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.223
<v 0>hm.</v>

634
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.540
<v 1>What are the greatest of all times?
Without a fucking doubt it,</v>

635
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:18.640
but you can't argue that,
but I really think these,

636
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.330
these cash grabs
I,

637
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.330
that just doesn't help be,
it maybe doesn't give a fuck.

638
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:27.663
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

639
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.810
<v 1>Fight and column and Gregor and I,</v>

640
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.030
are you going to fight like fucking packy hour again?
I,

641
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:40.220
but anyways,
but I,
I watched that fight,
couple of fucking warriors.

642
00:38:40.221 --> 00:38:43.430
I came in and went to a party and I saw like the last three rounds of it,

643
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.110
I was like,
fuck,
I wish I saw this whole thing.

644
00:38:45.111 --> 00:38:48.800
But I remember version was giving me shit because they like,
you know,
dude,

645
00:38:48.801 --> 00:38:52.160
I can't get into fucking ever bay.
I really love boxing.

646
00:38:52.161 --> 00:38:55.880
Boxing like so much better and blah blah blah blah blah blah.

647
00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.530
And I have to be a great fucking boxing match

648
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.840
as far as like combat sports.
I still,
you know what,
I have to agree.

649
00:39:06.841 --> 00:39:07.920
I don't think you can touch it

650
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:13.290
and we don't want to like about it because I love MMA.
Fucking love the shit.

651
00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:14.124
But like,

652
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:18.640
like when you watch those like this stand up game in MMA,
it,

653
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:22.310
you can't touch a box.
Now I know all you MMA guys going to flip out.
Yeah,

654
00:39:22.311 --> 00:39:24.470
you put a box on his back and he's done.
I understand that.

655
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.800
But it's the fact that all they do is throw punches.

656
00:39:27.801 --> 00:39:32.020
Like how fucking good they are in boxing.
It's incredible.
Um,

657
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.321
like the,

658
00:39:33.321 --> 00:39:37.580
the level of skill and those guys were just in the center of the ring for the

659
00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:38.250
last three rounds.

660
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:42.770
I would watch it essentially just bang and just beat the shit out of each other.

661
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.290
And I know a lot of people didn't like the,
uh,

662
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.270
the decision and I always go to how corrupt fucking boxing is.

663
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.770
And the thing that I like about the UFC is despite the fact that it's sort of

664
00:39:54.771 --> 00:39:59.771
like apple where it's like this borderline monopoly and uh,

665
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.760
but they can at least,
you know,

666
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:04.520
the best guys fight the best guys for the most part.

667
00:40:04.521 --> 00:40:07.010
I know it's not a perfect system,
but there's not like,
you know,

668
00:40:07.011 --> 00:40:11.510
three different leagues in somebody who has to try and unify the title and all

669
00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:16.220
that Shit.
All right.
For some fucking reason I went to,

670
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:20.550
uh,
I just hit stop against that.
I got three fucking ones.
I got to edit together.

671
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.530
Such an idiot.
Um,
anyways,
yeah.
So is that,
you don't have fucking,

672
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.500
I'll tell this story.
I'm just going to name any names.
I was at this party,
um,

673
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:32.770
one of these like really cool la parties that you hope you get invited to.

674
00:40:32.991 --> 00:40:36.920
And I got invited to it and they had Cuban cigars there,

675
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:40.430
which was fucking incredible.
As a beautiful house,
beautiful house.

676
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.790
And I went into the,
uh,

677
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.880
I went into this room with,
you know,

678
00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:51.710
the TV room they had that they had the boxing match on and I look over and a

679
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:52.490
fucking,

680
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.840
one of the greatest boxers for when I was growing up was there.

681
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.840
And it was fucking hilarious because it was him.

682
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.400
And then just a bunch of regular people like me who didn't fight,
you know,

683
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.720
you know,
ever or whatever,
you know.

684
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.460
So he's sitting there,
so it was like,
you did want to comment,

685
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.930
you didn't want to say anything,

686
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:19.820
but you wanted to say something cause you wanted to show that you knew
something.

687
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.510
It was fucking hilarious.
People would try to be,
everybody was like,

688
00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:28.930
you know,
wanting to say something,
but then kind of like not wanting,

689
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:32.200
it was fucking hilarious.
So I didn't say anything.
I'm like,
I hate to say it.

690
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.350
Fucking shit is no fucking way.
I'm going to be like,
Ugh,
throw left.

691
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:39.820
Fuck his hands are too low.
Why?

692
00:41:39.821 --> 00:41:41.360
Why set it up with the jab?

693
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:46.190
Like I'm going to fucking say that with this champions sitting there.
Right.
So,

694
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:50.450
uh,
my interaction was this tea.
At the end of the fight there was the decision

695
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.880
then this one of the greatest fighters of all time was just,
ah,
man,
come on.

696
00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:59.130
And I just said no.
And he went no.

697
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.880
<v 6>And that was my interaction.
I left the room.
I was like,
all right,</v>

698
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.870
I got my interaction,

699
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.680
<v 1>but there was no fucking way.</v>

700
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

701
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.020
<v 6>There was no fucking way.
I,
I just,
you know,</v>

702
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.950
I just watched the fight and was praying to God.
He would make some comments,

703
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:20.800
which he did a couple of times and it was just like,
oh my God,
this is,

704
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.520
unbelief is on fucking believable.
Uh,

705
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.230
don't ever let anybody have a shit on fucking la.

706
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.470
<v 1>I'm telling you,
you get out here,</v>

707
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.710
<v 6>bust your fucking ass.
And then I'm telling you the fucking people that you meet,</v>

708
00:42:34.711 --> 00:42:37.190
even just for two seconds and you have a one word again,

709
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.170
<v 1>strange.
It's like you gotta be kidding me.</v>

710
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.970
<v 6>I remember a long time ago when I was,</v>

711
00:42:42.971 --> 00:42:46.560
I was just struggling in this business and I was on the fucking,
uh,

712
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.400
the Fox lot.

713
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

714
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.090
<v 6>And uh,</v>

715
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.070
<v 0>yeah,</v>

716
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.850
<v 6>I just bombed some audition and I was just like,
what am I doing out here?</v>

717
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.110
I shouldn't be out here.

718
00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:59.420
I should be in New York trying to get better as a comedian.
It's just,

719
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.920
I just knew this wasn't my road.

720
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.590
So I was walking out and it was all fucking depressed.

721
00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:08.300
And as I was walking across the lot fucking Henry Winkler,

722
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:09.560
this is like 20 years ago,

723
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.010
right around the time he was doing the water boy just came walking by.

724
00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.330
<v 1>Yeah.
I was like,
that was fucking know it was Henry fucking Winkler.</v>

725
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.650
I just got that.
That's how fucking cool is that I am somehow

726
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:28.010
was in his fucking life for like five seconds,

727
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.010
whatever I'm doing leads to meeting that guy

728
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.980
and then like fucking,
I dunno,
20 years after that

729
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.810
bill haters show Barry comes out and next thing you know they want me to

730
00:43:42.811 --> 00:43:45.060
interview the cast that I was fucking sitting there and talking to

731
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.090
Henry Winkler Erie.
It's an incredible place that probably won't be here.

732
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.310
Look,
there's global warming.
I don't know.
Who knows?
I'd say get out here now.

733
00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.570
Why you still can't,
you know,
go down to Miami,

734
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.630
check these places.
These places are going to be,

735
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.190
you're going to be like somebody like,

736
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:10.010
you know when you're all the talking about how you,
you yeah.
Pompei pay.

737
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:13.600
I was there man.
Fuck yeah,

738
00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:17.050
I was there before the waters came up.
I was fucking there.

739
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.640
I did so blow.

740
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:23.410
I got my dick sucked and I had some fucking crab legs.

741
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.190
So if you can say it like an old man
to watch oh,

742
00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.550
chic,
right,
whatever the fuck you'd say.

743
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.230
Like doing blow at that point would probably be like,
you know,
bringing up,

744
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:39.180
doing the one,
two c,
whatever the fuck that was.

745
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:41.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

746
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.140
<v 1>What was that like?
Some sort of minor dance.</v>

747
00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:44.683
<v 0>Okay.</v>

748
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.560
<v 1>You know like what qualified as a fucking day.
Like it is an amazing</v>

749
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:54.580
just how human beings progress creatively.

750
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.830
They like the Charleston,
Charleston child's Dan Badda boom,
boom.

751
00:44:59.831 --> 00:45:02.110
Right.
And now like what?
What,

752
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.520
how well some of these kids can fucking dance just in clubs.

753
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.930
It's like back in the day like Fred Astaire would be asking for a goddamn
lesson.

754
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.510
It's like Odell Beckham

755
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.860
ever since he made that falling backwards while getting interfered with one

756
00:45:20.861 --> 00:45:25.480
handed,
like as far back as you can reach behind your head catch.

757
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.770
Nobody's ever made a catch like that now.

758
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.310
Like I don't know what they're doing that doing this thing with their strength

759
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.390
and their,
their fingers or they are just practicing it.

760
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:38.690
Like the guy in the Jag was did it.
Like I watched that.

761
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.050
The only thing that was as well,
I can't say it was as good as Odell cause it.

762
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.990
That was the first guy to do it.

763
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:47.240
Andy and the big thing was he was getting interfered with while falling down

764
00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:50.410
backwards.
Um,
boost guy just,

765
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.880
he just reached out like those like Spiderman,
just snag the thing,

766
00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.470
then move it around so the defender could knock it out of his hand and like

767
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.470
that's like a,
that's sort of the joy I got him in.

768
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:05.600
It's like the Jordan effect.

769
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.560
Like that shit that you know Colby was doing like by like they all saw Jordan to

770
00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:14.720
it and then they added it to their game cause he's showed the,
hey you,

771
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:21.150
this is possible.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

772
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.320
I'm trying to say some deposited before I try and try and see how great la is

773
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:27.360
and then the back of my head I'm like,
you know it's going to be fucking,

774
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.190
<v 0>yeah,</v>

775
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.150
<v 1>I don't know when it's going to be.</v>

776
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:33.690
All I know is I got a weird feeling that it's going to be all green and it's

777
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.940
going to be raining like the fucking rain forest,
you know,

778
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.670
they said that it's going to be like you get,

779
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.650
it's going to be like weird weather.
I think it's going to be just everything,

780
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:44.370
like whatever.
It used to be like the east coast is going to get all fucking hot.

781
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:47.400
It's going to be a Goddamn desert.
And then out here is going to be like lush.

782
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.810
I don't think it's going to eaten lunch land.

783
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.720
That's just wishful fucking thinking.

784
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.380
I Dunno who the fuck knows who the fuck are.

785
00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.930
They've always spent saying that we're going to fall into the goddamn emotion

786
00:46:57.931 --> 00:47:01.290
and all that shit.
Um,
do you guys watch any of that college football?

787
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:05.730
What a fucking weekend.
You know what,
when I went out to go to that party,

788
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.460
uh,
I could feel that Ohio state Tcu game was gay,

789
00:47:09.461 --> 00:47:12.180
was I knew I was leaving early and I had,

790
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:15.390
so I think I missed the game of the year so far.
Um,

791
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:21.540
and by the way,
uh,
Oh,

792
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.340
before I move on to the next game,
Tcu,
by the way,

793
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.920
how quickly are they on their way to probation?
You know,

794
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.100
I don't get these guys.

795
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.590
<v 6>These guys came out of nowhere.
They were great and then they fell off,</v>

796
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:34.390
which you see now all of a sudden they're great again

797
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.730
and a Texas and it's three letters,
Tcu,
Smu,

798
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.570
I'm telling you there's something there.
I'm just fucking with you.

799
00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:44.350
Tcu is what I fucking love.

800
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:47.680
Watching that team man exciting as hell and uh,

801
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.660
almost had a great comeback against the Ohio state.
Um,
and there are two went.

802
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:55.210
Oh well their coaches suspended.

803
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:59.680
He's allowed to coach during the fucking wake,
but on,
on Saturdays,

804
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:03.550
he is not allowed to couch.
Um,
tell me,

805
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:07.870
you don't have some sort of hedge sent wire thing going on or some shit.
Um,

806
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.780
Urban Meyer,
uh,
anyways,

807
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.940
plowing your head here.
That kid from north Texas who did the,
uh,

808
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.440
the fake fair catch.

809
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:19.980
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

810
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.120
<v 6>Uh,
the next time he calls for a fair catch,</v>

811
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.520
he better be waving a goddamn white flag.

812
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.590
There's that dude is going to get stuck for the rest of the fucking year cause

813
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.720
he,
he,
he humiliated whoever the fuck he did that too.

814
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:36.310
When people see shit like that,
y'all ain't fucking do that to me.

815
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.510
Then they give you the all right there Fred.
So keep your head on a swivel.

816
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:44.650
Their sunny.
Um,
I still don't understand how the fuck he pulled that off.

817
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.553
You know?

818
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

819
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:51.240
<v 6>Big Time.
Confidence,
big time.
Fucking confidence.</v>

820
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:53.523
Um,

821
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:58.920
did I read from the almond farmer yet that I did.
I miss that one.

822
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.980
Did that one get cut off at all?
The fucking confusion here.

823
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:06.800
This almond farmer wrote me,

824
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.470
he said he was actually listening to the podcast while I was talking about

825
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:16.000
almond farm.
Then he invited me,
you know,
to stop by,
which is always creepy,

826
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:16.834
you know what I mean?

827
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.930
Those farmhouses like I love far miles and now I fucking shit.
Right.

828
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.740
But like they're all scary looking farm.
Ours is,
are there,

829
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.390
there's scary during the day

830
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.220
because you never see anybody and he just always feel like they have all these,

831
00:49:32.221 --> 00:49:37.050
this,
this old fucking,
they have like sickles and shit.
It's just,
you know,

832
00:49:37.051 --> 00:49:41.910
they can feed to their pigs.
I Dunno,
they were shady group man.

833
00:49:41.911 --> 00:49:44.040
Those farmers,
they're out there by themselves.

834
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.280
You can't tell me you don't slowly go insane when you're fucking a fee when

835
00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:49.800
you're a farmer.
You know what I mean?
Then when you fucking a farmer,

836
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:55.020
all right ladies,
you keep doing that shit.
All right.
You don't have to be lonely.

837
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:59.430
Play in with his fucking almond scented balls.
All right.

838
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:03.780
Living off of smoothies.
Oh Lsu by the way,

839
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.750
Lsu is fucking two and now,
um,

840
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.400
I watched the whole game.
I watched the whole game and I watched so many sports,

841
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.670
so much sports this weekend.
I,
I can't even remember who the fuck they played.

842
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.110
Auburn.
Jesus Christ in Auburn,
right

843
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.640
war.
Fucking Eagle,
right.

844
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.860
They went down there and they went down there and they fucking,

845
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:31.910
I don't a lot of those Auburn people,
they're upset.
They'll lie on,

846
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.940
hey wait one on am fucking pass in or fairer girl scouts book and calls.

847
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.010
Um,
I am a big proponent of quarterbacks and how much they get fucked over.
But I,

848
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.910
both of those were in interference.
If you were at the game,

849
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.560
that one over the middle looks like bullshit cause they didn't show you the full

850
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:55.850
replay where the guy just held him for like,
you know,
10 yards.

851
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.970
Totally slowed them the fuck down.
And then the other one,

852
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.840
the guy was grabbing his fucking arm,
you know,
it was borderline.

853
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.290
Sometimes you get away with it,
but he got caught.
But he was doing it.

854
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:11.660
I can tell you this,
uh,
we're fucking two went.
Oh,
and what's his face there?

855
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.750
Their coach.
The hell's his goddamn name.

856
00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:17.570
I'd just keep spacing on his fucking name.
I'll get it.

857
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.070
<v 1>Uh,
that's,
he's,
he's the best thing in the sec,
if not in the fucking</v>

858
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.410
<v 6>college football right now.</v>

859
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.740
<v 1>Oh,
I tweeted that.
He's,
he,
he's</v>

860
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:32.470
<v 6>sounds like a fucking a Cajun hulk.
Hogan</v>

861
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.780
in origin.
Ron
[inaudible] Ron now.
Okay.
Alternative rundown.
We went out,

862
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.680
I'll tell you Trump to what brought up,
uh,

863
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.220
he sounds like a fucking wrestler and he's got and believing in themselves and

864
00:51:50.221 --> 00:51:52.200
they got a quarterback that's playing out right now.
Look,

865
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:56.790
we all know the Alabama Crimson tide is a fucking professional football team.

866
00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.780
All right.
I don't know what the Fuck Nick Saban is doing.

867
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:04.920
How he gets all those good guys.
Howie's always fun.
I don't know what,

868
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.550
but that guy is the fucking guy.

869
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.610
Nick Saban.
I love rooting against them,
but I love that guy.
I love Nick Saban.

870
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.520
You know,
I love what he's done with the Alabama or whatever,
but you know,

871
00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:21.750
when I needed to pick a college team I wasn't going to fucking jump on the

872
00:52:21.751 --> 00:52:26.730
bandwagon.
You know,
I like rooting against the fucking people.

873
00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:31.320
You know what I mean?
Well Do.
Yeah,
I dunno.
Maybe you don't.

874
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:36.960
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead,
living off smoothies.
Hey Billy,
fish paste.

875
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:40.103
Um,

876
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.040
<v 1>last week you mentioned you'd love to just live off smoothies if you could.
Well,</v>

877
00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:45.300
it turns out you can,

878
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.660
there's an entire niche food market called meal replacements or complete foods

879
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:53.940
that contain all the carbs,
fats,
proteins,
fibers,

880
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.930
micronutrients and everything else.
The body needs to function properly,

881
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.680
all in one serving.
Yeah,
I know,
but I get nervous cause when I,
I,

882
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.150
I just feel like it's,

883
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.870
it's science and then they always put all these fucking chemicals and shit in

884
00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:11.250
there.
Uh,
some come in powder form.
So all you do is mix it with water.

885
00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:12.960
Others come ready to drink in the bottle.

886
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.830
The difference between them and something shitty like ensure is that they take

887
00:53:16.831 --> 00:53:21.750
human biology and complete nutritional needs into account and make sure you get

888
00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:25.920
the full recommended daily intake for all vitamins,
minerals,
macros.

889
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.410
<v 6>Eh,
also most of them are made from whole food ingredients.
Um,</v>

890
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.210
this is probably what the future's going to be like when we fucking destroy the

891
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:34.044
whole planet.

892
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.340
And the only people left are living in this giant air conditioned fucking

893
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.780
greenhouse.
Uh,
and they just in there with,

894
00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:45.780
I don't know what chemicals,
but eventually you need plants so that they,

895
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:48.090
they just,
they can't their own ecosystem.
They're like,

896
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.300
we're going to heal the earth from inside here and then it's going to work on

897
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:57.870
the way out.
There's another side.
I always pitch these Psi Phi movies,
you know,

898
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:01.770
and then years later they ended up making them like that fucking population

899
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.060
jumped that I did that.
You take a test,
they literally made that fucking movie.

900
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.080
Where's another one for you yet even can actually go ahead and make it,

901
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:14.790
cause I'm not going to fucking do it.
Did you just give consent?
Um,

902
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.550
here's one for you,
right?

903
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:23.460
The whole fucking world looks like a Goddamn desert is all waterworld desert and

904
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:28.461
all that shit and it's just this one fucking greed house,

905
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.360
giant fucking greenhouse,
the size of Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

906
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:35.280
And in there they actually have plants,

907
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.780
they've got some chickens and shits like a fucking arc that doesn't go anywhere.

908
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.260
Right?
And in there is the perfect fucking ecosystem.

909
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.670
All right.
And then they're going to gradually,
like their thing is,

910
00:54:48.671 --> 00:54:53.671
is if they have to weight out all the waste and hope that the planet comes back

911
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:55.770
and then they gradually,

912
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.040
every year they try to expand a little bit more of this stadium to fucking

913
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:07.740
include more.
The more of this declivity claim more than fucking scorched earth.

914
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.920
Right.
I'm already off the rails.
I don't have this fucker works.

915
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:15.120
But somehow there's a fucking guy in there and he wants to take control and it's

916
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:19.380
all about the fucking air conditioner.
Right.
That was a bad one.

917
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.890
But some one of you nerds can figure it out.
Right.
All right.
Anyways,

918
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.650
the one that first came online a few years ago was called,

919
00:55:25.651 --> 00:55:28.620
this is back to the living off smooth smoothies.
Soylent.

920
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.800
They make powder in premixed drinks.
Very tasty.

921
00:55:31.801 --> 00:55:34.890
But there's doesn't of other companies that make similar products.
You know,

922
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:39.780
one of the guys I fly with a,
you know,
these digestive system,

923
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:43.290
whatever,
that's all he does.
And he,
we flew back from,
uh,

924
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.580
this place one time when I was hungry,
he was drink this man,
you'll be full.

925
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:50.580
And I drank it and it felt good,
but it was,
it was too weird,
man.
I need to,

926
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:54.960
I would need to read up on it.
Um,
but I know I'm not going to,

927
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:59.380
so I'm going to stick with what I've been doing,
but uh,
but I,

928
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.920
I would think that you'd be in great shape.
Right.

929
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.770
You know,
it's nice and easy to digest.
I don't know.

930
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.520
It depends on what's in it though,
right?
Anyways,

931
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.420
it doesn't have other companies that make similar products like Hule.

932
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.040
He will that we happy
Hule Huel,
Jimmy joy,

933
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.400
bio lint and super body fuel all with their very own special take on how to

934
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:24.460
fulfill requirements.

935
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.300
It's been working for me for years and I even lived off soylent for a month

936
00:56:28.301 --> 00:56:31.690
straight a couple of years ago with no issues along with hundreds of other

937
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:34.090
people.
But you obviously don't have to do that.

938
00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:36.970
You can just use it for breakfast or ever you want.

939
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:39.430
Thanks for all your left and go fuck yourself.
Well let me,

940
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.740
did you lose a bunch of weight and shit?

941
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.460
Like why don't fat people just fucking do this
or look into it?

942
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:52.910
You know,
cause I figured that once they push through and get off the sugar salt,

943
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.490
they can start turning it around.
Um,

944
00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:59.080
and one of the hardest things to do about eating healthy is,

945
00:56:59.081 --> 00:57:02.940
is now you got to sit there and prepare this shit while you're super hungry and

946
00:57:02.941 --> 00:57:06.030
your body's going to fuck this order.
A pizza man order a fucking pizza.

947
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:08.190
But if they just all these containers ready to go,

948
00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:12.440
you just shake it up and you drink it.
Um,
that could actually help some people.

949
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.780
Uh,
but I,
I would definitely,
if you're going to do that,

950
00:57:14.781 --> 00:57:16.010
if you listen to you're thinking of doing,

951
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.120
I would definitely do some research as far as like what is in them.
Alright.

952
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:24.590
Boycott dear Billy boy caught.
How do you feel about boycotting?

953
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.790
Have you ever boycotted anything?
Uh,
yes,
I have.
I have.
Uh,

954
00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:32.810
is there any reason you would boycott a show podcasts your company because you

955
00:57:32.811 --> 00:57:36.890
didn't agree with their behavior?
Um,

956
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:42.710
no.
Are Not their opinions.
I would,
I would,

957
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:47.770
I would like,
uh,
if something sucked.
So I don't know.

958
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.960
I guess that's sent a boycott then.
All right.
Anyways,
he goes,

959
00:57:50.961 --> 00:57:53.570
I feel like you have a thick skin,
so you probably have only,

960
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:58.190
you probably only have reason to boycott a group that was censoring you are your

961
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:01.180
comedy.
Um,

962
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.420
yeah,
like when I boy caught something,

963
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.790
when I boycott a company because of their behavior,
well I hate bankers,

964
00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:17.390
but I still fucking use him.
So that goes that.

965
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:24.200
Um,
yeah,
I dunno.

966
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.700
I Dunno.
I respect people that that's what they want to fucking do.

967
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.300
I would put it that way,
but like,

968
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.653
<v 0>yeah,</v>

969
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.820
<v 6>I don't know that I would,
uh,</v>

970
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.540
thank,
you know,
I get why people do that shit.

971
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:45.890
You just have to do a lot to fucking lose me,
I think.
You know what I mean?

972
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:50.000
Like I hung in there with Trump and you know,

973
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:52.610
cause I root for the president whether I like them or not,

974
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.840
but like once his wife wore that,
yeah,
I don't know.
I really care.

975
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.590
Do you jacket to that fucking,
you know,

976
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.470
when she's going down to see kids that were taken away from their parents,

977
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:03.363
I mean,

978
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.890
whether they're right or wrong about their way they're handling immigration or

979
00:59:08.891 --> 00:59:11.350
how they want to enforce it,
that,
you know,

980
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.570
that goes out the window when there's some kid crying missing his parents and

981
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:17.350
he's,
he or she's scared,
you know,
and you're going to wear something like that.

982
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.550
That's when they lost me and I was just like,
all right,

983
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.640
I'm by subtle and trash from in my act.
You know,

984
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.540
Kendall's is fucking plenty of people doing that.
Um,

985
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:31.010
so I may be honest,
you get this at this point in history,

986
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:34.640
I think it's really important rather than to walk away or something like that.

987
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:39.641
It's more important to try to get something going to talk or something cause

988
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:41.390
this screaming and yelling shit.
Jesus.

989
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:45.140
And this comes from somebody who will fucking screaming cunt.
Um,

990
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.490
you know,
it's just,
it doesn't,
uh,
it doesn't fucking

991
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:54.170
doesn't make any sense.
I understand why people do what they get.

992
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:57.920
They get emotional.
Jesus Christ.
God knows I've got fucking emotional today.

993
00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:01.060
This guy was supposed to move some fucking furniture.
I in my house,

994
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.380
it's one of the fucking workers.
Like I,
you know,

995
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:07.910
I did all this work on the house and like I loved the house as much as I bitch

996
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:09.380
about it.
And you know,

997
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.240
I brought it back to life where a lot of people did some home depot bullshit to

998
01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:17.120
it and I tried to restore it,
you know,

999
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.870
update it in the walls but like outside and tried to make it look like,
um,

1000
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.770
you know,
the time when it was created,
you know.

1001
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.390
So I went and I got these vintage door handles and somebody swiped one of them

1002
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.830
and I swear to fuck I got it back though.
I got it.

1003
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.840
I raised fucking holy hell,

1004
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.200
it's one of the few times my wife didn't give me shit for losing my mind.
I,

1005
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:42.080
I fucking lost my fucking mind.

1006
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.990
What is that about when somebody steals from you?
You know,

1007
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.980
it's just that they,
it's like,

1008
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.730
I think who do fuck does he think I'm that fucking stupid?

1009
01:00:52.731 --> 01:00:57.010
I wasn't going to notice.
Do you think on the kind of person that's,

1010
01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.650
that's not going to fucking pursue this?
I,
Ooh,
Jesus Christ.

1011
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.900
Oh,
well there's a reason I don't fucking own a firearm.
You know,

1012
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.491
you can't,
you know,

1013
01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:10.280
so that's one of those things that they should do is when you go down and get a

1014
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:13.580
fucking a gun license,

1015
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.250
they should like spy on you for a week and just figure out what irritates you

1016
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:20.720
and then they just come in and do it.

1017
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.720
Just have somebody do it to you in the parking lot and just see how much you

1018
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:27.770
lose your shit and just see if he should have a fucking gun or not.
Um,

1019
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.840
I would never shoot anybody,
but I think I would definitely brandish a weapon.

1020
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.640
I'm fucking wave in somebody's face,
buddy.

1021
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.440
I am going to shoot you in the face,
you know,

1022
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.980
put your fucking hands in that dashboard.

1023
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.460
One of those underrated performances in any terantin of movie.

1024
01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:51.410
The guy who played that fucking cup,
um,
in the bathroom scene.
All right,

1025
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:56.240
buying a Lamborghini.
Hey Billy,
the financial advisor

1026
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.680
just might be my favorite fucking question ever.

1027
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:02.480
Are you going to buy a Lamborghini?

1028
01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:06.410
You ever just live vicariously through somebody?
Uh,
more of a Ferrari guy?

1029
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:11.300
But God bless you.
You know,
I'm not a Lamborghini.
Guys are more flashy.
A,
hey,

1030
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:14.660
Billy,
the financial adviser.
I,
I'd appreciate your take.

1031
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:18.350
My childhood dream has been to own a Lamborghini then God damn it.

1032
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:20.370
Get yourself not because of the,

1033
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.360
Oh is he says I'd attract,

1034
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.150
but because I have a huge interest in cars and they've always been a motivation

1035
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:31.110
for me.
A problem is I'm not a hundred percent sure if I should.

1036
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.540
I should.
I left a word out,
drop 250 grand on a car.

1037
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:41.160
I know the old saying,
if you have to ask,
uh,
you can't afford it.

1038
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.440
Uh,
it has truth to it,
but I'd like to get advice from people on a big decision.

1039
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.410
We'll dude,
I'm not the guy.
I'm currently 27.
He says,

1040
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.850
did my master's and work a commission based job,
a real realtor,

1041
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.980
and luckily had a few good years in the past.
Um,
from the money I saved,

1042
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:03.090
I managed to buy three investment properties.
Oh Dude,
you're,
you're,
you're,
yes.

1043
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.330
Okay.
This is all great stuff.

1044
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:09.990
I know technically they belong to the bank,

1045
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:12.030
but I've been able to build equity that way.

1046
01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.270
The shitty thing is because I've been buying these,

1047
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.740
I ended up not buying a place for myself and my parents had been nice enough to

1048
01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:23.820
let me stay home with them.
I know that this is kind of fucked up,

1049
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:27.960
but I'm from South Africa and it's frowned upon to move out before getting

1050
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:29.730
married.
Well,
dude,
you save a ton of money.

1051
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.620
So I guess I kind of took advantage of that.
No,
he didn't,
that,

1052
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:39.390
that was their rule and you'd just,
you're playing within the rules anyways.

1053
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.250
Also,
you tell them a patriots fan.

1054
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.850
There's nothing wrong with that then and say he can't do it.
Also,

1055
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:47.790
I don't have a girlfriend and actually don't get laid at all.

1056
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.680
So I'm not doing it to impress girl.

1057
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.680
I could give a fuck about you or just a fucking asexual moneymaking machine

1058
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:56.370
here,
sir.
My question is,

1059
01:03:56.371 --> 01:04:01.290
should I buy my own place first then save up for a lambo or fulfill my childhood

1060
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:03.330
dream?
Now.
Uh,

1061
01:04:03.331 --> 01:04:07.080
the reason I don't want to necessarily buy a places because then I'll have a lot

1062
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:12.081
of pressure to find a wife and I know no woman will ever let me spend 250 grand

1063
01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:17.541
on a car and let's say spent 250 grand on her and because it may delay my dream

1064
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:22.830
and other five or so years and I want to enjoy it while I'm still relatively

1065
01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:25.380
young.
All right.
Wow.

1066
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.700
This guy's really planning out his life.
I liked this also,
if it matters,

1067
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:34.830
I have about half of the amount I need saved up so far and will either save up

1068
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.900
for another six months to a year and yes,

1069
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.800
I've researched maintenance costs and if factored those into its guy's done his

1070
01:04:40.801 --> 01:04:43.080
homework,
any help would be appreciated.

1071
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.730
Thanks for the free podcast and any advice from near would be helpful to you

1072
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:51.390
guys are great together and I wish I had friends in real life like you guys.

1073
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:54.720
That's really nice.
Now that I'm done sucking your tick,

1074
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:59.520
thanks and go fuck yourself.
That's hilarious.
Um,
all right.
Well,

1075
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:02.520
I think you know more about money than I do.
Um,

1076
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.140
here's the pros to buy a Lamborghini.
Um,

1077
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.740
they do retain their value.
Okay?

1078
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:15.741
If you don't wrap it around a fucking tree or modify it or do a bunch of,

1079
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:20.140
you know,
put a bunch of miles on it.
The weird thing about a Lamborghini is that,

1080
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:20.974
you know,

1081
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.300
these fucking guys get them and then they have them for 20 years and they sell

1082
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:27.910
them and they always have like 800 original miles.
And it's like,

1083
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:32.230
why the fuck did you even have it?
Uh,
secondly,

1084
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.070
um,
I don't know if it helps you.
It's not a good look.

1085
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:39.820
If your real estate agent is 27 and pulls up in a fucking Lamborghini,

1086
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.060
that would make me feel like this guy's taken way too much commission.

1087
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:46.330
He's fucking me.
So I,
if you're going to get it,
I would not drive it to work.

1088
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.173
Um,

1089
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.120
and as far as your worry about women,
uh,
here's,

1090
01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.170
here's the secret with women is you gotta be up front with them.

1091
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.023
Okay?

1092
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.530
You have to tell them from fucking day one that this is what you're doing and

1093
01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:07.480
then you have to follow through and do it.

1094
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:11.650
And don't let them do that shit where they go.
Well,
that was there for,

1095
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:15.820
I was predicted.
Nope.
Nope,
nope.

1096
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.950
All right.
Um,
I,
I would lean,
I would,

1097
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:22.600
uh,
listen,
I think there's,

1098
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:27.430
there's a massive like bubble being built in and I don't know shit.

1099
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:31.760
So people don't listen to me.
Okay.
I know I'm a bald guy and I know I screen,

1100
01:06:31.761 --> 01:06:34.030
but I'm not that guy on TV who yells about the stocks.

1101
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.650
I'm just a fucking stupid comedian.
Okay.
And I go with my gut and my gut is,

1102
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:42.250
was a travel round the country up.
Fucking look at paypal.
All right?

1103
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.820
And what's been freaking me out is the shit that I'm talking about where,
uh,

1104
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.010
it's like a fucking Thursday afternoon.

1105
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.280
I'm on the road and I go to a breakfast place and it is fucking packed.

1106
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:56.460
I'm standing in line like it's Sunday after church and I'm just looking around

1107
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.200
going donated.
These fucking people have a fucking job.

1108
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.320
And I'm looking at them all and they all have smart phones and they have fucking

1109
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.440
iPads and they got fucking their custom fucking sneakers that they ordered in.

1110
01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:10.780
Everybody is living this fucking lifestyle and part of this lifestyle is in

1111
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:13.270
building all these fucking luxury high rise apartments.

1112
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:18.010
I mean this is my fifth time around the block with this shit.
All right.

1113
01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.830
Started with the fucking yuppies was the first time I saw it.

1114
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.870
The fucking Dotcom Shit.
Uh,
the,
the,
the housing bubble lamb,

1115
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.730
everybody's getting a house,
you know,

1116
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.960
from fucking 10 years ago and now this shit.

1117
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:36.100
So maybe it's my fourth time through this,
but this is,
this is what happens.
So,

1118
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:38.710
um,

1119
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:43.710
I think keep doing what you're doing with the money and either stay at home.

1120
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.670
I wouldn't buy,
I wouldn't buy the loan.
No,
I want,
I don't want to talk to you.

1121
01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:50.470
It's a fucking dream or so I,
I'm,

1122
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:53.920
there's no way I'm going to talk a guy and up his dream or a woman or a

1123
01:07:53.921 --> 01:07:57.220
hermaphrodite or somebody transitioning.
Did I cover everybody?

1124
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.890
Am I still in show business?
Um,

1125
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.830
I,
uh,
and then as far as the pressure,

1126
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:08.440
you're going to get to get married a fuck that.
Okay.

1127
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:10.570
At some point you gotta be like,
listen,
I'm not doing that.
Okay.

1128
01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:14.170
I'm going to get married when I find the right person.
Okay.

1129
01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:18.800
And if you don't,
I'm talking about just watched coming to America.
Okay.

1130
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.990
I think you're going to find a lot of themes that you can relate to.

1131
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:30.530
Um,
that's your,
my coming to America is kill the Irishmen.
Um,

Uh,

1132
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.410
yeah,
I think,
you know,

1133
01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.900
here's the thing is another way to have a Lamborghini.

1134
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:41.320
You could have a Lamborghini for like a year and then turn around and sell it.

1135
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.200
You know,
my only thing is I think I,

1136
01:08:44.201 --> 01:08:49.201
I would kind of wait until the fucking Lamborghini is a great thing to buy

1137
01:08:49.601 --> 01:08:54.310
during a recession.
Okay.
Unless you're talking about buying a new one,
then,

1138
01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:56.140
you know.

1164
01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:55.023
Um,

1165

use 2008 Lamborghini Murcia Lego revention coop.

1166
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.570
For some reason they want 1,000,008 and 18.
What?
No fucking way.

1167
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:10.130
There's another oil is another.
All those doe.
All those are the kitty ones.

1172
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:30.360
These are a year old and these are all like a half a million bucks.

1173
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.240
Um,
yeah,
dude,

1174
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:38.550
you don't want to spend all this fucking money.
Maybe you don't worry.

1175
01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:40.590
Do I would I would buy a used one though.

1176
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.220
I would definitely buy a fucking use one.
Holy Shit.

1177
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:46.000
You know what kills me about these things?
If you go to the,

1178
01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.380
wouldn't go to the supermarket and drive over a fucking speed bump,

1179
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.780
please tell me those circuits you get this thing.
Please take it to the track.

1180
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.480
Please take it to the track.
Could you please,

1181
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.890
could you please take it to the track,

1182
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.410
the amount of Lamborghinis and never go to the fucking track.

1183
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.020
You know that if I got one of those fucking things,

1184
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.580
I'd have it on a flatbed truck.

1185
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:06.060
I'd take it to the track and I would meet an instructor there and be like,

1186
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:10.400
teach me to drive this thing as fast as my skill set will allow me,
um,

1187
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.190
without fucking destroying it.
All right,
let's close on this dilemma,

1188
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.080
but good luck to you sir.
Uh,
you got a lot of great options.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh,

1189
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.470
tell the woman what you're going to do and stick with it.
What she gonna do.

1190
01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.640
Be Up,
you know?
Um,
and then secondly,

1191
01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.670
you got to let go that shit with your parents.
If you're going,
don't,

1192
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:31.230
don't not buy a house because of some fucking,
you know,

1193
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:34.860
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Sorry,

1194
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:38.820
I always have to go with the fucking some sort of where I'm from kind of thing

1195
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.810
here.
A dilemma.
Everybody,
Dear Belle,

1196
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.790
if your life depended on it,

1197
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.820
would you in Chris Berman's voice what you live in medieval times as a king or

1198
01:12:53.971 --> 01:12:57.120
make 65 grand a year in the present time.

1199
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.880
Oh fuck that.
Oh my God.
As a king you be able to fuck any chick you wanted.

1200
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.680
Eat well,
live well do king shit.

1201
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:10.620
But you'd have to worry about being overthrown or invaded.
Yeah.

1202
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:14.610
Or getting some fucking disease and yeah.
And smallpox.

1203
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.640
Everyone asked this question to changes their mind after talking it out.

1204
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.530
I know.
I right out of the gate,
I was like,
no brainer.

1205
01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:27.531
I'll take 65 grand a year in the NFL package and I'll be an absolute fucking

1206
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:33.021
nobody and I'll rub it out to internet porn before I would go back into medieval

1207
01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:38.400
fucking times with scurvy,
gang green,

1208
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.330
the blackball scurvy I wouldn't have,
cause I'd be a king.

1209
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.800
I'd have plenty of fucking vitamins.
Steven,
is that what it is?

1210
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:47.280
No vitamin seasonal fruit in your diet or some shit?
Um,

1211
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.670
yeah,
fuck all that.
And then everybody come in to try to fucking kill me.

1212
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:57.000
And then just the shit I would have to do to stay in power,

1213
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.960
putting people in iron maidens and stretching them out.
I am like,

1214
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:05.100
I don't want to hurt people.
You know?
And then if you're a cool king,
right?

1215
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.760
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
they call you fucking Lord snowflake.
They,

1216
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.100
we all these liberal fucking,
everybody would think they could get over on you.

1217
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.210
Right.
And then you just have to stick someone in the belly of the beast.

1218
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:16.421
You know,

1219
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:21.190
I think about that fucking all the time meant like out of all those things,

1220
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.950
the iron maiden,
they slam it shut.
You're dead.
You know,

1221
01:14:23.951 --> 01:14:26.260
the rack is fucking brutal.
You know,
the rack,
they actually,

1222
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:30.220
they thought it's stretched in,
broke you,
you're a Toyota tendons and stuff.

1223
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:34.120
When it actually did was it broke your bones by stretching to the point that

1224
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:37.690
they cracked at me.
Just fucking insane.

1225
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.610
Human beings are so fucking horrible.
It's,
it's,

1226
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.800
it's not even like he came,
you can't wrap your head around it,

1227
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.400
but the belly of the beast,
you know what I mean?

1228
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:48.940
[inaudible] being in the belly of the beast,

1229
01:14:48.941 --> 01:14:51.430
they would actually have like some giant looking bowl thing

1230
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:55.660
made out of cast iron or something and they would put you in there,

1231
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:59.080
close it and enlight a fire underneath and basically cook you alive.

1232
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.920
And the amount of times I thought of what I would do

1233
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:07.420
if I was in there,
I would just slam my fucking head.

1234
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.540
I would fuck I do the million dollar baby.
I would bite through my fucking time,

1235
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.430
but it,
but to actually fucking,
you know,
hot,

1236
01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:19.570
it'd have to be before I could actually have the balls to do that.
Um,

1237
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:23.710
is there a way to just like,
you know,
you just rip your own throat out?

1238
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.180
I would literally,
I would try to fucking puncture my neck and bleed out.

1239
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.300
That's what I would try to do.
Um,

1240
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.050
but they probably put you in their butt ass naked with you for all tied up and

1241
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:38.500
shit.
I mean,
just fucking brutal.
So it's not even a question dude.

1242
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.970
65 grand of fucking year in the present,

1243
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.680
you know,
buy,
dress like Albert Einstein,

1244
01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:50.350
same fucking clothes every day except to be more than Malcolm Young Wardrobe,

1245
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.400
breast,
his soul.
Do you know,
I've been,
you know,

1246
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:57.130
going through a lot of shit here and I actually found this Malcolm Young,

1247
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.230
uh,
like action figure thing that I have not action figure.
It's like it's,

1248
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.260
but I bought the thing,

1249
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:08.650
I never assembled it cause you had to came from somewhere in Asia,
you know,

1250
01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:12.250
Angus didn't get any money on it and you fucking,
uh,

1251
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:17.430
you gotta glue his feet to the fucking base and a,

1252
01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:20.650
I've been meaning to go over to one of these fucking mom and pop department

1253
01:16:20.651 --> 01:16:24.100
stores,
you know,
fuck on depo.
I mean,

1254
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.550
anytime like you want to talk about someone who gets act like a king over this,

1255
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:29.380
you can actually find somebody on the floor.
They can,

1256
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.480
that doesn't have 20 people like running after them.
You know,

1257
01:16:34.481 --> 01:16:37.930
like when the dog whisperer goes over the hill and he's got $20 about 20 kids

1258
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:41.230
behind them or dogs behind that.
That's what the fucking home Depot's like.

1259
01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:44.620
So anyways,
yeah,
I would take 65 grand a year.
Great question though.

1260
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.660
Great questions.
Uh,
great.
Um,
I hope that gate,

1261
01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.110
I,
it's gonna work out for you,
buddy.
All right.
If you want,

1262
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:55.930
you got to tell somebody first dates tamed by yourself.
Uh,

1263
01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.280
I've always wanted a Lamborghini,
you know,
Jesus.

1264
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:04.780
What kind of woman would that attract?
Uh,
I don't know,
but that's your dilemma,

1265
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:08.080
buddy.
Good luck with it.
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on,
yeah.

1266
01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:09.090
Thursday.
