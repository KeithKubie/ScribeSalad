00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's say you're some
type of a hunter gatherer

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.290
and you're trying to figure
out how much of your time

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.770
to spend hunting and how much
of your time to spend gathering.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.150
So let's think about the
different scenarios here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.650
and the tradeoffs
that they involve.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.108
And just for
simplicity we're going

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.220
to assume that when you're
talking about hunting,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.975
the only animal
around you to hunt for

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:20.176
are these little rabbits.

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:21.800
And when we're talking
about gathering,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.091
the only thing you can gather
are some type of berries.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.250
That'll keep our conversation
a little bit simpler.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.999
So let's think about
all of the scenarios.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.410
So first, let's call this
first scenario Scenario A.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.000
And let's say--
so let's call this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.120
the number of
rabbits you can get

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.770
and then let's call this
the number of berries.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.450
Let's do this column as
the number of berries

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.560
that you can get.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.270
So if you were to spend your
entire day going after rabbits,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.584
all your free time
out-- making sure

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.250
you have time to
sleep, and get dressed,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.010
and all those type of things.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.950
Let's say that you can actually
get five rabbits, on average,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.090
in a given day.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.110
But if you spend all
your time getting rabbits

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.740
you're not going to have
any time to get berries.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.020
So you're going to be
able to get 0 berries.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.190
Now let's say that you were
to allocate a little bit more

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.520
time to get berries and a little
bit less time to get rabbits.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.530
So we'll call that
Scenario B. We'll

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.890
call scenario B the reality
where you have enough time

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.420
to get 4 rabbits on average.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.590
And when you do that,
all of a sudden you're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.950
able to get 100 berries.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830
And when we do these
different scenarios,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.360
we're assuming that
everything else is equal.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.100
You're not changing
the amount of time

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.000
you have either
hunting or gathering.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.860
You're not changing
the amount of sleep.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.150
You're not changing your
techniques for hunting rabbits,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060
or hunting berries,
or you're not somehow

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.810
looking to do other
things with your time.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.299
So all other things are equal.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.590
And the general term for
this, and it sounds very fancy

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380
if you were to say
it in a conversation,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.385
is ceteris paribus.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.330
Which literally means-- so any
time someone says, oh ceteris

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.256
parabus, we assume
this variable changes

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.630
or whatever else--
they're saying

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.419
we're assuming everything
else is being held equal.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.865
So ceteris means
all other things.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.930
You're probably
familiar with et cetera.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.670
It's the same word, essentially.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.080
Other things in paribus,
other things equal.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.064
So when you're going
from Scenario A

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.230
to Scenario B you're not
changing the amount of time

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.896
you're sleeping.

00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:33.490
You're not changing
somehow the geography

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370
where you are in a dramatic way.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.380
You're not changing the tools
you use or the technology.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.520
Everything else is equal.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.970
The only variable
you're changing

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.950
is how much time you
allocate to finding

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.330
rabbits versus finding berries.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.210
So let's do some more scenarios
assuming ceteris paribus.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.270
So let me do Scenario C.
You could, on average, have

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.900
enough time to get 3 rabbits.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.560
But if you get 3 rabbits
then all of a sudden

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.170
you will to get-- or if
you're only getting 3 rabbits,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.306
you're now able to
get 180 berries.

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:07.430
And let's do a couple more.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.200
I'm going to do
two more scenarios.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.680
So let's say Scenario D, if
you reduce the amount of time

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.450
you spend getting rabbits
so you get 2 rabbits,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.380
now all of a sudden you
have enough time on average

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.240
to get 240 berries.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.230
And then, let's say you
spend even less time hunting

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.030
for rabbits, on average.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.920
Then you have even
more time for berries.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.270
And so you're able
to get to 180 berries

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.780
and I'll do one
more scenario here.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.150
So let's say Scenario F-- and
let's call these the scenarios.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.470
Scenarios A through
F. So Scenario F

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.910
is you spend all your
time looking for berries.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.530
In which case, on
average, you're

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.480
going to be able to
get 300 berries a day.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.010
But since you have
no time for rabbits

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.170
you aren't going
to get any rabbits.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.350
So what I want to
do is plot these.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.550
And on one axis I'll have
the number of rabbits.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.350
And on the other axis I'll
have the number of berries.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.080
So let me do it right over here.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.430
So this axis, I will call
this my rabbit axis, rabbits.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.630
And we'll start.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.040
That will be 0.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.940
And then this will
be 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.140
and then that will be 5 rabbits.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.355
And then in this axis
I will do the berries.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.990
So this right over here,
let's make this 100 berries.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.170
This is 200 berries.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.230
And then this is 300 berries.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.550
And so this is my berries axis.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.110
Now let's plot these points,
these different scenarios.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.394
So first we have
Scenario A. Maybe

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.560
I should've done all these
colors in that Scenario A

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.390
color.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.170
Scenario A, 5
rabbits, 0 berries.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.700
We are right over there.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.060
That is Scenario A.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.420
Scenario B, 4
rabbits, 100 berries.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.460
That's right over there.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.920
That's 100 berries.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.970
So that is Scenario B.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.040
Scenario C, 3
rabbits, 180 berries.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.130
3 rabbits, 180.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.422
Let's see this would be 150.

00:05:28.422 --> 00:05:31.320
180 will be like
right over there.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.420
So 3, if you have
time for 3 rabbits

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.090
you have time for about
180 berries on average.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.240
So this is Scenario C. And then
Scenario D we have in white.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.110
If you have time for 2 rabbits,
you have time for 240 berries.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.560
So that is right around there.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.540
So this is Scenario D.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.830
Actually, a little bit lower.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.670
So this would be 250, so 240 is
a little bit lower than that.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.060
So it'll be right over there.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.030
That is Scenario D.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.940
Scenario E, if you
have time for 1 rabbit,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.340
you have time for 280 berries.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.930
So that gets us
right about there.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.950
That is Scenario E.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.490
And then finally
Scenario F. You are

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.570
spending all of your
time looking for berries.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.480
You have no time for rabbits.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.750
So all of your time for
berries, no time for rabbits.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.830
0 rabbits, 300 berries.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.430
That's right over there.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.535
So this is Scenario F.

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:30.800
So what all of these
points represent,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.970
these are all points-- now this
is going to be a fancy word,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.420
but it's a very simple idea.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.510
These are all points on
you, as a hunter gatherer,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.900
on your production
possibilities frontier.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.540
Because if we draw
a line-- I just

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.610
arbitrarily picked
these scenarios.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.320
Although I guess you could on
average get 4 and 1/2 rabbits

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.217
on average, on average
get 3 and 1/2 rabbits,

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:52.300
and then you'd have a
different number of berries.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.430
So these are all points on
the different combinations

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.700
between the trade offs
of rabbits and berries.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.210
So let me connect all of these.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.460
Let me connect them in a
color that I haven't used it.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.940
So let me connect them.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.309
And do you see-- this
should just be one curve.

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:07.600
So I'll do it as a dotted line.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.308
It's easier for me to
draw a dotted curve

00:07:09.308 --> 00:07:10.950
than a straight curve.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.010
So this right over here,
this curve right over here,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.210
represents all the
possible possibilities

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.900
of combinations of
rabbits and berries.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.800
I've only picked
certain of them,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.390
but you could have a
scenario right over here.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.320
Maybe we could call
that Scenario G, where

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.890
on average the amount of
time you've allocated,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.827
on average you would
get 4 and 1/2 rabbits.

00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.160
So some days you would get 4
rabbits and every other day

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.660
you would get 5
rabbits, so maybe it

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.217
averages out to 4
and 1/2 rabbits.

00:07:37.217 --> 00:07:38.800
And then maybe it
looks like you would

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.290
get about 50 berries
in that situation.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.830
So all of these
are possibilities.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.850
You don't have to just jump
from 4 rabbits to 5 rabbits.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.410
Or maybe in this scenario
you're spending 7 hours

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.140
and in this scenario
you spend 8 hours.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.490
But you could spend
7 hours and a minute,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.640
or 7 hours and a second.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.010
So anything in
between is possible

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.870
and all of those possibilities
are on this curve.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.820
So these five scenarios,
actually these six scenarios

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.180
that we've talked
about so far these

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.130
are just scenarios
on this curve.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.000
And that curve we call,
once again-- fancy term,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:33.360
simple idea-- our production
possibilities frontier.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360
Because it shows all of
the different possibilities

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.179
we can do, we can get.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.179
3 rabbits, and 180 berries.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:44.570
2 rabbits and 240 berries.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.750
What we cannot do is
something that's beyond this.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.630
So for example, we can't
get a scenario like this.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.270
So this right over here
would be impossible

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.290
Let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.680
Let me scroll, see
my scrolling thing.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.850
OK, so this right over
here is impossible,

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.350
this point right
over here where I'm

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.372
getting 5 rabbits
and 200 berries.

00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:10.580
If I'm getting five rabbits,
I'm spending all my time

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.079
on rabbits.

00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:12.770
I have no time for berries.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.430
Or another way to think about
it, if I'm getting 200 berries

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.920
I don't have enough
time to get 5 rabbits.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.359
So this point is impossible.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.650
This point would be impossible.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:26.530
Any point that's on this side
of the curve is impossible.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.507
Now any point that's on
this side of the curve,

00:09:29.507 --> 00:09:31.340
you can kind of view
it as inside the curve,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.940
or below the curve, or to
the left of the curve-- all

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.610
of these points right
over here are possible.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.620
All of these points
right over here

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.180
are-- these points, for
example, it is very easy for me

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.110
to get 1 rabbit and 200 berries.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.030
So that right over
there is possible.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.970
Now, is that optimal?

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.750
No, because if I were
to really work properly,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.550
I could get many more berries.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.670
Or I could get more rabbits.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.980
If I have 200 berries, I
could get more rabbits.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.390
Or if I'm concerned, if
I only want one rabbit,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.910
I can get more berries.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.890
So this is possible.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.660
All of the points down
here are possible.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.760
But they aren't optimal.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.360
They are not efficient.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.650
So the points in here, we'll
say that they are not efficient.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.080
Maybe somehow I'm not using
my resources optimally

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.260
to do this type of thing,
when I'm over here.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.620
Or maybe I'm just not
being optimally focused,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.721
or whatever it might be.

00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.470
If you're talking about
a factory setting,

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.136
when you're talking
about maybe deciding

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.180
to make one thing or
another, then maybe

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.670
you just aren't using the
resources in an optimal way.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.040
Now all the points on the
frontier-- these are efficient.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.876
You're doing the
most you can do.

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:46.500
Right now we're not
making any judgment

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.750
between whether any
of these possibilities

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.240
are better than any
other possibility.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.890
All we are saying
is that you are

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.362
doing the most that you can do.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.820
Any of these things,
you are making

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.120
the most use of your time.
