EVAN CAROTHERS: Docalytics
is a technology platform

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.280
for sales and marketing
professionals.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.264
And we allow them to track
metrics and engagement

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:14.680
around their
downloadable content.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.214
So things like white papers,
case studies, ebooks.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:19.755
We give them insight into how
that content is getting engaged

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.255
to sell the market
more effectively.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.520
Start-up weekend,
me and Ryan worked

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.890
tirelessly for over a
year, nights and weekends,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.270
in our basement to get
the product to market.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.766
Entirely bootstrapped and
founder-funded for a long time.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.890
We ended up participating
in an accelerator program

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.982
this last summer in
Wisconsin called gener8tor.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:40.690
So that gave us some
initial seed funding

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.314
to get through that
accelerator program

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:44.579
as we got our product
completely into the marketplace.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.120
And from there,
we're just continuing

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.400
to grow our customer base.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.560
And we raised just over $500,000
of what we're calling a Series

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.112
A to get us to
that next milestone

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:57.570
where we can hope to raise the
largest Series A investment.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.940
It's beautiful to be a
technologist because it's fun

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.887
to work on things that
are difficult problems

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:04.470
and stuff that you know is going
to have a change in the world

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.969
market.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.410
So we bootstrapped because it
was a smart financial decision

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.552
for the company initially,
but also because we're

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:12.260
really passionate
about what we're doing,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.460
and it made sense to get our
product scalable strongly

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.460
in the market before we
went to raise any money.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.168
STEVE PECK: Yeah.

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:19.820
And what I would add
to that is that it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.652
was a conscious decision
to have something

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:23.110
to offer in the
marketplace and get

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.930
some early traction and early
wins with some key accounts

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.440
so that when we did go
to find that funding

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.060
it was an easier process
because we already

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.340
had use cases and key
customers to reference.
