that make things better and obviously
 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.590 align:start position:0%
that make things better and obviously
you<00:04:54.370><c> can</c><00:04:54.550><c> act</c><00:04:54.729><c> in</c><00:04:54.910><c> ways</c><00:04:55.030><c> that</c><00:04:55.270><c> make</c><00:04:55.449><c> things</c>

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
you can act in ways that make things
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.370 align:start position:0%
you can act in ways that make things

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 align:start position:0%
really way worse and so the question is
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.930 align:start position:0%
really way worse and so the question is
well<00:04:59.650><c> are</c><00:04:59.800><c> there</c><00:04:59.979><c> ways</c><00:05:00.130><c> that</c><00:05:00.160><c> you</c><00:05:00.580><c> can</c><00:05:00.729><c> act</c>

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 align:start position:0%
well are there ways that you can act
 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
well are there ways that you can act

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 align:start position:0%
that make things really much better and
 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.430 align:start position:0%
that make things really much better and
