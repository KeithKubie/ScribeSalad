00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 How many solutions does the following system of linear equations have? 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.160
 Here is what this system is about. There are several ways to decide. 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.240
 One is graphic. We have to decide if they are 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.180
 of the same rights and accordingly have an infinite number of decisions, 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.480
 or are parallel, i.e., will never cross, and then there is no solution, 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.260
 or intersect at one point and then we will have one solution. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.780
 But let's approach algebraically. Let's try to solve it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.620
 system and see what we will get. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.600
 The first equation will leave it unchanged 5x-9u = 16. Want 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.480
 to shorten members with x, so I will multiply the second equation 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.400
 by minus one and so -5x and 5x will be destroyed each other. 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.480
 I multiply the second equation by minus one 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:00.660
 and the result is -5x + 9u = -36 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.000
 Now I will gather the left side of the equation with the right, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.160
 to get a new equation. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.760
 5x - 5x 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.400
 is equal to zero. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.420
 -9u + 9u will also be zero, 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.280
 which makes 0 on the left side, 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.540
 but on the right 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.400
 we have 16 - 36 = -20 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 And now I find myself with a strange equation, 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.220
 according to which 0 equals -20 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.200
 It is logical to think that this can not be true. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 But the way we have to think in this case is 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.300
 "Are there values ​​for x and y where 0 is equal to -20?" 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.500
 No, 0 will never be -20. Does not matter 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
 what are the x and y values. There is no 0 equal to -20. 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.960
 In fact, x and y disappeared from this equation. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 There is no way this is true. 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.649
 So I will write "No solutions." 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.560
 If you draw these lines, you will notice that they are parallel, 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 therefore they have the same slope at different intersections with y. 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.600
 And that's why we have no solution - they do not intersect. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 Let's solve another problem. It is very funny. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.079
 How many solutions does the following system of linear equations have? 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.560
 I will leave the first equation unchanged: -6x + 4y equals 2. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 And the second one? See if I can cut the member with x. 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 If I multiply it by 2, I will get + 6x. 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.200
 I will multiply this whole equation, both sides, by 2. 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.260
 I will get: 6x (3x by 2 is 6x) -2y by 2 is -4y 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.700
 and this will be -2. Now let's do the following. 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.623
 Let's collect the things on the left and the things on the right. 

00:02:57.623 --> 00:03:00.300
 So -6x + 6x will be equal to 0. 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.540
 4y - 4y is 0. On the left side we have 0. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.400
 On the right side we have 2 + minus 2, also equals 0. 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.800
 It's a bit different and yet it looks weird 0 = 0. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.100
 Last time, we had 0 equals -20. 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.669
 Now we have 0 = 0. Let's think - equality even though x and y are gone 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.105
 already in the equation ... 

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.810
 Then which pair of values ​​for y and y will give 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 true equality 0 = 0? Does not matter, 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.500
 this will be true for any pair of values ​​of x and y. 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 In fact, x and y are no longer involved in the equation. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.129
 0 will always be equal to 0, 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.840
 here we can have countless solutions. 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.709
 And because they are the same lines - they just look different 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.400
 algebraically, but if you plot one of them on a scale ... 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.700
 If you multiply both sides of the second equation by -2, 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.053
 you will get the first equation. 

00:03:58.053 --> 00:04:00.300
 Yes, they represent the same rights. 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.520
 We have countless solutions. 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.879
 When trying to find the solution of the following system 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.800
 of linear equations, Yvonne takes a number of faithful steps, 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.320
 which lead to equation -5 is equal to 20. 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.400
 How many solutions does the linear equation system have? 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.500
 I do not even have to look at the system. 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.210
 Because she has received something that can not be true: -5 never 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.700
 will not be equal to 20, and that shows us that she has no solution. 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.539
 And if you try to draw the graphics, you'll see 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.200
 that they are parallel. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.300
 That's why they have no solution. They never cross. 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.960
 There is no pair of values ​​for x and y that satisfies both conditions. 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.200
 Let's decide a few more. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.770
 When trying to find a solution 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.430
 of the following system of linear equations, Albus performs several 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.400
 the correct steps that lead to the equation 5y equals -5. 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.340
 How many solutions does this system have of linear equations? 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.740
 5y equals -5. 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.750
 We can divide both sides to 5 and get y = -1. 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.740
 And if we substitute in y = -1 in the first equation, 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.169
 if y is equal to -1, the result is +2. 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.750
 You can draw 2 on both sides and get 5x = 4. 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.500
 Or you will get what x is equal to 4/5. 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 Or, if you put -1 here, you will get 5x - 3 = 1. 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.000
 You can add 3 on both sides and you will get 5x = 4. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.400
 x is equal to 4/5. 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.100
 So we have only one solution. We obtain x is equal to 4/5, 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.300
 y is equal to -1. 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.900
 Let's decide one more. 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.000
 By trying to solve the following system of linear equations, Leaven 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.980
 performs several correct steps that lead to 0 = 0. 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.889
 I do not even have to look at that. 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.969
 Zero zero is always true, 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.770
 it will have countless decisions.
