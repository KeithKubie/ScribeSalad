00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.640
To determine the correlation coefficient, we're just going to run

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.290
our cor.test function. We'll pass at our two variables,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.430
www likes received, and likes received. This gives us

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.700
a correlation of .948. This is a strong positive

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.110
correlation, and in reality most variables are not correlated

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.350
that closely. The correlation that we just found was

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.880
an artifact of the nature of the variables. One

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.140
of them was really a super set of the other.
