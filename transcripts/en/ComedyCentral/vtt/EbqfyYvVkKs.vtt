HERE'S THE FIRST ONE.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.037

DEFICATED IN MY PANTS.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:50.217
&gt;&gt; MARY LYNN.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.418

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.010
MARY LYNN.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:25.085
&gt;&gt; OUR DAD IS DAVE COULIER. OUR
MOM IS A LEMUR.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:25.986
&gt;&gt; JUSTIN.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:31.558

GET ME AWAY FROM THIS
DEAD-EYED MONSTER.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.370
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE BABY REFERS TO

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:46.807
IN THE PICTURE, COME ON.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.010
HE WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE
RIGHT TO HIMSELF, I GET IT.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:55.516
THIS KID PROBABLY GREW UP JUST
LIKE THIS.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.184
&gt;&gt; HA HA HA HA.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.652
&gt;&gt; MARY LYNN.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:04.491
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS,
PEANUTS ARE ALLERGIC TO ME.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.994
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; JUSTIN.

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.780
&gt;&gt; HE'S GIVING ME THE CREEPS.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:38.392
&gt;&gt; LAST ONE. THIS SAD PRINCE
AND/OR PRINCESS.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:44.231
&gt;&gt; HE BLOCKED ME ON INSTAGRAM.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:48.669
