00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.700
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: So good morning.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.900
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.200
How many of you have
been here before?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.500
All right.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.270
How many of you have
never been here before?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.570
So good mix.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.900
I'm Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960
I direct educational
outreach here at the library.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.000
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: And I'm Mary Lou
Reker, and I oversee the doctoral

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.350
and post-doctoral fellowships
here at the library

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.180
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: And we are
really tickled that you're here.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.550 position:56%
A couple of months ago when Mary Lou
approached me and said we're going

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.120
to have a small group of World
War One scholars at the library

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.790
in the spring doing research
on political cartoons

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.210 position:56%
to see what we can glean about World
War One simply through the cartoons

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
that were published in newspapers
around the world, I was intrigued

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.720
because I remember when
I was in the classroom,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.970
my students got a real kick out of
political cartoons, and she said,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.410
"We need your help identifying some
groups of students who could come

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.290
and work with the scholars."

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.370
And I got to tell you when she
said World War one scholars,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.240
the picture in my head was not
quite what you're getting today.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.990
And without being completely
cruel to World War One scholars,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.060
I sort of had an image of a lot

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.530
of old guys wearing
tweed and smoking pipes.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.050
The scholars you're going to
work with today do not fit

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.920
that description at least not yet.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.500
Maybe in another 40
years or so, but not yet.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.200
So I had a chance yesterday
to hear what they had planned,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.560
and I think you are really
going to enjoy today.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: Absolutely.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.550
And one of these scholars gave me
a quote this morning, thanks Max,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.430
that this was published
this morning by Politico.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.750
A lot of you know Politico, right?

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.170
The magazine that's been
published here in D.C.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.930
for about what, 10, 12 years now.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.020
Every week Politico cartoonists
throughout the country

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.680
and across the political spectrum
apply their ink stained skills

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.380
to capture the [inaudible]
, memes, hypocrisies,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.420
and other head slapping events
of the world of politics.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.310
The fruits of these labors and
hundreds of cartoons that entertain

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.960 position:56%
and enrage readers of all political
stripes, and you're going to see how

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.420
that happened in the
World War One era.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.610
A hundred years ago this year,
the US entered World War One.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.740
The war had been going
on since 1914,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.880
and you'll learn a whole
lot about it today.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.180
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Great.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.540
And one last thing that I want
to make sure you're aware of.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.340
So today you're working
with political cartoons.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.340
They come from newspapers that are
in the collections of the library,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.140
but what you need to know is that
this is just a teeny tiny fraction

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.290
of what is here in the
Library of Congress.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.020
Some people describe the
library as the largest collection

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.870
of human knowledge and creativity
ever assembled on this planet.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.070
Every time I say that or even think
about it, I get all goose bumpy

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.110
and why I do is because I
know that that knowledge

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.380
and creativity isn't just in the
materials that the library holds

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.550 position:56%
but it's in the people who are here.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.150
So today, I am really hopeful
that the knowledge and creativity

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.830
that you all have really
shines through.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.000
We've got students from at least
nine different schools represented

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.300
in the room.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.600
Some of you know each other well.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.900
Some of you don't know
each other at all.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.530
You're going to have a
chance to meet each other

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.760 position:56%
and I really hope you take advantage
of that opportunity to talk

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.470
to each other and learn from each
other and really talk to and learn

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.110
from these scholars
because they know stuff,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.830
and the way that they're
finding out what they know,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.830
those are the real lessons that
I hope you take away from today

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.570
because they're cool scholars
who want answers to questions

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.440
and that's exactly what
you young people are.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.040
So thank you for being here.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.020
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: Oh, one
of the ways they've done

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.160
that is by collaborating.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.810
And so, they have set up a whole
forum for you to collaborate

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.850
with each other today and that will
unroll over the next hour or so.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.160
I was going to add to what you
said Lee Ann about the type

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.560
of collections that are here, and
not only are they huge in number

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.240
but the range of what's here.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.570 position:56%
Everything from the papers of George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.930
to Rosa Parks and the NAACP
to posters that are connected

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.230
with Cesar Chavez campaign
for justice among farmworkers.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.540
So the ranges of --

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.210
&gt;&gt;Lee Ann Potter: And [inaudible],
and maps and audio recordings.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.990
The film. How's that
for [inaudible].

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker:
[Inaudible] movies too.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.390
Yes. And I would love for the five
scholars and the artist scholar

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.330
to step forward here because
we're going to introduce you.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.630
[ Applause ]

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.670 position:56%
If you each could say a word or two.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:39.650
I want to introduce first
Armenoui Kasparian Saraidari.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.140
&gt;&gt; Armenouis Kasparian
Saraidari: Hello guys.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.720
It's great to have you here.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.440
So, we are six scholars coming
from different disciplines each

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.090
of which will introduce themselves,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.250
and I'm the what they called
the past few days artist.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.310
I'm a practice-based researcher
where I combine archival research,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.930
theoretical research, and I do art.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.120
So you will be having your
sessions with these people,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.620 position:56%
and I will be around to help you and
guide you through the art activities

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.240
and the practical activities
that you are about to do.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.740
So if at any point you
need specifically my help,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.350
just wave on me and I'll be
there in one or two minutes.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.010 position:56%
And I'm really thrilled to be here
with you and hope this is a creative

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.600
and joyful session for you.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.510
Welcome.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.430
[ Applause ]

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.730
&gt;&gt; Adam Sheriff: Hi all.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.660
It's a thrill to be here and
thank you for joining us.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.960
My name is Adam Sheriff.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.440
I'm from London, and if you're
joining me, we'll be looking

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.160
at the causes of the
first World War.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.810
I normally work on Second World
War but I think I know a couple

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.470
of things or enough to guide you

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.040
through an hour on
the First World War.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.340
Yes, pleasure to meet you all.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.640
Thank you.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.940
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: All right.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.240
What number is it?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.540
&gt;&gt; Adam Sheriff: It's table five.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.840
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: You said five.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.260
Who's got the number
five on their map?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.560
&gt;&gt; Adam Sheriff: Excellent.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Lou Reker: Okay.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.220
So folks are going to
go to Adam's table.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.930
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Go ahead.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.020
&gt;&gt; Maximillian Buschman:
Hi, I'm Max.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.900
I'm from the University of Munich
and I write my Ph.D. on the history

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.370
of hunger strikes within the
United States and beyond,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.990
and I will be at table three
and even my Ph.D. is focusing

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.990
on what many people consider

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.220
as a non-violent form
of political protest.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.040
I will focus today on
the theme of violence

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.260
and how violence was depicted in
political cartoons at the time.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.830
Well, I'm really glad to be here.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.160
Thank you so much for having
me and thank you so much

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.460
for coming and joining us today.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.340
It's a pleasure.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.640
Yes. Table three.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.130
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Lerg: Hey
my name is Charlotte.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.830 position:56%
I'm also from Munich so I'm a German
scholar who teaches American history

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.790
so there's already some kind
of weird connection there,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.200
and I'm here as a German
doing American history

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.130
in America to American students.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.860
So this is a fantastic setup.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.170
I'm really looking forward to
getting your input as well,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.230
and I'll actually be looking
at the American perspective

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.560
on Germany during the
neutrality years.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.830 position:56%
So if you're in my group, which is
I think two, that's what we're going

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.330
to be doing, and we had a
fantastic week preparing this

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.510
and I'm looking forward to sharing
this with all of you so welcome.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.940
[ Applause ]

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.240

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.540
My name is Charlie.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.220
I'm from London, but I'm
spending this year in Texas.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.180 position:56%
I haven't quite got the accent yet
but I'll get there by the end of it.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.000
I'll be talking to you
about maps and the way

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.040
in which cartoons are
depicted on maps,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.620
and whether that's people
representing countries

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.920
or that's animals.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.360
Whether that's bears,
dogs, all manner of things.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.700 position:56%
We'll be looking at this in map form

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.810
and I'm real excited
that you guys are here.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.110
I'm in group one.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.430
You'll be joining me in the
Woodrow Wilson room over there

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.820
so that should be very exciting for
you from Woodrow Wilson High School

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.800
to be in your namesake's library.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.820
I'm really looking forward
to working with you today.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.510
Thank you.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.090
I'm Andrew Karr.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.390
I'm from the University of Lincoln.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.160
I'm a propaganda scholar.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.690
I did my Ph.D. thesis on World
War Two propaganda comics

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.740
so yes you can get a
doctorate looking at comics

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.870
which is why I ended
up here at the Library

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.850
of Congress several years ago

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.530
because they have the largest
collection of comics anywhere

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.460
in the world so I pretty
much got to geek

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.640
out for six months reading comics.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.940
It was fantastic.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.240
Absolutely wonderful.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.030
And I'm at table four, and I'll
be taking you through the history

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.090
of the First World War with a
particular focus on the allies

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.170
and the enemies and the
story of how that changed

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.490
and how those battles have
shifted and the conflicts they came

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.170
into from 1914 all the way
through to the Armistice in 1918.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.360
So I look forward to
working with you all.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.000
It's a pleasure to be here, and
I'm very glad to see all of you.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.610
I look forward to meeting you.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.520
Have a good day.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.100
&gt;&gt; Maximillian Buschmann:
I'm Maximillian Buschmann.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.440
I'm from the University
of Munich in Germany.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.920
I'm a Ph.D. student and in my
Ph.D. thesis I focus on the history

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.680
of hunger strikes in the first
half of the 20th century,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.920
and some of my key case
studies focus on hunger strikes

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.270
of American suffragettes

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.900
and conscientious objectors
during World War One.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.200
&gt;&gt; Armenoui Kasparian Saraidari:

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.410
My name is Armenoui Kasparian
Saraidari, and I'm a scholar

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.020
at Central Saint Martin [inaudible]
University of Arts London,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.790
and I've been a Kluge fellow
here before working primarily

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.550
with photographic archives
and making connections

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.530
with the contribution in collective
memory of the Armenian diaspora.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.440
I'm here today for
the week-long event

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:13.620 position:56%
that the Kluge Center has put
together which [inaudible] cartoons.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.200
&gt;&gt; Andrew Karr: Hi, I'm Andrew
Karr, and I'm from the University

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.130
of Lincoln, and I'm
a propaganda scholar.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.390
Well I was a formal Kluge fellow.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.580
I was over here looking
into the comic book archive

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.500
for my doctoral thesis
so on propaganda comics

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.110
in the Second World War,
and I was invited back

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.580
for this wonderful event
by the Kluge Center,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.880
and I'm very happy to be here.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.570
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Lerg: My
name is Charlotte Lerg.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.990
I teach American History at
the University of Munich,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.190
and I have been at the Kluge
for six months last year

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.780
and delightful to be back.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.590
So this week has been an
amazing week of teamwork

00:11:53.590 --> 00:12:00.010
to create a work-a-thon for
students, for high school students

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.180
to work with cartoons from the
first World War and to use those

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.810
to help them understand history,
and I'm generally really interested

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:15.630
in finding new ways of
bringing history to kids.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.660
Well, I work with undergraduate
students at home but it's great

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.990
to get to know how to
work with different ages.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.290
&gt;&gt; Adam Sheriff: I'm Adam Sheriff.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.860
I'm from London.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.350
I'm based at the University
of Lincoln.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.650
I was a Kluge fellow four years ago

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.870
around this time and
thrilled to be back.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.260
I generally work on Second
World War American comics

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.880
and historical analysis.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.900
So I focus on methodology.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.780
Well I was very graciously
invited back to participate

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.930
in this work-a-thon with
fellow former Kluge scholars

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.860
in a new grouping.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.270 position:56%
So I was familiar with one colleague
but have made four new ones

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.020
such as has been thrilling,
and we're working

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.240 position:56%
on World War One editorial
cartoons from newspapers with a view

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.760
to running workshops for
local high school children

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.460
on different themes of the war.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.000
&gt;&gt; Charles Laderman: So, my
name is Charlie Laderman.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.730
I'm an academic at
King's College London,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.110
and I teach in the war
studies department there

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.710
in international history.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.740
But I'm spending this year at
the University of Texas at Austin

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.740
and my research focuses on the
first World War on the remaking

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.630
of the Middle East the
making of the Ottoman Empire,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.920
and I'm particularly
interested in the origins

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.630
of international government.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.920
And I did humanitarians,
human rights,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.970
and the sort of transformation
of the international system

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.320
around the First World War.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.250
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Lerg:
I can only predict

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.880 position:56%
that we will have very diverse
outcomes depending on the background

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.240
of the students, depending
on the classes that they had

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.270
because we are inviting
several schools from the area

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.150 position:56%
of Washington D.C., but the students
are coming from history classes.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.710 position:56%
Some students come from art classes.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.110
So they will come from
different backgrounds

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:11.740
and then they will have different
focus probably on historical themes

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.820
and subjects or some others will
focus more on the aesthetics

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:26.200 position:56%
of cartoons or the way that they
can react to what they have learned.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.750
I hope for some very creative and
wealthful and unique outcomes.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.900
I can't wait to see it actually.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.940
&gt;&gt; Maximillian Buschmann: At
my table I'm going to focus

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.870
on the theme of violence
during World War One

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.190
and how was it depicted

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.400
in the editorial cartoons
especially from the American side.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.410
So I will show them a couple
of cartoons from the beginning

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:54.680
of the war where violence
and atrocities are depicted

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.380
as like an effect of war itself.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.420 position:56%
So [inaudible] I came up with the
idea that we could help the students

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.830
and photoshop cartoons from the
German magazines and [inaudible].

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.470
With the photoshop
cartoons and these items,

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.220
they can create their own cartoons.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.650
They can create their
own narratives.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.920
We will give them pens
to mark something,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.710
to draw frameworks, to draw lines.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:29.250
Well, kind of alternate
the story which is depicted

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.900
in the photoshop cartoon
and by that they can learn

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.160
and get an impression
how cartoonists work.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.800
&gt;&gt; Armenouis Kasparian Saraidari: I
will help out with the activities.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.460
So throughout the week
we have worked closely

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.900
to create five different activities
that focus on the [inaudible]

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.650
of the cartoon, focus on
the presentational methods

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.850
of the cartoons, and we
have designed five different

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:00.290
methodologies that the student
can work either in pairs

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.250
or in a bit larger groups
like groups of four people

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:10.310 position:56%
to recreate cartoons themselves but
also to understand specific meanings

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:16.460
like what Charlotte described,
culture, civilization or barbarism

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.480
or massacres in the war
or violence in the war.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.780
So for example, we will be
putting together some collages,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:33.560
and I will encourage students to
find their own visual language

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.980
by using words or symbols or
arrows to express the dynamics

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.250
that were going on
during the war and how all

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.540
that as a narrative can
come through a cartoon.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.380
So I will be overseeing
how the activities are done

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.900
and encourage every student,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.900
even the ones that have
never had art classes,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.900
that this is a wonderful
opportunity to learn, understand,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.560
express themselves, collaborate.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.740
Of course it's also a fun day.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.630
It's a day of school, and I guess

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:13.280 position:56%
that the students would be really
excited to be in such a unique place

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.390
at the Library of Congress
and put their hands

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:23.360
on either the reproductions
of the cartoons or even look

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:31.390
at large scale maps that the
geography map [inaudible] have here

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.210
today in our presentation.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.910
&gt;&gt; Andrew Karr: Well, I'm
going to take them through,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.210
the sort of narrative of the
First World War from start

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:44.860
to the Armistice and with the
freedom of allies and enemies.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.700
So who's who's allies?

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.120
Who are the enemies?

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.220
How does this change across
the duration of the conflict?

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.190
What were the reasons for it
becoming a global conflict?

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.690
Then you've got this [inaudible]
Italian guy on the left-hand side.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.910
The Russian steamroller and
you've got the Swiss neutral.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.710
Trying to get their
heads a little bit

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.330
around the end [inaudible]
trench warfare and then put some

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.490
of these difficult subjects from
the source material of the cartoons

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.480
to illustrate them and we should
hopefully help engage them

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.030
and [inaudible] understanding.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:22.000
And along with that, we
have an activity from our --

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.340
the artists we've been
working with [inaudible]

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.910
which I think is fantastic.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:30.990
I think when you construct their
own first World War cartoon

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.070
and from a number of elements

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.180
that we've selected working
closely together across the week

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.230
so that they can build up their
own record and interpret the events

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:46.430
in their own way and produce this
cartoon at the end of the day

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.350
which I'm very excited
to see the results of.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.220
&gt;&gt; Charlotte Lerg: I
want to do two things.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:57.420
One thing is I want to explain to
them how one particular feature

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.990
of cartoons is the connection
between words and images

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.330
and how especially by
juxtaposition you can sort

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.980
of create a new message.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.520
One of the fears was that the
war would come over in terms

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.910
of the immigrants would then kind
of take their conflict into America

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:21.800
and that was another reason
why he stressed to be neutral

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.510
in thought but also in deed.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:29.500
At the content level I'm going to
look at German-American relations

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.650
and particularly I want to look
at terms like culture or culture

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:41.010
which turns into almost like a
propaganda term over the years

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.670
and changes its meanings
so I want to also discuss

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.050
with the students how sometimes
words can change meaning overtime.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.620
&gt;&gt; Adam Sheriff: We're going
to be focusing on the courses

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.480
of the First World War and the
outbreak of the First World War.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.570
What I'm hoping to do
with the students is

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.440
to give them the different factors
involved whether it's imperial

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.480
issues, colonial issues, or
the naval race or trouble

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.260
in the Balkans, all these different
aspects that play into one another

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.670
and in the short-term factors like
the fascination of Franz Ferdinand

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:22.520 position:56%
and give the students an opportunity
to create their own cartoons.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.870
This is the exercise Armand

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.180
and I have devised together whereby
they'll create their own cartoons

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.030
according to how they think
the war would have come about.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.880
And what's great about the
courses of the First World War is

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.110
that if you understand all the
factors and you assemble them

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.260
in a way that makes sense to
you and you can defend it,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.660
you can't be wrong that there
isn't a right answer to this.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.990
So I'm hoping that the
students will find that engaging

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.330 position:56%
because it's an opportunity for them

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.770
to bring their own
subjectivity to the table.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.340
&gt;&gt; Charles Laderman: So what
I'll be doing is teaching them

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:01.050
about the changing map through
cartoons and what we'll be looking

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.130
at which I've been
able to come up with

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:08.200
with Armand who's just been doing
fantastic [inaudible] wonderful,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.800
and what we're going to be doing
is a jigsaw puzzle using the pieces

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.570
of these cartoon maps to show
them to the students how the map

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.330
of Europe changed [inaudible]
in artistic forms

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.420
and then the idea will be to
show them the original maps

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.820
from the Library of
Congress's board.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.310
These remarkable maps.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.610
,The German dog

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.770
and the Austrian-Hungarian
dog attached together,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.090
and they're actually sort of
caught together by their leads.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.450
Because of the treaty they're
forced to fight with each other

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.250
and in the writing
underneath it talks

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.530
about the Germans having no ally
apart from the Austria-Hungarians.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.510 position:56%
And these maps, to have the physical
artifact before the mapping will be

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.810
wonderful for the students.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.440
So the idea is to show how the
map of Europe changed and also

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.970
to show how a mentality
in Europe changed.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.490
These maps, you see them at the
beginning of the war in 1914; 1915.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.530
We don't see these maps
by the end of the war

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.020
in some sense this
more innocent time.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.030
This more sort of playful
idea about the map of Europe

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.340
that transformed beyond all
[inaudible] description and the map

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.510
of Europe is also transformed.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:23:38.130
[ Music ]

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.990

of the Library of Congress.
