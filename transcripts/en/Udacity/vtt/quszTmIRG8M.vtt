00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.570
In this lesson, we look at the aggregation framework

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.730
in MongoDB and how we can use it to analyze

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.820
our data and even do a little bit of additional

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.050
cleaning. We also looked at indexing and what it means

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.152
to create indexes in MongoDB. In the next lesson, we're

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:18.176
going to be putting together the pieces from the entire

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:22.190
course. We'll be looking at extracting, auditing and cleaning our

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.770
data, as well as doing some analysis in a case

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.330
study involving the OpenStreetMap data set. Let's get started.
