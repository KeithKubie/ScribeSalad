00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.221
- [Instructor] in a previous video,

00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:03.580
we introduced this flowchart
that helps us think

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.758
about what strategies to use

00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:08.984
when trying to determine
a limit of a function

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.056
as it approaches a point.

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:12.292
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:16.661
is now try to apply that in
several example exercises.

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.490
So the first question,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.898
they say based on the
process in the flowchart,

00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:26.016
let's try to find the limit as
x approaches three of f of x

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:28.801
for f of x is equal to this business.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.841
What are the steps that
we should go through?

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.425
And they have these various steps,

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:35.783
and you might say, "Well what
is A and B and C, D and A?"

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:40.198
Well if you go back to
the original flowchart,

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:42.664
you see this is A, this is B,

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:45.649
this is C, this is D,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.482
So let's,

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:50.734
let's just first try to substitute,

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:54.276
see if we can get a value for f of three.

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.484
If f of three works, then
we are essentially done

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:00.855
because this is not some
strange exotic function,

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:03.263
it seems like it's continuous,

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.604
around x equals three,

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:06.997
if f of three exists, let's try it out.

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:07.830
So let me,

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:12.007
so we're going to have f of three

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.750
is equal to the square root of,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.633
let's see six minus five,

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.749
two times three minus five,

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.266
minus one

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.183
over three minus three.

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.508
So in the numerator here we get zero,

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:31.172
'cause this is one minus one,

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:35.012
so this is going to be
equal to zero over zero.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:36.476
So the first thing that happens

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:38.462
is we fall into the,

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:40.086
in that we tried to evaluate it,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.319
we fell into indeterminate form.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.065
So the first step is going to be C.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.537
Now the next thing that I would do

00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:50.286
because we have a radical expression here,

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:53.745
is to see if I can take a conjugate.

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:56.790
So it's going to likely be,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.110
we're definitely gonna have C first.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.099
Then we're going to try E.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.971
And frankly that's the
only choice that has that,

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.732
but let's actually see if
that actually works, CEB.

00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:12.000
So let me multiply this
expression times a conjugate.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.250
So the square root of two x minus five,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.622
minus one over x minus three

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:22.648
times the square root of two x minus five

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:25.471
plus one, it's the conjugate here,

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.554
over square root of two x

00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:31.228
minus five plus one.

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:34.197
And this is going to be
equal to, see this numerator.

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:36.962
The square root of two
x minus five-squared

00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:39.806
is going to be two x minus five.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.725
And then you're going to have negative,

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.719
you have a minus one-squared

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.496
which is going to be minus one.

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:49.746
All of that over x minus three times

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:53.852
the square root of two x minus five,

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.534
plus one.

00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:59.984
Let's see this stuff up here, this is,

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:02.830
you can rewrite as two x minus six.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.739
Two x minus six,

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.480
which is the same thing as
two times x minus three.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.234
And so those cancel out nicely.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.007
And so let's see this
is going to be equal to

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:16.424
two over square root of two x

00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.409
minus five plus one.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.589
Now let's try to evaluate
this when x equals three.

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.937
Well if we do that, we're
going to get two over,

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:31.262
so this is going to be six
minus five, the square root,

00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:33.095
which is one plus one.

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.897
So it's two over two
which is equal to one.

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:39.644
So then we were able to evaluate it,

00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:41.511
and we actually got a value,

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.604
so we feel pretty good that we're done.

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:47.648
So we went from finding
indeterminate form,

00:03:47.648 --> 00:03:51.440
taking the conjugate and then
being able to evaluate it.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.903
Let me just show that right over here.

00:03:53.903 --> 00:03:55.495
When we immediately try to evaluate it,

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:57.202
we got indeterminate form.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.025
We recognize that it was a radical,

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:01.760
that it was a rational
expression with a radical on top.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.368
And so say, let's
multiply by the conjugate.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.142
We did that and then after we were able

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:06.293
to simplify it with the conjugate,

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:08.783
we tried to evaluate it again,

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:11.572
and we were able to get a real number.

00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:15.739
So we feel pretty good that
that is going to be the limit.
