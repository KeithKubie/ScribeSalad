00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.600
What’s the problem with science?!?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.550
I’m going to tell you my top 5.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.220
Hey there science fans!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.510
Dr. Kiki from This Week in Science here for
DNews.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.140
I’m used to talking about all the things
that are awe-worthy about science, but science

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.140
isn’t perfect.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.780
And, everyone should understand how.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.850
So, here’s my list of the big problems in
scientific research:

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.140
Across the board, we lack a complete picture
of the world around us because of a convenience

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.960
bias in scientific research.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.440
Typically, researchers are only able to study
animals in the wild when and where animals

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.370
are there, and when the scientists have time
to get into the field.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.260
Thanks to an academic research schedule where
researchers are teaching and students are

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.610
schooling during a majority of the year, most
research is being carried out during single

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.700
seasons rather than year-round.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.600
A recent analysis of over 2000 animal studies
published in major journals over 18 years

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.760
found that only 5% of them looked at how multiple
seasons interacted to affect an animal’s

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
biology.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.060
Additionally, there is a vast over-representation
of male subjects compared to females in the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.470
animal literature.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.409
Because males don’t have babies.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.159
Or, because researchers haven’t collected
enough animals for an analysis to be statistically

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.630
significant, studies don’t differentiate
between the sexes at all.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.009
Hopefully, this sex problem will change moving
into the future since the NIH has called for

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.439
better balancing of male and female subject
numbers in studies.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.320
While we’re at it, there are still more
men in science than women.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.869
Yes, more and more females are studying in
the sciences than ever before, but the people

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.020
in charge are still mainly men.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.479
The culture of the scientific endeavor continues
to favor men, as more men than women are still

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.779
hired for academic jobs beyond graduate school,
and more men than women are published in prestigious

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:48.779
journals.

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:54.359
And, the craziest point here, both men and
women in the sciences are to blame as both

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.619
sexes favor men two to one in situations like
hiring.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.249
Publication bias
Publication bias is the preference that some

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.249
journals show for publishing scientific research
that will be perceived as exciting, will therefore

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.930
get cited as a reference by more people, and
be considered impactful.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.920
It turns out that these journals also have
higher retraction rates and publish studies

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.719
that are less replicable.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.840
They sure might be exciting to learn about,
but over time as more data gets collected,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.980
high profile studies turn out to be more like
statistical coincidences.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.829
Results bias
The “publish or perish” ethic among scientists

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.420
has led to heavy competition to get published
in the leading journals.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.230
Those who do manage to get published can look
forward to many career benefits.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.950
So, it’s not hard to see how with the drive
to publish impactful research, researchers

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.430
often overlook negative results that could
be quite informative, or go so far as to cherry-pick

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.049
data for their analyses.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.170
Those are extreme examples, but combined with
personal unconscious biases we’re seeing

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.510
a large number of retractions in recent years,
and a decline in reproducibility of studies.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.860
Also, scientists who are still trying to cement
their careers are less likely to do studies

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.890
that try to replicate the results of others.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.840
There is no glory in being second, even though
it helps the entire scientific community.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.469
All this brings us to how science is funded.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.769
In the US, money can come from either public
or private sources.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.980
Changes to political priorities have left
less than 8% of researchers who apply for

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.469
government funding actually receiving it.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.889
Additionally, basic research that could lead
to long-term technological and economic gains

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.079
is being underfunded as government grants
emphasize “practical” research with more

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.379
immediate and conceivable payoffs.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.230
To make up for shortfalls from public funding,
researchers look for private funding, which

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.040
can lead to conflicts of interest that bias
studies.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.489
When the funding just can’t be found, investigators
have to downsize their labs and research efforts.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.230
And, this means less good science being done.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.930
I know all of this sounds pretty bad, but
it can be fixed.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.400
People within the scientific research community
are already working to improve the publication

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400
process, find new solutions to funding scientific
research (like crowd-funding), and remove

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.550
human bias from experiments.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.920
My advice to you: Be patient with the process,
continue to be awe-struck by science when

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.319
it’s deserved, and always be skeptical of
the extraordinary.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.599
Do you think I missed anything?

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:26.330
What do you think of my list?
