00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.336
Please let me get a 
divorce.

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.238
Although I have dreamed
of strangling the life

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.408
out of Victor's body
or having him get hit by a train

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.777
or drowning in a bath
of his own brandy vomit,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.113
I think it's kinder to have him
arrested for battery.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.516
Sorry about this, Victor,
but you're going to jail.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.525
Ah!

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.093
[grunts]

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.462 align:start position:0%
[crying]

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:33.466 size:81% position:41%
And that's when he hit me.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.268 align:end position:100%
I'm so sorry
for your pain, ma'am.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.137 align:end position:100%
Ay, you'll tell us who the black
fella was who did this,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.406 align:end position:100%
and we'll throw him
in the pokey right quick.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.609
Oh, no,
it--it was my husband.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.211
[cries]

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.647 align:start position:0%
Well, that's another
matter entirely.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.282 align:start size:38% position:63%
Case closed.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.250
I'm telling you,
I was abused by my husband

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.419
in a manner that only a divorce
would settle.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.254 align:end position:100%
Well, let me ask
you something, dear.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.422 align:start size:50% position:50%
Are you a bitch?

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:57.857
What?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.625 align:start position:0%
Let's go about this
in a different manner.

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.361 align:start position:0%
Were you menstruating
at the time of the incident?

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.597 align:end position:100%
Were you riding
the red river?

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.133 align:end position:100%
And do you have
a raspberry bush?

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.037
How dare you?
I was very abused!

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.472 align:start position:0%
Looks to me like
you walked into a door.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.107
[gasps]

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.374
Well, that's an outrageous
implication!

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.276
And precisely
the sort of assumption

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:19.312
that makes women feel unsafe
to report their abuse

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.147
to the police
in the first place!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.648 align:start position:0%
Well, the rule of thumb
clearly states

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.550 align:start position:0%
that a man can discipline
his wife

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:28.321 align:start position:0%
with anything no thicker
than his own thumb.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.324
Well, that's the dumbest rule
I've ever heard of!

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.127 align:end position:100%
And that, my dear, is why
your husband hits you.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.096 align:end position:100%
If you were my wife, I'd smack
some softness into you.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.532
And I'd have hit ya
to be a bit taller.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.634
Perhaps some larger bosoms.
Now that we've settled that,

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.536
would you mind running along,
sweetheart,

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.371
fetch us a spot of tea?

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.073 align:end position:100%
And perhaps a tour
of the premises.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:51.410 align:end position:100%
We hear there's a room
made entirely of candy.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.446
Well, infidelity and abuse
were a bust.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.616
I guess I'm going to have to
kill Victor if I want a divorce.
