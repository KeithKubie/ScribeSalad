00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
- [Instructor] By the
time the antidote arrived,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.840
87 days late, the men had
already turned to stone.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.974
So I don't know what
type of problem they had,

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.940
but turning to stone,
that seems pretty serious.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970
But let's look at the grammar of it.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:14.860
So it's underlined.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.680
By the time the antidote arrived, dash,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.701
87 days late, dash, the men
had already turned to stone.

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.232
So this seems like a
pretty good use of dashes.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.137
87 days late, it's a parenthetical,

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:30.009
they're giving us a little
bit of extra information

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.350
that is not necessary for the sentence.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.245
You could remove, you
could take this part out

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:38.240
right over here, you
could take this part out,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.419
and it won't, it would still be a sentence

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.440
that gives the same meaning.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.758
By the time the antidote arrived

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:45.850
the men had already turned to stone.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.714
So you could do that, but
adding that 87 days late

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.052
gives you a little, it gives
you some extra information,

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:54.870
it gives you some extra context
for what's going on here.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.961
So this parenthetical, it seems
like a good place to do it,

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.440
and it seems good to do it with dashes.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.150
This 87 days late, hey, that's a pretty

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.934
strong thing that you
would wanna insert in there

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.421
to add some important
context to the sentence,

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.025
and you'd want the dash on both sides.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.700
So I like it the way that it's written.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.990
Now, these other choices.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.333
You wouldn't want to start with
a comma and end with a dash,

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.457
and you wouldn't want to start

00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:17.215
with a dash and end with a comma.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:20.290
And you need something to separate it off.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.290
You wouldn't say, by the
time the antidote arrived

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710
87 days late the men had
already turned to stone.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.680
This right over here, this
right here is a parenthetical.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.970
You could put parentheses around it.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.585
But I actually like putting dashes here,

00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:32.264
because it's very important context.

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:35.797
A parentheses, that's for a parenthetical.

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:38.137
Hey maybe it's nice to know,
it's kind of a cute thing,

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:40.550
you could make a little bit of an aside.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.751
But dashes are, hey, this gives
you some powerful context.

00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.485
The antidote arrived 87 days late.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:50.570
So I definitely, so this
one, you need some type

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.020
of punctuation to mark
off the 87 days late.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.923
So I would rule that one out as well.
