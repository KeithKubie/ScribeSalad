00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.090
When a reboot is announced, many moviegoers
decry Hollywood of being unoriginal and out

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.090
of ideas.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
Why return to a well that’s been played
out when you could just try something new?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.980
But that viewpoint is somewhat limited.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.880
Every once in a while, filmmakers can take
old material and put a refreshing new spin

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.290
on it, generating interest in a once fading
brand.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.480
Here are Screen Rant’s 5 great reboots that
were better than the original movies.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.760
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.180
George Miller’s Mad Max franchise always
scored well with the critics, but 2015’s

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.110
Fury Road was on a whole other level.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.920
The reboot was one of the best reviewed films
of the year and was seen as a game changer

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.519
for the way action movies should be made.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.210
It was also nominated for 10 Academy Awards,
including Best Picture and Best Director.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.830
That’s quite an achievement for what was
once thought of as an R-rated niche flick

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.040
and not much else.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.940
In addition, it had an impressive run at the
box office, paving the way for more sequels

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.910
Dredd

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
Lots of viewers love Sylvester Stallone, but
there weren’t too many fans of the action

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.930
legend’s take on Judge Dredd.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.440
Critically panned and a flop financially,
the comic book adaptation killed a franchise

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.630
before it truly began.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.050
It took years for someone to try to revive
it, and in 2012, Dredd came out.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.480
The reboot was seen as an innovative use of
3D and a film that did supreme justice to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.620
the source material.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.970
Karl Urban won many people over with his dedicated
performance, which included never removing

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.970
the helmet.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.550
While Dredd was a critical smash, it bombed
at the box office, meaning the sequel is a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.550
no-go.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.550
Ocean’s Eleven

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.100
Getting a bunch of smooth criminals together
to rob casinos is a great premise, but the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.190
1960 version of Ocean’s Eleven didn’t
strike a chord with moviegoers, who found

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.720
it to be disappointing and boring.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.140
Over 50 years later, Steven Soderbergh assembled
a team of Hollywood A-listers to try it again,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.270
and the results were much more successful.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.790
Critics praised the remake for being slick,
breezy entertainment, and audiences basked

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.750
in the chemistry between the stars.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.570
The response to Ocean’s Eleven warranted
the release of two sequels, creating a trilogy

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.750
of capers that the original could only dream
of.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.810
Star Trek

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.140
The original Star Trek TV series is one for
the ages, but the first Trek movie left a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.340
lot to be desired.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.660
Its sequels were marked improvements, but
the brand truly didn’t get a new lease on

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.230
life until J.J. Abrams’ 2009 reboot.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.780
Though some were upset by its reliance on
action set pieces instead of heady sci-fi,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.310
Star Trek brought in a whole new generation
of fans while honoring the property’s storied

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.060
history in an effort to please all.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.620
The film even earned a Best Picture nod from
the Producer’s Guild of America, a claim

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.380
that not many popular blockbusters can make.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.530
The Incredible Hulk

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.780
While only a marginal step up from Ang Lee’s
2003 take, the MCU canon reboot did prove

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.310
to be a greater success.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.280
Taking the criticisms of the first film to
heart, The Incredible Hulk ramped up the action

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.700
sequences to give fans some smashing set pieces,
and Edward Norton delivered a typically great

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.090
performance as the lead.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.790
Box office wise, the film only earned slightly
more than the ’03 version, but it earns

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.880
points for being a solid hit and not killing
interest in the character.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.650
For all intents and purposes, the green giant
was fully integrated into the shared universe,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.349
and nobody was complaining.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.770
Those are our picks for great reboots that
were more successful than their original.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.870
Are there any we missed?

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.970
