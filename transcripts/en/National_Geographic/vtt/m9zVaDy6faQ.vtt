Don George: I'm really excited
about this conversation.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.078 line:0%
I'm just going to
jump right into it.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:50.716 line:0%
You've written about so
many subjects, 23 books.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.818
As far as I know, you've
never written about elephants,

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.554
so, I wanted to ask you
first of all,

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.990
what was the inspiration
for Leaving Time?

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.358
<i> Jodi Picoult: Well, it was...
 it had nothing to do</i>

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.694
with elephants at
first actually. ( laughter )

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.329 line:0%
So, I have three kids,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.266 line:0%
and my youngest is a daughter
named Sammy.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.135 line:0%
And she was getting ready
to go off to college.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.004
And her brothers had
already left,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.639
so, I was becoming
an empty nester.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.842
And it upset me more than
I thought it was going to.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.544
I was really thinking about

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.947
what it would be like
to be left behind.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.215
And somewhere in the middle
of all that thought,

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.817
I read an article, probably

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.552
in the National Geographic
magazine,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:29.722
that said that in the elephant
kingdom in the wild,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.457
a mother and
daughter elephant,

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.326
stay together
their whole lives,

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.794
until one of them dies.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.862
And I read that fact
and I thought,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.197
'well why don't we do
it that way?'

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.232
I mean, it's much more humane,
you know. ( laughter )

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.168
And it kind of got me
thinking and...

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.502
and I began to do a little

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.404
background research
on elephants.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.441
<i> And in particular,
 how their minds work.</i>

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.510
<i> A lot of people love
 elephants, or you know,</i>

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.246
<i> collect elephants,
 but don't necessarily realize</i>

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.081
<i> the cognitive abilities
 that elephants have.</i>

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.951
<i> They can feel grief
 and pain and loss</i>

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.820
<i> and they have
 incredible memories.</i>

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.955
All of those things are
part of the elephant brain

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.657
and the more I learned
about that,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.959
the more I realize this was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.693
the perfect metaphor
for the book

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.128
and that I had a profession

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.863
for one of the main characters
in the book.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.165
Oh. Part of the challenge
of the book

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.300
is that you are writing
in different voices.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.969
You are writing
in the voice of a scientist.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.972
Was it difficult as a writer

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.041
to switch your brain
to do that?

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.510
No, this book
is the story of...

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.845
this woman, Alice Metcalf,

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.947
who studies elephant grief
and cognition,

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.050
and she runs a sanctuary
with her husband and one night

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.951
there's a horrible tragedy
at the sanctuary.

00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:35.621
And a caregiver is trampled
by an elephant.

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.656
And the same night,
Alice disappears off

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.325
the face of the earth.
And the only...

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.960
the only person
who is a witness

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.195
is her three-year old
daughter, Jenna.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.865
The problem is Jenna
can remember none of it.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.236
And um... Jenna then begins
the book ten years later,

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.737
believing that
her mother never

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.239
would have left her willingly
and that

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.874
she is going to find
this woman.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.942
And she enlists
the help of a failed

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:58.377
psychic named Serenity,

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:00.413
and an alcoholic detective
named Virgil.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.681
And the three of them are

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.382
somehow going to find
her mother.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:04.951
But you also get to hear
from Alice,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.385
and the way you get to hear
from her

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:08.087
is the way Jenna
gets to hear from her.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:12.058
By pouring over her research
entries and her journals,

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.961
and that's what Jenna's
done for the past 10 years,

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.295
is try to find her mother

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:17.930
literally between the lines

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.265
of what she's left behind.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.234
Right. One of the things
that impressed me

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:24.370
so much about the book
was the beautiful, detailed

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.073
descriptions of elephant
behavior and just elephants.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:30.676
And so you must have done a lot
of research for that,

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.044
and I'm wondering how
you went about doing

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.212
- that research.
- Yeah.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.181
For this book, I knew that
I needed to see both elephants

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.384
in captivity and
elephants in the wild.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.386
Because the main character
in the book

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.221
whose name is Alice Metcalf,

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.056
who is actually missing
for most of the book.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.958
She drives the book
as her daughter Jenna

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.126
tries to find her.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.694
Alice is an elephant
researcher

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:51.163
who studies grief and
cognition in elephants.

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:54.500
And she studies them
in the wild in Botswana

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.070
and then she runs sanctuary
with her husband

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.538
in New England.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.774
So, I began by doing research
at a place called

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.443
The Elephant Sanctuary, which
is in Hohenwald, Tennessee.

00:04:04.443 --> 00:04:06.512
The elephants
who come to live there

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.881
are elephants
who have been in circuses

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.249
and zoos their entire life.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.051
And in many cases
have been very

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.485
horribly abused.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.588
Coming to the sanctuary
means that they have

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.624
hit the jackpot
of retirement homes.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.759
So, I got to see
how a sanctuary runs,

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.494
which was really important
for the book,

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.832
because a lot of the action
takes place in the sanctuary.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.200
But I also needed to know

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.068
what Alice's research
was about.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.136
<i> And so I went to Botswana</i>

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:33.139
<i> and I worked with
 an elephant researcher</i>

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.075
<i> who studies the migration of
 elephants in the Tuli Block.</i>

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.410
And, you know,
I got to observe some

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.412
incredible behaviors
of elephants

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.081
in their natural habitat,
which were phenomenal.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.317
Everything that you read
in the book is something that

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.751
either I experienced

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.053
or that I was told by someone
at the sanctuary

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:49.154
or by this researcher,

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.989
so every story in there
is true.

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.159
Wow. How long were you
at each place?

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.129
I was in... at the elephant
sanctuary for just

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.832
a smattering of days.
It was couple of days,

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.034
but it's, you know,
it's 2700 acres,

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:04.536
most of which I wouldn't be
able to access by foot,

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:05.704
because I'm not an elephant.

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:07.206
( laughter )
And something that

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.041
a lot of people don't realize
is that elephants

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.410
in captivity often die of
foot problems,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.745
<i> because they've been standing
 on concrete for so long</i>

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.281
<i> and if you think about it
 in the wild</i>

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.817
<i> an elephant gets to walk
 on top of different terrain.</i>

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.987
So, for example, there was
an elephant at the sanctuary

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:24.757
that had such severe cracks
in her feet, that Teva...

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.759
you know the Teva company
that makes sandals?

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.829
They made these giant Tevas
for her

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.797
and she wore these
giant Tevas...

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:33.933
- Wow.
- around for a while. Yeah.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.335
And then when I was in Botswana,
I was there for about a week.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.504
It was fantastic because
you get up every morning

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.239
and you would
basically go on safari.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.908
And I got to see this
fantastic matriarch.

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:45.511
The matriarch is the female

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.379
head of the herd,
who runs the herd.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.181
She is usually
the biggest elephant,

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.051
and the one who has
the most collective knowledge,

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.652
often the oldest elephant.

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:56.955
And she was leading her herd
up this little incline

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:58.624
and sliding down on her butt,

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.959
over and over, like it was
a little playground slide,

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.361
and it was so much fun
to watch this

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.363
whole herd just keep doing it.
( laughter )

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:07.699
And then we came across
two young males,

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.870
they had this giant dung ball
which was kind of gross,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.039
but they were kicking it back
and forth like it was soccer,

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.942
just back and forth,
it was totally play,

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.376
there was no other reason
for it.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.878
You know, so it was really fun

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.546
to be able to see
behaviors like that.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.114
- That's really, really great.
- Yeah.

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:24.584
Actually, so one of the
behaviors that fascinated me

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:26.052
because it is
so interesting is,

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.320
elephants grieving.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.156
There is a lot of
elephant grieving in the book,

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:34.493
because Alice Metcalf
who is this missing mom...

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:35.862
that her daughter, Jenna is

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:37.930
trying find
throughout the book,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.531
she studied elephant grief

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.735
and that was what really
amazed me the most

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.369
and people say,
"What's the coolest thing

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.239
you learnt about elephants?"
And it's that

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.208
they do have this depth of
understanding for loss

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.876
that I would not
have been able

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:53.445
prior to this, to attribute
to an animal.

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:56.081
Elephants that come across
the bones of another elephant

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:59.117
will get very somber,
their ears droop,

00:06:59.117 --> 00:07:02.621
their tails droop, they have a
complete behavioral change.

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.957
And what's really interesting
is that

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:07.160
they don't act this way around
any other bones,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.961
it's just the bones of
elephants.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.765
They have been known and
very often return to the site

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.368
where an elephant has died
for years afterward,

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.303
as if they are paying
respects,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.737
like they are going
to the grave site.

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:20.506
And again,
when they get there,

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.409
they get very quiet,
somber, reverential,

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.345
they stay for a few hours,
and then they move on.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.547
They've been known to break
into research facilities

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:30.316
in the middle of the night,
and steal a bone

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.783
that a researcher is
working with,

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.218
and bring it back to the site
of that

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:34.753
- elephant's death.
- Wow.

00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.456
And at The Elephant
Sanctuary in Tennessee,

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.926
there's this great story about
an elephant named Sissy.

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.495
Sissy survived the 1981 floods
in Gainesville...

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:46.098
by basically being submerged
for 24 hours

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.500
with just her trunk up,
like a little periscope.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.669
- Wow.
- So, she was really

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.004
traumatized by the time
she came to the sanctuary

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.074
and it took her very long time
to bond with other elephants,

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.076
which they let happen
naturally,

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:59.412
which of course is one of the
issues with the zoos

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.746
because you know,
you can't just

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:03.215
stick to elephants together
and expect them to be friends.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:05.951
So, she instead of bonding
with an elephant

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:09.088
began to carry around a tire,
like everywhere she went.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.289
It was like
a security blanket,

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.890
like a little pacifier.
And for years,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.793
she carried this tire around,
and then finally she bonded

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:16.495
with an elephant named Tina.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.097
For years,
they were inseparable,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:21.133
and then one day Tina got ill,
and she died.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.301
When she died,
Sissy stayed with her

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:24.870
the whole time she was dying,

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.339
stayed by her grave
for a day after she died,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.175
and then very carefully,

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.943
they watched her
take that tire,

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:34.346
and lay it on the grave,
kinda like we place a wreath.

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:36.549
And she left it there
for her friend.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.117
As if she knew that
her friend needed it more now.

00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:40.786
- Wow.
- Right? I know.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.721
( laughter )
Amazing.

00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:44.089
- That's really amazing.
- Yeah.

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:45.291
Maybe,
we should watch the clip

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.626
- on the elephant behavior.
- Oh yeah.

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:51.664
We have an amazing, wonderful
clip about elephant behavior

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:54.333
that we would like to share
with you all tonight.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.068 line:0%

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:14.653 line:0%

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:20.025
<i> Now, he is just looking at me.</i>

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.794
<i> And, he's now starting
 to shake his head,</i>

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.930
<i> and doing
 what I call a "head waggle".</i>

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.901
<i> Now,
 that's an invitation to play.</i>

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.036
<i> This is just really cute</i>

00:09:31.036 --> 00:09:35.908
<i> video of two young elephants,
 two juveniles,</i>

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:38.043
<i> doing what we call
 "play social rub".</i>

00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:39.544
<i> They are lying on the ground</i>

00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.880
<i> and just wiggling against
 each other.</i>

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.149
<i> Elephants love to do this.</i>

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:46.651
<i> Especially kind of
 in the late afternoon</i>

00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:49.421
<i> when they had a lot to eat,
 and they are feeling good.</i>

00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:51.590
<i> This was filmed
 in the evening.</i>

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.660
<i> It was about
 an 11-year-old female</i>

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.830
<i> and two infant calves
 that she was looking after.</i>

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.900
<i> And she was so cute with them.</i>

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.570
<i> She just laid down in this
 sort of dust wallow here</i>

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.575
<i> and allowed them
 to clamber all over her.</i>

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:12.945
<i> Look, watch this
 balancing act here where he,</i>

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:16.548
<i> he tries to step on her,
 on her trunk,</i>

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:17.950
<i> but it is little bit
 too wiggly,</i>

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.251
<i> so then he decides,</i>

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:22.154
<i> okay, he'll just step
 right on her face instead.</i>

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.756
( laughter )

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.357
<i> She doesn't mind.</i>

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.259
<i> - Isn't that great?
 - It's wonderful.</i>

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.762
<i> It is so cool.</i>

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.663
And poaching, we haven't
really touched on it yet,

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.232
that's the sad thing
about elephants

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.366
that when you fall in love
with them,

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:35.701
then you begin to realize

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:37.035
that they are being killed
at a rate of

00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:38.804
38,000 elephants a year.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.805
And by that estimate,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.775
they'll be gone in the wild
in Africa in ten years.

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.710
And I don't know about you,
but I want my grandkids

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.346
be able to see elephants,
you know, so um...

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.581
it became very important
for me

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:50.882
to learn about poaching,

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:53.085
which I really didn't know
much about

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:53.953
and to...

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.587
to figure out
why it's important

00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:56.955
for us in this country,

00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:57.956
where we don't have elephants,

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:01.093
to really support
the initiatives to take care

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.694
of elephants that
are being threatened.

00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:05.096
We know that poaching is more

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:06.531
than just a wildlife concern,

00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:08.333
it's a humanitarian concern.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.135
They've linked the money
from poaching

00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:13.038
to Joseph Kony's Lord's
Resistance Army.

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.907
We know that Al-Shabaab

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.276
poaches one to three tons

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.045
of ivory every month
in Somalia, raising

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:21.413
$500,000 a month.

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:23.415
That goes a really long way
in Somalia

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:25.084
and Al-Shabaab has ties
to Al-Qaeda

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:26.084
and that's why it matters

00:11:26.084 --> 00:11:27.152
- in this country.
- Wow!

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.488
Without you or someone like
you writing about this,

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.923
there is a small fraction
of people

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.424
in the world
who would be aware of it,

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:33.759
and especially
in the United States.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.494
But everywhere that
your books are being sold

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.429
I just kinda felt like saying
on behalf of the planet,

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:39.298
- thank you for that.
- Wow, that's cool.

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.666
- I'll take that.
- No, I mean...

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.900
It's really, you know what,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.968
there are...
( applause )

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.570
there are lot of reasons that
people become writers.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.039
I'm really, really fortunate

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:50.275
because I go to my office
every day and I have the...

00:11:50.275 --> 00:11:53.511
the opportunity
to entertain everyone.

00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:56.215
But I also have this potential

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.749
- to educate a little.
- Yeah.

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.418
And I think if you can
leave the world

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:00.752
a better place
in some small way,

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.120
that's really important.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.821
Yeah.

00:12:03.054 --> 00:12:04.556
Hopefully, that's what
my books could do.

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:06.124
They could teach you
something you didn't know

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:07.860
and maybe open
your mind up a little

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.127
in a direction that
you didn't think

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:10.129
you were going to have to go.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.164
Yeah, absolutely. It's...

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.499
- it's wonderful.
- Thank you.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:14.566
Yeah. Thank you.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.835
So, I was thinking as a writer
reading this, it's...

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.871
a fascinating journey
for you because

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.672
on the one hand you get
to become a scientist,

00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:22.173
you get to become a psychic...

00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:25.344
( laughter )
you get to become a detective.

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:30.082
Do you feel enriched and...
do you feel exhausted,

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.484
do you feel enriched,
do you...

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:33.085
because you're becoming
all these different people

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.386
in the course of
writing your book.

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.488
- How does that affect you?
- I actually feel lucky.

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:37.956
- Yeah.
- I feel really lucky

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:39.791
because I get to go to work

00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:41.693
and I'm someone different
every day.

00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:44.696
I do not feel as if I have
created Serenity or Virgil

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:45.964
or Alice or Jenna.

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:48.500
I feel like they are
speaking through me.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.037
And I hear them. I hear them
very clearly in my head,

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.171
they talk to me,

00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.740
they sometimes
wake me up at night

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.441
because they are
annoying and...

00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:58.677
and honestly you know, they...

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.212
I've long said,

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.581
"my joke is that writing is
successful schizophrenia.

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.082
I get paid to hear voices."

00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:05.050
- Right?
- There you go.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.752
You know, but that's real,
I hear their voices.

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.921
I feel as if you guys are,

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.556
you know,
you can't see the movie,

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:11.557
you can't hear the movie,

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:14.293
so it's my job to tell you
what's being said.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.095
When I am... I know I am
close to finishing a draft,

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:19.698
I can already hear
other people whispering like

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:20.699
- "ready".
- Really?

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.467
- Yeah.
- Really? Wow.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.502
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.136
I'm sure there are people
in the audience

00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:26.504
who have questions

00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:28.173
that they brought with them
tonight and...

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:29.775
Right, so, there's
only one rule,

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:31.944
which is if you give away
the ending of any of my books,

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.545
- I'm going to kill you.
- Right.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:34.713
So, right, keep that in mind.

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:35.781
Yes.
You don't want to do that.

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:36.916
- Don't do that.
- That's really,

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:40.285
There was a question
right there.

00:13:40.285 --> 00:13:42.087
<i> - Woman: Hi.</i>
- Hi.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.256
What is...
what was the hardest

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.258
and easiest part
of getting started

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.827
as a writer
with your very first book?

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:52.330
The easiest part about
getting to be a writer,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.332
honestly was, um,

00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:56.301
having the great good fortune

00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.737
and the grades to get
into Princeton.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.739
Because at the time
in the 80s,

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:01.573
there were not many
undergraduate

00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:03.108
undergraduate creative
writing programs,

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:04.442
there were lot of
graduate schools,

00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:05.678
but not undergrad.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.713
And I had the opportunity
to work with

00:14:07.713 --> 00:14:09.013
living breathing writers,

00:14:09.013 --> 00:14:11.483
in particular one who really
shepherded me

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:15.587
into becoming
my own best editor

00:14:15.587 --> 00:14:18.157
which I think is the most
essential tool for a writer.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:20.458
I actually spent
a two-year period,

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:22.194
and this is the hardest part,

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.928
trying to find an agent.

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:27.232
I had over 100
rejections from agents.

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:28.800
A lot of people would
write me, and they are like,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.036
"Yeah, you know, I just
got back my third rejection,

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.404
I don't know
if I could do this,"

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.339
and I'd just go, "yeah, okay,
whatever."

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:35.841
( laughter )
You know,

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.175
that is the hardest part,

00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.610
honestly, of being a writer.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.380
I think, believing
in yourself enough

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.249
that somebody eventually
takes the second look.

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:46.818
One person has to
really fall for it.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.220
You know and
that kind of makes

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.956
the odds feel
a little bit better.

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:54.259
Let's come down
to the front please.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:56.194
So, I have a question about

00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:57.595
<i> My Sister's Keeper</i> .

00:14:57.595 --> 00:14:59.531
<i> How do I know that was
 coming? Yeah.</i>

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.032
It was the first book I read

00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:02.700
and it totally got me
hooked on you.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.203
<i> But when I was
 so excited for the movie,</i>

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.638
<i> after seeing it,</i>

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:10.242
I wondered what your
opinion was on the change.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.010
( laughter )

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.345
- That was so tactfully said.
- That was tactful.

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:14.112
( laughter )

00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:15.747
So, here's the thing about...

00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:17.750
about selling books for...

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.418
into movies, um,

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.886
what most of you
don't realize is

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.987
that the writer does not
have any say

00:15:22.987 --> 00:15:24.156
over what happens.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.290
There are exceptions,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.359
but in the vast
majority of cases,

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.328
you sell your property

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:30.929
to a studio and then they

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:32.597
do whatever they want to do.

00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:34.666
And you are not asked for any,

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:36.868
you know, any contributions
whatsoever.

00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:38.036
Um...

00:15:38.036 --> 00:15:39.738
it's like giving a baby up
for adoption.

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:43.108
And we writers try
really hard to...

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.711
to find a good home
for a baby.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.579
But sometimes
it doesn't work out.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.214
And, in my case, um,

00:15:50.214 --> 00:15:53.152
you know, I was actually asked

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:55.153
to try and...

00:15:55.153 --> 00:15:56.922
and interview Nick Cassavetes,

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.757
the director,
before he was hired.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.758
And I said to him
that what was...

00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:02.694
the only thing that was really
important to me in the book

00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:04.529
that should stay
the same was the ending.

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:07.065
And I explained that,
it was what had sold,

00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:08.833
all these copies of the book,
people going,

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:10.068
"I can't tell you
what happened, just read it,

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:11.369
so we can talk," you know.

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.071
And so he read the book,
and he said,

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:14.239
"you're right,
that's the only ending

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.108
for this story,
I'm not going to change it.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.075
If anyone else does,

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.177
I'm going to tell you why and
I'm going to tell you myself."

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:21.079
And I thought, that's fair.

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:23.448
And he spent two years
writing a script,

00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:24.583
he would call me weekly,

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.151
I would help him
whenever he asked,

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.653
with character, with dialogue,
with scenes, whatever.

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:30.088
And he would read me stuff.

00:16:30.088 --> 00:16:33.492
And, um, then
at the end of that process,

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.661
a fan wrote me an email saying
they've gotten a script of

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.463
<i> My Sister's Keeper</i>
and did...

00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:39.765
she worked
at a casting agency,

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.834
and did I know that they had
changed the ending.

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:45.537
So, I called Nick at home
and he wouldn't take my call.

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:48.240
I went to the movie set and
he threw me off the set.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.675
I went to Newline Cinema

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.077
and I spoke to the head,
Toby Emmerich, and I said,

00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:53.578
"You guys are going to
lose money on this film

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.447
because I have the best fans
in the world

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.816
and they are not going to be
happy with what you did."

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:59.084
And he said,
"No, no, you know,

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:01.152
we really trust Nick,
he did<i> The Notebook</i> for us,

00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:03.088
he knows
what he is doing," and I said,

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:04.623
"okay" and I walked away.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:07.859
And of course,
the movie was not successful.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.129
It's a beautiful movie,
Nick filmed a beautiful movie

00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:12.531
with wonderful
acting performances,

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.899
about dying with dignity.

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.334
That is not
what the book is about.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.568
That's his interpretation,

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:18.703
but it's not what I thought
the book should be about.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:20.839
And many of my
wonderful fans agreed

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.774
and the movie lost money.

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:25.877
And the really cool
silver lining here is that

00:17:25.877 --> 00:17:27.746
ever since then, um...

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.215
I have had more clout
in Hollywood

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.417
because I apparently
am psychic and I told them

00:17:32.417 --> 00:17:33.952
they were going to lose money.
( laughter )

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.120
So that's kind of cool.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.422
But it was not a
pleasant experience.

00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:39.457
Would it mean
that I wouldn't do it again?

00:17:39.457 --> 00:17:41.926
<i> No, because ultimately
 let's be real</i>

00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.094
<i> in most cases the book is</i>

00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:44.496
<i> always better than the film,
 right?</i>

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.799
<i> And for those of you, who went
 to go see</i> My Sister's Keeper

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.733
and were as disappointed
as I was,

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:50.736
the good news is that
you get to go home

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.137
and pull that
book off the shelf

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:54.939
and read the story
the way it should be. Right?

00:17:54.939 --> 00:17:56.107
Yeah.

00:17:56.107 --> 00:17:58.209
( applause )

00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:01.280
Um, gentleman
in the blue shirt here.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.750
<i> Man: Hi, my wife and I are
 both the oldest of four.</i>

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.452
And I've had a lot of
discussions and hardship

00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:09.320
with my relationship
with my mother,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.222
because I was the one
who started...

00:18:11.222 --> 00:18:12.924
- everyone leaving,
<i> - Yeah.</i>

00:18:12.924 --> 00:18:15.860
So, you really said
that this was the core...

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.162
<i> - Yeah.</i>
- For the book.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.231
How did this and this
journey of writing it

00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:22.868
help you with
what you were going through?

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.503
That's a great question.
It really did help me.

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:28.239
Most of my books are
really my therapy session

00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:29.574
for all of you to watch.

00:18:29.574 --> 00:18:31.943
You know, it's something that
I'm really struggling with

00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:35.780
and, and I wrestle it out and
throw it at other characters,

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.282
but really I'm talking about

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.950
something that's
upsetting to me.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.653
And you know,
for me it really was that,

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.122
that sense, okay,
elephants and...

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.825
elephants, moms and daughters
they stay together forever,

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.094
so what does that
really mean for humans.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:51.362
When people leave us,
do they ever really leave?

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:54.399
And I think that was really,
that was really the end point

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:55.634
that I came to.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.536
Physical distance means
nothing.

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:00.972
<i> That's details...
 that when you love someone,</i>

00:19:00.972 --> 00:19:02.207
<i> they are always with you.</i>

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.376
- Right. So, we have a...
- This girl, we got a...

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.610
A wonderful woman
in the front.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.180
- Yeah.
- In purple and black.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.149
What kind of events
inspire you to write,

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.952
because, like in your book,
<i> Nineteen Minutes</i> ,

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.054
Peter Houghton goes on a

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.623
shooting rampage
in his school.

00:19:18.623 --> 00:19:21.592
So, is it events like this
that inspire you to write?

00:19:21.592 --> 00:19:26.498
I could write about any number
of really devastating topics

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.466
or things
that are very upsetting.

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:31.036
But I think
there's more to it than that.

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:33.205
I don't rip things
out of the headlines.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.874
What I need to do
is to find something

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:38.109
<i> that has intersected
 in my life</i>

00:19:38.109 --> 00:19:41.946
<i> at that moment in a way
 that really moves me deeply.</i>

00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:44.149
And what moves me today,

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:46.717
might not be what moves me
in five years.

00:19:46.717 --> 00:19:48.820
So, a book that I think,
"That's interesting

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.721
but not that interesting
right now,"

00:19:50.721 --> 00:19:52.357
could completely change
five years from now.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.193
I could be dying
to write that book.

00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:57.796
So, there is this,
it's a dual feed,

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:00.031
part of it is,
things that I hear about,

00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:01.666
things that I read about
in the world that...

00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:03.535
that I have a curiosity about.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:07.072
And the other part of it is
where I am in my own life.

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:08.907
It's funny, because,
I sometimes think,

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.943
you know very self-servingly
about 'Jodi Picoult 101',

00:20:11.943 --> 00:20:13.911
which is going to be taught
clearly one day in college...

00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:15.247
( laughter )
And, you know,

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.949
if you look at the trajectory
of my career,

00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:21.152
my very first book was about
a mother and a daughter.

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:24.222
This book is about a mother
and a daughter again.

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:26.358
What's the difference?
When I wrote my first book,

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.860
I was closer in age
to the daughter.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.362
Now, I'm closer in
age to the mother.

00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:33.498
And in between I wrote about

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.166
the relationships between
men and women,

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:36.501
because I got married.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:39.304
Then I wrote about
all the really scary things

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.505
that can happen
to your children,

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.773
because I had children.

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.674
It was like a whole run
of that for many years.

00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:46.577
And now, you know, I'm moving
into more theoretical stuff,

00:20:46.577 --> 00:20:49.748
the nature of good and evil,
you know, and...

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:52.083
and race for example,
things that are bigger,

00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:54.385
because that's...
I have the luxury

00:20:54.385 --> 00:20:55.654
of worrying about those things

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.456
and not just worrying
about my kids anymore.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.091
I keep telling my mom
that one day I'm going to

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.758
write about putting your
parents in a nursing home.

00:21:00.758 --> 00:21:01.960
( laughter )

00:21:01.993 --> 00:21:03.661
She's really happy
to hear that.

00:21:03.661 --> 00:21:06.831
( laughter )

00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:09.334
<i> Great. That's great.</i>

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.970
Well, on behalf of all of us,
thank you so much for sharing.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.872
Thank you.
Thanks for being here.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.506
Thank you.

00:21:15.506 --> 00:21:16.708
( applause )

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:25.484
( outro music )
