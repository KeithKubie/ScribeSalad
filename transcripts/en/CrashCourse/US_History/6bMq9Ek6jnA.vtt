Episode 34 – The New Deal

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.919
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history, and today we’re going to get

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.280
a little bit controversial, as we discuss
the FDR administration’s response to the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.870
Great Depression: the New Deal.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.099
That’s the National Recovery Administration,
by the way, not the National Rifle Association

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.790
or the No Rodents Allowed Club, which I’m
a card-carrying member of.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.540
Did the New Deal end the Depression (spoiler
alert: mehhh)?

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.520
More controversially, did it destroy American
freedom or expand the definition of liberty?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.420
In the end, was it a good thing?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.820
Mr. Green, Mr. Green.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.820
Yes.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.760
Ohh, Me from the Past, you are not qualified
to make that statement.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.760
What?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.240
I was just trying to be, like, provocative
and controversial.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.060
Isn’t that what gets views?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.590
You have the worst ideas about how to make
people like you.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.340
But anyway, not EVERYTHING about the New Deal
was controversial.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:53.220
This is CrashCourse, not TMZ.
intro

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.970
The New Deal redefined the role of the federal
government for most Americans and it led to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.760
a re-alignment of the constituents in the
Democratic Party, the so-called New Deal coalition.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.829
(Good job with the naming there, historians.)

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.670
And regardless of whether you think the New
Deal meant more freedom for more people or

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.030
was a plot by red shirt wearing Communists,
the New Deal is extremely important in American

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.030
history.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.030
Wait a second.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.030
I’m wearing a red shirt.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.030
What are you trying to say about me, Stan?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.670
As the owner of the means of production, I
demand that you dock the wages of the writer

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.700
who made that joke.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.660
So after his mediocre response to the Great
Depression, Herbert Hoover did not have any

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.200
chance of winning the presidential election
of 1932, but he also ran like he didn’t

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.430
actually want the job.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.420
Plus, his opponent was Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
who was as close to a born politician as the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.250
United States has ever seen, except for Kid
President.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.890
The phrase New Deal came from FDR’s campaign,
and when he was running FDR suggested that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.220
it was the government’s responsibility to
guarantee every man a right to make a comfortable

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.369
living, but he didn’t say HOW he meant to
accomplish this.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.900
Like, it wasn’t gonna come from government
spending, since FDR was calling for a balanced

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.299
budget and criticizing Hoover for spending
so much.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.920
Maybe it would somehow magically happen if
we made alcohol legal again and one thing

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.479
FDR did call for was an end to Prohibition,
which was a campaign promise he kept.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.380
After three years of Great Depression, many
Americans seriously needed a drink, and the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.250
government sought tax revenue, so no more
Prohibition.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.390
FDR won 57% of the vote and the Democrats
took control of Congress for the first time

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.390
in a decade.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.170
While FDR gets most of the credit, he didn’t
actually create the New Deal or put it into

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.170
effect.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.569
It was passed by Congress.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.060
So WTFDR was the New Deal?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.620
Basically, it was a set of government programs
intended to fix the depression and prevent

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.870
future depressions.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.120
There are a couple of ways historians conceptualize
it.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.510
One is to categorize the programs by their
function.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.400
This is where we see the New Deal described
as three R’s.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.800
The relief programs gave help, usually money,
to poor people in need.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.350
Recovery programs were intended to fix the
economy in the short run and put people back

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.350
to work.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.790
And lastly, the Run DMC program was designed
to increase the sales of Adidas shoes.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.430
No, alas, it was reform programs that were
designed to regulate the economy in the future

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.989
to prevent future depression.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.190
But some of the programs, like Social Security,
don’t fit easily into one category, and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.400
there are some blurred lines between recovery
and reform.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.239
Like, how do you categorize the bank holiday
and the Emergency Banking Act of March 1933,

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.239
for example?

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.350
FDR’s order to close the banks temporarily
also created the FDIC, which insures individual

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.970
deposits against future banking disasters.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.350
By the way, we still have all that stuff,
but was it recovery, because it helped the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.760
short-term economy by making more stable banks,
or was it reform because federal deposit insurance

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.080
prevents bank runs?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.690
A second way to think about the New Deal is
to divide it into phases, which historians

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.190
with their A number one naming creativity
call the First and Second New Deal.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.280
This more chronological approach indicates
that there has to be some kind of cause and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.680
effect thing going on because otherwise why
would there be a second New Deal if the first

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.950
one worked so perfectly?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.440
The First New Deal comprises Roosevelt’s
programs before 1935, many of which were passed

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.690
in the first hundred days of his presidency.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.569
It turns out that when it comes to getting
our notoriously gridlocked Congress to pass

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.150
legislation, nothing motivates like crisis
and fear.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.180
Stan can I get the foreshadowing filter?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.280
We may see this again.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.690
So, in a brief break from its trademark obstructionism,
Congress passed laws establishing the Civilian

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.090
Conservation Corps, which paid young people
to build national parks, the Agricultural

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.269
Adjustment Act, the Glass Stegall act, which
barred commercial banks from buying and selling

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.400
stocks, and the National Industrial Recovery
Act.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.580
Which established the National Recovery Administration,
which has lightening bolts in its claws.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.479
The NRA was designed to be government planners
and business leaders working together to coordinate

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.979
industry standards for production, prices,
and working conditions.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.830
But that whole public-private cooperation
idea wasn’t much immediate help to many

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.669
of the starving unemployed, so the Hundred
Days reluctantly included the Federal Emergency

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.360
Relief Administration, to give welfare payments
to people who were desperate.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360
Alright.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360
Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.259
Roosevelt worried about people becoming dependent
on relief handouts, and preferred programs

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.159
that created temporary jobs.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.649
One section of the NIRA created the Public
Works Administration, which appropriated $33

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.539
billion to build stuff like the Triborough
Bridge.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.800
So much for a balanced budget.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.789
The Civil Works Administration, launched in
November 1933 and eventually employed 4 million

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.000
people building bridges, schools, and airports.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.009
Government intervention reached its highest
point however in the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.410
This program built a series of dams in the
Tennessee River Valley to control floods,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.800
prevent deforestation, and provide cheap electric
power to people in rural counties in seven

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
southern states.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.990
But, despite all that sweet sweet electricity,
the TVA was really controversial because it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.430
put the government in direct competition with
private companies.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.300
Other than the NIRA, few acts were as contentious
as the Agricultural Adjustment Act.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.180
The AAA basically gave the government the
power to try to raise farm prices by setting

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.479
production quotas and paying farmers to plant
less food.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.849
This seemed ridiculous to the hungry Americans
who watched as 6 million pigs were slaughtered

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.069
and not made into bacon.

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.060
Wait, Stan, 6 million pigs?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.289
But…bacon is good for me...

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.960
Only property owning farmers actually saw
the benefits of the AAA, so most African American

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.389
farmers who were tenants or sharecroppers
continued to suffer.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.341
And the suffering was especially acute in
Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Colorado, where

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.369
drought created the Dust Bowl.

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:21.460
All this direct government intervention in
the economy was too much for the Supreme Court.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.270
In 1936 the court struck down the AAA in U.S.
v. Butler.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.999
Earlier in the Schechter Poultry case (AKA
the sick chicken case - finally a Supreme

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:35.460
Court case with an interesting name) the court
invalidated the NIRA because its regulations

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.399
“delegated legislative powers to the president
and attempted to regulate local businesses

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.249
that did not engage in interstate commerce.”[1]
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:47.349
So with the Supreme Court invalidating acts
left and right, it looked like the New Deal

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.929
was about to unravel.

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:53.939
FDR responded by proposing a law that would
allow him to appoint new Supreme Court justices

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.919
if sitting justices reached the age of 70
and failed to retire.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.710
Now, this was totally constitutional – you
can go ahead at the Constitution, if Nicolas

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.479
Cage hasn’t already swiped it – but it
seemed like such a blatant power grab that

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.349
Roosevelt’s plan to “pack the court”
brought on a huge backlash.

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:10.349
Stop everything.

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.699
I’ve just been informed that Nicolas Cage
stole the Declaration of Independence not

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:14.699
the Constitution.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:19.710
I want to apologize to Nic Cage himself and
also everyone involved in the National Treasure

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.379
franchise, which is truly a national treasure.

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.080
Anyway, in the end, the Supreme Court began
upholding the New Deal laws, starting a new

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.770
era of Supreme Court jurisprudence in which
the government regulation of the economy was

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.509
allowed under a very broad reading of the
commerce clause.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.020
Because really isn’t all commerce interstate
commerce?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.199
I mean if I go to Jimmy John’s, don’t
I exit the state of hungry and enter the state

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.199
of satisfied?

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:48.009
Thus began the Second New Deal shifting focus
away from recovery and towards economic security.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.139
Two laws stand out for their far-reaching
effects here, the National Labor Relations

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:55.069
Act, also called the Wagner Act, and the Social
Security Act.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:59.169
The Wagner Act guaranteed workers the right
to unionize and it created a National Labor

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:02.689
Relations Board to hear disputes over unfair
labor practices.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:08.959
In 1934 alone there were more than 2,000 strikes,
including one that involved 400,000 textile

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:09.959
workers.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.959
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:14.409
Man, I wish there were a union to prevent
me from getting electrocuted.

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:15.679
The rules here are simple.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:17.249
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:19.389
And I’m usually wrong and get shocked.

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:24.150
“Refusing to allow people to be paid less
than a living wage preserves to us our own

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.150
market.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.199
There is absolutely no use in producing anything
if you gradually reduce the number of people

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:33.000
able to buy even the cheapest products.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.610
The only way to preserve our markets is an
adequate wage.”

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.729
Uh I mean you usually don’t make it this
easy, but I’m going to guess that it’s

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.389
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:43.899
Dang it!

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:45.399
Eleanor Roosevelt?

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:46.399
Eleanor.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.209
Of course it was Eleanor.

00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:49.209
Gah!

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:53.610
The most important union during the 1930s
was the Congress of Industrial Organizations,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.620
which set out to unionize entire industries
like steel manufacturing and automobile workers.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.490
In 1936 the United Auto Workers launched a
new tactic called the sit-down strike.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.220
Workers at the Fisher Body Plant in Flint,
Michigan simply stopped working, sat down,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.709
and occupied the plant.

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:13.339
Eventually GM agreed to negotiate, and the
UAW won.

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:18.740
Union membership rose to 9 million people
as “CIO unions helped to stabilize a chaotic

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.300
employment situation and offered members a
sense of dignity and freedom.”[2]

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.510
That quote, by the way, is from our old buddy
Eric Foner.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.910
God, I love you, Foner.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.540
And unions played an important role in shaping
the ideology of the second New Deal because

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.839
they insisted that the economic downturn had
been caused by underconsumption, and that

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:39.930
the best way to combat the depression was
to raise workers’ wages so that they could

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.319
buy lots of stuff.

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:45.010
The thinking went that if people experienced
less economic insecurity, they would spend

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.970
more of their money so there were widespread
calls for public housing and universal health

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:50.970
insurance.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.160
And that brings us to the crowning achievement
of the Second New Deal, and/or the crowning

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.850
achievement of its Communist plot, the Social
Security Act of 1935.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.120
Social Security included unemployment insurance,
aid to the disabled, aid to poor families

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.540
with children, and, of course, retirement
benefits.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.019
It was, and is, funded through payroll taxes
rather than general tax revenue, and while

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:15.019
state and local governments retained a lot
of discretion over how benefits would be distributed,

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:19.959
Social Security still represented a transformation
in the relationship between the federal government

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:21.080
and American citizens.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.990
Like, before the New Deal, most Americans
didn’t expect the government to help them

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.100
in times of economic distress.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.810
After the New Deal the question was no longer
if the government should intervene, but how

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.810
it should.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.390
For a while, the U.S. government under FDR
embraced Keynesian economics, the idea that

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.680
the government should spend money even if
it means going into deficits in order to prop

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680
up demand.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.430
And this meant that the state was much more
present in people’s lives.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.980
I mean for some people that meant relief or
social security checks.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.820
For others, it meant a job with the most successful
government employment program, the Works Progress

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.820
Administration.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.000
The WPA didn’t just build post offices,
it paid painters to make them beautiful with

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.220
murals, it paid actors and writers to put
together plays, and ultimately employed more

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.879
than 3 million Americans each year until it
ended in 1943.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:11.170
It also, by the way, payed for lots of photographers
to take amazing photographs, which we can

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.060
show you for free because they are owned by
the government so I’m just going to keep

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.580
talking about how great they are.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.760
Oh, look at that one, that’s a winner.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760
Okay.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.190
Equally transformative, if less visually stimulating,
was the change that the New Deal brought to

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.449
American politics.

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:28.820
The popularity of FDR and his programs brought
together urban progressives who would have

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.920
been Republicans two decades earlier, with
unionized workers - often immigrants, left

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.959
wing intellectuals, urban Catholics and Jews.

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:40.920
FDR also gained the support of middle class
homeowners, and he brought African Americans

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.949
into the Democratic Party.

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:43.750
Who was left to be a Republican, Stan?

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.379
I guess there weren’t many, which is why
FDR kept getting re-elected until, you know,

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:48.379
he died.

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:51.430
But, fascinatingly, one of the biggest and
politically most important blocs in the New

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.550
Deal Coalition was white southerners, many
of whom were extremely racist.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.029
Democrats had dominated in the South since
the end of reconstruction, you know since

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:00.810
the other party was the party of Lincoln.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.180
And all those Southern democrats who had been
in Congress for so long became important legislative

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.180
leaders.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.639
In fact, without them, FDR never could have
passed the New Deal laws, but Southerners

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:14.490
expected whites to dominate the government
and the economy and they insisted on local

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.880
administration of many New Deal programs.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.379
And that ensured that the AAA and the NLRA
would exclude sharecroppers, and tenant farmers,

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:26.730
and domestic servants, all of whom were disproportionately
African American.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.700
So, did the New Deal end the depression?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.700
No.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.779
I mean, by 1940 over 15% of the American workforce
remained unemployed.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:39.370
But, then again, when FDR took office in 1933,
the unemployment rate was at 25%.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.050
Maybe the best evidence that government spending
was working is that when FDR reduced government

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:51.009
subsidies to farms and the WPA in 1937, unemployment
immediately jumped back up to almost 20%.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:54.470
And many economic historians believe that
it’s inaccurate to say that government spending

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.959
failed to end the Depression because in the
end, at least according to a lot of economists,

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:03.420
what brought the Depression to an end was
a massive government spending program called

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
World War II.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.949
So, given that, is the New Deal really that
important?

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:07.949
Yes.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:10.380
Because first, it changed the shape of the
American Democratic Party.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.879
African Americans and union workers became
reliable Democratic votes.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:15.960
And secondly, it changed our way of thinking.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.550
Like, liberalism in the 19th century meant
limited government and free-market economics.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.399
Roosevelt used the term to refer to a large,
active state that saw liberty as “greater

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.230
security for the average man.”

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.990
And that idea that liberty is more closely
linked to security than it is to, like, freedom

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.649
from government intervention is still really
important in the way we think about liberty

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.649
today.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:40.920
No matter where they fall on the contemporary
political spectrum, politicians are constantly

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.620
talking about keeping Americans safe.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.860
Also our tendency to associate the New Deal
with FDR himself points to what Arthur Schlessinger

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.980
called the “imperial presidency.”

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.430
That is, we tend to associate all government
policy with the president.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.019
Like, after Jackson and Lincoln’s presidencies
Congress reasserted itself as the most important

00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:59.019
branch of the government.

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:00.790
But that didn’t happen after FDR.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.809
But above all that, the New Deal changed the
expectations that Americans had of their government.

00:14:05.809 --> 00:14:09.720
Now, when things go sour, we expect the government
to do something.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.329
We’ll give our last words today to Eric
Foner, who never Foner-s it in, the New Deal

00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:19.779
“made the government an institution directly
experienced in Americans’ daily lives and

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:23.399
directly concerned with their welfare.”[3]
