00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.900
Every object oriented language I can think of has a way to dynamically refer to

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.170
the current object.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.490
In JavaScript we use the keyword, this.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.740
But as you and I both know, it can be pretty confusing at times.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160
It doesn't always return the object you're expecting it to.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.690
&gt;&gt; I would actually go so far as to say the parameter,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.440
this, is easily the most widely misunderstood aspect of the language.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
But it's actually pretty easy to use.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.820
If you're thinking about it in the right way.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
So you'll notice I'm always very careful to refer to it as the parameter this.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.600
And that's because it behaves almost exactly like a normal parameter,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.240
with a couple of exceptions.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.260
Parameters are those words that we see between parenthesis in

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.610
a function definition.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.020
So there's really just two major differences between a regular parameter and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.270
the parameter this.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.980
The first is, you don't get to pick the name for the parameter this.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.000
It's always just going to be referred to as this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.980
And the second is, you go about binding values to the parameter this a bit

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.680
differently from how you bind values to other parameters.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.100
There's about five different ways, in fact,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.050
that you can do that and we're going to examine them all in an upcoming lesson.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.230
But before we do I'd like to just take a quick detour and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.080
look at the Dev Tools for a moment.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.840
To examine a scenario you might find yourself in where you could start to ask

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.660
the question, what is the parameter this is going to be bound to in this case?
