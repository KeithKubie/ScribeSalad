00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.910
This, my friends,
is a walrus baculum

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.450
it's basically a penis bone
found in most placental mammals.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.830
Interestingly, not in humans.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.540
And this is a polar bear
skull, which as you can see

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.940
is more streamlined for swimming in the water than a grizzly bear skull.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.040
And over here we have my
giant friend, the rhino head,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.030
which is good for being giant,
for fighting off predators

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.300
and fighting for-

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.910
I don't know, why do
rhinos have big heads?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.750
And this is the skull
of a pronghorn antelope.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.060
It has these horns that come
off, that are covered in these

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.010
keratin sheaths that
fall off once a year.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.500
These are all bones.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Parts of skeletons.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.040
And they're all pretty
freaking awesome.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.390
And I am surrounded by them here

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.290
at the Philip L. Wright
Zoological Museum,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.550
at the University of Montana.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.930
And all of these bones have
adapted to help animals survive,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.820
the horns on the pronghorn for
mating displays and self-defense,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.720
the streamlined skull of a polar
bear for swimming in the water,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.800
and the walrus baculum,
for, longevity, I guess.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.579
We're used to thinking of our
skeletons as being the dead parts

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.899
of us because that's what's
left over after all of our,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.149
like, stuff that looks
like us has rotted away.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.929
But the fact is, our bones
make up a vital organ system.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.280
And I don't just mean vital
in that, without them you would be

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.350
a sort of disgusting
dead pile of lumpy mush,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.829
but also in the traditional
meaning of vital:

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.060
meaning it's alive.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.649
It protects your vital organs.

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.359
It makes locomotion possible.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.889
It manufactures your blood.

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:23.799
And on top of it all it takes care
of its own repair and maintenance.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.889
Your skeleton is alive people.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:32.799
And walrus penises are
just the beginning.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.009
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.479
So you know what bones are,
but maybe you didn't know

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.299
that you don't have to be a
vertebrate or even a chordate

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.149
to have a skeleton.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.539
Jellies and worms, for instance,
have hydrostatic skeletons,

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.969
made up of fluid-filled
body cavities.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.090
By squeezing muscles around the
cavities, they change their shapes,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.099
and that can be used
to produce movement.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.599
Insects have exoskeletons,of course

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.119
made of the nitrogenous
carbohydrate chitin,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.340
and most mollusks have
exoskeletons, too,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.810
in the form of calcium
carbonate shells.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.759
But when it comes to skeletons,
the winningest formula

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.119
has been the endoskeleton.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.689
Even though we'd probably feel
a lot safer if we were covered

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.980
with armored plates like
some race of Iron Men,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.170
having skeletons inside of
our bodies has allowed us

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.079
to grow larger and have much
more freedom of movement.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.299
It's good stuff.

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.060
One of the many reasons
you don't see ants

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.040
the size of horses
walking around is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.409
well, one, it wouldn't
be able to breathe,

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.780
but also, a body with
such a huge volume

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.590
would require an exoskeleton
that was exponentially thicker

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.420
and therefore heavier and
clumsier, to support it.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.909
So, endoskeletons allow
animals to grow larger

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.739
by supporting more mass,
plus, you don't have to worry

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.680
about the embarrassment that
comes with unsightly molting!

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.209
As adults, humans have 206 bones
of all kinds of shapes and sizes,

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.250
including 3 tiny ones in each ear,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.290
1 weird one shaped one like
a horseshoe in your throat,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.390
27 in your hands,
and 26 in each foot.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.650
You also have at least 32 teeth,
unless you play too much hockey,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.810
and even though they're
included in the skeletal system,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.150
they don't count as bones,
because they're made up

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.489
of different material,
namely, dentin and enamel,

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.349
the hardest material in your body.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.730
And you probably think of
the skull as one big bone,

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.180
but it actually consists
of many separate bones,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.370
including 8 plates that cover your
brain and 14 others in your face.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.450
Face bones!

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.680
So, simple, right? Well,
you might want to sit down-

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.980
You probably already are,
but I'm going to,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.659
because it's time
for Biolo-graphy!

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.439
 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.980
Now, you'd think that we'd
have nailed down the basics

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.090
of the human skeleton
a long time ago,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.689
because our teeth and bones
are the biggest, hardest parts

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.909
of our bodies, and after
we leave this mortal coil,

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.430
they're what stick
around the longest.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.319
It's not like they're super
hard to find and study.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.129
Surely all of those
ancient physicians

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.120
who basically invented medical
science would have inventoried

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.739
all of our bones pretty
soon after they figured out

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.450
that we had bones. Right?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.480
If the answer was yes, do
you think I'd be sitting here?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.569
Must of what we know about
the human skeletal system

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.189
is thanks to Andries Van Wesel,

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.120
who was born in what's
now Belgium in 1514.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.359
And in those days, if you were
like, a kung fu master of science,

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.079
you pretty much got
your own Latin name,

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.299
so today he's known
as Andreas Vesalius.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.470
Vesalius came from a long line of
physicians to kings and emperors,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.380
and while studying in Paris,
he began dorking around

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.790
in cemeteries and became
interested in what's now known

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.180
as osteology, the study of bones.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.930
Perhaps Vesalius' greatest
contribution was showing the world

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.660
that everything we thought we
knew about osteology was wrong.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.020
See, back in those days, if you
wanted to become a doctor,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.790
you didn't study bodies or
see patients, you read stuff

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.400
written by ancient Romans, whose
work was considered indisputable.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.260
Because, y'know, those guys had
long beards and they wore robes!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.040
But in his research, Vesalius
discovered that Roman texts

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.410
about the skeleton,
especially the teachings

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.100
of the philosopher-doctor
Galen, were way, way off.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.290
See, Roman law prohibited the
dissection of human bodies,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.380
so none of those guys ever
actually studied human innards.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.650
Instead, they dissected
apes and pigs and donkeys,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.250
and used that to make
assumptions about the human body,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.860
and so for 15 centuries,
young doctors were taught

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.650
those assumptions.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.980
But Vesalius revolutionized
osteology, and all of medicine,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.820
by introducing a new practice,
every pre-med student's favorite!

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.950
Human dissection!

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.770
He instructed students
by dismembering corpses

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.110
in front of them and
cataloging their parts,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.230
giving students the
first opportunity ever

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.280
to directly observe
the inside of the human body.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.330
These new methods drew
a lot of attention,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.220
particularly from a local judge,
who began donating bodies

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.610
of the criminals he
executed to Vesalius.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.470
Suddenly, the dude was up to
his codpiece in pig thieves

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.130
and murderers, and by the
time he was 28, he had done

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.160
enough research that he published
De humani corporis fabrica.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.500
On the fabric of the human body,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.190
a seven-volume text
on human anatomy,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.830
including the first
comprehensive description

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.530
ever made of the human skeleton.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.590
Its beautifully detailed
illustrations are thought

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.880
to have been created in the studio
of the Renaissance artist Titian,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.520
featuring pictures of
flayed corpses positioned

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.630
in symbolic poses,
and many of the volumes,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.020
some of which still exist today,
are bound in human skin.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.360
So, the takeaway here is that even
though bones are big and hard,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.350
the science behind them
is far from obvious.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.960
Even though we tend to think of
our bones as rigid and fixed,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.530
your skeleton is as dynamic as
any of your other organ systems.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.690
It's built from scratch with
ingredients in your blood,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.260
it's grown according to
glands in your head,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.220
and probably coolest of all,
it's constantly breaking

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.380
itself down and rebuilding
itself, over and over again,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.740
for as long as you live.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.400
Most new bone tissue
starts out as cartilage,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.680
which you may know from
your nose and ears.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.360
It's made of specialized
cells called chondrocytes,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.840
and in newly forming bones,
these cells start dividing

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.910
like crazy and secrete
collagen and other proteins

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.110
to form a cartilage model, or
framework, for the bones to form on

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.450
Soon, blood vessels work
their way into the cartilage

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.300
and bring plump little
cells called osteoblasts

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.270
"oste," which you'll be hearing a lot
of today,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.940
just means bone and
"blast" means germ or bud.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.400
The bone-building that they do is
called, fittingly, ossification.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.510
They first secrete a gelatinous goo
that's a combination of collagen

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.020
and a polysaccharide that acts
like a kind of organic glue.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.890
Then they start absorbing minerals
and salts from the blood

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.470
in the capillaries all around
them, and unsurprisingly,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.870
they are especially absorbing
calcium and phosphate,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.980
and they begin depositing those
minerals onto the matrix.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.390
With the help of enzymes secreted
by the osteoblasts,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.980
these chemicals bond to
form calcium phosphate,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.980
which crystallizes to
make your bone matrix.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.150
In the end, about two-thirds
of your bone matrix

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.000
is proteins like collagen, and the
other third is calcium phosphate.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.500
Kinda surprising, right?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.220
Most of your bone
isn't even mineral,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.770
and even the part that is,
is living tissue.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.840
Because it's all honeycombed
with blood vessels

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.370
that allow osteoblasts and other
cells to do their jobs.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.320
Unlike an insect's exoskeleton,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.280
even the hardest parts of
your bones are alive.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.240
Now, even though a bone can
take all kinds of forms,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.090
from big, flat plates
protecting your brain

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.570
to the tiny stirrup in your ear,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.150
inside they all tend to have
the same basic structure.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.530
If you cut one in half,
you'd see that the matrix

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.170
actually forms in two layers.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.900
The outer layer, called the
compact or cortical bone

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.350
is hard and dense and makes up
about 80% of the bone's mass.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.090
In the middle the spongy
or trabecular bone,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.390
is softer and more
porous and contains

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.420
the marrow and fatty
tissues in larger bones.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.219
The marrow, of course, makes
not only new red blood cells

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.580
but almost all of your
different blood cells

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.460
by a process called hematopoeisis.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.050
I'd need like about a
week of your time

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.320
and a Greek dictionary to
explain how it does this,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.840
but suffice it to say that
evolution has wisely chosen

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.220
the innards of our largest bones
to house the blood stem cells

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.140
that together can produce
1 trillion blood cells

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.580
in you every day.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.460
That's 10 to the freakin' 12th.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.570
On the outside, the larger
bones of your body

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.600
have a similar structure.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.220
Have a look here at this femur,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.290
that's your biggest
bone in your body.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.840
The main shaft is
called the diaphysis,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.400
and each rounded
end is an epiphysis.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.660
When bones grow, as a child grows,

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.700
the new tissue forms at the
border between the two,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.670
a place called the
epiphyseal plate.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.420
As they did when they formed
the original bone tissue,

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.230
chondrocytes start to
produce new cartilage here,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.180
and the osteoblasts
come in and lay down

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.010
more collagen and
calcium phosphate.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.240
So as you grow, the ends of
your bones are actually

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.090
growing away from each other
until, by the time you're about 25,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.130
the last of these plates
in your bones hardens.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.030
By the way, this whole
process is stimulated

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.560
by growth hormones secreted
from glands all over your body.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.840
But the head honcho right
here is the pituitary gland,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.860
about the size of pea nestled
at the base of your brain.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.680
As adults, this and other glands
produce less growth hormone,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.120
which slows down
our bone lengthening.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.330
But even though lengthening is
a limited-time-only process,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.750
the thickness and strength
of bone must continually

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.320
be maintained by the body.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.120
Because, of course,
like all of your cells,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.550
bone cells go through a
lot of wear and tear

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.900
and need to be be able to
adjust to changing conditions.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.990
So over the course of each
year of your adult life,

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.470
about 10% of your skeleton
is completely broken down,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.740
and then rebuilt from scratch in
a process called bone remodeling.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.100
Here, the main players
are the osteoblasts, again,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.130
and another kind of cell that's
kind of their complete opposite:

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.260
osteoclasts, or bone breakers.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.330
You'd think maybe that the
cells that form bone tissue

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.250
and the ones that destroy it
would be in some kind of

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.170
constant battle in your
body, but during remodeling,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.020
they work closely together and
actually communicate nicely.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.580
It's like, they're
basically frenemies.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.220
Remodeling begins when
osteoclasts are sent,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.940
by way of hormone signals,
through the capillaries

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.320
to the sites of microscopic
fractures in the bone matrix.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.600
Once they're in place, they
secrete an acidic cocktail

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.100
of hydrogen ions to dissolve the
calcium carbonate into calcium ions

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.850
phosphate, water, and other
material that they carry

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.140
back to nearby capillaries.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.980
Then they secrete enzymes that
specialize in digesting collagen.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.520
This whole process
is called resorption,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.880
and when the old bone
tissue has been cleaned up,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.130
the osteoclasts send out a hormone
shout-out to the osteoblasts,

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.250
who come in and do
their ossification thing.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.620
Bone remodeling is
really pretty amazing,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.740
and it's all ultimately
regulated by hormones

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.110
that maintain the levels
of calcium in your blood.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.590
The glands that call the
plays during the bone-breaking

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.990
part of remodeling are the
parathyroids in your neck.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.350
When the calcium
in your blood plasma

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.870
falls below the
level of homeostasis,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.180
the parathyroid triggers
osteoclasts to

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.220
take calcium out of your bones
and release it back into the blood.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.740
Likewise, when blood calcium
levels are too high,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.670
the parathyroid's cousin,
the thyroid gland,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.720
signals osteoblasts to take
calcium out of the blood

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.100
and lay it down on the bone
collagen through more ossification.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.410
And remember last week
when we talked about how

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.620
the kidneys reabsorb
salts and minerals?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.360
Well, the thyroid also
regulates how much calcium

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.410
is reabsorbed in that process,
as well as the amount of vitamin D,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.640
because vitamin D helps
your body absorb calcium

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.279
through the small intestine.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.790
And that is why vitamin D is
good for your bones and stuff.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.220
Now, the relation of active
osteoblasts to active osteoclasts

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.670
can change dramatically
under different conditions.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.180
The more you stress your bones,
the more osteoclasts work

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.760
to break down the bone matrix,
so that it can be re-formed.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.100
Bone stress can include stuff
like fractures, of course,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.480
but it can also be less
traumatic and more sustained:

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.630
Exercise causes stress on the
skeleton that helps stimulate

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.890
bone remodeling, so when
you're working out,

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.160
you're not only building muscle,
you're also building bone.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.339
So, as you can tell, it's
kind of hard to talk

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:26.360
about bones without also
talking about muscles,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.310
and that's what
we're going to do

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.080
on the next episode of
Crash Course Biology.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.220

L. Wright Zoological Museum

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.390
at the University of Montana.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.660

as are all of the super
helpful people who are always

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.589
answering questions who are not us.

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.300
Thank you to those
people by the way.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.780
And we will see you next
time on Crash Course Biology.
