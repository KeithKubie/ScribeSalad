00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.520
I've taken a screen shot from
our fill in the blank proof

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.130
exercises.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.680
And I'm going to work it out,
essentially, on digital paper.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.470
And then we can fill in the
blanks on the actual exercise.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.960
So they tell us that
BC is parallel to DF.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.500
The figure is not drawn
to scale-- fair enough.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.574
Then they tell us that angle
CEF is congruent to angle BAC.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.110
CEF, so that's this
right over here.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.340
CEF is congruent to BAC.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.560
So it's congruent
to that over there.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.010
Then they tell us that
CFE is congruent to ABC.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.065
Angle CFE is congruent
to angle ABC.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.048
Then they tell us that
segment CF is congruent to BC.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.120
Then they tell us that
BDE is congruent to ACB.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.090
So that's that right over there.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.950
Then they tell us DE
is congruent to AC.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.080
And then finally, they
tell us that-- let

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.410
me do that in a
different color--

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.997
so BED is congruent to BAC.

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:34.080
Let me make sure I get it.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.070
BED-- so it's this
angle right over here--

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.905
is congruent to BAC.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:42.060
BAC is this blue one
over there, so we already

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.410
have a marker for that.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.630
So I'll write the blue
one just like that.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.160
So that's that piece
of information as well.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.932
Now we're ready for the proof.

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.390
Now whenever you
do any proof, it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.980
good to know what
you're trying to prove.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.570
So let's just cut
to the chase and see

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.087
where this proof actually goes.

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:57.670
So in the last
statement of the proof,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.630
they say triangle BCA is
congruent to triangle BCE

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.150
because-- and we
have to figure out

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.160
why we can say that
based on everything

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.289
that this proof has
proven beforehand.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.830
But so we're
essentially just proving

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.950
that triangle BCA, which is this
triangle right up here-- this

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.860
is BCA-- that it is
congruent to triangle BCE.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
BCE is this triangle-- this
downward-pointing triangle.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.326
So this is what we're
trying to prove.

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:30.707
This is congruent to
that right over here.

00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:32.540
This triangle is congruent
to that triangle.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.712
So that's important
to keep in mind.

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:36.420
And all we know about
these two triangles

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.880
is it they share a
side in common, which

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.154
is equal to itself by
the reflexive property.

00:02:41.154 --> 00:02:42.820
But we don't have any
other information.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.194
We're going to have to figure
out whether other sides are

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:47.860
congruent or maybe other
angles or something else

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.310
in order to actually
make this statement.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.690
So let's see what they've
done in the proof.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.132
So first they make a statement.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.840
And we don't need to
correct it, but it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350
good to follow the
narrative of their proof.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:09.690
BCA is congruent to BDE
because of angle, side, angle.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.105
So let's see, we have an
angle, side, angle; angle,

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:15.360
side, angle.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.200
This triple arc corresponds to
D here, corresponds to C there.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930
And you see that even over here.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.070
The way they wrote it,
D is the middle here,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.320
and C is the middle there.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.290
So they do correspond
to each other.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.380
That makes sense.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.946
This side, DE, should
correspond to CA.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.070
And you see that over here.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.340
DE corresponds to CA based
on the order it's written.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.000
E comes right after D.
A comes right after C.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.270
And angle E should correspond
to angle A, and it does.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.920
Angle E corresponds to
angle A, and it does.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.440
So this is completely
legitimate-- angle, side,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.750
angle; angle, side, angle
It's a little bit hard

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.000
based on how they're oriented.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.583
It would've been easier if they
were oriented in the same way.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:00.690
But this is legitimate.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.590
By angle, side, angle, these
two triangles are congruent.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.990
Then they say, something
is equal to something

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.790
because corresponding parts
of congruent triangles

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430
are congruent.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.089
And this is a little bit
harder because they're probably

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.790
making a statement-- we just
proved that this triangle

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.434
right over here is congruent
to this triangle up here.

00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:26.850
And so if we're going to say
that two corresponding things

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.058
are congruent, it's probably
two corresponding things

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.620
in these two triangles.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.470
And what is corresponding
in these two triangles that

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.440
will help us get to
our end goal of saying

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.700
that this top triangle is
congruent to this bottom one?

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.590
Well the only information that
this side triangle right over

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.640
here, that BDE shares with the
central triangle is this side.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.100
So maybe we can say that this
side corresponds to some side

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.260
up here.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.090
And it does because
they're congruent.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.650
And then that'll
give us information

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.870
for this middle triangle.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.430
So let's just think about that.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.170
And it may or may not be right,
but it's a good working guess.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.130
And there's different
ways to tackle these.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.050
So this side over here, if
we look at how this is-- BE

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.972
should correspond to BA.

00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:19.370
BE-- and remember,
it's between the blue

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.945
and the not triple green side.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.020
So these two should
correspond based

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.420
on the information
right over here.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.130
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.482
This thing should be congruent
to that thing right over there.

00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.190
And that gives us
interesting information

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.370
because now we've built
up two congruent sides

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.780
of this middle one
and this top one.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.310
So let's write
that as our working

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.310
thesis of what they want here.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:58.970
So we can say BE-- well, we
could say the length is equal--

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.600
but we could even say
BE is congruent to BA

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.840
because corresponding parts
of congruent triangles

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.450
are congruent.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.630
And this is not an
easy thing to do.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.213
But the real hint
is they just told us

00:06:12.213 --> 00:06:14.287
that these two
things are congruent.

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:16.620
And we want some information
about this middle triangle.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.036
And they share a
common side here.

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:20.100
So it seems reasonable enough.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.740
Hopefully that gets us
to the right end point.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.605
Now they tell us that triangle
BCA is congruent to FCE.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.630
And we started at F.
We started at B. That's

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.110
the double angle side.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.071
Then you went across
this one side,

00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:40.320
and you went across this
side with the magenta marker.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.080
So that seems right because
of angle, angle, side.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.820
Angle, angle, side--
angle, the blue angle,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.610
double magenta angle, and then
this single, magenta slash

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.110
side.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.860
Angle, angle, side--
angle, angle, side.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.280
That seems legitimate,
and it should

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.625
unless there was some type
of error in this code.

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:04.130
And then they say AC
is congruent to CE

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:11.600
because-- well we just figured
out that this top triangle is

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.720
congruent to this
one down over here.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.200
So it's probably going to be
because of corresponding sides

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.840
of congruent triangles.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.820
And we can verify it.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.130
If this is congruent to
that, then let's see,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:29.590
AC is between the blue angle
and the non-magenta angle.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.670
And EC is between the blue
angle and the non-magenta angle.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.880
I haven't marked it here.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:42.710
And so we have AC is
indeed congruent to CE.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.434
And now this is interesting,
and this was useful

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:53.600
because this shared a side
with this middle triangle

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.780
that we care about.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.460
And so we now show that this
top triangle, all the sides

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.986
have the same lengths as
all the sides down here.

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:02.610
So this was actually
useful information

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.370
that we figured out, so I
think that was the right way

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.670
to go about it.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.100
Oh, I need to finish this.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.150
AC is congruent to CE
because corresponding parts

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.955
of corresponding angles.

00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:17.437
Let me write it in black.

00:08:17.437 --> 00:08:19.020
And when we actually
fill it in, there

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.265
will be a pull-down--
so corresponding parts.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.350
And then finally, we're
in the home stretch.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.429
We're ready to say that
BCA, this top triangle,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.580
is congruent to triangle BCE.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.090
All their sides are the same.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.890
So this is side,
side, side congruency.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.990
So now let's verify our answer.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.220
So let's take out
the actual exercise.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.955
And so let's go down here.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.610
The first thing I want to type
in is that BE is equal to BA.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.430
So let me type that in,
BE-- and if this is right,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.350
it'll actually just process
it-- is equal to BA.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.990
And it is.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.050
There you go.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.369
Segment BE is congruent AB.

00:09:09.369 --> 00:09:11.160
So that's how we know
we've got that right.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.130
I wrote it as BA, but
that's the same thing.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.700
And that's why it processed it.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.945
And then AC is congruent to CE
because of corresponding parts.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.149
There you go.

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:24.690
And then finally,
these two triangles

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.140
are congruent because of
side, side, side congruence.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:34.600
And now let's verify our answer.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.940
I feel good about it, and I
am ready to check my answer.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.344
Yes, it is correct.
