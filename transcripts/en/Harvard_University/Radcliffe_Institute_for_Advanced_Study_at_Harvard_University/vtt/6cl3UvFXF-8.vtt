00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.060
-The Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.270
is an amazingly exciting place.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.650
It is intergenerational,
it is international,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.130
and it is a place where
people come together

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.300
in every discipline
to work together

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.450
and to learn from each other.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.170
-What the Radcliffe
Institute can do

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.120
is make sure that the
best minds of our society

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.720
have place and time
to do important work.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.010
-When I applied for a
Radcliffe fellowship,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.070
I had been a playwright
for 20 years.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.230
I was needing to force myself
to be creative on an airplane

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.870
or in that moment before my
son woke up in the morning.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.660
This has given me an
opportunity to just actually

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.160
breathe and be an artist
and be still and imagine.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.660
-My project for
this year, I've been

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.881
writing a book called
Born Translated,

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.130
The Contemporary Novel in
the Age of World Literature.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.680
-I'm pursuing a radical
alternative in which the Big

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.500
Bang is a big bounce.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.810
-A book on medical tourism.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.130
-Can we take what we've
learned from computer systems

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.471
and bring that into biology?

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.470
How does that help us
understand biology better?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.265
-This is the young lady
with the nice smile

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.402
and the pleasing drawl
who came to us last year

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:45.390
from Mississippi.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.940
Her Southern-ness as well as her
blackness made her stand out.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.210
-My days are so filled with
anthropology and those things

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.140
that when was the
last time I ever went

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.820
to go hear something about
computer science or physics?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.120
-As an undergraduate, I was
very appreciative to have

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.760
this opportunity to work
one on one with a professor.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.620
It also gave me a perspective
on the academia life

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.797
that I never had before.

00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:09.880
-I feel that you're missing
this great opportunity

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.240
to talk about some other
kind of revolutionary moment.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.700
Often, in the
middle of a project,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.870
you realize that you have sort
of accretions of old ideas

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.860
that you've never
quite thought through.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.900
And so this was really
fantastic opportunity

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.140
to have people push at those
and push me in new directions.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.420
-It's been a terrific year.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.739
I had fairly ambitious
plans for what

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.280
I was trying to
accomplish this year,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.700
and I think that, for the most
part, that I exceeded them.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.270
-The Schlesinger Library
collects the raw materials

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.300
of women's lives across the
long course of American history

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.140
right up to today.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.600
The women whose raw materials
we collect sometimes

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.690
know that they're
making history.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.650
Most of the women
we collect would

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.790
be surprised to know
that people consider them

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.760
an important part of the story.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.420
-Harvard undergraduates
and graduate students

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.500
use the collection.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.150
There are outside
researchers, faculty

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.640
from other institutions,
independent scholars that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.020
come and use the collection.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.850
-I was working on the
Betty Friedan collection

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.550
in the manuscript department
right about the same time

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.590
that I was reading The
Feminine Mystique in class.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.076
I really value getting to really
get up close to the history.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.930
-We are working extra hard to
digitize as many collections

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.680
as we can.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.450
By making it available
online, people can view it,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.030
they can do research, they can
just scroll through photos,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.740
they can use it in whatever
way that they need to use it.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.209
-What made this
seminar unique was

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.070
that it was a real
mixture from people

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.320
who are basically
neuroscientists

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.770
as well as people
who are economists,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.880
people who are public
policy types, and law types.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.080
The hope was that that could
create some synergy and also

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.540
some future research
that would maybe

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.845
help the-- this is an ambitious
way to think about it--

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:43.350
but maybe help the country
and the world do a bit better

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.520
in the future.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.080
-When Iran and
the US negotiate--

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.830
-We were trying to understand
if neuroscience, at the point

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.490
that it is now, whether
we have something

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.230
to say to policymakers.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.220
-When these two
tribes come together--

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.850
-So I think we started
a communication.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.013
I think that's probably
the most important goal.

00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:05.040
-Should the government
just let him die?

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.830
-Just a few minutes
after the sessions,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.530
people are already thinking
about collaborations

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.110
to do new work.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.020
There's a kind of openness
on the part of the Radcliffe

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.750
Institute to
intellectual experiments

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.740
which maybe go off a beaten
path but which can in the end

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.985
have tremendous payoff.

00:05:33.476 --> 00:05:36.600
-At the Radcliffe Institute,
not only are we committed

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.460
to the creation of new
knowledge and new ideas,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.270
we are firmly committed
to sharing those ideas

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.290
with a larger public, both with
audiences here in Cambridge

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.700
and through live streaming
through the internet.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.400
-If you come to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.895
you should be
coming to interact.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.930
-New breakthroughs or
advances, actually,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.630
often happen at the
boundaries between

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.220
traditional disciplines.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.300
And Radcliffe is just
about the perfect setting

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.310
for that to happen.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.450
-It has the opportunity
to be like a stone dropped

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.030
into a pool, where an action,
an experiment, a conference,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.750
an initiative can then have
lasting influence, or not.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.780
And so the kind of
experimentation and innovation

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.650
that's possible at Radcliffe
offers a great deal.
