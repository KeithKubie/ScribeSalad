00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:17.726
Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry,

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.981
a lesson of transformation.

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.140
Step 1:

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.517
Write it all down.

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:25.017
"Take one memory,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:26.919
explore it like a new land,"

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.595
the visiting poet tells the class.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.491
"Don't leave anything out."

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:34.136
Tyler sits in this high school workshop,

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:36.660
dizzy with where to start.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110
Memories wander in and out of his heart

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.808
like vagrants searching for home.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.387
He bends to his desk,

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:44.605
he writes,

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:45.733
"The snow goes black

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.383
when the moon turns its eyes away,

00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:50.265
all paper is yellow,

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.824
all letters spell eviction note,

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.984
Mama's lies are footsteps

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.326
too many to count.

00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.334
Making excuses on black snow.

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:01.472
'I paid the rent,

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:04.009
this is your room forever, baby.

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.664
I love you.'

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:09.252
But, she wouldn't even look at me."

00:01:09.252 --> 00:01:10.413
Step 2:

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.610
Read out loud.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.882
As he writes, his lips try on words

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:18.891
then toss them out like bad tenants.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:20.868
He pushes his desk back,

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:22.293
stands.

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:24.509
"Aunt Jocelyn's rice pudding was sweet,

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.643
but that's not what I want to write.

00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:28.104
Have you ever been so cold

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.989
your hair becomes an icicle?

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.241
Your little sister's fear of the dark

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.864
freezes on her lips

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:37.792
like she's kissed the ice tray?

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:41.494
How hungry have you been?"

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:43.009
Step 3:

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.020
Cut the fat.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.546
Abandon extra words.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:49.907
His pen becomes a machete,

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:54.245
slashing ands, thens, becauses.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:55.696
Step 4:

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:56.906
Read out loud,

00:01:56.906 --> 00:01:58.281
again.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:00.700
The 11th grade boy makes sure

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.696
Step 3's cuts weren't too deep.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.532
Step 5:

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:07.239
Add flava.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.982
Juice,

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:08.959
power,

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:09.909
movement,

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.212
emotion.

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:14.758
"Vanilla flavoring is the secret to my aunt's pudding.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:18.095
I kick out a few raisins but leave one or two.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:19.224
Life needs some bitter

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:21.506
to man up the sweet."

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:23.510
His hands reach out like shells

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.060
to hold our disbelief.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.454
Is this Tyler speaking?

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.921
The one who keeps his eyes on the floor

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.962
like they're carrying something heavy?

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:36.300
Voice rattles windows.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.633
"I am free now."

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.571
Body quivers with the pulse of each word.

00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.954
"The sun's joy melts snow."

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:46.644
Fingers trace the curve of his jaw.

00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.903
"My aunt's face was warm as a water heater

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:51.395
when she let us in that night."

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.938
Our boy is done,

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:56.415
his transformation complete.

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.213
Step 1: Write it all down.

00:02:58.213 --> 00:02:59.717
Step 2: Read out loud.

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:01.049
Step 3: Cut the fat.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.872
Step 4: Read out loud.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:04.461
Step 5: Add flava.

00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:09.340
Tyler's first poem takes residence in his heart.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.028
He flings his arms wide

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:13.716
like an open door.

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.483
Welcome home!
