00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.780
Ever been used as arm rest by all your friends?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.780
Yeah.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Not fun.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.540
But maybe a little human growth hormone could
help with that.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.360
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.750
I have always said I’m average height, but
growing up I had oddly tall friends.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
I wished there was some way to make myself
taller.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.120
I know I’m about average height for a woman,
which is approximately 5’4.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.250
But there are some vertically challenged people
who aren’t so lucky.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.890
Is there something they could do?

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.450
Well some people take human growth hormone,
to build lean body mass or to add a few extra

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.070
inches to their height.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.600
Human growth hormone is a hormone naturally
produced in high amounts during childhood

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.500
and adolescence, but a study published in
The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.140
found that secretion decreases with age by
around 14% per decade.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.300
The hormone is produced in the pituitary gland,
located at the base of the brain.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.950
HGH tells the liver to produce a hormone called
insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1).

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.140
The two hormones work together to tell the
bones, muscles, and other tissues to grow.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.729
But due to various genetic conditions, like
Turner syndrome, SHOX deficiency and Noonan

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.950
syndrome, some people just don’t produce
the hormone so they tend to be smaller than

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.950
average.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.080
But according to one endocrinologist, if they
take synthetic human growth hormone, they

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.360
could gain one to four inches.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
HGH does more than add a few inches, it can
even take away fat, according to a study published

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
in the New England Journal of Medicine.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
The study found that HGH deficient adults
who take the synthetic hormone gain lean body

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.360
mass and lose some fat body mass, which is
incidentally one of the reasons athletes dope

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
with it.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
But some parents are giving the hormone to
their perfectly healthy, but short children.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.859
Because in our Western culture, we value tallness.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.380
Studies show that taller people are generally
more respected and have higher IQs and according

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.170
to several studies published in the Journal
of Applied Psychology and another published

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.569
in the Journal of Human Capital, over the
course of a lifetime taller folks tend to

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.569
earn more money.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.679
A lot more.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.960
According to lead authors of the Applied Psychology
study, a tall person will “enjoy literally

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.740
hundreds of thousands of dollars of earnings
advantage.”

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.090
But giving your perfectly healthy but short
kid HGH might not be the best idea.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.789
First of all, it’s pretty expensive; costing
as much as 50,000 dollars.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.639
For spending all that money, it might not
even add height to those without a deficiency.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.789
Plus, it can cause some very serious health
issues.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.369
Too much HGH can cause a condition called
acromegaly, which basically causes hands and

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.910
feet swell, overly pronounced facial features,
and excessive sweating.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.470
HGH use can also trigger cardiomyopathy, osteoporosis,
menstrual irregularities, and impotence according

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.560
to a study published in the British Journal
of Sports Medicine.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.920
And one study published in the journal Acta
medica Scandinavica found that condition can

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.500
increase the risk of premature death from
heart problems.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.360
But still knowing all these risks, people
still take HGH for more superficial reasons.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.310
So if your kid doesn’t have a hormone deficiency
and are thinking of spending upwards of 50,000

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.030
dollars to try and boost their height, think
of all the side-effects first.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.340
Being short isn’t really a health condition
and plenty of people wind up just fine looking

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
up at the world.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
Plus they make good arm rests, apparently.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.340
Love science?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.340
Love learning?
