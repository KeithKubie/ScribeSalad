DEVON NEARY: My
name is Devon Neary,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.304
I'm the Community Outreach
Manager here at the CMA.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:17.220
As you all know our
members across the country

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.964
face constant opposition
from environmental groups.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:21.630
I'm here today to
propose some solutions

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.007
for working with these groups
[AUDIO OUT] against them.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.340
Our most recent conflict
involved an environmental group

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.520
trying to block the expansion
of our southwest computer chip

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.070
factory on the grounds
that pollution is causing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.460
a spike in local cancer rates.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.110
So what should our goal be
in designing a working plan

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.580
with this environmental group?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.990
I propose a strategy that is
different from how the CMA

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.840
usually conducts business.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.660
I propose we sit down in
remediated negotiations

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.670
with the environmental
groups and explain

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.440
our side of the
issue, allow them

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.140
to explain their
side of the issue,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.830
and find a consensus
for moving forward

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.320
that enables both
sides to achieve

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
their long-term aims given
the constraints of reality.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
We want to open up a space
to collaborate and brainstorm

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.270
nonbinding options
as a means of moving

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.640
towards a binding agreement.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.347
Why should this be our goal?

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:09.180
Environmental groups
pressure us and attempt

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.430
to block us at our sites
throughout the country.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.994
These disputes have not improved
over the last few decades,

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.410
and it's time for a new approach
to make sure our projects

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.380
progress according to time
and financial constraints.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.270
My research on this
issue supports the idea

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.250
that a consensus-building
approach can improve

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.440
outcomes for all parties.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
Just for a little
bit of context,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.940
in reality, our partners in
the environmental organization

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.490
do not have a lot of
legal ground to stand on.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
Proving the cause of a specific
cancer in a specific individual

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.100
and tying it to a specific
chemical that came out

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.610
of our chip plant
on a specific day

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.110
is very challenging and
costly in a courtroom.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.880
We can gently remind
environmentalists

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.500
that court is expensive,
adversarial, and often drawn

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.000
out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.250
Ultimately, our funding
and legal capabilities

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.510
will defeat theirs.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.544
In addition, in times
of economic duress

00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:54.960
and uncertainty,
local authorities

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840
are going to make way
for our great industry

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.870
to create jobs and capital.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.600
So in some sense,
there's no need for us

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.440
to engage with the
environmentalists.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.450
Without the negotiation,
we'll probably

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.015
still get our expansion.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.389
However, what I
want to point out

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.270
is that we can do better than
that through the negotiation.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.617
We can prove our relationships
with environmentalists,

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:16.950
and we can make it easier and
less costly to do business

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.210
in the future.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.100
I know many of you probably have
some hesitations about this.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.140
Perhaps you feel a
fear of the unknown,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.440
a fear that the
process will fail

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.080
or a fear that the negotiation
will be slow and costly.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.350
But remember we're investing
for long-term gains

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.470
in our relationships with
surrounding communities.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.120
I understand this is atypical
for our powerful industry

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.700
and there will be challenges.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.250
As the views of the CMA and
the views of the environmental

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.896
groups differ radically.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:46.290
The environmentalists may not be
ready or willing to negotiate.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.510
They may be intent
on filing a lawsuit,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.190
or they could draw
out the negotiations

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.210
in a disruptive manner.

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.805
Their ultimate
goal would probably

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:59.910
be to eliminate our plant, but
this is not a realistic demand.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.010
Our plant is already
there and operating well,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.960
so eliminating the
potential carcinogens

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.740
is not a feasible
option for them.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.910
So what is the next best
option for the community?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.680
Our strategy is
to think in terms

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.320
of what we can offer them to
appease some of their concerns

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.572
without giving up
anything precious to us.

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:17.530
Do they need health
clinics in their community?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.400
Do they want a community
buyout so they can relocate?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.470
Would they like a new
nature preserve or funding

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.580
for education?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.852
For our part our members
have to decide away

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.810
from the table, how much
we are willing to give

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.030
to smooth out these
relationships and leverage

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.935
these concessions
in negotiations.

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:33.810
We need to find out what
people on both sides

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.060
are really willing to live with.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.460
We can begin by addressing
their environmental concerns,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.320
talking about issues
of leaks, accidents,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.660
the increased rates of cancer
that they're observing.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.160
How can we prove
to them that we are

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.576
in compliance with regulations
and protecting the abutting

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:47.640
communities?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.100
We can also leverage what we
do well for the community.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.950
We create jobs, we spur
economic development,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.070
we make philanthropic
donations, provide job training.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.180
My job is to get people excited
about chemical manufacturing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.670
and all the wonderful
things we do for the country

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.670
and for the world.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.870
The chips manufacturing
plant in question,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.990
while maybe causing
some pollution,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.780
is manufacturing
computer chips used

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.470
in a wide range of
industries including

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.376
defense, medical research,
education, and so on.

00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:16.709
We believe that if residents
realize the contribution we

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.720
have in their community
and for the country,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.190
they'll be more amenable
to negotiating with us.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.084
So you want to focus
on two principles.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:25.500
You want to focus on maintaining
relationships throughout.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.840
And We want to focus
on mutual gains.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.170
So we'll follow a process
based on a research

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.940
consensus-building approach.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.460
When we are ready to negotiate
and the environmentalist

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.200
express that they
are ready, first we

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.270
will convene and assign roles.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.000
For example, we need
to identify a mediator.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.675
The mediator will schedule
and facilitate the meetings,

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:48.540
consult privately with groups
and push us to build consensus.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.640
We also want to focus on
group problem solving.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.050
How can we create
value as a group?

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.440
By brainstorming
different options together

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.810
based on our interests
and being creative,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.330
we can present
alternative designs.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.670
We can expand the means of
dealing with externalities

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.830
and try to create different
packages of benefits

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.070
we can offer the community.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.330
Once we have created value,
we can talk about ways

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.060
to distribute value to
implement these goals

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.900
and to hold parties accountable
for their commitments.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.870
So just to review the
benefits of engaging

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.750
in a successful negotiation
for our company.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.710
It's an opportunity to educate
the community about our work

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.810
and our constraints to gain
some flexibility in when

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.235
and how requirements are
met and to smooth out

00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:31.610
these longstanding
and disruptive

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.750
and conflicts with
environmentalists.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.250
With the
environmentalists, they can

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.860
achieve better environmental
gains, reap added value,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.860
and enforce stronger business
practices in their community

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.390
all at a lower cost.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.240
Thank you.
