analysis of markets with search

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

frictions to understand this prize we

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
frictions to understand this prize we
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500
frictions to understand this prize we
have to understand the dynamics of the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
have to understand the dynamics of the
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.529
have to understand the dynamics of the
labor market so could you in simple

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
labor market so could you in simple
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.040
labor market so could you in simple
terms

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050
terms
 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.749

tell us what search frictions are and

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759
tell us what search frictions are and
 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.870
tell us what search frictions are and
what their impact is on the labor market

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
what their impact is on the labor market
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.109
what their impact is on the labor market
right so search frictions exist in many

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
right so search frictions exist in many
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.450
right so search frictions exist in many
markets but as you know that the most

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
markets but as you know that the most
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730
markets but as you know that the most
important example is the labor market

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
important example is the labor market
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.780
important example is the labor market
and in the labor market the search

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
and in the labor market the search
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420
and in the labor market the search
frictions show up because workers are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
frictions show up because workers are
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120
frictions show up because workers are
looking for jobs that are suitable to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
looking for jobs that are suitable to
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380
looking for jobs that are suitable to
them and this is a process that takes

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
them and this is a process that takes
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.640
them and this is a process that takes
time

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
time
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160
time
similarly employers are looking for

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
similarly employers are looking for
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.690
similarly employers are looking for
potential workers and they also are

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700
potential workers and they also are
 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.210
potential workers and they also are
looking for specific workers and so this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
looking for specific workers and so this
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.749
looking for specific workers and so this
process of matching the two together is

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759
process of matching the two together is
 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.520
process of matching the two together is
referred to as friction search frictions

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
referred to as friction search frictions
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.160
referred to as friction search frictions
and that's that's an important element

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
and that's that's an important element
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.600
and that's that's an important element
behind why we have unemployment because

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610
behind why we have unemployment because
 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.460
behind why we have unemployment because
when it takes time you will have

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
when it takes time you will have
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.740
when it takes time you will have
unemployed workers and vacancies

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
unemployed workers and vacancies
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.429
unemployed workers and vacancies
unfilled jobs so search frictions is

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
unfilled jobs so search frictions is
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.130
unfilled jobs so search frictions is
that time and resources it it's it needs

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
that time and resources it it's it needs
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.389
that time and resources it it's it needs
to to fill fill job hosts and for people

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
to to fill fill job hosts and for people
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130
to to fill fill job hosts and for people
to apply for posts and be interviewed

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
to apply for posts and be interviewed
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.580
to apply for posts and be interviewed
and for jobs to be accepted exactly so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
and for jobs to be accepted exactly so
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.420
and for jobs to be accepted exactly so
it because that process takes time the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
it because that process takes time the
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.420
it because that process takes time the
laureates thought in this 1970s and we

laureates thought in this 1970s and we
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.420
laureates thought in this 1970s and we
just heard professor Pisa readers this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
just heard professor Pisa readers this
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.509
just heard professor Pisa readers this
describe how he started in the 70s with

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
describe how he started in the 70s with
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.949
describe how he started in the 70s with
an interest in understanding why the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
an interest in understanding why the
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780
an interest in understanding why the
unemployment rate was going up so fast

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
unemployment rate was going up so fast
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.839
unemployment rate was going up so fast
in many European countries so he thought

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849
in many European countries so he thought
 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.119
in many European countries so he thought
we have to think about this it's a huge

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129
we have to think about this it's a huge
 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.309
we have to think about this it's a huge
problem it's a social problem what

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
problem it's a social problem what
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.589
problem it's a social problem what
determines why it's going up so fast and

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599
determines why it's going up so fast and
 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.039
determines why it's going up so fast and
and he discovered that there was no

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
and he discovered that there was no
 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.080
and he discovered that there was no
fully appropriate theory for thinking

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
fully appropriate theory for thinking
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.240
fully appropriate theory for thinking
about how the unemployment rate was

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
about how the unemployment rate was
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.750
about how the unemployment rate was
determined as a result of this costly

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
determined as a result of this costly
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.479
determined as a result of this costly
search so he started working on that and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489
search so he started working on that and
 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.089
search so he started working on that and
and Peter diamond and Dale Mortensen did

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099
and Peter diamond and Dale Mortensen did
 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.190
and Peter diamond and Dale Mortensen did
the same thing on the other side of the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
the same thing on the other side of the
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.679
the same thing on the other side of the
Atlantic so you said there was no sort

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689
Atlantic so you said there was no sort
 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.420
Atlantic so you said there was no sort
of real theories describe what was going

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
of real theories describe what was going
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610
of real theories describe what was going
on what did economists think before the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
on what did economists think before the

three laureates published their their

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389
three laureates published their their
 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.110
three laureates published their their
groundbreaking work I think the idea

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
groundbreaking work I think the idea
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.940
groundbreaking work I think the idea
that there have been that there are

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
that there have been that there are
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.209
that there have been that there are
frictions the idea has perhaps been

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219
frictions the idea has perhaps been
 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.309
frictions the idea has perhaps been
around but it had not been developed

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319
around but it had not been developed
 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.509
around but it had not been developed
into a coherent complete theory to

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
into a coherent complete theory to
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.250
into a coherent complete theory to
really think about all the important

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
really think about all the important
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.559
really think about all the important
components in the labor market so one is

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569
components in the labor market so one is
 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.360
components in the labor market so one is
the worker perspective and the firm

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
the worker perspective and the firm
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.849
the worker perspective and the firm
perspective another one is how they're

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
perspective another one is how they're
 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.059
perspective another one is how they're
matched together and the third one is

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069
matched together and the third one is
 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.039
matched together and the third one is
whether this market works well or or not

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049
whether this market works well or or not
 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.869
whether this market works well or or not
and and I think these questions were

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879
and and I think these questions were
 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.929
and and I think these questions were
mainly not addressed so they have their

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939
mainly not addressed so they have their
 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.449
mainly not addressed so they have their
work has allowed us to think coherently

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459
work has allowed us to think coherently
 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.890
work has allowed us to think coherently
about all these important issues

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
about all these important issues
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.110
about all these important issues
suppose the labor market perceived by

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
suppose the labor market perceived by
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.539
suppose the labor market perceived by
colonists to be like any normal supply

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549
colonists to be like any normal supply
 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.699
colonists to be like any normal supply
and demand market I think a bit more

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
and demand market I think a bit more
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.759
and demand market I think a bit more
like that this is not the only possible

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769
like that this is not the only possible
 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.099
like that this is not the only possible
theory of unemployment I mean you can

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109
theory of unemployment I mean you can
 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.129
theory of unemployment I mean you can
imagine that for some reason wages are

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139
imagine that for some reason wages are
 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.089
imagine that for some reason wages are
too high and then that will create

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099
too high and then that will create
 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.309
too high and then that will create
unemployment and then we have to think

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
unemployment and then we have to think
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.110
unemployment and then we have to think
about why they're too high but I think

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120
about why they're too high but I think
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.759
about why they're too high but I think
it was the first full theory of

it was the first full theory of
 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.110
it was the first full theory of
unemployment and how it evolves over

unemployment and how it evolves over
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.960

time because of search frictions so

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970
time because of search frictions so
 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.030

could you take us through the the key

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
could you take us through the the key
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.189

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479
well and Peter diamond then went to the
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.929
well and Peter diamond then went to the
efficiency question and studied that you

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939
efficiency question and studied that you
 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.390

think about unemployment benefits should

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090
think about unemployment benefits should
 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.369

they increase them should they not

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379
they increase them should they not
 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.740
they increase them should they not
should they decrease them and it goes up

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
should they decrease them and it goes up
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.709
should they decrease them and it goes up
and down in different countries then

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719
and down in different countries then
 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.059

sorry this model as we call it has been

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650
sorry this model as we call it has been
 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.309
sorry this model as we call it has been
used to show quite clearly that

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319
used to show quite clearly that
 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.769
used to show quite clearly that
increased unemployment benefits through

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779
increased unemployment benefits through
 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.180
increased unemployment benefits through
several channels tends to lead to higher

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
several channels tends to lead to higher
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.430
several channels tends to lead to higher
unemployment rates so you can actually

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440
unemployment rates so you can actually
 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.680
unemployment rates so you can actually
see very clearly by just having the

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690
see very clearly by just having the
 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.059
see very clearly by just having the
complete picture the way they have

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069
complete picture the way they have
 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.680
complete picture the way they have
served it up for us

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690
served it up for us
 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.809
served it up for us
then of course the next step is to ask

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819
then of course the next step is to ask
 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.930
then of course the next step is to ask
if it's desirable to doing to in this

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940
if it's desirable to doing to in this
 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.070
if it's desirable to doing to in this
case it would be decrease that

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080
case it would be decrease that
 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.600
case it would be decrease that
unemployment benefit because that would

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610
unemployment benefit because that would
 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.570
unemployment benefit because that would
lower the unemployment rate but then one

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580
lower the unemployment rate but then one
 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.540
lower the unemployment rate but then one
has to think about the unemployed

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
has to think about the unemployed
 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.279
has to think about the unemployed
workers if you lower the benefits it's

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289
workers if you lower the benefits it's
 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.689
workers if you lower the benefits it's
it's bad for those who are unemployed

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699
it's bad for those who are unemployed
 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.309
it's bad for those who are unemployed
and that's of course a trade-off

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319
and that's of course a trade-off
 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.480
and that's of course a trade-off
so before you make policy changes you

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490
so before you make policy changes you
 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.120
so before you make policy changes you
have to also consider other aspects like

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130
have to also consider other aspects like
 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.629
have to also consider other aspects like
their insurance aspect so I think

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639
their insurance aspect so I think
 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.310
their insurance aspect so I think
policymakers you

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320
policymakers you
 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.580
policymakers you
the model to really highlight this this

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590
the model to really highlight this this
 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.760
the model to really highlight this this
important aspects of of the the choice

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770
important aspects of of the the choice
 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.590
important aspects of of the the choice
of that particular instrument but it's

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600
of that particular instrument but it's
 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.840
of that particular instrument but it's
similar with other changes in labor

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850
similar with other changes in labor
 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.670
similar with other changes in labor
market regulations you can sort of feed

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680
market regulations you can sort of feed
 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.950
market regulations you can sort of feed
them through the model and analyze the

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960
them through the model and analyze the
 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.710
them through the model and analyze the
outcome and you mentioned that towards

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720
outcome and you mentioned that towards
 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.990
outcome and you mentioned that towards
the beginning that they the models also

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000
the beginning that they the models also
 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.780
the beginning that they the models also
used in other situations you mentioned

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790
used in other situations you mentioned
 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.100
used in other situations you mentioned
in the announcement that the housing

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110
in the announcement that the housing
 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.780
in the announcement that the housing
market was was was one situation has

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790
market was was was one situation has
 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.430
market was was was one situation has
used that could you give us a bit more

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440
used that could you give us a bit more
 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.770
used that could you give us a bit more
detail about how it's used and what

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780
detail about how it's used and what
 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.410
detail about how it's used and what
information it provides right so the

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420
information it provides right so the
 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.360
information it provides right so the
housing market is not the example right

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370
housing market is not the example right
 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.080
housing market is not the example right
because we all care about much more than

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090
because we all care about much more than
 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.050
because we all care about much more than
just the price of a house we want to we

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060
just the price of a house we want to we
 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.280
just the price of a house we want to we
wanted to have certain characteristics

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.290
wanted to have certain characteristics
 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.120
wanted to have certain characteristics
and qualities that we like so there's a

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130
and qualities that we like so there's a
 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.830
and qualities that we like so there's a
bunch of people searching for a house

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840
bunch of people searching for a house
 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.710

secondly the in the housing market there
are some interesting things like

are some interesting things like
 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.060
are some interesting things like
seasonal fluctuations I think is an
