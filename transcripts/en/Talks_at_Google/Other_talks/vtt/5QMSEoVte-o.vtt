00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.810
DIANA: Hi.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.580
Welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.160
I am thrilled today to be able
to introduce Mollie Katzen.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.750
I feel like I've
met an old friend.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.710
I have my "Moosewood
Cookbook" from about 1981.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.340
I was in grad school.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.380
And one of my roommates
bought the cookbook,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.070
and we started
cooking out of it.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.540
And I had never been exposed
to vegetarian food before.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.180
And it's absolutely delicious.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.210
And I have made
the quiche recipe

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.439
in this book so many
times over the years

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.830
I can't even remember.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.850
I can't even count them.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.190
And so I am very, very excited.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.120
And Mollie is here with
her latest cookbook.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.725
How many cookbooks have you--

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:45.190
MOLLIE KATZEN: It's number 12.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.315
DIANA: This is number 12.

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:48.220
My library is a little depleted.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.860
I need to stock
up-- hop on Amazon.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.110
No, I actually talk to Nadine.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.910
That's what I need to do.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.731
"Heart of the Plate"-- and
so please welcome Mollie.

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.772
MOLLIE KATZEN: Thank you.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:02.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.610
MOLLIE KATZEN: You said you'd
be brief, and you didn't lie.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.380
Thanks for coming.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.546
It's so much fun to be here.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.070
And people eating their lunch
while I'm talking about food

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.890
is very homey.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.990
I am thrilled to be here.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.120
I've been enjoying talking
about my 12th and last book.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.890
And I say my 12th and last
book, and then people go, oh.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.610
And then I say don't
worry, because it follows

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.300
by four years my
11th and last book.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.170
And I started writing my
last book in 1988 or '89.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510
But there's a reason for that.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.190
Every time I finish
a cookbook, I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.670
feel that I couldn't possibly
find something more to say.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.950
I feel like how many things
can you say about eggplant?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.015
I've said 42 things
about eggplant.

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:45.800
Maybe there's 48
things to say about it.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.730
But the knowledge
keeps changing,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.250
and the ingredients
keep getting better.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.270
And the demographics and the
willingness and the interest

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.120
shifts around quite a bit.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.037
So there's always, it
seems, more to say.

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.620
What I want to talk about first
of all, right out of the gate,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.161
since, Diana, you
suggested that this

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:07.740
would be a good portal for
the subject matter at hand,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.270
that the title of this
book and the subtitle

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.370
are two things that are worth
looking into because they

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.760
were not simple decisions.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.800
The main title of the
book,"The Heart of the Plate,"

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.860
doesn't say vegetarian recipes.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.164
It doesn't say how
to not eat meat.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.330
You'll notice it just says
"The Heart of the Plate."

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.030
And in fact, it's both a
question and an answer.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.905
The answer is threefold.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:35.780
Maybe it's four-fold.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.640
But at this point I'm
thinking threefold.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
First of all, it reflects
the most literal fact that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.290
to eat a certain way based
on plant foods taking up

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.030
most of your plate
is heart healthy.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.950
So there's the heart part of it.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.040
That's your heart.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.360
And then there was
a very personal memo

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.800
I got from my editor on this
book who when she launched me

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.710
into it when we finished our
discussion outlining what it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.540
might be, she said,
OK, I don't want

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.000
to see you or hear
from you for two years.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.300
Write your heart.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.624
Goodbye.

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.790
And then I'm sitting there
thinking, write my heart.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.950
What does that mean?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.030
And it evolved into
writing what I love.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.331
So there's that
romantic interpretation

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:16.330
of "Heart of the Plate."

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.240
And then there's
also the plate itself

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.890
and what is at the
heart of your plate?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.390
What is at the
center of your plate?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.530
And that is where it
becomes a question.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.540
What is the model
that we've grown up,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.630
the model that lets
us know we've eaten?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.990
There are so many
psychological associations

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.980
with what it means to
have a plate of food that

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.080
satisfies you.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.900
It's not just eating cerebrally,
what I think I should eat,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.110
or eating centrally,
what I'm hungry for.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.150
It's also what you're
hungry for emotionally,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.590
the plate of your childhood,
which for many of us

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.766
has a big hunk of
meat at the center.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.390
And if vegetables
appear there, they're

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.010
mostly decorative or a
token or on the side--

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.180
literally, side dishes.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.870
But the main thing is the hunk
at the center of the plate.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.620
I both question
that in this book

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.020
and also offer
different arrangements

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.270
for your plate, which we'll
talk about in a minute.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.440
The secondary title is also
a series of semantic queries

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.890
and challenges-- "Vegetarian
Recipes for a New Generation."

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.459
I use the word vegetarian
pretty much for the first time

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.010
on the cover of any of my books.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.670
It's not a word I
like, and for me,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.430
the interpretation of
that word is not simple.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.830
What does vegetarian mean?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.380
I am not somebody who's
against eating meat.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.040
In fact, I like a little
bit of meat once in a while.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.630
And so here I am talking
about a vegetarian book,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.170
and we go right to
the subject of meat.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.610
In fact, for the most part,
if you think about it,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.680
when people talk about
vegetarian-- when someone

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.380
sits down at your
table and says,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.870
I'm a vegetarian--
what they're mainly

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.730
doing is making a
statement about meat,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.040
as in, I don't want any; as
in, keep it off my plate.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.730
In the 40 years in which
I've been writing cookbooks,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.520
I have found that almost always
the word vegetarian is that.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.310
It's about meat,
as in keep it away.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.230
And also, I have found so many
self-described vegetarians

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.960
for whom it has nothing or very
little to do with vegetables.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.520
It's mostly about the meat.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.570
So it's not as
though someone says,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.430
I would like to stop
eating meat and therefore I

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.052
am madly interested
in Brussels sprouts.

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.510
The stopping eating meat for
whatever reasons, whether it's

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.510
ethical or environmental or
some combination or aesthetic,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.510
very often has nothing
to do with whether or not

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.290
you're going to be chowing
down on kale salads,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.790
which, by the way,
I think were just

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.210
invented in the last two years.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.848
Something happened with kale.

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:44.340
We can explore.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.630
So I use the word
vegetarian in the subtitle,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.500
in the secondary title,
because I personally

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.180
choose to redefine it.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.110
My definition of vegetarian
has nothing to do with meat

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.460
except for the fact that in
my perfect world, by the time

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.780
we're all done putting
as much beautiful plant

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.140
food on this reconfigured
plate as we want,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.310
there isn't much room
for anything else.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.640
If there's room, is an
incidental topping, which

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.760
could be egg noodles,
which is, in my book,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.960
a thin omelette
sliced into strips

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.320
so that it looks like
noodles, but it's really egg.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.520
Same thing with
tofu-- tofu noodles.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.520
If somebody wants a little bit
of meat but mostly vegetables,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.550
it could be a few strips
of last night's steak,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.590
left over, cut on top.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.500
But it's not a statement
about meat, really.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.980
It's a state about what
is the whole plate.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.790
And the plate is
filled with plant food.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.030
So this leads me to my
new vegetarian definition,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.590
which I hope you'll
agree with and adopt,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.560
which is I want vegetarian
to become in our vernacular

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.180
an adjective that describes
the food on the plate

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.560
and not a noun that identifies
the person eating the food.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.920
Can we all repeat this?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.960
Repeat after me.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.170
Once we do that, once we
take the word vegetarian

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.220
and describe the
food with it instead

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.950
of IDing the person with it,
it becomes incredibly flexible.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.417
And it becomes, I
hope, a big tent

00:07:09.417 --> 00:07:12.000
where everybody feels like they
can sit down at the same table

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.790
and eat the same basic meal.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.790
Whether they're adding
that little bit of strips

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.240
of steak on top or the little
bit of egg on top or not,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.790
this is a table where somebody
who was a strict vegan--

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.830
meaning, as you all probably
know, no animal products

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.530
whatsoever, no
egg, in some cases

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.650
no honey, nothing that has
anything to do with animals

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.420
except for the problematic fact
that soil, good healthy soil,

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.495
is filled with little tiny
microorganisms that are alive.

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:40.670
Little inconvenient fact, but
other than that, it's basically

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.490
is completely
independent of animals--

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.010
the vegan can sit down at the
table with the vegetarian who

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.784
eats lacto-ovo, as
they say, with somebody

00:07:49.784 --> 00:07:51.700
who might have had steak
for dinner last night

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.980
and might have it
again tomorrow night

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.400
but tonight wants
the plant food.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.870
They can all share
the same meal.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.720
And it's a big
tent, one big table,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.940
everybody enjoying their
plant food together.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.060
That's my dream
situation-- very long way

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.600
of saying that's
basically the beginning

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.556
part of my secondary
title in the book.

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:10.180
But I'm not finished
yet with the title

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.800
because the secondary part
of the secondary title

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.410
is "Vegetarian Recipes
for a New Generation."

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.797
I had somebody my age
say to me, oh, but I

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:19.880
want to cook from it, too.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.726
Is only for the young people?

00:08:21.726 --> 00:08:24.100
And I said, oh no, that's not
what I meant by generation,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.250
or is it?

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.560
Then I realized, oh,
multiple meanings once again.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.350
New generation-- yes,
people coming up, learning

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.010
how to cook, young
people who, in my life,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:42.460
the young people have a far
more open hearted, embracing,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.290
ecumenical sense
of what food is.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.489
It's much less narrow
than when I was coming up.

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:48.280
At least those are the
young people I know.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.340
But also, the new generation
part first personally to myself

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.790
because I grew so much
as a cook from the time

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.369
I first published "The
Moosewood Cookbook"

00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:00.160
until publishing "The
Heart of the Plate"--

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.310
almost 40 years in between.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.840
I became a much better cook
and a much simpler cook.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.910
My cooking used to be very
complicated, at least to me.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.780
When I first started,
once upon a time,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.190
I considered it very clever to
put as many things in any given

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.340
dishes as you could
find in your kitchen.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.970
I call it the kitchen
sink school of cuisine.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.687
And so I would be breathlessly
going through my kitchen

00:09:25.687 --> 00:09:27.770
and dumping everything I
could into a single dish,

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.820
always with sunflower
seeds and soy sauce.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.330
And if eggs went in,
they'd be beaten,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.330
so it would hold together
and come out hopefully

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.130
in squares or triangles or
whatever shape you want.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.570
But it was a very complex,
layered sense of cuisine,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.510
if that's what you can
generously call it.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.330
But now, I will keep
it's so simple this

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.996
if just a splash
of good olive oil

00:09:51.996 --> 00:09:53.620
will make something
taste good to maybe

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.595
a sprinkle of some designer
salt, I'm thrilled.

00:09:56.595 --> 00:10:00.130
The old days, I thought
it meant you were clever

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.760
if you could put a lot
of stuff in a dish.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.286
Nowadays, I don't
feel like it's really

00:10:05.286 --> 00:10:07.410
about people thinking the
cookbook author is clever

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.820
so much as I really
want people to get

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.903
their dinner on the table.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:11.750
And I am your
coach, and I really

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.810
want you to be cooking at home,
except for the fact that they

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.900
feed you so well here.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.600
MOLLIE KATZEN: I was having
lunch here, and I was asking,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.600
is it OK to talk about
cooking at home to people

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.080
who work at Google and get
all their meals-- it is?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.780
I like the nod.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.980
Thank you very much.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.580
And then there's one more
piece to the definition

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.320
of new generation,
and that is it's

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.280
romantic-- bear with-- the idea
of regeneration in all of us,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.800
that we can all learn new
skills and be opened up.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.370
Even though we're
very experienced,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.130
we could be opened up to
new experiences and new ways

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.150
of looking at cooking and food.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:54.330
If I have two goals-- and
I like to narrow it down.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.020
OK, three-- neither
one of them has

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.000
to do with getting
people to eat less meat,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.310
although that is
embedded in my message.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.112
One of them is to get people to
fall in love with plant food.

00:11:06.112 --> 00:11:08.320
Another one of them is to
get people cooking at home.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.390
Forgive me, Google.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.820
Cooking at home is a wonderful
birthright to all human beings,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.860
cooking where we live,
making our own food.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.090
And that's a skill that needs
rescuing in our culture.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.920
So I'm part of that squad.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.840
And then the third goal
is-- and this is perfect

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.600
because you're divided it
into two sets of chairs,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.300
so you can be the visual--
we have in our culture

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.300
a sense of dichotomy about food.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.300
So here's the
firewall, this aisle.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.340
And on one side is food that's
healthy and good for us,

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.740
that we know we're
supposed to be eating.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.060
And it's very depressed, and
it's not very well seasoned.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.090
It's those spears of raw
broccoli and zucchini from 1982

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.160
when you go to a
cocktail party--

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.120
big ones, really raw, like never
cooked ever, with an onion dip.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.680
And everyone's standing
around, thinking,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.850
ew, pretending they like it.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.410
But if it's the undercooked,
under-seasoned, under-salted--

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.890
I call it remorse cuisine.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.600
It's healthy.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.180
And you will be
miserable eating it,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.130
but the paradox is you'll
live supposedly longer.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.410
But you won't really want to.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.782
Life will be longer, but
it will seem interminable.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.240
But the dichotomy
on the other side

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.150
is food that's delicious
and sensual and compelling.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.872
And we want it, and we love it.

00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:37.330
But we'll pay later
because it will

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.600
be unhealthy or bad for us.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.030
And the adjectives that
food writers-- not me--

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.810
use a lot for this is
decadent or sinful.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.600
You've seen those in the
restaurants-- or syndrome

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.970
where the waiter brings one
piece of chocolate cake for six

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.000
of us with six forks,
and everyone's going,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.949
we're being so evil.

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:02.490
But we're going to
really enjoy this,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.420
but we're going to
feel-- the syndrome is,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.200
if it's really,
really delicious,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.200
it can't possibly be healthy.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.110
So we straddle this division,
and we struggle with it.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.250
But long way of saying one
of my very biggest goals

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.890
is to get rid of that division
altogether-- no firewall.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.270
Move all your chairs in.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.740
No aisle, except for fire
safety in this building,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.740
and understand that food
that is good for you

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.030
and food that is delicious
can be a one and the same.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.235
Good for you, good
tasting, just get

00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:36.610
rid of all of the other words
and just use the word good,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.026
and all the food
can be delicious.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.780
And that's one of my goals.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.780
One of the things that's
made it so much easier

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.570
to write vegetarian/plant
food-based cuisine

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.100
is that ingredients have
gotten so much better.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.800
Putting this into a cultural
and historical context,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.990
40 years ago, when I
started writing cookbooks,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.090
you could not find a bottle
of really good olive oil

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.250
in this country in
any supermarket.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.040
You could barely find
fresh vegetables.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.970
Bell peppers, for example,
were always green and bitter.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.370
Red bell peppers did
exist, but they were rare,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.560
and they were expensive.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.270
If you found one,
it was a big deal,

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.376
and you would have
to call somebody

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:20.750
when you found a
good red pepper,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.820
and you'd want to use it
judiciously and not waste it.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.600
Things we're so much
more limited then.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.650
And also-- and this
is a mixed blessing

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:33.090
because I'm nostalgic
for this-- the fact

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:38.634
that food really was local
and seasonal because that

00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:39.550
was all you could get.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.290
Until very recently, it
wasn't a thing to be local

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.370
or to be seasonal, which
now it's become chic.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.300
But it used to be
what there was.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.140
Local food was the
food that grew near you

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.700
that you would get in season.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.590
I'm from upstate
New York originally.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.920
I now live in the
East Bay, which

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.950
is so heavenly in
terms of fresh--

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.606
my East Coast friends
are so envious

00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:03.230
because I just put
in a bed of lettuce,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.610
and it's beginning of December.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.450
We're very blessed to live here.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.630
When I first moved to the
Bay Area, the very first time

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.920
in the early '70s, when
I was writing recipes,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.060
I would have to call my mother,
who lived in upstate New York,

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.640
in the middle of winter to
see what was available there.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.802
And practically nothing was.

00:15:22.802 --> 00:15:24.260
I didn't want to
write recipes only

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.801
for people who lived
in the Bay Area,

00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:28.670
although that would've
been a whole lot easier.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.580
So the idea that we can
get most food most places

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.430
most of the time is a
very mixed blessing.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.970
But the good side of it is it
makes it a lot more possible

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.200
to write recipes that are
very simple for very good

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.120
produce a good deal of the time.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.360
There are grains and legumes and
different kinds of nuts and not

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.600
just good olive oil but
all sorts of good oils.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.960
Oils made from roasted nuts
are some of my favorites,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.020
that you can drizzle on
at the end of your cooking

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.010
and have it taste
just berserkly good.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.370
I love that you're smiling.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.620
You've done that, haven't you?

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.790
I can tell.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:07.040
So all this good
selection of ingredients

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.930
makes it so easy to cook simply.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.100
My idea now of a really
good plant food dinner

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.740
is several different
smaller things

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.316
on the plate in some kind
of a smaller arrangement,

00:16:17.316 --> 00:16:19.190
rather than throwing
everything all together.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.520
What you'll find a lot in
The Heart of the Plate.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.319
is a simple legume dish
next to a simple grain dish.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.360
I call it a pilaf, although
technically it's not.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.290
But just a little bit
of a cooked grain,

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.130
maybe mixed with
another cooked grain,

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.350
a drizzle of that nut oil,
a matching nut, toasted,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.920
sprinkled on top-- done.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.560
Maybe a little
parsley-- maybe not.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.760
That next to a simple-
again, olive oil,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.680
it's my cooking crutch.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.359
People ask me how my
cooking has changed.

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:48.400
How do I characterize it?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.530
I say, two words-- olive oil.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.230
There might be a
mashed vegetable.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.930
I'm so in love with
mashed vegetables.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.680
I think I'm still
reacting to those spears

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.910
of the raw broccoli
from 30 years ago.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.550
So I've gone the
other direction,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.470
and now I cook it
until it's really soft

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.099
and run it through
the food processor,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.300
thinking if mashed potatoes,
why not mashed broccoli?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.790
I have mashed parsnip.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.960
I just recently
discovered celery root.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.589
It looks really gnarly
and unapproachable.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.640
But if you approach it,
it's like that big dog

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.040
that looks from a distance
like there is a big dog.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.811
And you go up close, and
it's wagging its tail.

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:26.310
Not a good metaphor
for a vegetable,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.720
but it's friendly in
that way and sweet.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.370
And you peel it easily and
cook it up and mash it.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.130
But on top of the
mashed vegetable,

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.160
you can put a grilled
vegetable that

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.320
has crisp, caramelized edges
and play with the textures.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.940
You can garnish things
with nuts and fruit.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.800
You can make the
plate beautiful.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.620
Guess what we just
completely circumvented?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.440
We circumvented the
hunk of something

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.140
at the center of the
plate, because this

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.380
is more of a collaboration.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.750
Rather than everything
going into one dish

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.270
with the sunflower seeds
coming out and the squares,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.840
I've got a variety.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.680
I love all the metaphors--
the collaboration.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.740
The plate looks like
a mandala, or maybe it

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.580
looks like a constellation.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.500
Or maybe it's a Bento box.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.050
When I do cooking with
preschoolers in Berkeley

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.330
they say, it looks
like a peace sign.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.700
And when I do cooking classes
with the kids in Moran

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.820
they say, it looks like
a Mercedes Benz logo.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.844
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:20.844 --> 00:18:23.010
MOLLIE KATZEN: It's so
similar with the arrangement.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.830
I was showing this
to one of my siblings

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.504
who grew up with me
in the late 1950s,

00:18:28.504 --> 00:18:30.170
and so he said, oh,
it looks like the TV

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.479
dinner with the
little sections--

00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.020
however you want to
see the metaphor.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.900
But it is a plate
that's playful.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.450
It's a plate that's fresh.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.560
It isn't necessarily
at all more work,

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.820
because every little component
on the dish is really simple.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.090
And it becomes a symphony.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.270
It becomes, as I
said, a collaboration,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.540
and it's really a lot of fun.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.910
And I enjoy it greatly.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.330
You could also, though,
go the other direction

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.640
and-- I hate the stealth
approach to vegetables,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.240
but in fact, this
is-- you can start

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.040
to creep more vegetables
into the dishes.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.770
The comfort food
classics that you

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.970
might love like mac
and cheese or lasagna

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.010
or even just plain cooked rice,
start mixing some vegetables in

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.880
to spruce it up and color it up.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.320
At a certain point, we get what
I call the food flip, which

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.740
is that where you started
maybe with, oh, I don't know,

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.200
vegetable fried rice and
you added so much vegetable

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.690
matter to the rice
that it started

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.730
to favor the vegetables
you cross over,

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.180
and it becomes rice fried
vegetables because you flipped

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.030
it in favor of the vegetables.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.970
Or with layered lasagnas,
seasonal lasagnas--

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.950
we're in late fall
now, so I have

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.100
four of them, one
for each season,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.010
plus one with just every kind of
mushroom you can possibly find,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.540
a lasagna overwhelmed
with mushrooms

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.450
that nobody will
ever complain about.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.370
At this time of year, it's
roasted butternut squash,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.060
layered with the noodles but the
squash outnumbers the noodles.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.000
So if people are saying they
don't want to eat carbs,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.260
so you don't have to.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.210
The vegetables have the
glycemically perfect carbs.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.580
And there are roasted red
onions, and there's ruby chard.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.920
And it's a lasagna.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.010
It is so much fun to do this.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.450
And I just want to say also
in terms of food fads and food

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.010
styles and what's trendy-- and
I'm often asked what's trendy,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.210
and I say I have no idea.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.460
Would you like to just know
what I just ate for lunch?

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.850
Because that's my current
trend-- one of the things

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.390
I'm so grateful for is
the end of certain trends.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.700
I date some of them mostly
to, say back, again,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.730
the early '80s with those
raw broccoli spears.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.610
The Ten Speed Press edition
of "The Moosewood Cookbook,"

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.720
which is the one that most
people know, came out in 1977.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.190
Just a few years later, in
the early '80s, in addition to

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.150
the raw vegetable fad,
suddenly everybody

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.720
was talking about low fat
being the ideal way to eat.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.620
And I don't know
how this happened,

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.880
but the low fat craze
set in in the early '80s.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.900
And suddenly, everything
had to be steamed.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.240
It was part of, again,
the remorse cuisine.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.010
And I just have to
share how painful it

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.060
was for this
cookbook author to be

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.130
trying to come up with a
recipe for potato latkes

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.410
during the low fat era.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.410
It was really depressed.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.100
It was so sad.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.970
And there was just no way
you could make polite latkes.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.940
They have to be really
rudely oily and crisp.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.820
Interestingly, if you were
to graph the low fat trend

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:41.230
in the '80s, the obesity
epidemic mirrors it exactly.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.800
And those were the
days when I would

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.450
make a beautiful chocolate chip
cookie filled with real butter

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.491
and offer it to somebody.

00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:51.980
And they would say, oh no, I
cannot eat that because it has

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.790
butter in it.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.190
And then they'd go to the
store and buy an entire boxes

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.830
Nabisco Snackwell's
fat free cookies

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.110
and eat the entire
box of cookies.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.840
This was the most irrational--
thank you for going like this.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.320
You guys are so good.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.500
When that fad finally
subsided-- of course,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:15.220
it morphed into the low carb
fad, the Atkins one-- what

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.320
all of that subsided,
what we were left with

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.050
was just real food.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.800
There is nothing more
satisfying to me now

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.610
than to, again, that
bottle of olive oil

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.870
and being able to drizzle
it on the vegetables

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.080
and knowing it is one of
the healthiest things you

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.900
could possibly do.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.780
This is such a
great piece of news.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.240
It's a two-fer or
maybe a three-fer.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.397
Not only does that olive oil
make the food taste better

00:22:38.397 --> 00:22:39.980
and make the cook a
whole lot happier.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.980
It also elevates
the bioavailability

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.610
of the beta carotenes and
all of the phytonutrients

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.990
in that green vegetable.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.940
So you're actually getting more
out of it, you should know,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.400
by adding oil to the vegetable.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.750
So that part is all wonderful.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.230
So in fact, in this
book, because olive oil

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.360
is, A, so available now and
so delicious and so high end

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.270
and really affordable
when you think

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.570
about it in context of
the fact that you will now

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.660
be eating a lot
less meat-- again,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.110
this is not against meat.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.860
But certainly when
you eat less of it,

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.020
you have more money for the
olive oil and the nut oils--

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.990
that cooking becomes simpler,
and it becomes more joyful.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.810
And what happens also is
it becomes more creative.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.540
One of the things I hope people
will do with these recipes

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.830
is gain the confidence
to follow them maybe once

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.840
and then to just
decide-- and this

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.950
is what I tell you in the
beginning of the book.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.870
It's my book until you buy it.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.570
Take it home, and
then it's your book.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.320
They're my recipes
while I'm testing them,

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.800
and I'm responsible
for them working.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.480
Take them literally just
once, and then change them

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.870
and make them your own.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.770
They're all very, very flexible.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.000
I've tried to keep
them really simple.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.540
I know, for example, that if a
recipe has too many ingredients

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.840
in it, if that list,
ingredient list in bold,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.900
if it's one or two ingredients
too long, that you will likely

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.070
turn the page and not make it.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.190
So I've tried to keep it
as simple as possible.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.480
And in cases where there are
a lot of things that you could

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.950
add-- because they
were on my list

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.700
when I went into my kitchen
to test this recipe,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.490
I thought I might
end up adding x, y,

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.100
and z in addition to a, b, c, d.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.840
But I didn't get to x, y,
and z because at d or e,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.586
I took a taste, and I was happy.

00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:28.960
And there was a
part of me going,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.970
I'd like to add all these other
ingredients because it makes

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.710
me look more clever, and it
makes the book look cooler.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.570
Then I thought there's
somebody at home who's

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.750
had whatever kind
of day they've had.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.090
They have whatever kind
of time constraint.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.500
They're in whatever
kind of mood,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.320
and they need to get
dinner on the table.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.060
I'm really thinking about you.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.840
And I want them to, at
a glance, have a sense

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.710
that this recipe is
something that they can do,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.830
and so I keep it simple.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.980
However, the part
of my list that

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.070
didn't make it into the basic
recipe is on the next page

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.900
under a heading called
optional enhancements.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.150
And that's where I get to
share what I might have done

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.280
or what you might do to
take it further and make

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.510
it more complicated.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.640
But in the meantime, I've kept
it as simple as I possibly can

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.140
and as friendly
as I possibly can.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.630
And so I hope this will
find you making friends

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.410
with more vegetables, more
grains, more legumes, more

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:28.070
nuts, cooking all together,
and feeding people and making

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.580
them happy.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.110
I also really hope that when
you sit down with people--

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.000
and this is another
one of the reasons

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.720
I question the word vegetarian.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.667
When you make this
beautiful plant food,

00:25:39.667 --> 00:25:41.500
I hope that people
sitting down at the table

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.480
together who have different
eating identities--

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.926
say there's vegan, a
self-identified vegan,

00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:48.300
because I hate
the labels myself.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.070
I really don't
like them, somebody

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.850
who identifies as a vegan
and somebody who identifies

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.220
as a vegetarian and
somebody who has no clue

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.960
and is just there for the food--
that for at least the duration

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.720
of the meal, we leave all
these differences behind

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.161
and that nobody judges
anybody else's mouthful

00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:09.160
and that everybody eats
peacefully at the table,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.460
because the last
thing I want to do

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.834
with the vegetarian
and the vegan

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:13.740
and all these
different identities

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.200
is add to the sense of
otherizing other people

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.150
over personal choices
and habits through food.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.617
Food-- and this is the
preachy part of my talk,

00:26:23.617 --> 00:26:25.200
I'll keep brief--
it should be the one

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.410
thing that brings us together.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.410
The table should
be the place where

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.450
whatever other divisions we
feel, disagreements we feel,

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.630
or the otherization
of others that we feel

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.560
can be left at the
door and for once,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.370
just for the
duration of the meal,

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.960
we can sit down and not feel
as differences but chow down

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.104
together and enjoy
the same food,

00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:47.270
even if the person next to
puts that little leftover

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.400
steak on top of their broccoli.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.860
So that's my hope for all of you
and how you'll use this book.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.110
And now I open the floor
to your many questions,

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.030
which I'm sure you'll have.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.210
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite brand of olive oil

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.080
to keep around for
a general cooking?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.561
Because there are so many--
at the supermarket even,

00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:07.310
there are so many.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.430
MOLLIE KATZEN: I know,
there are so many brands.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.330
Another benefit to
living in California

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.215
is that the olive oil options
are greater here because there

00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.450
are so many boutique ones.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.922
I always look for dark bottles.

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:27.890
Olive oil, similar to coffee, is
sensitive to light, heat, air.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.360
If you shop at Trader
Joe's, the best one

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.010
there is, in my opinion, the
Greek Kalamata olive oil.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.870
It's the most flavorful.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.320
And then I buy
boutique olive oils.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.050
Or I actually get them sent
to me a lot for tasting.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.520
And the really, really fruity
ones, the highest end ones,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.510
are great for finishing,
not necessarily for cooking.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.050
The smoke point for olive
oil is pretty resistant,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.930
but those really fruity ones--
but I'd say my workhorse one is

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.602
that Kalamata one
from Trader Joe's.

00:27:59.602 --> 00:28:01.310
I use olive oil for
most things, but when

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.670
I'm not using olive oil,
my other workhorse oil

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.470
is grapeseed,
which I love a lot.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.820
Just the green color
is so beautiful.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.059
DIANA: [INAUDIBLE]
cookbook, how is it new?

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:13.600
MOLLIE KATZEN: It's new because
the publisher wanted the word

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.359
new on there.

00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:16.900
AUDIENCE: There are
some differences.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.655
I compared it to my old
one-- but not a lot.

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:19.030
MOLLIE KATZEN: There
are some differences.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.140
And this is all going to change
because in the fall of 2014,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.430
we're going to reissue The
Moosewood Cookbook for one

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.620
of its many anniversaries.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.270
This will be the 40th of my
own self-published edition.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.510
And we're going to combine some
of the old and new material.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.940
In 1992, when "Moosewood"
was about 15-- because again,

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.210
there were many editions--
I went through the book

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.750
and tested every recipe again.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.100
I wanted to see if I
agreed with myself.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.782
I wanted to see how I would cook
those recipes 15 years after

00:28:52.782 --> 00:28:55.240
and hadn't been at the Moosewood
Restaurant for a long time

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.410
and just wanted to see.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.877
I'd never made
them all in a row.

00:28:57.877 --> 00:28:59.460
I really actually
went chronologically

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.700
through the book, and I
would glance at their recipes

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.570
and then close the book and
then improvise and write down

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.680
what I did and compare.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.614
And in many cases,
it was identical.

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:11.280
And in some cases,
it was not, because I

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.520
had a lot of extra
butter and eggs

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.730
that I purposely put
into the early recipes

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.400
that I felt could come not
necessarily completely out

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.470
but could be reduced.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.982
So there are recipes, for
example, the French onion soup,

00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:29.440
which I believe in
the original one

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.930
had eight tablespoons of
butter for about six to eight

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.390
servings, and I
realized that it could

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.580
taste just as good with only
maybe three or four or two

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.910
tablespoons of butter.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.450
So it was trimmed
down in that way.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.350
And then I added
some new recipes.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.810
I took out some recipes I
thought no one ever used,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.730
but then some
people yelled at me

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.229
because they had
actually used them.

00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:50.146
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:51.770
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of questions.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.470
First of all, it's such
a treat to have you here.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.790
MOLLIE KATZEN: Thank you.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.581
AUDIENCE: And I recently
moved to Berkeley,

00:29:55.581 --> 00:29:57.579
and so it's fun to know
that you live there.

00:29:57.579 --> 00:29:58.870
MOLLIE KATZEN: Monterey market?

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.640
So my first question
is if you could

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.990
talk about protein-rich
vegetables or the protein

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.010
content in vegetables.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.760
And then the second thing, I am
having a chef over for dinner,

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.964
and I'm not as good
of a cook as he is.

00:30:12.964 --> 00:30:14.630
And I'm wondering if
there is any recipe

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.150
that you particularly recommend
from your new cookbook?

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:17.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.608
MOLLIE KATZEN: Oh, boy.

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:22.480
What kind of chef--
any specialty?

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.170
Nice person?

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.960
I assume it's a nice
person if you're

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.512
inviting this person for dinner.

00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:28.400
AUDIENCE: Very nice,
open person, yeah.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.525
MOLLIE KATZEN: Well, I'll
start with the second one

00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:33.280
because it's easier for me to
answer the second question.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.710
I would guess, wild guess,
just out of the blue,

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.850
most cooking
professionals never get

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.660
invited over to anyone's
house for dinner

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.180
or rarely do and will
be grateful for anything

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.865
you serve.

00:30:46.865 --> 00:30:49.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.580
MOLLIE KATZEN: Just a
little trade secret.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.580
Keep it very simple.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.950
Keep the ingredients
really fresh.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.250
This is pure, simple arithmetic.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.880
If x tastes delicious and
y tastes delicious and z

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.330
tastes delicious and it's
not a crazy combination

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.190
but it's logical, they're going
to taste delicious together.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.510
They're not going to lose
traits as they blend.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.800
It'll build.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.730
Unless it's wild and crazy,
in which case, good luck.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.279
See, it might go well.

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:23.820
But I would say keep
it really simple

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.310
and make sure the ingredients
are top of the line.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:31.770
And then I love my mac
and cheese recipes.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.560
One of my favorites is the one
that has spinach and mushrooms,

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.480
and the white sauce, which
is made with white cheddar,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.605
is also made with beer.

00:31:41.605 --> 00:31:43.230
That's one of my
favorites, personally.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.910
And then you can top it
with toasted walnuts, which

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:51.930
take it over into beyond land.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.790
I do not really know about the
protein levels in vegetables.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.760
So I wish I could answer
that, but I don't.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.960
I'm fortunate enough to
have a bit of a pipeline

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.410
to the researchers at the
Harvard School of Public Health

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.950
Nutrition Department because
they're my good friends.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.096
And they usually keep me
informed about the latest

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:12.970
nutritional findings.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.360
I just owe them--
we all owe them--

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.750
so much because they redeemed
oil and fat so beautifully.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.996
Thank you.

00:32:21.996 --> 00:32:25.810
But I don't really understand
the protein content

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.960
of vegetables so much.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.070
I'm old fashioned in
that I recognize it

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.830
more in legumes and
whole grains and nuts.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.570
So I would love it if you find
that if you'd let me know.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.365
Thanks.

00:32:36.365 --> 00:32:39.450
AUDIENCE: So growing up Chinese,
we eat rice with every meal.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.700
So I've started to
substitute the carb part

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.300
with sweet potatoes or potatoes.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.894
But beans and legumes and
lentils are my downfall.

00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:48.310
I don't know what
to do with them.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.310
MOLLIE KATZEN: Why are
they your downfall?

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.320
AUDIENCE: I just don't
know what to do with them.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.445
I didn't grow up with them.

00:32:51.445 --> 00:32:54.700
I just boil them and add
salt, and that seems terrible.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.655
MOLLIE KATZEN: Why?

00:32:55.655 --> 00:32:57.863
What kind of beans and
legumes are you talking about?

00:32:57.863 --> 00:32:59.870
AUDIENCE: Just red
beans, black beans.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.080
So I was wondering if
you had any advice.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.030
I wanted to try different
carbs with dinner

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.315
that's not rice and potatoes.

00:33:06.315 --> 00:33:07.690
MOLLIE KATZEN:
Well first of all,

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:13.610
for beans, the kind that you
buy dried and soak and then cook

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.380
after you soak
them, they do age.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.780
So beans that have been
sitting in some bin,

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.850
whether in the store or in your
house, for two years or more,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.050
they will be tougher
and have less flavor.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.750
So even with dried beans, make
sure they're relatively fresh.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.290
Same with dried
herbs and spices,

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.740
too-- they sit around,
they all start to smell

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.540
like white noise, if
white noise has a smell.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.720
So fresh dried and then soak.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.570
And then lose the soaking
water and cook in fresh water.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.800
What I almost always do
is I'll infuse that water

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.730
as the beans are cooking.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.870
Garlic cloves-- whole garlic
cloves go in, chunks of onion.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.510
I'm very fond of adding ginger,
just big slices of ginger.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.870
If you can get fresh turmeric,
things like that-- seasonings

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:02.460
directly in.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.720
Sometimes when I'm
going Italian style

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.510
with white beans,
one sprig of Rosemary

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.420
in with the garlic in
the bean cooking water,

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.009
they will infuse utterly.

00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:14.550
They'll soak it
right up, and they'll

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.679
retain that flavor-- and
then a good, fruity olive oil

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.440
if it's Italian style.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.230
If it is Asian style-- a nut
oil or a roasted seed oil,

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.199
sesame or pumpkin seed oil.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.220
Those oils, they're volatile.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.469
They're precious in every way.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:30.885
They're precious
in terms of being

00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:33.219
a little pricey and,
again, unstable.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.900
But you keep them
in the refrigerator

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.699
and use them sparingly
as a finishing.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.469
And that can help a lot, too.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.889
But you wanted to go
beyond beans-- tofu,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.949
make tofu taste better?

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:48.469
I almost always, no matter how
firm the tofu is to begin with,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.920
I simmer it in water
before I do anything.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.110
I have a water first, oil
second, begin with water,

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.200
finish with oil manifesto.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.420
If I could summarize
in general cooking,

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.170
for example to
blanch vegetables,

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.250
it's a wonderful
way to handle what

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.469
I call the vegetable
volume challenge.

00:35:08.469 --> 00:35:10.010
You get home from
the farmer's market

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.850
or wherever you
bought your produce.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.000
And you're very well
meaning and bushy tailed,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.470
and you want to get five
a day or, actually, it's

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.270
more like 9 to 11 a day
now of vegetable servings.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.680
If you're serving
a family of four

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.540
and you only can get to the
grocery store or the produce

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.260
market once a week,
you have to come home

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.950
with 120 servings
worth of vegetables.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.970
And it's all well and
good, but they're huge.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.740
And they don't fit anywhere.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.850
They're going to go bad.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.380
So you get your
favorite big pot.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.690
By big, I'm favoring
wide over tall.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.000
Get some water simmering
and blanch everything.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.370
Give everything 10, 20,
30 seconds in the water.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.860
You don't even have to cut it.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.160
You could hold chard
or kale by the step

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.580
and just hold it
in, count to 10,

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.290
take it out, ring out
the water, let it cool.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.290
Blanching vegetables
ahead of time will,

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:08.770
once they're cool and
drained, their shelf space

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.030
will be cut by more than half.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.820
Their shelf life will
be more than doubled.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.320
So they will last
the week, and they

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.819
will take up a whole
lot less space.

00:36:16.819 --> 00:36:18.750
And the third wonderful
thing about doing this

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.020
is that you've now created
instant vegetables for later

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.895
in the week because their
shelf life has been so extended

00:36:24.895 --> 00:36:26.770
that all they need--
and here it comes again,

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:30.090
the olive oil-- just a quick
ride through some olive oil,

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.170
maybe with some garlic.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.640
And they're an instant
vegetable for dinner.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.350
So that's nice.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.930
With tofu, I like to also
blanch it 10 minutes.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.800
It firms up so beautifully.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.270
Then part two,
oil-- part two oil

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.660
with the vegetables, part
two oil with the tofu.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.010
Then you can fry
it up more crisply.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:53.120
Don't be afraid of high
heat, depending on your oil.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.850
Spectrum Organics-- I believe
it's spectrumorganics.com--

00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:01.582
is a website that charts
the different smoke

00:37:01.582 --> 00:37:03.290
points of different
oils and how high you

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.850
can take them temperature-wise
with keeping them stable.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.110
So it's a good frying
guide, because if frying

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:14.960
is done with the right oil
and the right temperature,

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.350
it can be very clean, and it
doesn't end up being greasy.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.860
So tofu that has
been simmered first

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.610
or tempeh, which is an
inoculated soy product,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.750
fermented, then they
go into the hot oil,

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.000
and you get them really crisp.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.125
And then you have the whole
texture thing going on.

00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:34.310
And then that should
do it for you, I hope.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.560
But using oil in the right
way makes a huge difference

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.903
and using heat in the right way.

00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:38.444
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:42.020
I have a question regarding
your favorite olive oil.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.680
There's been conflicting
information around it.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.640
And the title of your book
has the word heart in it.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.500
One of the heart
experts, Dr. Esselstyn,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.880
he's been advocate
of not using oils.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.690
So I was wondering if you
have any insights around that,

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.295
especially given your pipeline
into Harvard Nutrition?

00:38:03.295 --> 00:38:05.170
MOLLIE KATZEN: You mean
about a low oil diet?

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.110
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.040
In fact, there are people
who say no oil diet.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.050
But olive oil, a
lot of that, do you

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:18.037
have any insights as to whether
there is good research about--?

00:38:18.037 --> 00:38:19.620
MOLLIE KATZEN: I
have to qualify first

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.810
by saying I am not a
nutrition researcher nor am

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:28.960
I a dietitian, so I just pilfer
information from those who are.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.400
It's my understanding that
oil is very heart healthy,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.560
that olive oil, that you
should go out of your way

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.590
to include it in your diet
because it is, in fact, a heart

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.990
protector.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.640
And nuts also-- not even just
nut oils but nuts, avocados,

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.030
those kinds of oils are
very, very healthful.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.790
And I believe-- and I
will check with him--

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.270
but I am pretty sure that Dr.
Walter Willett of the Harvard

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.728
School of Public Health, who
is the head of their nutrition

00:38:56.728 --> 00:39:01.040
department, is up to a
good probably 30% or more

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.630
of the calories per
day that he would

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.840
like you to get from
olive oil alone.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.340
The model is called
The Mediterranean Diet,

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.170
and it also includes fatty fish.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.830
It also includes one or two
drinks a day of alcohol.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.290
So for people who like
alcohol, that's a nice thing.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.760
So for the people I know
and the people who school me

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.580
in these things, I
would say that I'm

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:30.100
very pro healthy oil
but anti unhealthy oil.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.770
But it's a question of
the quality of the oil.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.350
It's not all fat is bad,
but look for the good oils.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.080
In fact, it really
makes no sense

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.800
according to these researchers--
and I am totally convinced

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.020
by them-- to, when you
see those labels on food

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.790
and they tell you
calories from oil,

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:53.490
percentage oil, grams
of fat-- meaningless.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.780
What does that say?

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.220
What do you take home from that?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.400
It's all about quantities of
fat, which don't mean anything.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.440
It's not a different
kind of calorie.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.650
It's not necessarily
bad or good.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.380
You have to look
further and see what

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.100
is the actual source of fat.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.490
But it is my understanding
that a good oil

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.550
is a very healthful thing.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.390
The expression, the phrase,
essential fatty acids,

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.020
the word essential is literal.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.970
Those are fatty acids
that your body needs,

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:24.977
that your body
cannot manufacture.

00:40:24.977 --> 00:40:26.060
So you need to take it in.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.720
You need to ingest it.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.650
AUDIENCE: Quick question
on pots and pans

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.700
that are used in
cooking-- is there

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.930
a difference between, say,
cooking in a non-stick pot

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.920
or pan versus an iron
skillet, because I've

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.410
been led to believe
that they do make

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.290
a difference in the
flavor of the food?

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.360
MOLLIE KATZEN: What's
your experience?

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.080
What kind of difference
do they make?

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.090
AUDIENCE: Well I just wondered.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:47.839
I don't cook much.

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:48.900
I just hear about it.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.754
And I'm planning to
buy some pots and pans,

00:40:50.754 --> 00:40:52.545
so I thought your
feedback would be useful.

00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:55.330
MOLLIE KATZEN: Yeah, I do have
an opinion on it, just the way

00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:00.010
I feel about cooking and the
way a pot or pan feels to me.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.250
I want it to be as
heavy as possible,

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.370
and I go for horizontal
cooking as much as I can.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.037
It's interesting.

00:41:07.037 --> 00:41:09.370
I could give a whole other
talk about how my cooking has

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.250
changed, and one of the ways
is the shape of my cooking used

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.410
to be more vertical, and
now it's more horizontal--

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:20.210
horizontal meaning that
every tidbit in the pan

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.460
gets its own place in
the sun, so to speak.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.570
Contact with the surface,
with the heating surface,

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.310
is in itself a way of
flavor being imparted

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:33.324
because that cooking
surface, depending

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.740
on its proximity to the heat
and the intensity of the heat

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:40.580
and the kind of oil,
is itself a seasoning.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.487
At that point, that's
the point where

00:41:42.487 --> 00:41:43.820
you can actually hear the sound.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.500
When you the sizzle of a
tidbit going into the pan,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.600
you hearing the
imparting of flavor.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.470
It's a beautiful thing.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.420
I don't like non-stick
pans because I'm

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.750
suspicious of the materials
used in the coating, which

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.750
can leach into the food.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.291
And they're chemical,
and they're not

00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:00.250
necessarily healthful.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.340
They can, in fact,
be unhealthful.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.755
This isn't completely-- I was
going to say it's not ironclad.

00:42:05.755 --> 00:42:06.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.170
MOLLIE KATZEN: But it is
pretty much the rule of thumb

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.050
is I would avoid coatings.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.980
So I like heavy.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.652
I love cast iron, and it's
also the least expensive.

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:17.110
And for me, it's
the most nostalgia

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.910
inducing because the
first cookware I ever

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.050
had was cast iron.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.450
And it's a very honest cookware.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:28.256
And I like the fact you can
heat it really well and slowly.

00:42:28.256 --> 00:42:29.630
I'd much rather
have a pan that's

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.110
been heated on a medium-low
flame for a longer

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:36.390
period of time than flashing
something with a sudden burst.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.400
So I would go with
something-- anodized

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.750
steel is a really nice,
heavy kind of cookware which

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.330
I like a lot and
then the cast iron.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.410
But avoid anything
that's very lightweight--

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:53.590
literally lightweight--
and that is coated.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.470
One way you can have a non-stick
situation without it being

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.490
officially non-stick
is if you're

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.700
patient with the
heating of the pan

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.150
and make sure it gets very,
very hot and then add your oil.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.820
And then make sure the
oil itself gets very hot

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.560
so that when the food finally
goes in, you hear the sizzle.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.030
Again, hearing the
sizzle tells you

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.650
that it's probably
not going to stick.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.800
And then you have
a metal spatula

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.730
with which you scrape
the food as it cooks.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:24.040
And you shake it, keep it
going, to keep it from sticking.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.650
You're the non-stick factor.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.870
Your cooking habit becomes
the non-stick factor.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:32.430
My recipes used to say, oh,
just cook the vegetable.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.074
It didn't even
say, heat the pan.

00:43:34.074 --> 00:43:35.490
I don't even
remember what I said.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.210
But now I very
specifically almost always

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:42.860
have one clear instruction
first, pan on heat.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.700
Wait.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.000
Oil goes in.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.010
Wait.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.290
Swirl to coat.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.790
Wait.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.250
There's a lot of waiting.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.820
It's like a time
signature in music.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.204
There's a little rest.

00:43:56.204 --> 00:43:57.620
And then the food
goes in, and you

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.840
hear the sound of it being
infused with flavor and with it

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.665
becoming something that's
not going to stick.

00:44:04.665 --> 00:44:05.267
Did that help?

00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:06.600
AUDIENCE: Absolutely, thank you.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.310
MOLLIE KATZEN: Thank you.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.960
AUDIENCE: So you call it
"Recipes for a New Generation",

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.840
and I thinking of
my son who used

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.010
to read "Pretend Soup" at
night in bed, picking out

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.177
the recipe he wanted to cook
in the morning and who asked,

00:44:17.177 --> 00:44:19.510
as soon as he saw that you
had a new cookbook out, said,

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.330
this is the book I want,
"The Heart of the Plate,"

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.200
in my new apartment.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.840
This is my cookbook
to cook from.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.350
So he grew up thinking
of you as a model,

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.630
which I think is wonderful.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.520
And you say this is
your last cookbook.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.086
So what about your last
children's cookbook?

00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:34.710
Are you doing more
children's cookbook?

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.910
MOLLIE KATZEN: That's
really possible.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.284
See, I have no
credibility when I

00:44:37.284 --> 00:44:41.980
say-- "Pretend Soup"
and "Salad People"

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.840
are the two cookbook I
wrote for preschoolers.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.710
There's a reading
readiness embedded,

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.640
early, early, early
reading, recognition

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.430
of numerals and certain letters.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.780
It was very hard to find
things that preschoolers could

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.102
or would do because just
their little arms and things.

00:45:01.102 --> 00:45:03.060
For example, everyone
thinks, oh, preschoolers,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.450
we'll make cookies.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.650
Nuh-uh, because they
can't stir cookie dough,

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.080
and you don't want to
be doing it for them.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.140
And then I wrote one
later, "Honest Pretzels,"

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.020
for older kids, which was
difficult because the level

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.154
as is so all over the
map, that some kids have

00:45:17.154 --> 00:45:18.320
a lot of experience cooking.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.880
Some don't.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.360
I think there's a lot
more to do with kids,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.880
and there's certainly a need.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.999
And I love hanging out with
kids, so there's a good chance.

00:45:28.999 --> 00:45:30.540
Was that the whole
question, darling?

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.990
Because she's my friend.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.810
That was it?

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
another one.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.402
MOLLIE KATZEN: Shall we talk?

00:45:36.402 --> 00:45:39.760
Because I love cooking-- kids
are just so fresh and so honest

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.340
about food.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.060
And one of the things that's
been so wonderful about cooking

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.240
with children is they're so not
what you expect in the kitchen.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.720
I know I'm speaking in a
very broad generalization.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.340
But the idea that they're being
invited in to what is normally

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.230
considered an adult realm,
they are so honored.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.295
And we expect them to
want to make a mess.

00:45:58.295 --> 00:46:00.170
And what I've found is
when they make a mess,

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.707
they get very upset and want
to clean it up right away.

00:46:02.707 --> 00:46:04.290
And they really want
to make something

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:05.780
that they can feed you.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.140
And it's a wonderful
way to elevate

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.790
a child's feeling
of being effective.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.450
So, OK, I'll do it.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.767
Yay, it'll be fun.

00:46:15.767 --> 00:46:17.850
I thought of something I
didn't say earlier that's

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.890
an important point for
me, when you asked me

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.010
about the materials,
about the pans.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.710
One of the things that
is important for people

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.920
who are new to cooking
a lot of vegetables,

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.550
really cooking vegetables-- I
grew up with frozen vegetables.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:35.925
In my mom's house,
it was frozen.

00:46:35.925 --> 00:46:37.650
And I actually loved them.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.080
And my first vegetable
dish that I ever cooked

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.242
was opening up a package.

00:46:42.242 --> 00:46:43.200
And it was green beans.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.000
And most of the
instructions when

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.430
I was trying to
write my early recipe

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.029
had a lot to do with
opening the package.

00:46:50.029 --> 00:46:51.570
First you go to one
end and you open.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.220
You tear it.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.386
And then if it doesn't open,
you take a little knife

00:46:54.386 --> 00:46:55.510
and cut it open.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:58.000
But it was all about getting
it out of the package.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.150
And then you add water
and put it on heat.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.950
And then when the corners fall
off and it's no longer square,

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:04.834
serve.

00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:05.750
That was my early one.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.317
But now it's about the knife.

00:47:07.317 --> 00:47:09.400
Now it's about, you get
the fresh vegetables home.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.780
And for a lot of
people, I believe

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.880
the barrier to cooking
more vegetables

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.977
is a little bit of uneasiness
about the knife, which

00:47:18.977 --> 00:47:20.060
is a very essential thing.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.970
I call it the knife block.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:27.710
And again, we talk about
the line in the sand,

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.300
before and after.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.940
There is before you
bond with your knife.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.320
And then there is
post-bonding with your knife.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.620
It's a whole different world.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.390
When you find the
knife of your dreams,

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.000
it's like finding
a relationship.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.500
And there's no one knife
that's right for everyone.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.690
But there is a knife
that's right for you.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:50.190
And it feels good in your hand,
and it's got a straight blade.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:54.600
It can be a 6, 8, 10-inch
blade, but it feels good to you.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.490
And you keep it very,
very, very sharp.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:59.250
You have it professionally
sharpened once or twice a year.

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:02.000
And it is so exciting
to try to cut something

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.370
with a sharp knife
for the first time.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.550
It heads toward an
onion or an apple,

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.630
and with almost no pressure
from you, it grabs in.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.310
It's a clean slice.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.300
I'm so into sound
effects, so you

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.470
can hear this little whoosh.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:21.400
And lo and behold, you
have a clean, perfect slice

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.260
of onion or apple, and
you then have religion.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.360
And then you've crossed over,
in a good way, to the good side.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.240
And that's when you not only
are willing to cut onions.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.470
You'll cut onions
for all your friends,

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.100
and you will look
for things to cut.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.690
When you fall in love
with slicing stuff,

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.024
everything changes.

00:48:42.024 --> 00:48:43.440
And I just had my
knife sharpened,

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.520
so I'm in a really
good mood about this.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.010
It just brightens your life.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:48.782
You go for the small things.

00:48:48.782 --> 00:48:50.240
Enjoy that because
that will really

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.281
change your cooking life.

00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:52.720
I guarantee it.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.440
AUDIENCE: So always
this time of year,

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.900
when there's just that
first chill in the air,

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.440
I make that lentil soup of
"The Moosewood Cookbook."

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.940
And it warms my heart.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:07.130
But from your descriptions, it
sounds like you're constantly

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.170
jumping from recipe
to recipe, or you're

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.610
making a lot of different
things, trying out new things.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.550
How do you balance between
making something new

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.067
and going back to old favorites?

00:49:18.067 --> 00:49:19.900
MOLLIE KATZEN: That is
such a good question.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.066
I'm wondering why I've never
been asked that before.

00:49:22.066 --> 00:49:24.380
You're original.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.180
I test a lot of new
recipes, obviously,

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.900
when I'm working on a cookbook.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.690
I'm not always
working on a cookbook.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:38.420
And in between
cookbook projects--

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.300
which take several years
because those recipes, these,

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.840
I've tested three,
four, or five times

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.650
and actually lose sleep over the
ones I think aren't coming out.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.600
I really care.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.350
I really care.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.710
When I take off my
making a cookbook hat

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.580
and I'm just an
ordinary citizen,

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.110
I am pretty much incapable
of following a recipe.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.290
I've tried, and it's hard.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.540
It's a rebellious thing.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.790
I don't know what it is.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.840
And I cook very much
by going to the market

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:14.880
and seeing what's there and what
just speaks to me on that day.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.725
That said, I do have
a few favorites.

00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:22.020
I can't really follow
even my own recipes,

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.800
but that lentil soup is one that
when I have nothing else going

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.210
on, I just automatically
will put lentils on the stove

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:30.100
and start making that.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.350
I cook really simply.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:36.500
And it's like being on vacation
to not write things down,

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.080
because a cookbook is
a technical manual.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.790
It really has to work.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.630
And also, in writing
one, you don't really

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.840
know exactly whom
you're writing it for.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.590
What's your habit?

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.450
What's you're habit?

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.110
What do you need me to tell you?

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.230
How comfortable are you filling
in the blanks on your own?

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.920
What does your
kitchen look like?

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.240
What is your attention span?

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.650
What are your taste buds?

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.561
I'm guessing.

00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:59.060
Not to complain,
but it's really fun

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.393
when I'm not having to do
that and when I'm just cooking

00:51:01.393 --> 00:51:02.477
and I don't write it down.

00:51:02.477 --> 00:51:04.268
On the other hand, if
I don't write it down

00:51:04.268 --> 00:51:05.920
and then I really
liked what I made,

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.900
I can't remember what I did.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.610
But I pretty much don't cook the
same thing more than once ever

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.240
in real life.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.320
I hope that was not
too disappointing,

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.948
because it's really true.

00:51:17.948 --> 00:51:20.210
DIANA: OK, thank
you so much, Mollie.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.030
That was awesome.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.493
MOLLIE KATZEN: Thanks, Diana.

00:51:21.493 --> 00:51:22.419
Thanks for having me.

00:51:22.419 --> 00:51:23.345
Thank you so much.

00:51:23.345 --> 00:51:25.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.250
MOLLIE KATZEN: So if you'd like
to get your book autographed--
