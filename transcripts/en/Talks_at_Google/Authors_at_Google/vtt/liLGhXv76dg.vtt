00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.050
TREBOR SCHOLZ: So in
the next 40 minutes,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.250
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about an emerging business

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.510
model that I've been working
on for the last three years

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.050
together with literally
hundreds of other people

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.760
around the world.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.480
But before I go
there, I want to start

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.020
by sort of setting
up a bit of a context

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.311
for this work, which really
goes back to the last 40 years,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:32.810
right?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.190
So when we look at the
last 40 years there,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.940
we've seen a steady
increase of the productivity

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.170
of the American worker,
which really rose by 73%,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.120
while hourly pay stagnated
over the same time.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.450
So it's around an increase
of 11% over the same time

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.450
which adjusted for inflation
really amounts to stagnation,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.190
right?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.510
And as you are well
aware, of course,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.360
there is also a steep
increase in income inequality.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.640
So 62 individuals owned the same
wealth as 3.5 billion people

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.570
in last year.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.124
So I'm sure you were aware
of these kinds of statistics.

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:18.790
So you have an increase
in productivity,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.920
a stagnation in wages.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.270
And the project of
political democracy

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.460
has really propagated in the
last decades in many countries,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.960
while workplace democracy has
really been left behind, right?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.190
So there's a real
tension between the two.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.520
You could also argue
that the web has really

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.940
hit rock bottom,
at least when you

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.670
look at the original
intentions of the founders

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.150
of the internet, and also Tim
Berners-Lee, who hadn't really

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.760
intended for this
kind of concentration

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640
that we are seeing today.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.440
And at the same time also,
over these last 40 years,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.320
there's a much of a
real like nationalism

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.150
as we see it play
out right now very

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.140
clearly, in isolationism,
nationalism, and also

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.900
isolationism, right?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.330
In the United States through
the next last election,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.520
we saw also cultural
schisms really

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.830
playing out significantly.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.850
But this is not
only happening here,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.770
also, you know, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, so all

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.030
over Europe as well.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.650
So again, over this
time period as well,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.940
we had over these last
42 years a shift away

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.380
from direct employment.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.280
So fewer and fewer people are
protected by the Fair Labor

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.720
Standards Act.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.980
So by 2020, the projection
goes that 40% of Americans

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.660
will be freelance.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.490
And so today already, you
have 55 million Americans

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.140
being freelancers,
so that there's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.770
one in three Americans being
a freelancer already now,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.820
which, you know, I'm not
exactly bemoaning employment,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.390
per se, right?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.520
I mean, OK, not that
everybody works for Google.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.650
But you know, people in
other sets of employment

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.230
will not be as enthusiastic
about employment.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.690
But there's one
thing that I would

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.130
insist is really a big loss,
which is rights, the worker

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.980
rights that came under the Fair
Labor Standard Act of 1938,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.420
unemployment benefits, you
know, the eight hour work

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.510
day, workers comp,
all of which are

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.810
gone in this new setting
in this freelance economy.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.570
And I think there's a broad
recognition that this really

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.580
is not sustainable.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.970
Now, sort of switching to the
on-demand economy, sharing

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.860
economy, collaborative
economy, whatever

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.710
you want to call it
depending, you know,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.390
if you're European
or American, you

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.000
could place the
beginning of that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.020
maybe around 2005 with
Amazon Mechanical Turk,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.930
2008 the financial
crisis on the heels

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.030
of which people were much more
likely to take low paying jobs.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.260
And on the other
hand, and I think

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.420
there's I'm sure a broad
agreement of the people

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.329
in the room here, there's
a real significant consumer

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.960
convenience that comes with
this sharing economy, the likes

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.110
of Uber and Airbnb, right?

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.170
So there's a real
consumer convenience

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.800
that is appreciated.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.630
There is access to work.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.740
I mean, gigs, right?

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.660
Not employment, but gigs.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.890
That has increased for people
who are in between jobs

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.550
and students, for example.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.300
So I would very much
recommend my students

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.330
to work in that economy.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.060
Because with TaskRabbit
or other companies,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.670
the amount of money
you make are probably

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.250
more than they would
make otherwise.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.570
So there are opportunities also
for the upper middle class.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.900
So if you own a five bedroom
apartment on the Upper East

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.620
Side, it's like a really
fantastic opportunity

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.400
to rent that out when you spend
your weekends in the Hamptons,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.430
right?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.740
So you can make thousands
of dollars with that.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.970
Of course, a bit different
if you live in a project

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.730
or are African-American.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.590
As this Harvard
study showed, right--

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.730
a clear difference between
an African-American man

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.424
trying to rent out
and a white woman.

00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:31.590
So there are all these sort
of racial aspects coming

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.820
into this economy as well.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.300
And then this is
not necessarily.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300
I mean, people always say
like, well, you know--

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.174
I was just at a conference
and somebody says,

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.530
like, well, Uber and the
whole sharing economy,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.779
how much of the GDP is that?

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.320
That doesn't really
matter to anyone.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.440
It's like so, so small, right?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.930
But what happens is with
many statistics, especially

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.110
government statistics,
they really

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.540
don't catch those people
working in that economy.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.600
Because they only look
at employment or they

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.300
look only at the large amount
of income that people generate.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.160
Only that is counted as a job.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.190
And the rest falls to the
side and is not recorded.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.810
But if you do look at
people working on platforms

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.300
and you do account also for
smaller amounts of income,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.840
then like this Pew
survey here, you

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.970
will learn that
24% of Americans,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.840
in fact, are or worked
on platforms in 2016.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.340
So it's not a niche.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.140
So I worked about this
for the last 10 years

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.580
and worked in digital
labor for a long time

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.820
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.370
So the book that
you're seeing here

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.890
is sort of a mapping of
the digital labor landscape

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.490
and its many opportunities
and problems,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.100
ending with a proposal of what
I call platform cooperativism.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.419
And I congratulate Rachel that
she was able to pronounce that.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.960
And then there's a
second book, which

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.370
we don't have here, which is
"Ours to Hack and to Own,"

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.380
which is really a collection
of some 40 authors responding

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.080
to this idea of
platform cooperativism.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.900
And I will explain what
that is in a minute.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.160
We also learned today that
Travis Kalanick stepped back

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.680
as CEO of Uber.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.190
And this came on the
heels of, you know,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.100
the Delete Uber campaign
if you remember this,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.800
like when they joined the
economic board of the Trump

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.150
Administration.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.570
200,000 people deleted
their accounts,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.210
which shocked them
enough to withdraw

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.010
from this economic board.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.320
And then, of course, the
very, very influential

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.610
and consequential blog post by
Susan Fowler, the former Uber

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.780
engineer, who revealed
the misogynistic work

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.740
culture at Uber.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.900
And then there are other
movements and incidents

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.110
which would be demonstrated
by this #airbnbwhileblack

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.950
and others.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:07.020
There were also demonstrations
of hundred thousands of drivers

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.500
in India, Uber and Ola drivers.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.170
So there is a clear pushback
against this economy, right,

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.580
which you can see.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.590
So I would suggest, and I'm
not alone with that opinion,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.580
that we are really looking at
a market failure of the sharing

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.450
economy.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:31.410
And that is based on
the privacy intrusions

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.049
that we saw with the likes
of these taxi of companies

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.250
that we discussed, but
also with the concentration

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:45.300
of data which is really
weakening competition, right?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.640
And you see also technology
companies allowing

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.590
the exploitation of workers--

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.110
so that is also
well-documented and, by now,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.130
quite uncontroversial--

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.670
and attacks on
public infrastructure

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.850
and many other reasons that
we can discuss as well.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.830
And there's always
this discussion

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.070
in Silicon Valley of,
you know, framing all

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.260
of this as innovation, right?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.040
And I think what we really
need is to really think

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.680
about whose problems
are actually solved

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.260
by this innovation, right?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.720
Are these the problems
of middle class people?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.540
Or are these real problems
of people in need?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.970
But are these the
most burning problems

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.700
that this innovation solves?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.340
Or whose problems are addressed?

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.370
So here you can see the
Barcelona City Council

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.590
in the background
in this photo that

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.570
really looks at
social value creation

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.010
and insists that basically
citizens and the needs

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.050
of citizens are
addressed through

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.760
technological developments that
are implemented in Barcelona.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.490
So then there is the
obfuscation of language.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.550
So you have this
wonderful mobilization

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.580
of the language of
love, of sharing,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.160
all these like wonderful
sort of '70s discourses

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.460
that are mobilized to
sell commercial platforms.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.815
And so, you know,
like Eva Illouz,

00:10:11.815 --> 00:10:18.370
the Israeli sociologist, talks
about the language of intimacy

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.380
even being brought
into this discourse,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.600
right, so that you
feel when you listen

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.770
to the discourses of
Airbnb or even Uber,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.890
it sounds almost as if you
talk to a lover at night

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.040
on the pillow.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.385
So it's this kind of
counterculture, obviously,

00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:36.760
that is mobilized, right, the
language of counterculture.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.970
So they really try
to sell themselves.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.680
At the top of this
image, you can

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.220
see the sort of
counter-revolution,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.590
counter-cultural forces,
where in fact, you know,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.670
they're really not-- so
the California ideology.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.410
And at the same time,
still sort of trying

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.870
to frame this sort of
40-year long development,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.660
right, you also have a
technological displacement

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.470
of labor.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.880
So with the development
really where you can already

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.200
foresee that a tiny group
of owners will be in charge

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.950
and will be the owners of
artificial intelligence,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.720
how will this escalate
all of these developments?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.670
So there is a lot of talk about
suddenly in Europe and now

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.470
also increasingly
in the United States

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.320
about universal
basic income, right,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.660
and the post-work society.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.600
Paul Mason wrote a book
about post-capitalism.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.980
And you know, it's wonderful.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.420
I would love to
live in a society

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.170
where my life opportunities
are dealing from wages.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.120
That would be super awesome.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.480
But this is also, certainly, in
this country a very long time

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.410
away, right?

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.910
It's very far off.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.540
And I think what many of
these activist groups,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.720
like Occupy Wall
Street in fact, were

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.610
lacking where they presented
critiques and perhaps even

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.690
a long-term vision.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.280
But what they didn't offer
were near-term alternatives, so

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.600
things that you can do
when you leave this room

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.950
and you can do next
Thursday, right,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.850
so direct projects
to engage with.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.380
So my proposal is basically
with this platform cooperativism

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.740
is to work towards a diversified
digital economy in which you

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.380
don't have only four
or five players,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.770
but also many small
businesses and one

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.700
that is not looking only for
solutions and technology.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.520
So not having to solve
everything, click here,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.650
philosophy or ideology, but
to really look broadly also

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.160
at the communities and what
they really need locally.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.320
So platform cooperativism
is not a silver bullet.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.030
It's not the solution
to everything.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.640
But you can see it clearly in
tandem with other movements,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.485
like the B-Corps
movement, credit unions,

00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:05.480
the pro-commons movement,
the creative commons,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.800
solitary economy,
community currencies,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.270
and many other projects.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.180
So it's really not a
multiculturalism, right?

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.850
So it's not about unicorns,
but really about zebras.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.962
Because they, in fact, exist.

00:13:17.962 --> 00:13:20.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.410
So it's also, you know, looking
at this historic moment,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.834
there's a great opportunity
recognized by many people that

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:34.000
comes with the retirement
of the baby boomers, which

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.710
just means that a
lot of businesses

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.390
are changing hands, right?

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.330
So many of them are bought
by Goldman Sachs already.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.890
But others are not, right?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.450
And so here's an
opportunity to basically

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.010
rethink worker ownership and
to think about what it would

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.580
be like and also give workers
this awareness that they could,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.680
in fact, be owning
the businesses

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.710
they are running also
in the digital economy.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.665
I don't know if you're
familiar with these guys here,

00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:02.990
the Rochdale Equitable
Pioneer's Society.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.620
So this was the first
consumer cooperative

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.740
in Rochdale in England.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.420
Interestingly, geographically
and also in terms of the time--

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.940
quite close to the
foundation of unions as well,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.630
who came out of guilds
in the same region

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.800
around the same time.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.070
So you had the first
cooperatives emerging really

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.230
as a response to a
precarity, right?

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.340
So they were starving.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.890
So they said, well, let's
buy oatmeal, and milk,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.480
and butter together, right?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.900
And it will be cheaper.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.080
And this became a
very successful model.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.300
So if I would talk
with you individually,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.744
you know, if you would
go to the cafeteria,

00:14:42.744 --> 00:14:44.410
I'm sure like most
of you would tell me,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.460
well, but cooperatives?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.210
You know, come on.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.540
We've seen this before
clearly not working, right?

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.490
It's an old-fashioned model.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.410
And I've heard this
very many times.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.210
But in fact, just
like this frog,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.740
right, it's hiding
in plain sight.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.750
Cooperatives are really
hiding in plain sight.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:07.890
So from the Barcelona Futbal
Club to Ace Hardware, REI, s

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.180
Associated Press, these are
all cooperatives that are,

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.580
you know, enormously
financially viable.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.250
And like you can see here, one
in three Americans, in fact,

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.720
is a co-op member.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.580
I mean, I'm certainly
in many co-ops.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.100
How many of you are co-op
members of some kind?

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.750
A-ha, so some of you, fantastic.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.100
$500 billion in total
annual your revenue,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.560
nearly 1 million jobs,
$5 billion in wages--

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.560
so it's definitely
not a failing model.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.510
I mean, this is
something that's clear.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.930
It's not taking over the
entire economy, clearly.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.580
But it's also not going away.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.200
And it's also not
a failing model.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.533
I mean, I think this is quite
clear if you look at this.

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:49.310
Mondragon, the largest
worker cooperative

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.150
in the world in Spain,
has 74,000 members

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.250
and is a major economic
force in that country.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.690
So what I'm proposing-- and I
have sort of worked my way up

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.880
to this, so now we
are sort of there--

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.670
is what I call-- and this
is hard to pronounce.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.920
You can try this
three times fast--

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.530
platform cooperativism,
so the idea

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.270
to bring the
cooperative business

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.400
model to the digital economy.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.480
In short, what would it
be like if the drivers

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.670
would own something like Uber?

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.190
What if residents would
own something like Airbnb?

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.490
And as it turns out, I wrote
a text about that in 2014

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.470
which kind of became viral.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.360
And then I suddenly
realized like, oh my god,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.880
what I was writing
about actually exists.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.700
So there are many companies
like that out there.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.980
So we created a large
conference in 2015.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.650
Very many people attended that.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.640
And out of it really became
an international movement

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.020
around this model.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.830
So it's based on co-ownership
of the platforms,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.910
so a co-operative ownership
of the platforms and the data,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.680
and democratic governance.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.520
So in the co-op tradition,
one worker, one vote, right,

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.461
this is how decisions
are made about what

00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:07.460
happens on the platform.

00:17:09.922 --> 00:17:11.880
And immediately, somebody
would say like, well,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.839
how does this compare to Google?

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:18.990
Or how does this compare
to the unicorn model?

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:24.470
And well, there are, of course,
many disadvantages, but also

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.145
many advantages.

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:32.810
So advantages include that
they have larger resilience.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.710
So there's research that shows
that cooperatives have a lower

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.810
failure rate after five years.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:44.696
80% versus 41% of co-ops
will then still be around.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:47.870
You know, it keeps
money in the community.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.120
You have access
to member capital

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.980
when you're starting
as a startup.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.970
There's ownership and
control of the people who are

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.950
involved in the cooperative.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.940
This could be more
multi-stakeholder,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.960
so in the sense of
users of a platform

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.960
owning the platform as
well, or really just

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.140
the people who are making a
living through that platform.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.660
There are tax benefits.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.020
There's a potential of a
cooperative data commons.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.470
And I will talk about this
with an example afterwards.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.240
And just sort of to
give you an idea,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.860
many of these platform
co-ops take 5%

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.630
to operate the platform
compared to 25% to 50%

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.690
with the unicorn model, with
the investor-owned model.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.650
so a clear difference.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.750
Also, productivity benefits are
demonstrated with cooperatives.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.720
So the transition, you know,
happens in various ways.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.990
We see this, so
basically cooperatives

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.710
turning into platform
co-ops, unions joining co-ops

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.010
to form platform co-ops.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.900
There are startups
that are transforming.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.450
There are failed startups
that are turning over.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.060
You know, like a Deliveroo-type
project in Belgium,

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.000
for example, turned
into a cooperative,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.890
was just taken over
by the couriers when

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.930
the startup failed.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.110
And then, of course, we see
mounting anti-trust efforts,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.440
you know, against
many companies.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.170
And the hope is that when
this happens, basically,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.890
one of the split companies
could become a cooperatives.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.280
So there are opportunities
to reinvent themselves,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.420
but opportunities for
reinventions for co-ops,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.970
for worker-owner, for
the worker ownership

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.420
model, for free
software developers,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.730
and also for unions.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.480
So the question
also becomes, how

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.250
can people make a decent living?

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.560
So everybody committed
to the commons,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.300
how can they also make a living?

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.980
So there's a long tradition
and a strong movement

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.390
behind, you know,
Wikipedia and, of course,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.990
open source, et cetera.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.710
But what has often
been forgotten

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.240
is basically that
people also need

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.710
to be able to make a living.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.500
And there are examples
of, for example,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.170
free software cooperatives,
but there are very few.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.520
So often, the assumption
is that these sort

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.280
of well-situated middle
class individuals who

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.280
contribute to the commons,
have the time to do so

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.780
and the resources.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.790
And the question
becomes, now how can you

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.090
find business models that
contribute to the commons,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.060
but also provide
people with a living?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.560
OK.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.320
So in which sectors
is this playing out?

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.010
It's all over the
landscape, right?

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.110
So it's vastly distributed.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.730
It's not just one area.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.290
It's everything from childcare
to software development.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.600
There are cooperative
online marketplaces,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.350
as you will see in a
second, health data

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.250
cooperatives, translation,
credit unions, crowdfunding,

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.290
journalism.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.956
I will give you a few examples.

00:20:50.956 --> 00:20:53.950
So on our site,
platform.coop, you

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.290
can see this sort
of, well, directory

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.610
where you can click in.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.175
And you can actually see
the individual co-ops

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.300
and where they are located.

00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:04.420
Yeah.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.610
So I mean, afterwards, we
can go into more examples.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.120
It's a patchwork of all these
different companies that

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.000
are in existence right now.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.910
I just want to sort of
highlight a few, three or four--

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.210
Stocksy, for example.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.410
So it's a really fascinating
and really wonderful

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:30.340
company started by the founders
of iPhoto who basically

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.160
were then bought
out by Getty Images

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.170
and started their own stock
photography site in Canada

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.350
based on the idea,
basically, of pushing back

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.530
against the sort of very cliched
stock photography, right?

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.050
The white man in the suits
in these sort of boardrooms,

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.720
you know, that's really not what
work looks like for most people

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.710
anymore, right?

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.540
So they wanted to
create a different kind

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.866
of stock photography.

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.240
But they also
wanted to make sure

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.820
that the photographers that
are contributing to the site

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.980
can make a living, right?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.320
So it's not about the
race to the bottom,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.850
but it's actually
about commitment

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.310
to a smaller group
of photographers.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:16.360
So they made $10.7 million last
year, $300,000 in dividends

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.570
and supported 960 photographers.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.510
So 960 photographers
contributed to this cooperative

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.270
in 63 countries.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:30.890
And they served 124 of
the Fortune 500 companies.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.720
And so it's a great product.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.360
But at the same
time, it's operated

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.400
in a way that is very
different to invest

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.800
their own companies in that they
really invest in the workers,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.580
if you like, in
the photographers.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.050
Because they say, here
are our 960 photographers

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.310
that we commit to.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.190
And so we need to make sure that
they deliver the product that

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.630
makes us successful.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.270
So that gives them the drive
to actually educate them.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.390
So they have these online
meetings, a continuing

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.030
education if you like, for
the online labor market

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.340
where they show them
what kind of product

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.060
they are looking for, so that
they can improve and deliver

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.210
more photography that
they can accept, right?

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.830
So this is one example.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.630
Here they are.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:20.110
Now, about a month
ago in May, Up &amp; Go

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.160
was founded here in New
York, which is basically

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.340
a platform for home
cleaning, so you should all

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:33.730
use it, which basically
connects people to cooperatives

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.970
in their neighborhoods.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.340
So you order a cleaning
service through this platform

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.950
and will always be connected to
a co-op in your neighborhood.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.540
And the difference is that
they basically charge 5%.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.160
So 95% of the profits go to
these low-income immigrant

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.140
women.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.350
And they're interesting.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.150
I mean, we could talk
about this for hours.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.910
But there are interesting
design differences

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.890
as well where, for example,
there are no individual worker

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.020
profit.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.720
And there's also no
reputation system.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.640
So what you will
find on the site when

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.710
you type in your
zip code, all you

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.540
get is a photo of
the cooperative.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.820
And somebody from this
co-op will service you,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.950
but you do not know who.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.670
And this was a long
discussion with those workers,

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.240
for example.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.365
And we can talk about that.

00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:28.390
It's an interesting difference.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.020
So this is what it looks
like, very simple interface.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.500
And here is one of cooperatives
that services the site.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.160
So if you want to do something
for low-income immigrants,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.010
use this site.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.380
This is then what you
get in the interface

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.200
when you decide
whom to work with.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.615
OK.

00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:51.390
And I'm going to go fairly
fast through a few more.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.550
Loconomics is a labor market
for freelance in San Francisco.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.080
SO anybody from
psychotherapists,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.530
to massage therapists,
tutors, and so on,

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.140
go through the site
to find clients.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.760
It's a labor brokerage and
run as a cooperative, right?

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.130
And interestingly, again,
like different to the venture

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:16.950
capital model, their
bylaws protect exit, right?

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.130
So a pivot a impossible, right?

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.390
So nobody could buy them out.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.750
They will always
be a co-op-owned.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:33.060
So Green Taxi in Denver has
800 members, Denver, Colorado,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.520
from 37 countries.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.330
Each of them contributed
$2,000 to, you know,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.970
basically start
launch the upstart.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:50.070
And they were helped by the
communication local 7777

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.970
to basically deal
with local regulation

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.550
to sway that in favor
of the cooperative,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:01.350
just like Uber has to
buy their regulation.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.840
Also, of course, cooperatives
have to do similar things.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.240
They captured one third of
the Denver market, right?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.520
So this is this model pronounced
Midata in Switzerland coming

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.200
out of ETH in Zurich that
basically looks at the fact

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.650
that there are so many
healths data that we have

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.480
today from 23andMe to Fitbits.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.780
And nobody really has
in central control.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.590
So there is no central ownership
of those data, partially

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.210
for, you know,
regulatory reasons.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.820
The government doesn't
allow Google, for example,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:39.570
to do that.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.000
There are many laws against it.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.880
But with cooperatives,
it could be different

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.750
where you basically say
that there are national data

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.900
co-ops for patients
that can then

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.540
decide to release these data
to their general practitioner

00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.990
to researchers or even
sell them to the industry.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.600
And the profits would never
go to the individuals,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.170
but go into public research
or civic-minded projects.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.150
This is how the
project is set up.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.550
It's already profitable
in Switzerland.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.030
It's now also starting
in Spain and in Germany.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.190
So this is the current model, so
a corporate central ownership.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.300
And their model is basically
a federated cooperative model,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.180
where because the laws
about healths data

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.400
are so different from
country to country,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.080
you could basically release
your data across borders

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.690
through the sort of federated
cooperative data commons.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:45.720
There is more conceptual
work underway with Fairbnb,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.524
where basically groups in--

00:27:49.524 --> 00:27:50.940
actually, now there
are two groups

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.950
with the same title, confusingly
enough, Fairbnb in Canada

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.930
and FairBnB in Amsterdam.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:03.030
And the Canadian model is
really about changing regulation

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.970
in terms of Airbnb.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.950
The Dutch model is
really about building

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.195
a platform that will
be resident owned

00:28:11.195 --> 00:28:15.044
and a cooperative ownership
that allows residents to say--

00:28:15.044 --> 00:28:16.960
and I don't know if
you're familiar with this.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.040
But you know, cities like
Barcelona and Amsterdam

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.320
are flooded with
tourists, which creates

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.320
very serious problems, really
way too many tourists, right?

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.280
So your local grocery suddenly
turns into a Nutella store

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.520
which locals don't
really want, right?

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.680
Or in Barcelona-- nothing
against Nutella, right?

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.200
Or in Barcelona you have,
like, a vegetable market

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.290
that is flooded with
tourists who don't really

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.264
buy vegetables.

00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:45.180
And the locals don't
want to go there anymore,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.326
because they can't
really shop there,

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.950
because there are so
many tourists-- so

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.340
like issues like that and
partly caused by Airbnb.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.650
And so basically
the idea in part

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.690
is also to put a limit
on how many people

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.880
can be in the city at one time.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.210
And that would be controlled
by citizens or in collaboration

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.890
with the city.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.194
And so it's an
interesting project.

00:29:07.194 --> 00:29:08.610
Then I don't know,
some of you may

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.300
have heard about that
my colleague Nathan

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.750
Schneider and the campaign
associated with that, tried

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.510
to come up with the $12
billion that it would take

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.610
to buy to Twitter,
which is up for sale

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.560
and turn it into a cooperative.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.450
And first, I thought, well,
this will never go anywhere.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.570
Hundreds of articles
around the world written

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.350
about this and the
shareholders voted on it

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:38.040
with 4% of shareholders
in favor of discussing it.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.920
It will be discussed again
at the next board meeting

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.910
next year, so a democratic
ownership of the internet also

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.320
being part of this discussion.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.980
So there are
journalism platforms,

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.950
like Positive News in the UK
that are cooperatively run.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.590
In the United States, you may
be familiar with Banyan news,

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.380
which really tries
to think about how

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.270
to push back against fake news.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.350
through cooperative
ownership and Resonate,

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:09.150
which just launched
after a very long time

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.900
basically in Berlin which is
a cooperatively owned music

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:18.120
streaming service trying to
create competition for Spotify.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.530
And if you look at the numbers,
it's quite interesting.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.480
So basically, it pays
musicians 200% more

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.690
on 100,000 plays than Spotify.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:33.120
It basically uses blockchain
to make a living for musicians

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.470
again.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.990
And it's a stream to own model.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.570
So the more often
you're streaming a song,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.500
the more you own it.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.790
So you basically put--

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.290
link it to your credit card.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:48.750
And with every play, it
deducts a few cents until you

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.480
own this song in total.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.490
And the platform
itself is owned,

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.050
as you can see at
the bottom here,

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.875
by artists, so the musicians
themselves, the listeners, so

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:00.990
a multi-stakeholder
model, and also

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.830
the employees of
the company, right?

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.250
So it's a mixed model like this.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.630
There are sanctuary
platforms that create--

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:14.220
like in Germany with its 1.5
million refugees, many of them

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.380
are actually IT professionals.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.570
And now they are in
some refugee camp.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.810
I don't want to call it camp.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.847
And they, you know, can't
work, because they can't leave.

00:31:26.847 --> 00:31:28.680
But if they would be
able through a platform

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.690
like that be able to
connect to Germans

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.730
who are looking
for IT work, this

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.230
would create basically
a market like that.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.170
Lastly, Fairmondo, an
online labor market

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:46.410
that overtly tries to
compete with eBay and Amazon,

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:51.390
so it's focused on fair
products or fairness

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:56.670
in all regards really, so fair
labor, selling the fair phone,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.176
and other fairly produce
products, et cetera.

00:32:00.176 --> 00:32:01.675
So they're really
into transparency,

00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:02.790
as you can see here.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.510
So, yeah, of course,
I should end this talk

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.850
by saying that there are,
of course, also quite

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:19.330
enormous challenges which have
of course to do with funding,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:24.760
unsurprisingly, and then issues
like the value proposition.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.520
So with something
like Stocksy, you

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.690
could see that they came
out of the corporate sector.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.460
And they really
understand what it

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.930
means to create a good product
that functions in the market.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.900
Other companies are really
so excited about starting

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.110
a cooperative that
they are not so focused

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.500
on the value proposition, and
then have problems with that.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.160
There's a question of education.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.576
I mean, I don't know if any
of you went to business school

00:32:50.576 --> 00:32:51.390
here.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.680
Anybody got an MBA?

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.400
I mean, they're not even taught
about the co-op model, right?

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.870
Certainly, in
universities they're

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.580
not taught about
it anymore either.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.850
And so people just
really don't know, right?

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.540
And yet, like I said,
hidden in plain sight,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.240
they are really all around
us, one in three Americans

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.050
being part of one.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.810
So it's definitely a model
that's all pervasive,

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.130
and yet sort of overlooked.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.099
And there's this problem
of decentralization.

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.390
Of course, the network effect--

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.900
I don't have to tell you that--

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.410
plays out in favor of
the existing platforms,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.190
scaling issues, et cetera.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:36.210
But you know, so the question
then comes basically,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:41.140
how can you create institutions
that support this new economy?

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.640
And so we started with
a platform.coop, which

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.450
is basically a hub where
people who want to start co-ops

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.610
like that from
all over the world

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:55.710
can have a starting point
where we are working

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.220
and hope to perhaps
interest you as well

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.120
to work with us on designing
an open source platform that

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.670
could be used around the globe.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.110
Because what
happens right now is

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.520
that people basically from
San Francisco to New York

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.677
to Argentina to India are all
starting the same project.

00:34:16.677 --> 00:34:18.510
They're all designing
these labor platforms.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:23.820
And of course, it's a huge waste
of effort and money, resources.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.030
So there could be an
open source kernel

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.760
that could be then
plucked and, with the help

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.120
of local programmers,
adapted to their local needs.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.696
We have an overview you
can see on the website

00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:37.320
where you can sort
of follow up on that

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.510
and get involved if you like.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.050
We set up a consortium, which
basically brought together

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.960
institutions that
are in support.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.780
So, you know, like
from the Berkman Center

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:53.429
to MIT and to Oxford Institute
for Internet and Society,

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.030
and then many cooperatives and
businesses as well and as well

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.440
as unions who are basically
all working to support this.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.310
And you can join
us on November 10

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.890
to 11 at the New
School here in New York

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.490
just a few blocks from here when
we have our next big gathering.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.040
We hope to get Bernie
Sanders to come--

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.400
and the people's
disruption platform

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.490
co-ops for global challenges.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.970
And this is where
I will leave it.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.268
Thank you very much.

00:35:25.268 --> 00:35:31.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.730
AUDIENCE: Any ideas on how
big companies like Google

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.120
could turn into a
co-op, number one,

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.120
if you thought about the
challenges of something

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.800
like that?

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.870
And number two,
in a co-op world,

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:47.020
how do you prevent the
capitalist, the VC basically,

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.540
from eating co-ops?

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.290
Not because they're
going to acquire them,

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.600
but because they're
going to starve them

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.065
by doing aggressive price
cutting and these kind

00:35:56.065 --> 00:35:57.820
of the things.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.600
TREBOR SCHOLZ:
Well, I mean, there

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.929
is increasing turn of anti-trust
measures against Google,

00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:08.220
people writing books about
it and policy makers getting

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.630
more interested in the idea.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.750
So if this will ever happen
is the other question.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.670
But if there is such a break
up, like I said in my talk,

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.420
the idea would be that one
of these smaller companies

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.730
could be run as a cooperative
or could be mandated

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.352
to be run as a cooperative.

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.810
And to answer your
second question,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.330
they don't take VC money.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.940
So the money comes from users.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.720
So for example,
Fairmondo put a cap

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.870
on 20,000 euros per investor.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.270
And they are users of the site.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.250
So they are members
of the co-op.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.630
So they get their capital
from members, not from VC.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.066
So there is no
controlling influence.

00:36:50.066 --> 00:36:52.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, let me
clarify the second question.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.040
What I meant is how do
prevent a company like Uber

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.770
to compete with the
Green Taxi of Denver?

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.080
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.070
AUDIENCE: Because
Uber could say,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.660
hey, free rides for everybody
for the next five years,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.540
because it's powered
by VC capital.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.480
And then Green Taxi
dies, and Uber lives.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480
How do you prevent that?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.604
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah, right.

00:37:07.604 --> 00:37:10.050
Well, you can't
prevent that, but you

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.740
can look at markets
and industries

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.420
in which this model could be
more successful than in others.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.530
For example, in the United
States as much as in Europe,

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.390
home health care is a huge issue
where this model could really

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.310
succeed very well.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.680
But you see it also in Denver.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.090
There are cities,
like Austin, right?

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.670
In Austin, there are several.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.800
There are platform
co-ops and also a DAO,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.460
if you're following that
discussion, basically

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.980
that work in markets where
Uber is not so dominant

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.910
or left in fact.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:45.810
For example, Italy.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:53.280
So the Italian government
just informed us

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.110
that they are basically
financing a study

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.670
to see if platinum co-ops could
be rolled out all over Italy.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:05.200
Because Uber announced that
they will leave the country.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.620
So you know, I guess
like one answer

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.510
to that would be in niches
where they are not competing

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.160
or in niches where
they don't operate.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.760
It's, of course, I
would think this.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.010
The idea here is not
to destroy Uber, right?

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.990
I hope I made that clear.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:27.330
But the objective is a more
diversified digital economy

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.260
and one where ethical
alternatives like that

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.310
have some room in
the market, right?

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.620
I think it would be
unrealistic to think that they

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.387
would dominate those markets.

00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:41.886
AUDIENCE: Does
anyone here use Juno?

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:42.387
I use Juno.

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:44.219
TREBOR SCHOLZ: I mean,
Juno was interesting,

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:46.080
because it had a
worker-ownership model.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.496
I don't know if
you followed this.

00:38:47.496 --> 00:38:49.560
So they basically
said if drivers

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.440
have a high performance, they
will own part of the company.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.150
Only problem is that they
then were purchased by Gett

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.910
and betrayed the workers.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.200
And this is not really
happening anymore.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.180
So we deleted them
from our website.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.100
But you know, there
are dozens of companies

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.820
that do operate, like
Cotabo in Italy, ETX.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.630
I mean, there are
many examples--

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.332
Austin Rides.

00:39:20.332 --> 00:39:22.540
AUDIENCE: The thing that
stuck out to me about this--

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.440
because I think it's easy to
argue that over time overall,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.120
it's cheaper for everyone.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.370
But there's a minimum
buy in for people

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.407
who want to be part
of these co-ops.

00:39:32.407 --> 00:39:34.240
And I'm wondering how
that affects something

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.320
you talked about earlier, which
is whose problems are getting

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.474
solved by these things.

00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:40.390
You mentioned Up &amp; Go.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.280
I don't know if
that's an example.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.780
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Well,
you know, there

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.613
are lots of different
ways of funding these.

00:39:46.613 --> 00:39:50.040
So like Up &amp; Go was funded
through foundation and a bank,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.800
right?

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.634
So Barclays Bank
and the Robin Hood

00:39:53.634 --> 00:39:54.800
Foundation here in New York.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.560
[INAUDIBLE] a
foundation that aims

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.320
at alleviating poverty in New
York City invested in that.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.410
And then there are, you
know, blockchain schemes

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:09.760
where people basically tried
to find new funding ways.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.890
We are just about to create a
plot from co-op crypto token

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:21.760
to basically allow people
in the crypto token system

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.750
to invest in this model as well.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.227
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that lead
to situations like Juno,

00:40:27.227 --> 00:40:29.140
though, if you're
getting external funding,

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.207
but you want people to
be owning the company?

00:40:31.207 --> 00:40:32.290
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Not really.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was wondering
if you could talk about kind

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.700
of where a co-op might not
be the best thing where kind

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.065
of a larger company where you--

00:40:45.065 --> 00:40:46.190
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Right, yeah.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.648
AUDIENCE: I mean, when I think
about Uber, the thing that's

00:40:48.648 --> 00:40:51.110
nice about it is I can go
almost anywhere and use it.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.890
Whereas, these co-ops, you
seem to be kind of focused

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.215
in smaller areas rather than
kind of a large extended co-op.

00:40:58.215 --> 00:40:59.840
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Well,
it depends, right?

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.880
So yeah, I agree with you.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.080
So the most sensible
areas would be

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.710
I think where research
and development is not

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.370
very extensive.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:15.200
So probably not in
automated cars, right?

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.140
Probably not in
self-driving cars.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.530
So you know, I mean,
development of AI i

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.510
would not place on small
cooperatives, right?

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.810
But even in that discussion, it
would be interesting to see--

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.520
and there are
already cooperatives

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.680
that actually contribute to
the research of AI companies.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.824
They are not doing
it themselves,

00:41:38.824 --> 00:41:40.240
but they are part
of this picture.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.732
They're trying to insert
themselves in there.

00:41:42.732 --> 00:41:43.940
That was your first question.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.712
But then you had the second one?

00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:46.420
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.660
That was kind of my--

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.350
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.683
No, I completely agree with you.

00:41:49.683 --> 00:41:52.670
And this is why areas, for
example, like, you know,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.640
home health care,
like I say it again.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.420
You know, we saw it being very
successful in the Netherlands,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.520
you know, where basically groups
of nurses form cooperatives,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.550
create websites with services
like prenatal care for Latino

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.420
women.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.920
You know, there's
this [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.890
for example, done here
in Southern California

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.910
where these nurses traditionally
through temp agencies

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.730
would pay 50% to
the temp agency.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.040
And now they have a
very different situation

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.700
when they run their own
operation like that.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.810
So there are clear advantages
for particular groups I think.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.765
So, yeah.

00:42:33.765 --> 00:42:35.390
AUDIENCE: One other
different question.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.750
You kind of mentioned that
there would be this ideal co-op

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.787
platform kernel.

00:42:39.787 --> 00:42:40.620
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.121
AUDIENCE: And we make platforms
here a little bit sometimes.

00:42:43.121 --> 00:42:44.661
TREBOR SCHOLZ: I've
heard about that.

00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:45.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.630
What kind of main
features do you

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.910
think would exist in
this type of platform?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:50.993
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Absolutely.

00:42:50.993 --> 00:42:54.110
Well, it's really
for apps, right?

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:59.000
Well, it's one worker
facing, one client facing,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.110
for iOS and for Android.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.560
So it's really like four apps
that you would have to demo

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.550
and have to develop.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.160
And then they would have to
plug into different applications

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.190
locally, right?

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:14.480
So it would just be the
kernel, and then local.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.000
So you know, it would
be somebody [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.650
what you would
consider small grant,

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.150
I would consider an
enormous grant for this.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.350
And so we tried to
make a dent in that

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.650
and actually hope to have this
done in the next two years.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.122
So I mean, if any of you
are interested in this

00:43:31.122 --> 00:43:33.080
and think that they would
like to support this,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.450
we would, of course,
highly welcome that.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.987
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about policy changes--

00:43:39.987 --> 00:43:40.820
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.210
AUDIENCE: --that could
encourage more co-ops or level

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.510
the playing field or take
a holistic approach to--

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.810
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Absolutely.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.510
AUDIENCE: --creating, you know,
a world that results in more

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.034
co-ops or whatever
that would be--

00:43:55.034 --> 00:43:56.200
TREBOR SCHOLZ: No, absolute.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.910
AUDIENCE: --if people
are thinking about that

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:57.890
or if you have anything
to say about that.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:58.723
TREBOR SCHOLZ: Yeah.

00:43:58.723 --> 00:44:01.880
No, so part of what this
organization, the PCC,

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.160
the Platform Cooperatives
and Consortium does

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.065
is we write policy
briefs for senators.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:14.780
And I don't know, in October,
we talked to the G7 about this.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.630
And you know, we wrote
one for Kirsten Gillibrand

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.190
who requested one.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.380
Because Kirsten Gillibrand
and Bernie Sanders

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.900
created this package on May 11,
I think, they released that,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.910
where they proposed a large
push for cooperatives.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.400
And so I think the
interventions are mostly

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.180
on the municipal level, right?

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.480
I wouldn't have all too much
hope on the federal level

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.040
at least for the next
four years, and so there.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.880
But I think you can work with
cities very much so hoping

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.290
to bring about local legislation
that is in favor of that.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:58.730
And there's a
whole sort of list.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.271
I mean, I have in
fact even a slide--

00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.210
I can show it to
you afterwards--

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.640
which lists the things
that we're proposing,

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.220
like a revolving loan fund for
platforms co-ops town hall.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:14.920
Set up townhalls to
discuss these issues

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.380
and many other things.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.020
The problem with
American policy is

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.780
that it's relatively
friendly to monopolies,

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.930
but it's really
hostile to cartels.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.480
And something like
Mondragon, which is really

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.530
a network of cooperatives, would
definitely be seen as a cartel

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.040
and would not be tolerated.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.280
So you have to find
ways to influence that,

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.735
as the people in Denver did.

00:45:41.735 --> 00:45:42.610
Thank you, everybody.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:48.060
[APPLAUSE]
