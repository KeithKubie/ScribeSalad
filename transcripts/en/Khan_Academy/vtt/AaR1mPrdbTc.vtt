00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.400
When economists refer
to inflation today,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.080
they are referring
to a general increase

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.450
in the level of prices
of goods and services.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.210
So they're really talking
about price inflation.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.980
The reason why I stress
that is because sometimes,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.170
or especially when the
term inflation first

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.330
came into usage, it actually was
referring to monetary inflation

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.240
or an increase in
the money supply.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.470
So it was referring to an
increase in the money supply.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.050
These two ideas are
closely related,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.050
but it's important to
realize that people really

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.439
are measuring inflation.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:36.230
When they're talking
about inflation today,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.010
they're talking about
price inflation.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.926
Because although these
two things are related,

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.140
they aren't always
exactly the same thing.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.730
It is generally true that if
the money supply-- and the money

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.094
supply is more than
just the amount

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:50.260
of dollars that are printed.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.093
It's the amount of
dollars that are printed.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.439
It's affected by the amount
of lending that's occurring.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.230
It's affected by the
number of transactions

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.810
that are occurring
in the economy.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.910
And if that money supply that's
affected by all of those things

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.379
grows faster than the total real
productivity of the economy,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.155
then it will generally
increase the level of prices.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:10.530
But especially in
the short term,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.720
there could be other
causes of price inflation.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
You could have things
like supply shocks.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.050
And a supply shock is
the supply of something

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.460
becomes scarce
all of the sudden.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850
And the most typical
example of a supply shock

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.130
is especially in the
oil crises in the 1970s.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.870
If for whatever
reason oil becomes

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170
scarce in a country
like the United States,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.590
then the price of oil
and gas would go up.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.490
But then these are inputs into
a whole set of things, even

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.900
that banana that you buy
at the grocery store.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.180
If the price of oil
or gas-- or both

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.610
of them, frankly-- or the
price of oil were to shoot up,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.530
even the price of your
banana would shoot up.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.340
Because to get that
banana to your store,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.880
you need to use some gasoline.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.060
In fact, a significant fraction
of that banana in that store

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.430
was probably the cost of
the gasoline for that ship

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.910
to take that banana
from wherever

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.900
it was grown to your grocery
store and then on a railroad

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.630
and then on a truck or whatever.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.039
So this would affect the
general prices, not just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.072
the prices of oil or gas.

00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:11.780
So these two things
are related, but it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990
important to realize
that people are

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.870
referring to price inflation.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.940
And the general consensus
is a little bit of it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.110
is a good thing.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.030
And I want to stress,
little is good.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.230
And we're talking 1, 2.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.020
Maybe 3% per year.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.320
But anything larger than
that gets a little scary

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.330
because it can kind
of snowball on itself.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.080
And we'll talk about
that in future videos

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.030
when we talk about
hyperinflation.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.260
And economists are also
afraid if inflation

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.530
were to ever get negative.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.440
That leads to deflation, and
we'll talk in future videos

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.250
why in many circles that
is viewed as a scary thing.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.180
Now in the United
States, inflation

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.836
is measured with the
Consumer Price Index, CPI.

00:02:58.836 --> 00:03:01.460
And you'll always hear
this reported in the news,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.740
especially if you watch some
of the business programming.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.390
And there are actually multiple
consumer price indices.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.980
The one that people
report whenever

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.720
they say the CPI went
up 2%, they are actually

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.420
referring to the
CPI-U. And the U here

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.890
stands for Urban consumers.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.740
And the reason why this
is the headline CPI,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.700
or the one that people
actually report,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.010
is because most of the
country in the United States,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.760
they are urban consumers.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.190
So this is the CPI that
affects the largest

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.380
number of people's pocketbooks.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.960
And the way that it's calculated
is, it's like the deflator.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.000
It's a price index.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.120
And it's measuring a general
increase or a general change

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.200
in the level of prices.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.700
But they actually are calculated
in slightly different ways,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.420
although they should
come into agreement

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.130
or they should be
close to each other

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.550
if they really are
indices from measuring

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.920
the general level of prices.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.870
But the way that
the CPI works is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.410
that they take a basket of
goods for this type of consumer

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.350
in a base year.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.020
So they'll pick up base year.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.930
And let's take a super simple
example, a ridiculously simple

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.850
example.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.110
Let's say in our little
country, the urban consumers--

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.410
we'll focus on CPI-U--
only consumes two things.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.510
In the next video, we'll
see that in reality, we

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.180
consume many more
than two things.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.638
But the two things--
and they spend

00:04:24.638 --> 00:04:28.380
60% of their money
on apples, and they

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.600
spent 40% of their
money on bananas.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.840
And in that base year, we just
set that base price of apples

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.207
at 100, and bananas are 100.

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:41.040
Now we're not saying
that apples and bananas

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.109
cost the same thing.

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:44.150
We're saying that we're
spending 60% of our money

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.850
on apples, 40% on bananas
in that base year,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.030
and that this is just that
base year level of prices.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.050
What will matter is
how much this grew.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.470
What will this index change
as we go to whatever year

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.950
we want to calculate
the inflation

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.414
in relative to this base year.

00:05:00.414 --> 00:05:01.830
So let's say in
our current year--

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.130
could be the very next year--
so let's say in our current year

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.220
and we're going to assume
these the same rates,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.000
that we're still spending 60%
on apples and 40% on bananas.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.040
In our current year,
the apple index--

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.140
let's say that it has
grown 50% percent to 150.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.360
So it is plus 50%.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.510
And let's say that the banana
index has grown to 180.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.360
So bananas have gotten even
more expensive-- plus 80%.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.060
So how would we measure?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.950
How much would we say
the CPI-U has grown?

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.817
Well, we would take a weighted
average of these indices,

00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:39.900
or you could say a weighted
average of the growth.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.410
And you could do it either way.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.260
So let's do it either way
to get you the same result.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:52.010
So in this year, our base index
is 0.6 times 100 plus 0.4 times

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.200
100, and this will
just come out to 100.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.530
This is 60 plus 40.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.730
This is equal to
100 as it should.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.960
That is our base year.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.990
That is our base for our index.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.525
Now over here in
our current year,

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.150
so this is what we're
transitioning to,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.566
there's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:11.890
You could say, look, we're
spending 60% on something

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.080
that has gone up to 150 now.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.810
So we would say 0.6 times 150.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.290
And then we'll say
plus 0.4 times 180.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.620
And that gets us to-- let
me get my calculator out--

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:40.570
so this gets us 0.6 times
150 plus 0.4 times 180.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.130
So that gets us to 162.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.440
So our general-- if you
look at this basket and this

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.140
is an overly simplified
basket-- we've

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.880
increased from 100 to 162.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.232
Or you could say
this is plus 62%.

00:06:58.232 --> 00:06:59.940
And you would have
gotten the same result

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.106
if you took the weighted
average of the percentages.

00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:06.122
If you took 0.6 times 50%
plus 0.4 times 80%-- in fact

00:07:06.122 --> 00:07:07.330
we could do that in our head.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.670
0.6 times 50% is
going to be 30%.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.510
And then 0.4 times 80%
is going to be 32%.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.642
to 30 plus 32
gives us 62% growth

00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:19.600
for this basket of goods,
which we are assuming

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.430
is I guess for this
urban consumer,

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.149
from our base year
to the current year.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:24.690
Now in the next
video, we'll actually

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.940
look at what the basket
of goods actually

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.950
looks like in the United States
for an actual urban consumer.
