00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.360
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In today's video, we're going to take
a look at a few different methods

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.460
for how to fill bubbles with fuel
so you can light them on fire.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.880
[Music]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.780
In the past, we've shown you
a fun way to make bubbles

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.860
that you can hold down your hand,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.120
and light on fire.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.120
This is just a little bit of
bubble soap diluted with some water,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880
and a can of butane that
I'm just turning upside down,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640
and pressing onto
the bottom of the bowl.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.280
That releases the butane,

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.119
it forms bubbles in the soap,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.180
you can then scoop them up onto your hands,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.740
and light them on fire.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.480
It's a cool trick that
when you do it correctly,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.780
is not all that dangerous.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.000
Although of course, you still need
to be very sure that you're being careful.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.420
But it's not quite what you might
imagine if you think of fire bubbles.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.780
It is bubbles and
they can be lit on fire,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.400
but we wanted to see if we could
do something a little bit different.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.980
I was hoping that I could take an
actual bubble machine and modify it,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.789
so that instead of just
blowing normal bubbles,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.500
it blew bubbles full of a fuel,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.640
so you could then light
the bubbles on fire.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.840
I'm going to walk you through
the process I went through

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.640
as I explored whether or not
this was a viable project.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880
On the back of the bubble machine,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.250
there's a small fan that
blows air through the machine

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.840
until it comes out the front.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.860
A little circle of bubble wands
dips down into some soap,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.380
rotates around and ends up
right in front of the fan.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.240
That's where the bubbles
are all blown out.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.270
So, my thought was that
if we could isolate the air intake,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.800
and flood that with fuel,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.340
it would just start blowing
fuel-filled bubbles out of the front.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.620
Like with the bath of bubbles,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.160
the plan was to use butane as a fuel.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.620
A butane canister is cheap,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.700
and we know that it doesn't just
destroy bubbles on contact with them.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.220
There's probably several types
of fuel that are like that,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.700
but we already know the butane works,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.940
so that's the one I wanted to try.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.299
So, how to direct the butane
from our little canister

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.829
onto the back of our bubble machine?

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.700
Well, what I came up with
was uh-- it was gloves.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700
I decided to try using
one of these rubber gloves

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.520
to see if I could attach
it onto the back of the fan,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
and then to just use one of the fingers
as a fill point for the butane here.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.520
So first step,
I'm just gonna use some tape,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.680
and tape it down over
the whole air intake area.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.720
[Music]

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.540
That's a glove just taped down
over the entire air intake

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.720
of this bubble dispenser,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.880
and now, at this point,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.280
if I hit this button,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.620
it will actually suck some
of the air out of the glove.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.540
Turn it on.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.420
So, we know the air intakes is trying
to pull air from out of the glove.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.100
That's what we want.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.940
And now we need to attach the other end
of this glove to our butane container.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.590
To do that, I'm just going
to stab or cut a very small hole

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.820
in the tip of one of the fingers,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.140
and then I'm going to just
attach it around the nozzle.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.220
Okay, we now have our nozzle
attached to the finger of the glove,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.720
and the rest of the glove is
attached to the air intake of the fan.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.560
See if we can...

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.900
See, I need to elevate this a little bit more.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.000
All right, for my workshop,
I have a one of these just sitting there.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.540
So, I'm going to use this.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.340
The goal is to elevate
the bubble machine just enough

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.280
that I'm not kinking the connection
between the glove and the butane,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.940
so it has a better chance
of filling correctly,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.340
and not just getting trapped in there.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.080
All right. Let's see what happens
if I grab the nozzle and press down on it.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.960
[Music]

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.220
The glove seems to
inflate just a tiny tiny bit.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.540
[Music]

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.340
You can see the finger certainly inflated.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.440
[Music]

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.060
But most of the glove doesn't,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.620
and I'm pretty sure
that's actually just because

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.460
it's going all the
way through the glove,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.160
through the fan,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.880
and coming out in the
front of the bubble machine.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.520
I have a-- I think an effective,
if somewhat dumb way to test that.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.540
[Music]

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.320
Set this right-- Oh!

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.100
[Music]

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520
I think that's test
confirmed right there.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.480
Enough butane had just settled
around here that it lit on fire.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.620
But you can see that it becomes
flammable when I press down on here,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.880
butane is traveling through.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.320
So now the test is
to see what happens

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.540
if we turn on the machine while we're
pushing down on the butane nozzle.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840
Will we get bubbles flying out the front?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:14.660
[Music]

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.200
Well, it was definitely flammable.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.680
It was definitely taking
the fuel from the canister,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.940
and blowing it out in the air.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.090
But, you probably noticed,

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.300
it didn't actually
successfully make any bubbles.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.280
See the bubble machine works
by just blowing a fan constantly,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.851
and then the circular bubble wand
moves the different bubble wand

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.032
heads in front of the fan,

00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:33.530
and that's where all
the bubbles come out.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.760
But it doesn't only blow the air

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.730
when the wand is right
in front of the fan.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.320
It's constantly blowing it out.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.280
In between every one of
these bubble wands,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.660
there's a lot of space.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.880
If you try and light the bubbles
anywhere close to the machine,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.210
you have a very real chance of
just hitting the stoichiometry,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.840
where the fuel and the air
are mixed together

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.780
just right to go up
in a big old fire ball.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.220
I think it would need to
be something a lot more precise

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.090
to be a fully automated machine,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.370
something that dip the
bubble wand into bubbles,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.530
puts in front of a nozzle,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.510
a carefully shaped small volume nozzle

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.980
that's just going to blow the fuel
right into the bubble wand,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.380
instead of just blanket
spraying fuel everywhere,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.620
and hoping it catches some
bubbles as they move by.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.280
So moving on from using
the pre-made bubble machine,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.040
I still like the idea
of getting bubbles blown

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.870
through a bubble wand of some sort.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.760
So, I wanted to try
a slightly different method

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.580
that did not use the bubble machine.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.500
This bubble soap came
with this gnarly bubble wand

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.120
that does a pretty good job
of making some good size bubbles.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.580
So, I thought maybe I could
modify a butane canister,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.640
so we can just blow bubbles through here.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.040
Those are good bubbles.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.050
I like those bubbles.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.080
So, I wanted a way
to direct butane sideways,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.580
but by leaving the canister
straight up and down,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.540
and that kind of made me
think of a can of spray paint.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.580
Cans of spray paint are up and down,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.640
the nozzles on the top,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.520
paint comes out sideways.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.100
How perfect!

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.420
That's just what we're looking for.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.200
I do have an extra spray paint
nozzle from an empty spray paint.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.320
This obviously was black spray paint,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.720
and it fits fairly closely
on top of our butane canister.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.040
It's kind of loose still, it spins.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.320
But even with it spinning loose like that,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.620
if I press down on the nozzle,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.180
I can feel the butane
coming out the front.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.460
I think there's also quite a
bit leaking out the bottom,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.730
because as I said,
it's not a perfect seal.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.680
So, what we want to do
is attach this nozzle

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.200
onto the butane canister a
little bit more permanently,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.480
and to do that, we're going
to use some two-part epoxy.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.240
We're going to mix up a little bit of this,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.860
apply it on the little stem of the nozzle here,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.180
and then put our cap on,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.390
and really try and make sure
that we get a nice tight seal,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.090
so there won't be any gaps
and no leaking fuel,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.200
except out the front.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.960
Take our epoxy and start applying it.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.311
And of course,
we want to make sure

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:39.180
that it doesn't go all the way
up onto the top of the nozzle,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.760
because that would block it up,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.120
and we do not want to block it up.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.490
We just want to stop it
from coming out the sides.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.820
So we choose where it comes out.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.100
Put that in.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.490
I'm just going to twist it
back and forth to try and get

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.100
that epoxy to bond on
everywhere in a circle.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.960
Right now, it's making
contact all the way around.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.740
So now, I'm going to
flip it back right side up,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.880
because I don't want to have any epoxy
accidentally running down the nozzle,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.639
and just filling and blocking it all up.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.660
So right now,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.380
that should be in a spot
where it will be attached,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.180
and form a seal all the way around,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.500
but it should leave the nozzle open
to spraying once the epoxy is cured.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.020
It's been a few minutes,
and the epoxy is cured.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.220
So we have a nozzle on top
of our butane canister,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.980
and I believe we have butane
only coming out the nozzle,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.980
and not leaking out the bottom.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.760
Let's give it the upside down test.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.980
[Music]

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.560
Plenty of butane
coming out the front,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.380
but I don't see anything
spraying out the gap here.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.320
[Music]

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.720
I'd call that a success.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.340
Let's see if we can use this
butane bottle to fill some bubbles.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:48.160
[Music]

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.280
Those are bubbles.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200
Blown with the butane canister.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.640
So one of the main questions
is whether or not we can get

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.100
enough butane into these bubbles
for them to actually be flammable.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.900
It could be that the
Bernoulli effect is causing there

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.690
to be so much air inside the bubbles

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.180
that it no longer is
a flammable level of fuel.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.520
Here's a little bit of the science
behind what might be happening.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.740
The Bernoulli effect is something
that occurs with high velocity fluids.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.520
When something like a stream of air
or gaseous fuel is moving really quickly,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.800
it creates a low-pressure area.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.340
Pressure always tries
to move from high to low,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.400
and so, all of the air outside
of the low pressure zone

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.020
will try and rush in to fill
the low pressure zone,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.880
which means that air would get pulled
through the bubble wand into the bubble,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.160
along with the fuel.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980
Seems logical to me that
the best way to test

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.040
if there's enough butane is
to try and light them on fire.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.420
Let's give it a shot.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.520
Ideally, this isn't
a one-person activity,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.090
but I'm going to try
and make it work anyway.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.240
I have here a little party sparkler.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.160
I'm going to light the party sparklers.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.620
I'm going to blow some bubbles
using the butane canister,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.620
set that down,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.500
quickly try and grab the sparkler,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.340
and see if I can ignite the bubbles
before they just pop on the ground.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:59.880
[Music]

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.240
Wind to stop changing.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.520
[Music]

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.020
Come back!

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.860
Oh! That one actually burned.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.240
[Music]

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.540
Some of those worked.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.800
It might have been really hard to see
on camera because it's daylight,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.540
and it's just a small little flame.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.880
But those ignited.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.880
The sparklers have been
lighting off some of the bubbles.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.640
But they don't do as good of a job as
I think just using the torch might do,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.400
so, I'm going to try
just lighting the torch,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.460
and blowing some bubbles,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.980
and trying to light it off with that.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.480
It might work a little bit better.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.620
[Music]

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.800
Yeah!

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.140
[Music]

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.120
But I think I'm getting
the hang of what does work.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.380
If I don't press down quite as much,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.740
letting out the butane in a slower stream,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.340
it doesn't pop the bubble as often,

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.060
plus the pressure difference between

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.220
inside the bubble and
outside the bubble is lower,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.430
so we get less air and more butane,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.820
which is more flammable.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.020
This is working okay.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.840
Actually, a little better
than I thought it would.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.580
But it's really hard to see in the daylight.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.020
I think we need to go to night.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.020
Okay.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:03.740
There we go. That's better.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.120
We should now be able to see
if things are actually lighting on fire.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.540
Let's give it another try.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.520
[Music]

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.960
I saw a little flame.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.940
[Music]

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.740
I saw another one.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.340
[Music]

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.360
That was great.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:33.200
[Music]

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.380
That was exciting.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.680
All right,
since I only have two hands,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.070
I got my friend Keith to fill in.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.160
He's got an extra hand.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.210
He's gonna hold the torch.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.279
I'm gonna make the bubbles.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.140
Hopefully, we won't
light each other on fire.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.060
We'll see.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.220
[Music]

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.600
&gt;&gt; Ah, it's like whack-a-mole.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.360
Gotta get them all.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.580
[Music]

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.900
&gt;&gt; Not so close.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.800
[Music]

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.160
Butane in your face.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:09.960
[Music]

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.440
He's in his 30s, folks.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.800
&gt;&gt; I'm an adult.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.360
&gt;&gt; But I'm the one blowing
bubbles so you know...

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.580
Dancing with a sparkler.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580
Blowing bubbles.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.620
We're both adults.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.720
It didn't work out so well
to make a bubble machine

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.980
that had flammable bubbles,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.279
but just blowing gas into the
bubble soap worked out quite nicely.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.330
I really like that effect.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.700
It's something that I think
I would like to revisit.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.720
Maybe trying to make bigger bubbles with
more gaseous fireball flames in them.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.160
Or maybe just using some cooler
footage of doing this same thing.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.541
Both of those would be really neat.

00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.220
What would you like to see us try?

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.000
Guys! That's not all.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.120
There's still more for you to see.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.671
That little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:52.671
and you should go check it out.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.790
The box down at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.790
you need to be watching next,

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.960
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to our channel,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.760
so you never miss out on a video.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.820
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you on the next one.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.560
Talk to you then.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.600
Taunted by bubbles.
