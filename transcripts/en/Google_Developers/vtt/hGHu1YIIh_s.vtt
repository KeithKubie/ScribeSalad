[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.620
ANDREW BROGDON: I want
to thank all of you

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.150
for being here with us tonight.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.525
Well, it's true that Google's
putting a lot of effort

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.650
into the developments that
you've just heard about.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.550
Flutter is an
open-source project.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.060
And it's created and supported
by an entire community

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.450
of SDK contributors, package
developers, YouTube creators,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.410
and more.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.920
And by choosing to
join us tonight,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.440
you're now part
of that community.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.731
And we want to hear your voice.

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.670
So for the next
hour or so, we're

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.604
answering your questions
live right here.

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.770
You can post them in the
YouTube livestream comments

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.050
or tweet using the
#AskFlutter hashtag,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.084
and we'll get to
as many as we can.

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:40.500
So you're working
the streams, Wm.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.860
We get a lot of
questions so far?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.390
WM LELER: Oh my god.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.890
Yes.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.600
We have a ton of questions, and
we've been getting about two

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
per second now, which is down
from the high of about seven

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.380
per second.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.840
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.631
WM LELER: So, yeah.

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:52.320
We're getting a lot of tweets.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.820
ANDREW BROGDON: Cool.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.269
We also have a
few drop-in guests

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.060
lined up from the
Flutter engineering team.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.220
And we're coming to you from
the crowd at Flutter Live.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.250
So if you ask a
question I can't handle,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.980
I'll find somebody that can and
we'll get them up here with me

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.200
and answer it together.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.870
So, all right.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.829
Wm, are we ready to go?

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.828
WM LELER: Well, let's
start with an obvious one.

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:11.490
We've been getting
a lot of questions--

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.100
actually, even
before the keynote,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.440
we were getting so
many people asking us,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.690
when are Maps going to
be available on Flutter?

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.481
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:22.290
WM LELER: Now we already have
the answer to that question,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.530
but let's go into it
a little bit deeper.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.114
Can you give us a
little demo of how

00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:28.280
Maps are working on Flutter?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.620
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.280
Yeah.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.079
So, full disclosure,
we kind of figured

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.370
this one was definitely coming.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.980
So I've got some stuff
ready to go on my laptop.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.949
Real quick, let's take
a look at the code.

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:38.490
So one of the nice
things-- you know,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.100
Flutter is completely
open source-- the SDK,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.630
the tools, the language.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.610
You know, Dart itself
is open source,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.150
and the plugins are, too.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.020
So let's go to our plugins repo.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.000
So this is flutter/plugins.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.130
Got it up on my laptop.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.546
And if you go in here, you can
see a bunch of the packages

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:58.940
that the team is maintaining
and building out.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.620
There's stuff for battery,
camera, connectivity

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.190
and things.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.430
And way down here we have
Google Maps for Flutter.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.679
And so if you're ever curious
about this code base--

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.220
you know, what can
Maps do right now,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.160
where's it going-- this is a
great place to go check out.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.049
So we have the lib directory,
which has the imports.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.590
This will have the
Google Map widget.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.760
Because this is Flutter.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.920
Everything's a widget.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.640
It also has the map controller
and some other things.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320
And then we have the Android
and iOS sort of bridge

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.660
that goes from Dart
into the Google Maps

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.630
SDKs for Android and iOS.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.220
And let's see what
code I've got here.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.395
So, here we have our
DevRel sample for Maps.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.270
And this was done by
the very talented Kenzie

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.430
Schmoll up at our Portland
office, who you know well.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.140
And this is right
now up on GitHub

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.780
in the flutter/samples repo.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.250
That's the one that DevRel
uses for our samples.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.874
So all this code you
can go get right now.

00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:59.290
And let's take a
look at this app.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.460
So this is using a
Google Map widget.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.017
And it does the
things you'd kind of

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.100
expect a Google Map to do.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.080
You can pan around,
you can zoom in.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.210
She's got some places that
she's added to this map.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.210
She's got a couple sets.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.600
And you can see if I
switch between them

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.480
the map automatically zooms
out, just like you'd expect.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.630
I can go in here and switch
terrain types, for example.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.370
I can check that, go
from the Street View

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.400
to satellite, topographic
if you want to know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.870
where the mountains are.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.090
You can even turn it off.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.890
And then back to Street View.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.620
And as you notice, I'm
clicking on buttons on the map

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.930
that you wouldn't normally
see on the Google Map.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.570
And that's because
they're Flutter widgets.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.990
These are things that
Kenzie added to this on top

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.010
using a stack.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.759
WM LELER: So the Map
widget, it's just

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.050
a widget like any other widget.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.620
ANDREW BROGDON:
It's just a widget.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.010
It's doing some
things under the hood,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.218
but it's still just a widget.

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.224
You saw in the demo
that [? Philip ?] did,

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:52.640
he even threw it
into a transform,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.530
and his map was
tilted like this.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.430
You can play with
them just like that.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.994
So, speaking of
playing with it, let's

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:01.160
mess with this a little bit.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.785
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:02.700
I wanted to ask.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.245
How hard is it to add
Maps, then, to your app?

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.870
ANDREW BROGDON: So
a good way to answer

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.859
that question would be to just
blow away this entire app.

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:11.400
WM LELER: OK.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.150
Let's kill it.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.260
ANDREW BROGDON: So this is home.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.579
I'm going to replace
everything in the app with just

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.300
a Google Map.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.050
So let's try that.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.329
Here's the Google Map widget.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.790
And the map, its
constructor takes

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.840
a single required parameter,
which is onMapCreated.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.160
And this is a little callback.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.717
So to interact with the map,
you use a Google Map controller.

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:34.800
The controller pattern you
may have seen elsewhere

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.040
in Flutter, the text fields
and some of the inputs.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.080
This is how you interact
with it, change its behavior.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.220
And so it has a little
callback that'll

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.850
give you the controller.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.290
And so I'm just going to
make a spot to hold it.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.245
So I'll go up here, make a
little Google Map controller,

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:54.870
just like that.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.490
And I'll call it _mapController.

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.680
And I'm going to
assign that down here.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.250
All right, so I've got
my widget in place,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.620
I've got the
controller callback.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.780
Let's do a little hot reload.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.470
And there we go.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.129
So my entire app now is
basically just a map.

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.920
And I can still come
in here and do things.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.940
If I wanted to zoom in,
I can click and zoom.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.630
I can still pan around
and things like that.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.860
All right.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.507
So let's do something with this.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:32.340
We've got the map, we've
got the controller.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.548
WM LELER: Well, you said
before you could add buttons

00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:35.850
over the Flutter widget--

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.970
the Map widget.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.220
Let's see what we can do.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.011
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:43.157
Let's add a button and
we can do something.

00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:43.990
We click the button.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.414
So I'll wrap this in,
let's go with a stack.

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:48.580
So I'll put this in a stack.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.760
And of course stacks
have children rather than

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.840
a single child, so we add that.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.980
And that's going to be a list.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.356
Come down here.

00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:00.150
The magic of auto-formatting.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.100
And let's put a button.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.390
And I'm going to want this--

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.290
I'll put this in the
lower left-hand corner,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.178
just so we know where it
is, so use a Positioned.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.430
There we go.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.840
So bottom, I'll give
it a little padding.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.400
That's not how you
spell "bottom."

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.500
And left.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.200
Maybe a little padding there.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.050
And then child.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.300
I'll give this a RaisedButton.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.320
And so our button
will need some text.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.590
Let's move the camera when
the button gets put, I'd say.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.728
How about that?

00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:39.610
There we go.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.630
And we'll give it an onPressed,
because every button needs

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.820
an onPressed callback if
it's going to be used.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.260
And just for fun,
let's give it a color.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.740
Let's give it a-- is there
a light green material spec?

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.850
There is a light green.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.740
Awesome.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.644
OK.

00:06:56.644 --> 00:07:00.000
Let's hot reload again.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.240
We've still got our map.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.750
And let's-- we've
got a button now.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.624
Let's move the camera
when we get this click.

00:07:06.624 --> 00:07:11.668
So we have the controller.

00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:16.280
And, update-- animateCamera.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.650
Let's do an animative--

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.530
WM LELER: OK.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.863
ANDREW BROGDON: And that's
going to take a CameraUpdate.

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:25.740
And then we'll do--

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.890
let's do a LatLng here.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.389
Do you happen to know any
latitudes and longitudes?

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:33.680
WM LELER: How about for London?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.530
ANDREW BROGDON: Do
you know London?

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.160
WM LELER: I sure do.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.243
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:40.650
WM LELER: It's 51.5 latitude
and, well, let's just say 0.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.845
That's actually Greenwich,
but it's close by.

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:44.120
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.350
I'm going to put a semi-colon
on there, and-- oh, wait.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.100
That gets a comma.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.225
WM LELER: Do you want to
zoom in a little bit, too?

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.111
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:51.610
All right.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.962
So come over here.

00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:54.920
Let's zoom in a little.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.440
Oh.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.190
It twisted.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.080
And let's go ahead
and save this.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.600
So we're hot reloading again.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.070
And let me click
the Move Camera.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.976
And there we go.

00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:08.600
So now we're interacting
with this map.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.240
In about five minutes we
dropped a Google Map in here,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.969
got the controller, and used it
to animate a change to the map.

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:16.010
WM LELER: That's awesome.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.885
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:19.750
WM LELER: So not only do we
have Maps now, full Google Maps,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.687
they're really Flutter widgets.

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:22.520
ANDREW BROGDON: Mhm.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.620
WM LELER: And they're really
easy to add and manipulate,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:24.690
so--

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.564
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:08:25.564 --> 00:08:26.810
You can compose with these.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.860
They're just like
any other widgets.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.140
You can get them in here,
put things over them,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.120
move them around, do
what you need to do.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.600
WM LELER: That's great.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.433
ANDREW BROGDON: Yep.

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:36.240
And so, like I said, if you have
any other questions on this,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.520
check out the
source code itself.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.210
And if you run into any issues
or want any other features,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.370
file an issue request.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:42.919
WM LELER: OK.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.027
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:45.110
All right, so that's Maps.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.842
What else?

00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:46.550
What else we got?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.508
WM LELER: Well, I've got
a couple of questions.

00:08:48.508 --> 00:08:49.790
Here's a question from India.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.786
We got a lot of
questions from India.

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:52.660
ANDREW BROGDON: Cool.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.243
WM LELER: Probably, I think they
win the award for most number

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.920
of questions, which is doubly
amazing because I think it's

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.510
after midnight now in India.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.100
So this is pretty amazing.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.870
So the question is, I want to
know what the best laptop is

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.120
for developing Flutter apps.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.677
Which are compatible with all
the emulators and so forth?

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.760
ANDREW BROGDON: Probably
whatever laptop you have,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:14.960
right?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.160
WM LELER: That's right.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.880
Yeah.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.755
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:19.360
So, Flutter, part
of being open-- you

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.290
know, when the team says
open, they really mean it.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.664
They don't just
mean open source.

00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:25.940
It's, you should be able to
use the machine that you have,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.830
use the tools that you already
like, and things like that.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.320
So if you're building Flutter
apps, you can use IDEs.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.080
You know, this is
IntelliJ IDEA that I use.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.970
And VS Code, of course, runs
on just about everything.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.950
So, Windows machine,
Linux machine--

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.590
WM LELER: iOS.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.960
ANDREW BROGDON: OS X.
You can run on all of--

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.710
WM LELER: [LAUGHS]
No, Apple-- yeah.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.700
They even run on--

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.130
you can run this on Chromebooks.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.040
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
and Chromebook as well.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.340
And so if you're going to
actually build and release

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.420
an iOS app, you would actually
need a MacBook or an Apple

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.370
machine at that point,
because their toolchain

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.674
runs on their machine.

00:10:02.674 --> 00:10:04.840
So if you want to actually
build an iBA and sign it,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.980
and do all of
that, at that point

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.930
you would need an Apple machine.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.020
But you could even
build it out entirely

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.600
without touching a MacBook
or an Apple, you know?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.620
WM LELER: Right.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.670
ANDREW BROGDON: So, yeah.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.626
Really, I mean, it's up to you.

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:19.250
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.530
That is one of the
advantages of Flutter,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.760
is that you can actually
build an iOS app not on a Mac.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.740
And then at the last
moment, because of Apple's

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.010
requirements, yes, you have
to find a Mac somewhere and do

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.510
the release build.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.590
But that's it.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.510
And send it off
to Apple that way.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.092
So, if you have a cousin who has
an Apple laptop, you're fine.

00:10:39.092 --> 00:10:41.300
ANDREW BROGDON: Just drop
by, release your app, and--

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:41.435
WM LELER: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:44.060
Just borrow it for a few
hours, and there you go.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.650
I'm actually going
to switch over.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.439
We have so many live
questions coming in.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:48.230
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.890
WM LELER: I'm going
to go ahead and do

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.200
a couple of live questions.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.380
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.056
WM LELER: One of them is, can I
use a Java library in Flutter?

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:56.930
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.370
Yeah.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.920
So Flutter has a thing
called platform channels

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.130
that can help you with this.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.999
Let me pull it up, and we'll
go into the laptop here.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:05.540
WM LELER: OK.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.373
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
do platform channels.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.380
See if I can find it
in one stroke here.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.210
There we go.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.650
So, platform channels is
a way for the Dart code

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.770
in your Flutter app to talk
to platform code and interact

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.400
with native APIs if you want
to, or just use native code.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.330
And so you can set up a method
channel that will marshal data

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.120
sort of out of Dart land
and into platform land,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.070
where you can call
Java functions,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.840
you can interact
with the Android API,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.570
or you could work
with hotlink code.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.160
Or on iOS, you could call
into Objective C and Swift,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.710
interact with those
platform APIs.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.992
So if you have a
Java library that you

00:11:46.992 --> 00:11:50.270
or your business or your group
has invested a lot of time in,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.620
and it would be a little bit
difficult to rewrite in Dart

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.880
natively for Flutter, you can
build a platform channel to it

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.070
and use it that way.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.739
You have that ability.

00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:04.280
WM LELER: OK.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.680
Let's go to a related question.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.580
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.550
WM LELER: This one,
where is it coming from?

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.410
Let me see.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.030
This is coming from Lake Zurich,
which is actually in the United

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:22.130
States, in Illinois, so it's one
of our very few US questions.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.850
So the question is, how
secure is a platform channel?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.520
Is there any chance that
somebody could intercept

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.160
that data, especially if
they have a rooted device

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.130
or something like that?

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.220
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.460
This is something I was
talking to the engineering

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.840
team about the other day.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.440
So the way platform
channels works,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.380
you have in your application--
you have sort of the Flutter

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.820
code that's running in Dart.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.190
It's built with Dart, it's
compiled to native code,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.580
and run that way.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.100
And on the side, you
would have some other code

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.950
that's running in Android.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.350
You would have the
Java VM that's running.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.860
And on iOS you have your
platform code for iOS

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.940
that's also running
outside of that library,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.290
made from the Dart.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.930
And so there's a memory
buffer in your process

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.690
for the communication
between the two of them.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.710
But that's within your process.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.481
So there is no IPC, interprocess
communication, required.

00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:13.730
Nobody is writing to like a
named file or a named pipe

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.060
on the system to talk between
two different processes

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.520
where, in theory, somebody
might have a better way

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.840
to go in and sniff the traffic
or something like that.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.010
This is all in one process.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.860
So a Flutter app,
in that regard,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.270
is as secure as any
normal Android or iOS app.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.789
WM LELER: OK, so I have another
live question, just came in.

00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:34.580
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.340
WM LELER: Can I use a
third-party ad network

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.540
in my Flutter project?

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.836
ANDREW BROGDON: [LAUGHS] You're
talking to the right person.

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:44.210
Before coming to
the Flutter team

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.650
I worked on the Mobile Ads team.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.820
WM LELER: I gave that
one just for you.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.695
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:53.450
So there is an ad-- there two
ways that you could do this.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.200
One is, you could use
platform channels to interact

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.207
with that network's mobile SDK.

00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:01.040
So if you wanted to
incorporate the Audience

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.310
Network or something
from Oath or InMobi

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.159
or something like that,
you could take that SDK,

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:09.200
build a little bridge
using the platform channels

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.080
to call methods on it,
and access it and use it

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.420
as you would otherwise normally.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.975
The other option that you
have, and I would make sure

00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:21.350
that you test this thoroughly,
because it's not something

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.790
I've tested personally--

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.140
you could use the
Flutter Firebase AdMob

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.810
plugin to use AdMob mediation.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.670
So AdMob has mediation,
which is a way

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.200
to use multiple ad networks in
concert within a single app,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.294
where AdMob sort of manages
which network shows an ad based

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.710
on which one is
providing the most

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.760
revenue at that
particular moment.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.140
And because the plugin for
AdMob is using the native AdMob

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.239
SDK, the native
Google Mobile Ads SDK,

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:49.530
that is still available to you.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.320
So if you have a
mediated ad unit,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.050
give it a try with that
plugin and see how it goes.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.337
I think it will more
than likely work fine.

00:14:57.337 --> 00:14:58.770
WM LELER: OK.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.110
Let me ask another live one.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.030
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.410
WM LELER: Can Dart be a
standalone programming

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.550
language?

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.930
ANDREW BROGDON: Dart is
a standalone programming

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:07.430
language.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.660
WM LELER: It absolutely is.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.600
Yes.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.800
So, yes, it can.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.940
In fact, it is.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.740
ANDREW BROGDON: I
mean, we-- obviously,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.700
on the Flutter team we
talk about Dart mostly

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.444
within the scope of
mobile applications,

00:15:15.444 --> 00:15:16.860
because that's
what we use it for.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.850
But, I mean, Dart, Dart for
the web, there's AngularDart.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.520
It's being used
all over the place.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.460
WM LELER: Our own
website, the Pub website,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.820
is using Dart to
build, on the server,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.060
to build a website, as well.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.850
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, and
we have Iiro, Iiro Krankaa,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.530
who's actually here.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.220
His inKino application
shares Dart code

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.780
in between a mobile
application built

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.930
for Flutter and an AngularDart
application as well.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.180
So that's definitely possible.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.730
There's also server-side Dart.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.063
There are people building
server applications with Dart.

00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:51.052
So it's a very
portable language.

00:15:51.052 --> 00:15:52.010
WM LELER: That's right.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.200
OK.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.490
I think I'm going to ask--

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:56.990
hold on.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.060
Let me find this new
one coming on over here.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.630
Ah.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.800
So we have a couple of questions
that are sort of related.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.870
They're saying, you
know, at one end

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.599
of the spectrum is, how do
I get started in Flutter?

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:09.390
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.765
WM LELER: And we
had one question

00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:12.050
that said, I know JavaScript.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.300
Can I learn Flutter and
Dart very easily with it?

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.860
And at the other
end of the spectrum,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.900
how do I become an
expert in Flutter?

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.280
ANDREW BROGDON: So the two--

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.330
how do I get on the path
and how do I get to the end?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.800
WM LELER: I did
that because I just

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.079
noticed that Pooja's there.

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:26.870
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.460
Pooja's over there.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.570
Yes.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.440
WM LELER: Pooja, do you
want to come up here?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.900
ANDREW BROGDON: Please.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.520
You would be great
for this question.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.103
Please, come and
join us and sit down.

00:16:33.103 --> 00:16:34.914
WM LELER: Join us.

00:16:34.914 --> 00:16:35.962
POOJA BHAUMIK: Hi, guys.

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.045
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:37.520
You've got the microphone there.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:37.692
POOJA BHAUMIK: Hello.

00:16:37.692 --> 00:16:37.780
Hi.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.290
ANDREW BROGDON: Hello.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:38.750
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.330
This is Pooja.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:39.560
POOJA BHAUMIK: Hi.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.610
ANDREW BROGDON: This
is Pooja, everyone.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.735
POOJA BHAUMIK: Hi everyone.

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:45.440
ANDREW BROGDON: And so you
recently wrote an article

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.230
about your path from
becoming a complete Flutter

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.889
newbie to a more
seasoned coder, right?

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:51.680
POOJA BHAUMIK: Yes.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.510
ANDREW BROGDON: And so let
me pull that up on my laptop,

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.110
actually.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.270
Can you tell us,
for the person who

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.649
asked about getting started,
how did you get started?

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:01.190
POOJA BHAUMIK: I
actually got started

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.590
because I joined
this company and they

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.140
wanted me to work in Flutter,
so I learned Flutter.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.119
And that's how I started.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:13.400
But I will tell you how
I started with Flutter.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.530
What I did is that I worked
on a lot of designs, you know?

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.950
I mean, Flutter is so
great for designing apps.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.700
Well, I wanted to-- let's just
redesign every app that I have,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.550
that I know.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.190
Let's redesign it in Flutter.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.148
WM LELER: That sounds
like a problem, you know?

00:17:30.148 --> 00:17:31.890
It's so easy you want
to redo everything.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.514
POOJA BHAUMIK: [LAUGHS]
I wanted to see

00:17:33.514 --> 00:17:38.240
if Flutter has the capability
to actually make it possible

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.220
for me to redesign all
of my favorite apps.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.250
And I could actually
make apps in one

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.950
day, like the entire app in
one day-- all the screens

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.850
and everything.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:51.260
And that's how I was
very sure this is it.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.880
This is what I want to do.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.540
ANDREW BROGDON: That's right.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.998
POOJA BHAUMIK: I
mean, I switched--

00:17:54.998 --> 00:17:56.960
I did not switch,
but I did kind of go

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.330
from Android to
Flutter because of it,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.302
because it's so amazing
to work with Flutter.

00:18:01.302 --> 00:18:03.260
ANDREW BROGDON: And it's
not like those Android

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.536
skills aren't used.

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:05.660
You still need them, right?

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.326
POOJA BHAUMIK: Yeah,
we still need them.

00:18:07.326 --> 00:18:11.040
You can start Flutter
without Android,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.950
but you will have to
come back to Android

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.540
at some point or the
other if you want

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.130
to work with native channels.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.440
I mean, if you want
to make a fuller app,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.012
you have to know a bit
of Android or maybe iOS.

00:18:21.012 --> 00:18:21.762
Whatever you want.

00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:23.160
WM LELER: Right.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.230
That definitely helps.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.910
ANDREW BROGDON:
So what were some

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.430
of the things that helped you
when you were getting started?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.830
So we talked a little bit
about what you were working on.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.330
Did you look for articles?

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.740
Did you look for videos?

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.960
Did you look for sample code?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.324
You know, those sorts of things?

00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.740
POOJA BHAUMIK: I
actually looked--

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.024
first I went to the codelabs.

00:18:41.024 --> 00:18:42.440
OK, so I checked
out the codelabs.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.200
It was actually very helpful.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.740
I wanted to try out the
Java-to-Dart codelab just

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.850
to see how Dart is.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.686
And it's pretty easy, actually.

00:18:56.686 --> 00:18:58.660
I learned Dart in a day.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.220
OK.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.470
ANDREW BROGDON: Once you
get past seeing "this"

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.780
in a constructor, it's fine.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:01.980
Right?

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.440
POOJA BHAUMIK: Yeah.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:02.939
Exactly.

00:19:02.939 --> 00:19:04.310
It's actually pretty easy.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.190
I don't know.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.290
Other languages, JavaScript or
whatever, they're not so easy.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.450
So, yeah, I was
convinced that day.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:18.810
And I did try out some articles,
talks by the Google I/O

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.830
and Google developers.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.420
ANDREW BROGDON: Flutter.io
docs and codelabs.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.780
POOJA BHAUMIK: Yes.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.500
Uh-huh.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.820
And there are a lot of GitHub
repositories out there,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.860
and a lot of other
tutorials in YouTube.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.670
And they all helped me a lot.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.930
I mean, I'm writing tutorials
on Flutter right now,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.225
so you can check them out
in Medium if you want to.

00:19:39.225 --> 00:19:40.350
ANDREW BROGDON: Absolutely.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.230
POOJA BHAUMIK: So, yeah.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.460
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.320
One of the problems we
have, as the DevRel team,

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.819
is sometimes it's hard to keep
up with the amount of content

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:47.200
being made by the community.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.700
You know?

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.950
That's why our GitHub
repo with samples

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.260
actually links out to
a number of samples

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.880
that our team didn't
create, we just

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.995
think are really,
really good, you know?

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:56.828
POOJA BHAUMIK: Yeah.

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:59.170
You should check out that,
because they have really

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.370
accumulated the best
articles and resources that's

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.350
possible for you
to learn Flutter.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.142
So check that out.

00:20:06.142 --> 00:20:07.047
[LAUGHS]

00:20:07.047 --> 00:20:09.630
WM LELER: And it's really great
having people in the community

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.380
writing articles.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.270
I remember at one point
where I felt like I

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.460
had to write all the articles.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.500
But then it got
to the point where

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.289
I was trying to read
all the articles that

00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:19.080
were being written.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.560
I've totally given up on that.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.740
There's so much coming out.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.320
POOJA BHAUMIK: Same here.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.861
I mean, in the beginning I used
to read all the articles that

00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:25.560
used to come.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.280
Now I think I've
missed out almost 50%.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.800
I mean, it's kind of like you're
all bookmarked, bookmarked,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.915
bookmarked.

00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:35.345
I'm like, when I have time,
OK, I'll read them then.

00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:37.470
ANDREW BROGDON: So, tell
us a little bit about what

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.310
you're working on right now.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.210
POOJA BHAUMIK: So right now,
it's not like a project,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.010
but I am going to
go back to India,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.870
and I'm going to give
a talk at a college

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.000
and tell them about Flutter.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.150
Because it's pretty, very, very
required for college people

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.270
to actually know about Flutter.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.920
Because you can actually
tell the employees,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.530
but it depends on the
companies, what they're using.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.270
But college students,
they are going

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.040
to graduate with that
knowledge, and they

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200
are going to tell other
people to try out Flutter.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.740
So let's target
the colleges first.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.040
As a college student myself, I'm
targeting the college students

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.000
in India.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.570
If you are wanting me to
talk about Flutter in any

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.170
of the college in India--

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:17.670
yeah.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.280
Hi.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.150
So, yes.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.920
That's what I'm going to work
on now, as soon as I go back

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.695
to India.

00:21:25.695 --> 00:21:25.960
ANDREW BROGDON: Wonderful.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.290
WM LELER: So I have-- well,
we're almost out of time,

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.820
but I have one more
quick question.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.280
So you watched the
keynote, right?

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.490
So what was your favorite
thing in the keynote?

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.960
POOJA BHAUMIK: The Square.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.140
The Square-- yes.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.640
I mean--

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:36.995
WM LELER: The puzzle?

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.495
POOJA BHAUMIK: I
was really shocked.

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:40.660
I was really shocked
that you are just

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.290
working with Square right now.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.220
And, yes, also the
two-dimensions thing.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.252
Oh my god.

00:21:47.252 --> 00:21:48.056
That was crazy.

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:48.458
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:48.957
Yeah.

00:21:48.957 --> 00:21:49.990
Yeah.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.660
POOJA BHAUMIK:
Honestly speaking,

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.035
this was really
the best keynote,

00:21:52.035 --> 00:21:55.235
because every five
minutes I was like, what?

00:21:55.235 --> 00:21:57.565
WM LELER: [LAUGHS] Well,
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:21:57.565 --> 00:21:58.440
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.199
They put a lot of
effort into it.

00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:02.240
So we're going to move on
to some more questions.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.840
Thank you so much for
sitting down with us.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.841
We really appreciate it.

00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:06.340
POOJA BHAUMIK:
Thanks so much, guys.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.490
You're doing a great job.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.980
WM LELER: Thanks for
letting us drag you up here.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.350
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.320
WM LELER: All
right, thanks a lot.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.600
ANDREW BROGDON: There you go.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.226
Right that way.

00:22:11.226 --> 00:22:12.599
And take the
microphone with you.

00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:13.350
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.670
ANDREW BROGDON: Excellent.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.750
Thank you so much.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.590
WM LELER: All right.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.410
ANDREW BROGDON: All
right, so we have--

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.130
WM LELER: Do you want to do
some livestream questions?

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:18.570
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.510
So we're going to take a
short break in a little while.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.968
And afterwards,
we're going to have

00:22:21.968 --> 00:22:24.110
Eric Seidel from the
engineering team, who you just

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.901
saw in the keynote.

00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:26.910
He's actually going
to sit down with us.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.201
But we have a little more time.

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:29.885
Let's take a few
questions from YouTube.

00:22:29.885 --> 00:22:30.780
You want to look
at the livestream?

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.030
WM LELER: Yeah, if
you want to do that.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.196
And while you're looking
up some questions on there,

00:22:34.196 --> 00:22:36.590
I have a couple more
that have come in.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.040
Actually, here's a good one,
because I can answer this one.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.300
We have a question from
Nebraska, from the US, says,

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.760
is there something similar
to build flavors in Android?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.130
And it's true.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.200
You can do build flavors.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.070
It's not really built into it.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.820
But, for example, one of the
developing companies that I

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.560
work with is called AppTree.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.600
And all of their stuff,
it comes in flavors.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.520
They actually have
an app which, they

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.560
build a flavor for
every single customer.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.750
So you can do--

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.800
that's pretty far out.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.200
ANDREW BROGDON: Wow.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.450
WM LELER: And they have--

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.329
I don't know, I'm
not even sure I

00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:11.870
can say how many
customers they have,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.910
because it's not
public information.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:19.220
But they build for
places like Stanford

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.270
or for companies like
McDonald's, they build an app.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.020
And they have to customize
it for every single customer.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.460
And they do that with flavors.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.185
So you can definitely do that.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:32.060
And the other thing
that's amazing about what

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.840
they do, they not only do that
on Android, they do that on iOS

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.235
and they do that
on their web app.

00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:39.110
So all three of them.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.000
Because they have
to deliver all three

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.830
to every customer,
and they have to have

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.340
a separate flavor for it.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.097
So it's definitely
possible to do.

00:23:46.097 --> 00:23:48.430
ANDREW BROGDON: They put out
some open-source code, too.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.440
AppTree does, right?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.080
WM LELER: They what?

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.530
ANDREW BROGDON: They put
out some open-source code

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.370
of various kinds, right?

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.616
WM LELER: Yeah.

00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:52.740
Yeah.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.300
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.570
WM LELER: They've written
a lot of articles.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:54.800
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.490
WM LELER: I'm not
sure if they've

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.320
written an article
about doing flavors yet,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.460
but I should bug them to
write something like that.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.440
ANDREW BROGDON: Maybe we
can talk them into it.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.579
WM LELER: Yeah, I hope so.

00:24:01.579 --> 00:24:02.870
Anyway, did you find something?

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.210
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah,
let's look at this.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.600
So we have some things in here.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.740
And let's take a look at this.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.347
So, when are you planning to
support AR or VR development?

00:24:15.347 --> 00:24:16.930
Greetings from the
Dominican Republic.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.642
Hey, cool.

00:24:17.642 --> 00:24:19.100
WM LELER: So when
are we going to--

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.474
augmented reality and--

00:24:20.474 --> 00:24:21.890
ANDREW BROGDON: I
think that one's

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.147
a little bit down the road.

00:24:23.147 --> 00:24:24.230
WM LELER: I think so, too.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.271
ANDREW BROGDON: I think
there's some other things

00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:27.710
sort of before that one.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.480
WM LELER: I mean,
part of the reason

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.030
for that is, so far
Flutter is really

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.460
concentrating on 2D graphics.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.790
And in order to
do AR, I mean, you

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.860
can do it with a certain
amount of 2D graphics,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.150
but it really works
better with 3D

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.290
because you do need to
be able to do perspective

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.500
and stuff like that.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.220
So I think that's probably
something that will happen.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.320
I'm just not sure when.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.950
It's not on our
roadmap right now.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.410
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
see what else we have.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.280
Can I integrate my existing
Android project with Flutter?

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.030
WM LELER: Can you?

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.630
ANDREW BROGDON: You can.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.850
Many people have done this.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.290
WM LELER: That's true.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.165
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah.

00:25:05.165 --> 00:25:07.500
So this is something that's
being worked on right now.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.720
You can go and look at
it, add to an application.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.640
A number of people with
larger applications

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.610
have found ways to
integrate a single Flutter

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.080
activity into their app.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.440
You can also have a
Flutter activity in Android

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.510
that launches a native activity,
you know, platform activity,

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.180
to show platform code that way.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.600
And similarly on iOS, you
can have a view control

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.417
that is doing Flutter launch
a platform on or vice versa.

00:25:33.417 --> 00:25:35.000
WM LELER: And backing
up a little bit,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.010
there's sort of two ways
to go about doing that.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.970
One is, I mean,
the question was,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.957
can you add Flutter to
an existing application?

00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:45.040
And you've talked to that.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.300
But actually, another
way to look at it

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.090
is that you can actually
convert the entire application

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.490
to be a Flutter
application but then

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.540
plug in native code from
both platforms into it.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.852
So you can either
do it as, all right,

00:25:58.852 --> 00:26:00.560
here's just a piece
of Flutter that we're

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.300
going to put in as a single
view, or you can say,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.770
OK, the whole thing is
Flutter, but we're going

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.550
to put a lot of native code.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.250
And they're both
good ways to do it.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.720
The latter is actually
easier in some ways,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.880
even though it sounds
like it would be harder.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.820
But it's easier
just because if you

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.710
have two separate
applications, like you

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.680
have an iOS and an Android app,
and you have to put Flutter

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.320
into both of them, you have to
do that in two different ways

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.090
and you no longer have a
cross-platform solution.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.390
So you're going to be
modifying two different code

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.760
bases at the same time.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.650
Whereas if you go the
other way, the code

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.740
that you haven't written
in Flutter stays the same.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.770
But you can just feed that
into a single application.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.396
So both work.

00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:46.270
That's probably more
detail than people need.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.127
But anyway--

00:26:47.127 --> 00:26:48.210
ANDREW BROGDON: That's OK.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.750
WM LELER: It's definitely
something you can do.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.624
ANDREW BROGDON: For more
information on this,

00:26:51.624 --> 00:26:53.590
you can check out the GitHub.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.380
flutter/flutter is
the repo with the SDK.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.845
And you can actually go in
and look at how Add to App

00:26:58.845 --> 00:26:59.470
is progressing.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.490
There's a number of
ways that they're

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.130
trying to make sure it's
possible, as easy as possible
