00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.600
For this project, let's see how fast we can
build a website from scratch. My goal .. start

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.280
to finish in 6 minutes flat.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.300
Some of you might remember, a few months ago that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.580
YouTube accidentally deleted
my entire channel and terminated my account.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.140
Thankfully, it's back online now, but obviously
we need a backup plan for you "King of Random"

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.560
fans in case of another emergency. With or
without Youtube, I'll keep making videos,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.579
but how are you gonna know when and where I post them? I've formed an inner circle,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.779
and you can become part of it by clicking
here.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.440
Now to setup a 6 minute website, let's start
by going to squarespace.com and clicking on

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.440
the button that says "get started". You can
see the first thing that pops up is a number

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.320
of templates that we could use to design our
webpage. And I'm gonna keep it simple by

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.629
going with a template called "Beatrice". Here
are some examples of what other people have

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.910
done with the layout, but let's just go ahead
and click "start with this design". If we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.150
enter a name, email, and password, that's
really about all we need to get this started.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.990
Now this next part should go fairly fast,
so don't try to keep up on details. Just sit

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.010
back and enjoy. With the timer started, we
can skip the intro video by hitting escape,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.550
then go to the main navigation bar on the
left, click the gear icon, and click to "make

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.240
a page like this". This is gonna be our
home page, so let's change the name, and the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.330
url to match, then click save. Now all you'd
really have to do is swap out your text and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.070
pictures with what's already here. But in
this case, I'd prefer to start with a blank

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.640
page, so let's just delete the items one by
one until everything's gone. Now that our

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.200
page is blank, why don't we make another one
by clicking "Add page", selecting a blank

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.060
page, and let's call this one "Videos". While
we're here, let's add one more page, and call

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.720
it "Contact". Ok, with that's saved, let's
go back to our home page and click on the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.970
"+" sign at the top. This opens a bunch of
item options, and the first thing we need

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.940
is a newsletter block. This will create our
mailing list for the inner circle. Let's change

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.420
the name, then click the storage tab so we
can connect it to a databasing service like

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.269
"MailChimp" or "Google Docs". I chose to use "Google Docs", and as you can see it's as easy

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.250
as creating a name for the database, and clicking
save. Now if we go to the top and click "view

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.359
page", it will ask us to save our work, and
here's what the webpage looks like so far.

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.310
Now check this out. If we click the pencil
at the bottom, we can highlight the footer

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.030
text, and paste in some custom information
in its place. Now if we save that, click the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.120
"X" and now click on the "paintbrush" icon,
we can access the "style mode". This means we

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.290
can edit the banner image, delete it, and
upload one of our own. There we go, much better

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.620
already. But I'm not a very big fan of this
site title covering the bottom of the banner.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.689
Unfortunately we can't delete it, but if we
click the "site title" properties, we can

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.879
adjust the line height down to 1 pixel, and
that pretty much gets rid of it. Now it's

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.180
hard to tell, but there's a yellowish background
image as well, and if we delete that, then

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.739
click on "site background", we can adjust
it to a custom background color. I'm going

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.400
with black. The only problem with that is
that the words are harder to read. To fix

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.120
that, let's adjust the text colors for the
navigation (active) text, the navigation (hover)

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.480
text, the standard navigation font, the main
body font, and the text color for the footer.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.549
I'm basically just changing the colors of
all the different words. and I'm sure you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.019
get the idea. Now you can see the mailing
list area is still pretty dark, so let's fix

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.260
that by scrolling to the bottom left, and
changing the "newsletter style" from "dark",

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.959
to "light". That's better already, but we
can also change the "newsletter background"

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.849
to a custom color of our choice, and while
we're at it, change the "button" color so

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.560
it's a little more prominent as well. Now
to tighten everything up, let's go to the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.719
"page padding scroll bar" and adjust the padding
level down to around 25 pixels, so it pulls

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.969
everything together. Now let's "X" out of
the style mode, and see how it looks. Ok cool.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.569
Now let's "escape" back to the edit menu,
click the left side gear icon, select "basic

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.840
information" and give our website a name.
Of course this one is for "The King of Random",

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.629
and we can customize it further by scrolling
down and uploading a logo into the "browser

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.099
icon" section. Next let's click the index
for "domains", and you can see this will give

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.760
us the option to customize our URL. In this
case I'm just going to call it "TKOR", but

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.650
that can be changed anytime you want. Now
if you look at the URL at the top, you should

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.750
see your icon, as well as your custom squarespace
URL. Ok cool, let's keep going.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.580
Let's try adding a page in the "not linked"
section, and choose the "gallery page" option.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.340
I'm gonna name this one "video gallery",
and although this page will be invisible to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.510
our visitors, it is still very valuable to
our page. Let me show you why.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.510
When I click "Add images or video", "select
video", then paste the URL for one of my YouTube

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.660
uploads, you can see it automatically populates
the video title, thumbnail, and sets the image

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.140
overlay. Now when we save it, a little video
thumbnail pops up on the unlinked page. I'm

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.820
gonna add 7 more videos just like this,
and I'll speed the process just for convenience,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.080
because I'm sure you already get it. At this
point, let's head back to the home page, click

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.600
the "+" sign, under the mailing list, and
select to add a line. This is mainly, just

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.590
for looks. Now let's click the "+" sign again,
and this time choose "gallery", "use existing

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.400
gallery", and select the video gallery we
just created. Now if we go to "design", and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.830
click "gallery design", there's an option
for a customizable grid layout. That looks

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.760
pretty awesome, but watch this. If we add
another gallery the exact same way, but this

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.800
time keep the "slideshow" option, and click
the "auto play" feature, watch what happens.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.400
We can drag and drop the slideshow gallery
down beside the thumbnail grid gallery, and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.610
it automatically reformats the layout. Let's
save that, and view the page now. Here we've

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.800
got a clean looking signup page, with a video
slideshow, and video thumbnails set right

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.060
beside it. Nice. Ok to finish up the other
two pages, let's click the gear icon at the

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.690
bottom and quickly edit the "videos" page.
This time when we add a new block option,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.590
let's scroll down until we find the block
for inserting "code". All we need to do is

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.870
delete the code that's already there, and
paste this free embed code, I got from tint.com.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.250
You can see that if we view the page now,
all of my recent YouTube videos are automatically

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.340
populated into a grid. But they are a little
off center. Let's fix that in the style mode

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.500
by grabbing onto the side of the page, and
setting the page width to 1100 pixels. Now

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.780
you can see the video list is adjusted so
it's perfectly centered. And this page is

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.020
done. Lastly , let's hit escape, and click
to edit our "contact" page. This is gonna

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.380
be as simple as scrolling down to find
the option for creating a "form". I'm gonna

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.710
call this one "contact", then deselect
it from sending emails, and instead, sync

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.850
it up with my Google Docs. Now let's see what
this is going to look like. Click "view page",

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.940
"save", and there's our contact form. So there
you have it. In under 6 minutes we have a

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.340
website with a built-in registration, for
my private mailing list. Not to mention a

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.600
few of my favorite projects, all my newest
posts, and a contact page. Everything else

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.190
from here on in, is just supplemental, and
you can see how easy it would be, to add a

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.400
page for blogs, photo galleries, or even making an online store. 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.320
By the way, if you haven't joined my mailing

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.770
list yet, now is the time to do it. I've got
a lot of prizes I'm gonna start randomly

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.770
giving away, and of course it doesn't' cost
you anything to be a part of it. Well that's

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.620
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
