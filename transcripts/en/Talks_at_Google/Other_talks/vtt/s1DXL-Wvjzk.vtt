00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.830
&gt;&gt;Mina: : Dr. Turek is director of The Turek
Clinic, a men's health clinic in San Francisco.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.430
He is a former professor of urology, obstetrics
and gynecology at the UCSF and held the Academy

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.840
of Medical Educators Endowed Chair in Urology
Education.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.700
Dr. Turek attended, I think I keep saying
that wrong,Turek? Sorry. Attended Yale College

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.060
followed by Stanford University Medical School.
After Urology residency at the University

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.300
of Pennsylvania, Dr. Turek was fellowship
trained at Baylor College of Medicine.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.489
His 175 publications include basic research
that focuses on germ and stem cell genetics

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.039
and epidemiologic studies of men's sexual
and reproductive health problems. He's on

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.960
the advisory board of the National Men's Health
Care Network and the NIH Reproductive Medicine

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.510
Network.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.059
He is also the editor of The Reproductive
Volume of Netter's Images and oversees an

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.770
active blog on men's health issues. He recently
founded a volunteer medical clinic, powered

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.000
by retired physicians for the working uninsured.
And with that, I'll introduce Dr. Turek.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.060
[applause]

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.600
&gt;&gt;Dr. Paul Turek: Thank you Mina. I want to
thank, are you mic'd OK? OK. Thank you for

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.420
having me. Thank you HR for bringing me to
Google. It's my first time. I'm very excited.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.310
And I wanna teach a little bit about your
life. So, if you have. This might be a sensitive

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.300
lecture, so if you do have questions, you're
welcome to send it to a hashtag or tweet at

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.280
theturekclinic. If you wanna do that, we'll
answer those for you. If you want a copy of

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.310
the slides, do likewise please.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.070
Mina went over this with Google Health, which
I think actually is a great initiative. Google

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.500
Health, one of the problems in men's health,
and I'm gonna generalize to men's health,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.530
is that men don't get great care and Google
Health allows you to own it more.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.200
So, I'm a real fan of and would like to get
involved with Google Health on that level.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.180
So, why was I asked to speak? Well, I am a
micro-surgeon and I am a urologist and I am

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.870
a Fellowship trained men's health specialist
and I'm pretty well known in the field. But

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.031
that's not why I was asked.

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:31.150
I was asked to speak because I care. I care
about you. I care about the kind of care that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.780
men are getting in America right now. I have
developed inventions to find sperm from a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.569
rock in fertile men and get them pregnant,
help them get pregnant and lead better lives.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.660
I have patented inventions. We have stem cell
technology coming out where we can take a

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.730
skin biopsy potentially in the future, making
it into a stem cell, making it into a sperm

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.970
in a dish. So, we get that little kid with
leukemia who can't conceive when he's an adult

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.350
and you can give him the option of fatherhood.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.080
So, there's a lot of wild stuff going on.
I am developing an artificial testicle to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.780
help that happen with some great scientists.
So these are the things I'm working on. And

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.410
I also go into the government a lot. They
asked me to come to Washington in the middle

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.940
of winter.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.459
And it's cold and windy there. And they say,
"Where is men's health going and what should

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.900
we be doing?" And I'll give them my opinion.
And I'll give you some of that opinion today

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.440
because it needs to change. Because essentially,
the problem is that men are underserved.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:38.190
Men your age are underserved. So, who has
a car? Most of you. Who gets the oil changed

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:46.610
on their car regularly? OK. Who's been to
a doctor in the last one year? Wow. OK. Didn't

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.610
work.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.489
[laughter]

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.630
So, typically, men take better care of their
cars than they do the bodies. And you guys

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.980
are proving me wrong, but so, congratulations
is what I would say to that. But men have

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.260
issues and typically they don't get great
care for those issues.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.629
And they don't reach out very well. So, men
are terrible at reaching out, unlike women.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.710
They do not have a monthly biology to respond
to. So, they don't get great care for lots

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:19.370
of reasons. And I'm just here to say that
I care and I have a program for you. So, this

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.050
is the traditional view of men's health in
America.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:29.470
There's sexual health, which is an orbiting,
an orb, next to the mothership or mother planet

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.690
of overall health and they're relatively disconnected.
So, I look at it as rotating around overall

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.470
health as this isolated orb of sexual health,
which is actually a lot of the issues of young

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.150
men, their sexual health issues.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.810
But, and that's what's been going on. And
that has fragmented care for men in America.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.580
Because what happens is there's no ownership.
So, an internist might take care of A, and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.450
endocrinologist B, a dermatologist C, but
no one really owns the package of men, unlike

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.699
a gynecologist who does the breast exam and
does a lot of the typical things that women

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.880
need periodically.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.330
So, that's the problem in America. There's
no ownership of care of men. So it's all fragmented.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.000
And I think that needs to change. And we're
doing that. And what needs to change is we

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.880
need to bring sexual health into the planet
of the whole planet or realm of overall health.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.080
And I'm gonna prove to you today that it belongs
there; that you're sexual health is as important

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.150
as your overall health and is integral to
overall health. And you've got a lot of initiatives

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.330
here at Google. You heard a mindfulness talk
yesterday. Stress reduction, they feed you,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.520
they encourage you to stand.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.889
The ergonomics team will help you stand instead
of sitting, 'cause you live longer that way.

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.060
Lots of things are going on. It's beautiful.
This is what we want. So what is sexual health?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.330
It's kind of blurry, but WHO, the World Health
Organization, calls it the integration of

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.180
the physical, emotional, intellectual and
social aspects of sexual being.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.979
That's really it. So, here's a cloud tag I
put together on the topics I wanna talk about

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:19.280
under the realm of sexual health and their
relative frequency. So, ejaculation disorders

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.590
are really number one for young men. And sexual
desire disorders, libido, is really number

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.590
two.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.590
And you're gonna learn more about those than
you ever cared to learn today. But these are

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.750
important things that matter to men and affect
their quality of life. So, first start off,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.350
how is a man like a vintage Maserati? So in
this crowd it's different because you actually

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.850
probably take care of yourselves as well as
a vintage Maserati.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.991
And I was gonna offer you, if no one raised
their hands when I said do you go to the doctor

00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:56.259
once a year, have you been in the last year,
I would have said, how many of you would sign

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.900
up for my men's health tune-up if I put it
up on Google Offerings when it comes out?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.979
But you guys are already doing a good job.
But sign up for it anyway. So, like the Geico

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.360
caveman, OK? So, men are immortal. You're
immortal. You hardly ever think about things.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.979
You take great abuse, long hours, fluorescent
lights, sitting, over-clocked computer.

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:27.139
You have no signs of failure basically. And
but when you do fall, you fall hard. So it

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.870
takes a lot to keep you sick, to keep you
at home, but you stay home and it's usually

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.000
a big hit. A vintage Maserati, when it runs,
it runs hard. They run really well. It gobbles

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
up terrible roads.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.110
It can eat miles and miles. It's really fast.
But the gauges may not work, so it's hard

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.630
to tell if something's going wrong. And the
metal may bend quietly and then break, which

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.020
is similar to man. So, these are pretty good
analogies. And you'll see me running through

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.680
the caveman analogy and the old car analogy
quite a bit, because I do think that everyone

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.680
needs a tune-up.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.039
Now, in this talk, I've got these blog posts
written. That's on turekonmenshealth.com.

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:09.150
It's a blog I write weekly and this one's
called "The Sound and the Fury," but if you

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.880
see that, then it'll talk a lot about that
and expand on it for you. It's on turekonmenshealth.com.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.389
And love your input.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:25.260
So let's talk about erections. Near and dear
to everyone's heart at your age. This is Massachusetts

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.560
male aging study, which is impressive because
it showed us that it was done on a cross-sectional

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.639
population of men in Massachusetts and all
different kinds of men.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:41.770
And it showed that basically, erectile dysfunction
occurs in everybody. Almost in every age group

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:47.250
you'll find erectile dysfunction, trouble
with erections. And the second thing is it

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:53.810
goes up as you get older. So in this graph,
white means basically no problem and yellow,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.959
orange, and red mean there is a problem.

00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:59.660
And you can see the proportion of the graph
with yellow, orange, and red goes way up as

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.459
you go down on the graph. And so, even at
age 40, which is when the study started, there

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:10.440
are half the men were having problems with
erections. Half. And you can extrapolate that

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440
to 30.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.660
It's pretty linear. You can see at 30 there
are gonna be people. too. So this is an epidemic.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.800
This is not minor stuff. This is an epidemic.
So, let's go over the erection a little bit.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.410
I'm sorry if you're eating lunch and seeing
this slide, but this is a cross-section of

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.410
the member.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:35.230
And this is how it's built. So, there's an
artery down the middle and the erection starts

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.000
by the artery dilating. So, from left to right,
you'll see it dilate. And then that fills

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.360
these lacunar spaces in the penis which give
you tumescence, or engorgement. And those

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.440
are called sinusoids.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.100
And then, the sinusoids when they fill, slap
the vein shut against the wall of the penis

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.640
and close off, or cork off, the flow of blood
out of the penis so it stays in. So it's very

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.490
mechanical, a very mechanical system. And
that's called venous compression. So, but

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.570
I like this analogy.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:12.930
I think you should think about it as a sink.
So the arterial inflow is the faucet. And

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:19.420
the venous outflow and the sinusoids are the
sink itself. And the drain is the venous leak,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.500
are the veins that drain. So, to get a good
erection, you would follow the green curve

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.970
there, where you get,.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.920
it quickly fills up and it stays full. That's
a sink with a good seal and a good inflow.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.290
But a lot of problems, a lot of times you
may have problems with the drain. So, you

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.990
have a kitchen sink and the drain's not tight
and you get the yellow curve shows an erection

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.460
that occurs quickly, but falls quickly because
it's draining out.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.960
That's very common. And the red curve is an
erection that takes a while to get because

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.339
the faucet's weak, but once you get it you're
OK. And those are three typical patterns that

00:10:56.339 --> 00:11:01.950
demonstrate the mechanics of this. But what
else is going on with the penis? So, that's

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.680
the mechanical issues, but the erection is
not an isolated event.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.610
The problems with erections is not just a
simple mechanical problem, because men with

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:19.230
erectile dysfunction we now know, this is
established science, have twice the, . in

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:25.260
their 40s or so, have twice the risk of heart
attacks as they get older than men who don't.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:31.279
And that risk, increased risk of heart disease
with an erection problem as a younger person

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:36.310
is the same risk as a smoker or someone in
your family who has a heart problem.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:44.610
Same risk. That's pretty important. I call
that a biomarker. Women have periods and they

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.800
have cycles and they go to doctors when they're
irregular. Men with an erection problem, bing

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.170
bing bing bing, that's a sign. That's a biomarker.
Something not right, yet it has to do with

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.150
mechanics, but there's some larger issues
going on. Yes.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:03.850
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: inaudible question
from audience

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:13.250
&gt;&gt;Dr. Paul Turek: Wait. I'll get to it. "Anybody
who believes that the way to a man's heart

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:20.040
is through his stomach flunked geography."
OK. It's not. So the answer to your question

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.110
is here.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:27.810
These are conditions that are well-established
and influence erections. So, up here, this

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.930
corner, the upper left-hand corner are the
metabolic syndrome risk factors, right? Obesity,

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.760
heart disease, cholesterol, blood pressure,
diabetes. That's the metabolic syndrome features.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.370
They're all, throughout this talk, they'll
be all in the upper left-hand corner. Sleep.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.700
Stress. Stress is a Type A personality, except
there aren't any Type A personalities here

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:56.320
I'm sure. Medications. Organ failure. Low
testosterone. Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol is

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320
fabulous.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.380
So alcohol, you see these young guys come
in and they have a problem with intercourse

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.530
or whatever. And what happens is you're on
a date. You're at the bar and you pound a

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:12.589
couple of stouts. And you see a woman, or
man, and you like them. And you say, "You

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:14.250
know, I'm gonna say something to them."

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:20.209
But you need those beers to get it done, because
what alcohol does is it's socially uninhibiting.

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:25.780
So, you're pretty nervous about it. You'll
get relaxed. Your libido, you sex drive, will

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.089
go up and you'll say, "I'm gonna do it." And
you go over there and it works out really

00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:31.589
well.

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:37.740
And later that evening, you go to use the
device, and you'll have the activity and it's

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.670
numb as anything. Because alcohol is a local
anesthetic. It's an anesthetic. That's what

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:48.320
we gave people when we were cutting off arms
and legs in the Civil War before we had anesthesia.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.990
Alcohol and a bullet. It's great. So it actually
numbs the signal and it's sometimes almost

00:13:54.990 --> 00:14:00.600
impossible to keep an erection if you have
a lot of alcohol on board because your sensations

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.860
are changed. So, it's a two-edged sword. But
this is well-established stuff.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.660
So you can see, this very much a part of overall
health. An erection problem is very much part

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.589
of overall health. And when I see a man and
I'm pretty convinced it's a real erection

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:21.180
problem, at the Turek Clinic, what I will
do is I will evaluate him for metabolic syndrome.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.920
I will do those things because we need to
own it. And I'm not gonna send him to a medical

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:32.560
doctor to do it. I'm gonna do it and take
care of it and try to get that under control.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.029
And taking care of those risk factors will
improve the erection. So, men with heart disease,

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:44.889
it's all one big blood vessel, but heart disease
patients who have poor erections, if you can

00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:47.430
help their heart disease out, they'll get
better erections.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:53.100
So you can actually improve things. So, let
me summarize. Erections are common. Erectile

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.981
dysfunction is very common. Your age: 31,
32, 40. It can be a marker of heart disease

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:04.600
if it's real and there's a way to figure out
whether it's really an organic problem, or

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.260
it's just a stress-related situational problem.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.730
And that's really easy to differentiate with
one visit. And then, erectile dysfunction

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.899
is related to overall health. That's really
important. So you need to take care of your

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:21.170
overall health. You need to eat well. You
need to sleep well. You need to exercise.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.440
You need to go to the massage and yoga classes
here.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.740
You need to stand when you're at your desk.
You need to do the things that Google Health

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.269
is trying to convince you to do. And they're
doing a great job of it. And take ownership.

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:39.410
Let's talk about something more common than
erection problem, which is a sex drive problem.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:44.070
There's very little science here, but clinically
I treat this all the time. It's probably the

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:50.281
most common thing a young man would come in
for besides an infertility problem. What is

00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:57.279
it? The desire to have sex. It's basically,
it's been called an urge that's instinctual,

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.790
biological, or primitive.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.399
That's how basic this definition is. What's
true about it, I think clinically, is that

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:09.430
levels vary widely among individuals. So often
a couple gets together and the one partner

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:14.699
and the other partner have very different
ideas of how often they should have sex. And

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:15.699
you'll see this in a marriage.

00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:21.050
It's very different. And that is one of the
hardest parts. It's harder than the dishwasher

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.639
thing where you're putting dishes away and
you say, "Am I gonna do this for the rest

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:28.800
of my life? Am I gonna be putting the dishes
away?" You know, as the guy in the relationship.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.910
It's one of those things. How do you solve
that problem? Well, it kind of works itself

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.209
out. Kinda works itself out, but you do have
to deal with it because people are different,

00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:41.790
women from men, men from each other, etc.
But within an individual the pattern is pretty

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.820
characteristic of the sex drive, the frequency
of wanting it, the desire, the urge.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:53.199
There can be times of deadlines and stress
where it might not be as high. And it's not

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:58.620
linked to testosterone levels. So, the guy
in the porno flick who wants it all the time

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:04.010
doesn't have a higher testosterone than the
guy somewhere else who isn't in that situation.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.639
And the question is can oysters improve it?
And for that, you'll have to go to the blog.

00:17:08.639 --> 00:17:17.419
Oyster, men, sex. So, here are two men with
their patterns of sex drives. So, the man

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:22.839
on the top in the green basically has a high
sex drive and it's constant. The man on the

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:28.209
lower part is lower sex drive and it varies
a little bit, but it's got a pattern to it.

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:33.570
And those are both normal. Those are both
normal. What's not normal for me is when a

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:39.859
man has a pattern that is changing. And changing
can be it was high and then literally last

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:44.059
August, middle of the month, all of a sudden,
it dropped through the roof. It dropped to

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:45.450
the floor.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.309
That would be abnormal. I jump on that one.
I look for an issue there. And the second

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:55.049
one would be it varies a little bit, but it's
getting a lot worse over time. And that's

00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:05.509
something that should be pursued medically.
Why? The usual suspects. The usual suspects.

00:18:05.509 --> 00:18:10.460
Overall health, right? There's our metabolic
component in the upper left-hand corner. Low

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.289
testosterone is a part of this. Stress is
a huge part of this. Sleep is a huge part

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:22.320
of this. Alcohol and drugs, etc. Travel, circadian
stress can all affect this. And prolactin.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.019
The guy who dropped off the face of the earth
with his sex drive, there's a good chance

00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:32.259
you're gonna find a benign brain tumor in
that guy if you check his blood test for prolactin.

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:38.289
That's not a cancer. It doesn't need treatment.
That's a health problem. So, I respect libido.

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:45.739
I respect it. And you should respect it and
try to own it. Let's talk about sleep. So,

00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:49.909
what does sleep affect? Well, sleep's really
important. Does it kill you not to sleep?

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:55.639
Probably not, but there are studies going
on that show that mortality is lower in men

00:18:55.639 --> 00:18:58.389
who don't sleep well.

00:18:58.389 --> 00:19:02.330
Same with low testosterone and the same with
stress. They're not strong. They're epidemiologic

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:10.220
studies. But it does affect lots of things
on this graph. So, obesity, your eat/dietary

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.619
habits, your stress, testosterone, diabetes,
high blood pressure is a stressor.

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:18.659
So, let's talk about sleep. This is from the
National Sleep Foundation. It's an ongoing

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:26.229
annual survey on the web and the graph shows
the number of hours slept per night in 2010

00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:32.190
by people in America. So half the people in
America who answered the survey say they're

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.789
not great sleepers.

00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:41.210
10 to 15 percent say they never get good sleep.
They get an average of 6 hours and 30 minutes

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.540
of sleep. How many hours did you get last
night? 6 hours and 30 minutes of sleep. What's

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.080
considered physiologically important for an
adult is 7 to 9 hours.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.119
For most. Everyone is different. Good sleepers,
if you looked at that subgroup, they tend

00:19:55.119 --> 00:20:02.340
to get an hour more than the sleepers who
aren't sleeping well. And every generation,

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:08.019
humans, get one hour less sleep a night. Welcome
to the Information Age.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:15.549
Stay connected. So, wake is the new sleep.
Short sleep has been linked to, definitively

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:21.679
as that graph showed, depression, obesity,
heart disease, and attention disorders. So,

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:26.429
it's subtle but it's real. Sleep is important.
What do you do about sleep then? And what

00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:28.409
do you do about the sex drive and sleep?

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:37.940
Less caffeine, less alcohol. Those are disrupters
of rhythms and things. Less Red Bull. Exercise.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.059
Take those bicycles from building to building
on campus. Eat dinner early. Don't fill late

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:51.789
in the day so your metabolisms change. And
relax after work. So, that would be an e-book,

00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:54.159
a tub, something where you kinda get your
body down.

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:58.809
Exercise would be great. And keeping a sleep
schedule is really important. And anyone with

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:04.669
kids will know kids smile in the morning if
they're on a schedule. They look great in

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:08.809
the morning. I mean, if you keep them off
their schedule, your life is a mess. It's

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.809
the same with you.

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:14.580
You're basically a big kid. And I mean, basically
your body does better on a schedule. So, if

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.070
here's a Saturday and you always get up at
seven or eight, get up at seven or eight o'clock

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.629
and then go back to sleep. But wake up like
normal. Keep on that schedule and then maybe

00:21:24.629 --> 00:21:27.049
go down a little bit afterwards to sleep in.

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:32.029
But it's not bad to do that. So it's really
important. Olympic athletes know this. Anyone

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:38.820
who practices anything at high level microsurgery,
it's all about schedule. I mean, I do surgery

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.789
on things that you can't see by eye. And so,
I don't go play tennis and pull my shoulder

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:48.809
the night before a microsurgery case because
if I'm in pain, that causes a tremor.

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:54.440
If I have a tremor, that's not as good a procedure
for me. So, you have to take care of things.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.230
Sleep aids and medications, I put them at
the bottom. Not a first line approach to things,

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:04.139
but they can help enormously. And there's
a nice blog called "No Sex, Get Some Sleep:

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:05.229
How it can improve your sex life."

00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:11.279
I actually wrote one to the royal couple.
And I said I know the invitation probably

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:15.619
got lost in the mail, but I'll give you some
advice anyway, William.

00:22:15.619 --> 00:22:17.259
[laughter]

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:21.619
Get some sleep, you guys. You got a busy life,
but take care of yourselves. So, it's one

00:22:21.619 --> 00:22:30.559
of those blogs. Stress. Central. Central to
your life. Central to your sexual life. Central

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:35.379
to your overall health. It affects almost
everything. OK. And is affected by things.

00:22:35.379 --> 00:22:37.200
So, what about libido and stress?

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.320
So, here you are, the Geico caveman and you're,
and I have no relationship to Geico by the

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.700
way, you're the Geico caveman and your body--.
When were we cavemen? Two hundred thousand

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:55.309
years ago? The Paleocene era? And your nervous
system is basically identical to that.

00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:59.409
But your stressors are not woolly mammoths
chasing you anymore. So when you're chased

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:03.990
by a woolly mammoth, what do you think happens
to your erection? It's gone 'cause you gotta

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.399
get out of there. OK? All right, what happens
to your sex drive? Is that a time to have

00:23:08.399 --> 00:23:09.859
sex? No.

00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:15.350
Get out. OK? You have the same nervous system.
So what's your stressor? There are no woolly

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:25.309
mammoths. So, ours are physical. So, long
work days, sleep/wake cycles, emotional stressors.

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:30.869
We have financial stressors, especially in
the Bay Area. And travel stress.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:35.409
Travel is a great form of stress. You're traveling
to Europe all the time, Google London, that

00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:40.399
can be a problem because your clock is not
resetting. You have a pineal gland that likes

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:45.909
a rhythm. And that changes all the levels
of things. So, you should know your woolly

00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:49.690
mammoths on this situation.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.539
So what do you do? So, that is the sympathetic
nervous system and I just saw a great poster

00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:59.469
out here in your lobby. Massage. Great for
your parasympathetic nervous system. I thought,

00:23:59.469 --> 00:24:03.649
[chuckles] "God, they know the names of the
nervous systems. That's great." I never see

00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:05.669
that anywhere else.

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:09.960
It's not relax. It's like it's great for your
parasympathetic nervous system at Google.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960
[laughter]

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.741
OK. So this is the sympathetic, . OK, I'll
talk to you that way. This is the sympathetic

00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:19.340
nervous system. All right? So, this is the
fight or flight. That's the stress one. No

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.590
woolly mammoths, but whatever they are, they
may be small. You may not even know them.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:28.639
But you want the parasympathetic nervous system
and that's how you get it exactly--massage,

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:34.349
exercise, acupuncture, or yoga. Men are terrible
at figuring out if they're stressed or not.

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:39.289
They're terrible. I have to ask them things
like, "How many times do you wake up at night

00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:42.129
worried about something at work?"

00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:45.620
That's the kind of question and that's an
extreme example of it. But that's how men

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:53.249
gauge it. But these are fabulous ways to reduce
your stress. Get your body tired. So, more

00:24:53.249 --> 00:24:59.299
profound and stressful than libido and erections
in a lot of couples is infertility, in people

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:01.169
your age, especially because it involves a
partner.

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:05.019
So, that's an important thing to talk about
as a sexual health issue. And it's defined

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:10.440
as the inability to conceive after a year.
However you wanna define it. Whatever position

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.020
you want. One year. And it's a very simple
evaluation at the Turek Clinic. We do it all

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.020
the time.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.601
One visit and maybe a phone call. OK? You
do a personal family history, 220 question

00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:30.200
questionnaire, a good physical exam like a
doctor does, a semen analysis and then potentially

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.750
a hormone evaluation. That's just a picture
of the room that we collect semen in at work,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.200
which is taken after Google.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.600
It's a Wi-Fi, cordless, [audience laughs]
insulated, very efficient. It's been in a

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.679
couple magazines. And there's a play written
after it called "Sperm Warfare," which is

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:52.210
gonna be made into a movie. And it's very
much a headache movie because you watch and

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.539
it's all the problems that could happen to
a guy in a collection room who can't get it

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:56.539
done.

00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:59.139
Like, the women, wife, or partner is calling
him and saying, "Come on. Is it done? Is it

00:25:59.139 --> 00:26:03.570
done? And the phone's in there." And the nurse
comes through and he says, "Should I ask her

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.289
to help?" And then all these things and then
he says to her, "You know. Maybe you just

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:08.289
want me for my DNA.

00:26:08.289 --> 00:26:11.850
I really don't wanna do this. You just want
me for my DNA." But anyway, it's a great little

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.299
show. It'll probably be coming out soon. But
if you asked me what's the most important

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:20.419
thing, everyone would say it's gotta be the
semen analysis, right? No. It's not. It's

00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:22.529
the personal and family history.

00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:28.429
Semen analysis, unless it's zero, is irrelevant,
almost irrelevant. It's really the history

00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:37.739
of that patient. So, why is that important?
Because look at this, the usual suspects.

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:43.399
Look what underlies male infertility. There's
very little difference between this and erections.

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:49.470
The metabolic syndrome group is up there and
it's Building 41 here. You have heart disease,

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.080
testosterone, stress, sleep, all of it is
all part of it and that's all part of the

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.880
personal history. That's really important.
So your infertility could be due to stress.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.229
It could be due to other mechanical problems.

00:27:00.229 --> 00:27:05.929
It could be due to medical illness. It's not
an orb rotating some other place. It's part

00:27:05.929 --> 00:27:15.240
of your health. It's not a separate problem.
So, what's my advice? You make a thousand

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:22.179
sperm per heartbeat. That's busy, right? That's
busy. A thousand sperm per heartbeat. [snaps

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:25.999
fingers] A thousand. Two thousand. Three thousand.
Almost like your income here.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:29.729
[laughter]

00:27:29.729 --> 00:27:34.429
Testicles, they wanna run fast. This is an
engine. It's an engine and it's running hard

00:27:34.429 --> 00:27:40.049
all the time. What you can do to it is bring
it down. So, all these things slow it down.

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:45.339
It's like diluting the gas or something, flatten
the tires. You do something to the car to

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:46.609
slow it down.

00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:54.519
It wants to run fast. It needs to run fast.
You're built for this. So, have respect for

00:27:54.519 --> 00:28:02.019
small things in great numbers, like ants,
sperm. Eat well. Sleep well. Exercise. Reduce

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:07.570
your stress. The mantra. The mantra of Google
Health, the mantra here. Treat your body well

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.570
and keep the engine running.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.889
Does anyone know what kind of engine that
is? Anyone a car guy?

00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:14.289
[Audience member responds to question inaudibly]

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:18.159
&gt;&gt;Dr. Paul Turek: There you go. There you
go. You know, I like it 'cause they show it

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:22.970
off. You should show off the parts. It's a
mechanical thing, show it off. Everyone covers

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:28.200
it with plastic now. It's not the way to do
it. So, there's another thing about infertility

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:34.340
that I've been very interested in the past
15 years as a researcher is that I think it's

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.009
good to know about it because it's a biomarker.

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:42.049
Like erections are a biomarker of health.
Semen analysis is a biomarker of health. It

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:46.619
gets treatable, so it can reveal underlying
conditions. Those conditions can be treatable

00:28:46.619 --> 00:28:51.179
and should be treated in some situations.
And you can avoid technology, like in vitro

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:54.279
fertilization test tube baby and that stuff.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:58.849
And it may be a window into future health.
It may be a window and it may be a true biomarker.

00:28:58.849 --> 00:29:04.609
So, we did a study where we looked at the
ability of infertile men to repair their DNA.

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:09.250
Here's the car analogy all over again. You
have a car. You drive it to work.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.309
You drive it home. You go in and all those
dents you pick up from the parking lot, when

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:18.070
it's in the garage those go away. It gets
fixed up overnight and it comes out the next

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:22.320
day shiny and clean. That's what your body
does a million times a day. You get exposed

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.139
to sun, etc., and your body repairs its DNA
breaks.

00:29:27.139 --> 00:29:31.210
If it couldn't do it, you'd have cancer. Skin
cancer, eye cancer, all that stuff. That's

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.649
the two-hit theory of cancer. You can't repair
the second hit. You can't repair the hit that

00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:41.119
occurred with the first. So, you have these
systems in place called DNA polymerase, nucleotide

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:45.731
excision repair, DNA mismatch repair, and
they take the dents out of your DNA every

00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:46.731
day.

00:29:46.731 --> 00:29:51.269
OK? And there's some mice that you can knock
out some of these genes that control these

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:57.080
things, mismatch repair genes, and you can
make them and make transgenic mice and you

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.729
look at these mice and a couple papers came
out ten years ago where they made this great

00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:04.269
knock out and they looked at it and got cancer.

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:07.480
So the knock out mouse got cancer. And they
said, "Great. Now we have a model for colon

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.899
cancer." But the problem was they were also
infertile. So we looked at these at journal

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:17.830
club at UCSF and said, "That's odd." So, the
first manifestation was the infertility and

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.529
then they got cancer 'cause they had this
problem.

00:30:20.529 --> 00:30:24.149
So that's a problem for transgenic. You spend
a million dollars to make a mouse with a gene

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:28.020
that's missing and you can't reproduce it.
So what do you do? You write a ton of papers

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.529
about the infertility. So they did. And we
saw these pictures of their testicles, the

00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:35.841
biopsies, and I said, "God, I have guys just
like that."

00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:42.570
They look just like that. So, we took the
guys who had testicle biopsies that looked

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:47.820
like these mice and got their blood and got
their sperm and did all this stuff. And we

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.089
looked at them very carefully and we looked
at the source of the problem, which is called

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:53.089
meiosis.

00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:58.589
Remember meiosis? High school? Biology, maybe
college? Chromosomes get together, they recombine,

00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:02.650
then they leave and that's a new individual.
It's different from mitosis, which is the

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.330
rest of your body, which is don't make a mistake,
don't change, let the gametes do the changing.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:13.730
Evolution is all about your gametes. So, we
looked at the fidelity of the process of these

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:18.460
men versus normal men. And what we're finding
is, you can't see these, but there's little

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:25.129
yellow nodules, dots, on these chromosomes
that are painted with stains. And some people

00:31:25.129 --> 00:31:27.519
are missing those dots, or the dots aren't
made well.

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:32.889
And those dots are recombination nodules that
repair problems. So, those are the nodules

00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:37.059
that go in and pull the dent out, the suction
cup that pulls the dent out of your car at

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:42.629
night. And then it says, "OK, we're fine.
Let's keep going." And they had faulty meiosis.

00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:48.320
So, they were bad. So we said, "Oh, my God."
So it came out in The Economist, wrote an

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.649
article about this paper we published and
said, "Are you telling me that these guys

00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:59.149
are all gonna get cancer?" Are we passing
off men with infertility as cancer farms?

00:31:59.149 --> 00:32:00.889
Are they gonna have kids with cancer?

00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:07.459
I said, "We don't know." But quality control
is very high in this system. So I don't really

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:13.940
worry about it. But then, ten years later,
a great fellow came into the department who

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.419
was an epidemiologist and we said, "We have
a fabulous database of infertility patients

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:23.459
in California of 55 thousand or 40 thousand
in a fabulous cancer registry."

00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:28.459
So we did a really nice epidemiologic study
and we just looked at, over 30 years, the

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:33.570
guys who were infertile. And it was based
on a semen analysis. And we said, "Are they

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:39.469
higher risk for cancer if they're infertile,
and if infertility is due to a male factor?"

00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:40.469
And we did.

00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:46.950
We found it. So, in this study, we found that
all men, the standard incidence ratio just

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:54.300
means relative to the population of healthy
Californians at the time. It's 30% higher,

00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:00.570
but not significant, this crosses one. So,
all men in the study, all part of infertile

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:06.789
couples, their rate of cancer, testicular
cancer, after infertility, this is later disease,

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:09.879
not the same time, later disease.

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:13.389
But if they had a male factor infertility
that was three-fold higher, and if they didn't

00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:17.799
have a male factor infertility, so the infertility
was a female issue, then it was the same.

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:21.409
So, that's a nice control. There's a control
and there's a control. Negative controls.

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:23.529
And cancer was three-fold higher.

00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:28.059
Perfectly consistent with European data. First
data in America that was real. And then we

00:33:28.059 --> 00:33:32.919
took a negative cancer, like prostate cancer,
which is late in life, same thing. It was

00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:37.591
two-fold higher. And I'm like, "Now what do
we do?" So, what's going on? I don't know

00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:42.059
what's going on, but this worries me and it
means that infertility may be a biomarker.

00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:47.389
So, here you go on your life. You start out
here, born at a young age, spend some time

00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:54.929
at Microsoft, Facebook's old, you come to
Google. And then maybe something else happens,

00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:59.320
like infertility. And the question is what
else is gonna happen because that's the first

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320
marker.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.539
And you don't know that. But this is where
I think the government should be spending

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:09.580
money on how is this a biomarker of health.
What about testis cancer? This is near and

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.750
dear to my heart. I'm an advisor to Lance
Armstrong Foundation. And I think this is

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:18.720
an incredible story, but this is the most
common cancer in your age group, essentially.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:25.429
It does go down at 35. There's another peak
at 50, but I asked UCSF medical students who

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:32.149
were in their 20s who are supposed to be health
conscious, how many of you do testicular self-examinations

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:36.990
once a month in the shower? Nobody. Or nobody
admitted it, but nobody.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:42.980
And that's sad because that's real easy to
do. And these cancers are rising 36% per year

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:50.059
in America, per year, and elsewhere in Europe
much higher. And what really gnaws at me is

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:54.789
the, this is the men's health thing. The average
delay in the diagnosis from when the man knows

00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:59.720
that there's an issue that's not normal to
when he gets care is 12 to 24 weeks.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:08.230
That's three to six months. Three to six months.
For cancer, that's a big deal. But we know

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.609
the risk factors. We know the risk factors.
There's a family history now. If your testicle's

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:18.789
not descended at birth that's a risk factor
and pot use is a risk factor, believe it or

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:19.789
not.

00:35:19.789 --> 00:35:24.800
It's curable, very curable, if you catch it
early. And self-examination is a fabulous

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.060
way to pick it up early. And I had a patient
a couple months ago who found it and just

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.400
found a little bit of difference between his
testicles and I said, "Congratulations." I

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.109
basically took it out and put a fake one in
there.

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:39.289
He didn't miss a beat and he's cured, based
on one procedure. Not a pleasant one, but

00:35:39.289 --> 00:35:43.380
it's one. So, there's a blog on the pot one
if you wanna know more called "Weed worries."

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:50.289
How about this one? Have you ever heard about
this one? Ejaculation. It's not in your head.

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:57.190
It's not in your head. Ejaculation is a spinal
reflex. This is a reflex from the spinal cord,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:03.269
like a sneeze. It's the only two reflexes
you can't control. Once they go, they go.

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:08.990
It's a spinal reflex. You can tell her that.
[chuckles]

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.990
[laughter]

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.631
But there's disorders of this, which are very
interesting, that you can be early, or early

00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:18.619
ejaculation, which is a question of, what's
early? It's, we're starting to define it.

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:19.730
It can be late.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:25.270
It may not happen. It may be very difficult,
that's true. It can be dry. Everything's working,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:30.440
but just nothing comes out. Or, it can be
absent. It's just never developed. And those

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.890
are very treatable conditions. I don't know
if there are health risks with them. So I

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.960
don't know if this is a general health. But
quality of life issue?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.990
You bet. It's very treatable. I treat them
all the time. They don't even involve pills.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:54.170
Some of it's just behavioral training. Contraception.
OK. You're in the bar. You're doing well.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:37:00.700
You're at Google. You got it all. There's
a lot of reward. And there's some risk. You're

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.579
out there and there's some risk of being out
there.

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:07.010
Contraception is important. So, here are your
choices. You can use condoms. You can use

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:12.410
rhythm method. What the hell is that? You
can use withdrawal. There's a great blog on

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:20.029
that, "Pulling Out is In." You can abstain.
Always works. Vasectomy. A little invasive.

00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:23.529
I like them, but. And then, there's the male
pill, which we'll talk for a minute about.

00:37:23.529 --> 00:37:27.990
But the number one for STD, sexually transmitted
disease, is a condom. And that's a two percent

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.750
failure rate, and that's a pretty good rate.
Withdrawal, believe it or not, in studies

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:32.750
works very well.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:36.109
Everyone worries about the first part of the
ejaculate having sperm, but in fact, it's

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:41.010
a four percent failure rate. It's basically
like a condom. It's pretty good and everybody

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.940
uses it. But there aren't very many people
that conceive with withdrawal. I don't know

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.940
if I'd recommend it, but it is quite good.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:55.000
And men get pretty good at it. Vasectomy,
absolutely the surest, best form of contraception.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.970
No compliance issues. You're done, you're
done. Seven minute procedure. You come to

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:04.539
the office, getting a diploma, congratulations.
It's a good one. The Turek Clinic.

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:09.270
The male pill. What's happening with the male
pill? Well, it's probably not gonna happen

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.730
because there's ethnic variations in men.
And there is compliance issues with men and

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:18.519
men aren't women and pharmaceutical industries
are not really interested in anything with

00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:19.519
a risk like this.

00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:23.191
It's like taking a pill to prevent a heart
attack and you get a heart attack. They're

00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:27.789
just not that interested. So, there's been
30 years of research and the hormonal contraceptives

00:38:27.789 --> 00:38:32.359
are being developed in labs, but the pharmaceutical
industry's just not really interested.

00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:40.529
And that's kinda the latest and so there probably
won't be a male pill. What about the other

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:45.940
sexual health issue is you go to the bar,
you come back, do you want the nightmare reminder

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:52.210
of that evening? And this is the most unwanted
list. This was provided by the CDC in Atlanta

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.019
to me for this talk.

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:59.940
And basically, number one are the viruses.
So, genital herpes and the herpes virus, sorry.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.079
Genital warts and the herpes virus are number
one and two. And those are literally 25 percenters

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:10.180
of reproductive age people. They're not curable
either.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.920
Although there is a vaccine now for genital
warts called Gardasil, which came out which

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.020
works really well, but it's not for people
with the problem. It's for currently 9 to

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:27.410
13- year old pre-sexually active women to
prevent the contraction of warts which can

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.490
lead to cervical cancer.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:33.640
It's not approved for men, although that's
being discussed. Should we give it to young

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.260
boys, too? This is preventative. It's a vaccine,
essentially. So once you have it, it doesn't

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.580
help. But you do control it clinically and
then it doesn't become infectious and it's

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.029
not really a problem.

00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:50.950
But chlamydia's on the rise. That's the college
one. That's going up. Gonorrhea and HIV are

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.579
on the decline, which is good. And syphilis.
You probably don't even know what syphilis

00:39:55.579 --> 00:40:00.610
is, it's so old. But syphilis is on the rise,
too. And so that's something to think about

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.030
and these are things that you have to think
about.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:08.150
And here's syphilis in California. Who does
it occur in? Reproductive age men. Where is

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:13.599
it occurring in California? Bing bing bing
bing bing. And that's probably most of the

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.599
Google campus right there.

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:18.079
[laughter]

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:22.140
So the best advice is the oldest advice. You
take your history with you when you go into

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:29.430
a relationship. So, be safe. Pretty plain
and simple. Hormones. So, everyone talks about

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.019
testosterone, this or that.

00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:35.430
Is testosterone important? It's got a bad
rap with sports and stuff, but it is very

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:39.769
important. It's very important. It is good
for your heart. It's good for your muscle.

00:40:39.769 --> 00:40:45.079
It reduces your fat. It keeps your blood counts
up. It prevents depression. It is an elixir.

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:48.670
It doesn't get you the car, but it's good
for your bones.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.730
It's good for maintaining your sexual health
too and maintaining that area. So, it is important.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:41:00.190
And what's influencing testosterone? Look
at the same actors, basically. Metabolic syndrome,

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:05.670
diabetes, thyroid, overall health in the body.
Testosterone is a rest and restore molecule.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.950
If you're running from a woolly mammoth, you
think it'd be higher. If you're a really good

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:14.009
athlete, it's not. Because it's a molecule
that rebuilds you when you've done the run.

00:41:14.009 --> 00:41:18.240
So when you're running from the woolly mammoth,
that's adrenaline. But when you sit down and

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.240
start to take a couple of breaths, that's
when your testosterone kicks in.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.369
So, it's really an anabolic hormone--more
of a rest and restore one. So, stress kills

00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:32.230
it. Does it do a body good? Absolutely. It's
the elixir of life. You have to have a good

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:38.200
level of it. Is it the root cause of your
problems? Probably not. Is replacement the

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.420
Holy Grail? No.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:46.269
Testosterone replacement is not the Holy Grail.
You can read the blog "A sword with two edges."

00:41:46.269 --> 00:41:47.339
Maybe it was for him, maybe not.

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:48.339
[laughter]

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:53.200
I don't know. You decide on Schwarzenegger.
This is the fact, though, about testosterone.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.240
It's probably, whatever you put on this curve,
this is the computer and you want your computer

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.059
to be over-clocked and you're doing that and
you think more testosterone will help your

00:42:04.059 --> 00:42:05.559
body computer.

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:09.500
What happens, what people think is that more
is better and you're just gonna get stronger,

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.140
this this this, more more more. It's not the
way it works. It's probably a saturation curve.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.359
You get a normal level and at that point,
you're not gonna improve much.

00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:21.829
It's gonna be saturated. So that's probably
what's going on with testosterone. I call

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:28.420
it "here's the truth" curve. That's it. That's
my advice about these simple sexual health

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.190
issues. You need to think about them. You
need to take ownership of them. I will help

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.190
you do that.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.320
The medical system right now isn't very good
at that, 'cause everyone's got their own little

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.589
expertise. But you are an individual and it
is all one big happy family inside of you.

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:46.859
These issues, called sexual health issues,
are lead indicators of health and they are

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:49.180
lead predictors of future health.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.990
So, this is what most of my time with the
government is spent doing, trying to get grants

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.770
to go in this direction for men. And not only
that, treatment will really improve your quality

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:03.770
of life. So, that is really the strong, important
things. I wanna thank some organizations for

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.160
helping out with this talk.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.730
It's through their advice that I have told
you a lot of this. So, NIH helped out and

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:16.319
the CDC and a couple of professional organizations
that I'm a member of and I've had people contribute

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:22.710
to this talk. So, I wanna thank you for your
time. Again, if you have questions and you

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:27.230
don't want to talk about them here, or you
want the slides from the talk, there's the

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:31.789
hashtag and at Twitter it's @TheTurekClinic.
Thank you very much.

00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:33.130
