markets saying China is actually
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109
markets saying China is actually
becoming a problem for us because they

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
becoming a problem for us because they
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700
becoming a problem for us because they
subsidize their industries and they

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
subsidize their industries and they
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410
subsidize their industries and they
manipulate their currency and therefore

growing Latin America's growing they

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
growing Latin America's growing they
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420
growing Latin America's growing they
could actually be growing even more if

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
could actually be growing even more if
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039
could actually be growing even more if
it weren't for China actually out

it weren't for China actually out
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.530
it weren't for China actually out
competing them I think that's much more

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
competing them I think that's much more

that has gone into Africa into South
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310
that has gone into Africa into South
America even into Australia which is the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
America even into Australia which is the
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780
America even into Australia which is the
largest foreign direct investment

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
largest foreign direct investment
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850

beneficial you know you look at a place

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
beneficial you know you look at a place
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149

like Africa which is a billion people

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

I mean the fact that now China

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
I mean the fact that now China
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.069
I mean the fact that now China
desperately needs to purchase African

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
desperately needs to purchase African
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.419

for economic growth with these eco
economy something that we haven't seen

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
economy something that we haven't seen
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460
economy something that we haven't seen
in a long time but this can put them

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
in a long time but this can put them
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930
in a long time but this can put them
to trouble too because if trying to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
to trouble too because if trying to
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.580
to trouble too because if trying to
start handing out billion dollar checks

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590

governments that money is going to
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.550
governments that money is going to
disappear and then what happens when

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
disappear and then what happens when
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.810

we're not going to let the Chinese March
off with all of our resources when we

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
off with all of our resources when we
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.860
off with all of our resources when we
didn't receive any benefit in return

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
didn't receive any benefit in return

we're going to renegotiate these deals

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
we're going to renegotiate these deals
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.590
we're going to renegotiate these deals
we're going to take it back and that's

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600
we're going to take it back and that's
 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.030
we're going to take it back and that's
going to create a new risk both for that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
going to create a new risk both for that
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.890
going to create a new risk both for that
country and for China and so there could

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
country and for China and so there could
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.000
country and for China and so there could
be blowback which would be very

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
be blowback which would be very
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.560
be blowback which would be very
interesting because China has really

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
interesting because China has really
 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.180
interesting because China has really
come center stage as a world superpower

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
come center stage as a world superpower
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490
