BRADY HARAN: Hi there,
everyone.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.790
Can I just say a quick thanks
to everyone who watched my

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.540
last video in which I set myself
the slightly bonkers

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.450
challenge of rolling a
Yahtzee, a one-roll

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.000
Yahtzee, that is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.760
You've all had a lot to say
about it, and I think the main

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.720
thing has been a little bit of
disappointment with my lack of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.020
enthusiasm when I finally
achieved my goal.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.210
I have done it.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.210
This tape's about to end,
but I've done it.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.130
I have rolled a Yahtzee.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.910
And amazingly, five of you have
already sent me videos of

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.080
you guys performing a
one-roll Yahtzee.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.190
Let's have a quick look.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.540
This first one came from David,
who's obviously a bit

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.820
concerned about waking anyone up
in his house, so he had to

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.880
do it in silence.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.782
But then here we go.

00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:46.840
The magic moment.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.650
And he rolls all twos
for his Yahtzee.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.440
Well done, David.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.520
He did it in silence.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.150
And he tells me it took him
one hour and 44 minutes.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.650
Let's have a look
at another one.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.320
Daimo do Costa tells me it
took just 328 attempts.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.800
And here it is, like
me, all threes.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.270
Miranda Richards apparently took
25 minutes, watched by

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520
her pet cat.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.340
Before this moment, all fours,
but that's a Yahtzee, and the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600
odds are one in 1,296.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.150
But I've saved the
best for last.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.420
Here are two more, both by
people called Richard.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.730
Here's the first one.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.680
Richard Moyer here in Canada,
apparently took 2 and 1/2

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.850
hours and 1,743 rolls
until this happened.

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:40.700
RICHARD MOYER: Oh my god!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.380
I did it!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: Two hours
of rolling, and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.510
you rolled a Yahtzee.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.010
No way!

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.126
RICHARD MOYER: Yeah,
on threes.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:46.540
[BLEEP]

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.790
yeah!

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.560
BRADY HARAN: And I can forgive
that reaction.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.840
And here's the last one.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.750
Another rather excited
Yahtzee roller.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.360
RICHARD: Yes!

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.280
[BLEEP]

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.860
BRADY HARAN: Not sure how many
rolls it took, but a pretty

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.150
excited reaction.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.530
Thanks a lot to those people.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.789
And if you want to have
a try, send it in.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.380
There's the email address.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.590
I'll use the video,
that's for sure.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.600
And if you want to watch my
original Yahtzee video.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.070
The link will be somewhere on
the screen using annotations

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.270
or under the video.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.180
Anyway, better get
back to work.
