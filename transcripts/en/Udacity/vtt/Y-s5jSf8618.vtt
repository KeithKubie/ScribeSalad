00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
And I think that the last three options could be valid responses.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.060
I think the first one is actually not. And the reason for that are two things:

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.600
One is that I think it kind of does seem a bit suspicious but even if you don't think it's suspicious

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.730
you don't really understand what's going on here.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.770
So on the last throws, it has all turned out very, very, very well.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.490
So no 6 was thrown. Always 30% payout.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.040
Now the reason could be pure chance and maybe the person offering the game at that point

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.250
just had bad luck but the thing is you don't really know.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.570
So if you decide to play, I think you should only play a little

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.890
and it certainly depends on your risk affinity if you even want to get into the game

00:00:38.890 --> 99:59:59.000
because I do think the whole thing seems a bit suspicious.
