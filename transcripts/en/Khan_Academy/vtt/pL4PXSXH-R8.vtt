00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.203
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:02.036
we're going to get a little bit

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:06.430
of practice setting up
systems of linear equations

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.370
based on a word problem.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.130
We're not actually going
to end up solving it.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.370
You can do that if you
like just for kicks.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.630
But really we're going to
just focus on setting it up.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
So here we're told Lauren uses
a blend of dark roast beans

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.710
and light roast beans to
make coffee at her cafe.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.420
She needs 80 kilograms of beans
in total for her next order.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.490
Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.170
light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.780
and someone wants to spend $220 total.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.110
Let D be the number of kilograms

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.050
of dark roast beans she buys

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.630
and L be the number of kilograms

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.760
of light roast beans she buys.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.860
All right, so based on this information

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.870
that we've been given, see
if you can pause this video

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.020
and set up a system of equations.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.420
And it's going to have two equations

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.300
with two unknowns, D and L,
that in theory we could solve

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630
to figure out the right
number of kilograms

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.960
of dark roast beans and light roast beans

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.070
that Karen should use.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.320
So pause this video and
try to work that out.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.640
All right, now let's do it together.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.610
And what I'm going to do
is I'm going to underline.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.850
So let's see, we know
that D is dark roast beans

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.150
and the L is the number of
kilograms of light roast beans.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.610
And then they tell us here,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.610
they say she needs 80
kilograms of beans in total.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.610
So what we could say is,
hey, the number of kilograms

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.150
of dark roast beans plus
the number of kilograms

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.150
of light roast beans needs
to be equal to 80 kilograms.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.390
So the number of kilograms
of dark roast beans

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.022
plus the number of kilograms
of light roast beans.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:52.300
(laughs) I'm having trouble
saying light roast beans.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.040
Well, this, what I just underlined here,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.270
it says needs to be 80 kilograms in total.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.690
So that needs to be 80.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.130
So this number of kilograms

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.770
plus this number of kilograms
is going to be equal

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770
to your total number of kilograms.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.380
All right, so I have one
equation with two unknowns.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.670
Let's see if we can get another one.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.670
So next, they say dark roast
beans cost $3 per kilogram,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.350
light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.060
and she wants to spend $220 total.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.430
So what I just underlined
in this aquamarine color

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.890
we can set up another equation with.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.620
And if you haven't already set
up your system of equations,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.170
see if you can now do that.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.610
See if you can set up
this second equation.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.240
Pause the video.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.150
All right, well, the way to think

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.130
about it is we just have
to have an expression

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220
for how much did she
spend on dark roast beans,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280
how much did she spend
on light roast beans,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080
and then we need to
add those two together,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.470
and that needs to be equal to $220

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.470
'cause that's how much she
wants to spend in total.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.830
So how much does she
spend on dark roast beans?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.390
Well, it's going to be
the number of kilograms

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.420
of dark roast beans that she buys,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.640
and it says that it cost $3 per kilogram,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.157
so we're gonna multiply it by three.

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:02.640
$3 per kilogram times
the number of kilograms

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.480
of dark roast beans.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.300
This is how much she
spends on dark roast beans.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.690
And so how much is she going
to spend on light roast beans?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.020
Well, she buys L kilograms
of light roast beans.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.340
They told us that there.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.650
And they cost $2 per kilogram,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.070
so $2 per kilogram times
the number of kilograms.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.390
This is how much she spends
on light roast beans.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.710
So you add how much she
spends on dark roast

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.310
to how much she spends on light roast,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.930
and so this is going to be $220 in total.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.870
And there you have it.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.540
We have our two equations
with two unknowns,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.790
and so now we could go and solve it,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.850
but you can do that outside of this video.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.990
But the whole point of
this video is to understand

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.740
how to construct these
based on the constraints,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.790
based on the information
that we see in this.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.810
So typically when you're
trying to set these up,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.480
there's often a sentence or two

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.040
that will focus on one equation.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.440
So this first one is
saying, hey, the kilograms,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.690
let's add those up for the
total number of kilograms.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.940
And then there's another
sentence or two that'll focus on,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.160
in this case, some other equation.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.450
In this case, it's the price.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.130
So the price of the dark
plus the price of the light

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.130
is going to be equal to the
total amount she wants to spend.
