1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.700
Huh.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.700
<v 1>Another way to look at a patient is as an organism that develops in which has a</v>

3
00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:13.070
sensitive period early in life where environment has a big impact.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.150
That takes us into the developmental origins of health and disease.

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.070
If we look at adaptability on different timescales,

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.200
we can see that the homeostatic mechanisms of physiology that are doing things

7
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:31.790
like controlling our temperature and our sugar content and in our blood,

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.240
our operating on periods that are from about a 10000th of a generation up to

9
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:40.280
about a hundredth of a generation.

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.790
If we look at Rio static mechanisms,

11
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:47.420
which signified changes in set points for homeostatic feedback,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.440
then the Rio static mechanisms are on a slightly longer time scale up to about a

13
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:55.670
10th of a lifespan.

14
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.720
Developmental plasticity is something that has a timescale that runs from about

15
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.750
a hundredth of a lifespan up to a full lifespan.

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.970
Then natural selection,

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.150
which is generating adaptation rather than adaptability is something that's

18
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.290
operating on a timescale from about a generation up to hundreds of generations.

19
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.780
Many of the noninfectious diseases,

20
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.470
the chronic diseases originate early in development,

21
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.360
autumn,
autoimmune diseases and eight piece are examples.

22
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.980
If the developing organism does not experience,

23
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:39.660
that's normal [inaudible] they're evolved interactions with the immune system

24
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:43.470
don't take place and that leads to an abnormal immune response.

25
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.700
We will expand on this.
That's for cancer.

26
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:52.701
The somatic mutations that lead to cancer are most influential when they occur

27
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.090
early in development,

28
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.070
when cell division is rapid and when the downstream influence is greatest.

29
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.310
The Metabolic Syndrome,

30
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:08.311
which we're going to go now go into some detail on basically points out that

31
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:13.981
condition at birth affects the probability years later of type two diabetes,

32
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.190
obesity,
high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.

33
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.310
And this can happen even 50 to 60 years after the initial proximate cause has

34
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.383
had its effect.

35
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.400
<v 1>There were two early hypotheses for the metabolic syndrome.</v>

37
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.860
James Neal,
uh,
offered the thrifty genotype hypothesis.

38
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.800
It was based on genetic determinism.

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.280
He was trying to explain why diabetes exists at all and his,

40
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:50.431
he posited that a condition of insulin resistance would have been beneficial if

41
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.390
people had repeatedly been exposed to starvation.

42
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.800
The problem is that famines do not appear to have been frequent hunter hunter

43
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.690
gatherers.
Hunter gatherers are not obese,
but they are very rarely starving.

44
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.020
David Barker,

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.590
30 years later offered the thrifty phenotype hypothesis instead of genetic

46
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.890
determinism.
Barker was using developmental determinism.

47
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.480
He tried to explain why the Metabolic Syndrome is more frequent in adults who

48
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.481
are undernourished as fetuses and infants and the idea of the thrifty phenotype

49
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.511
hypothesis is that a developmental switch gets thrown that puts the physiology

50
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.211
of the developing organism into a very thrifty state and insulin resistance

51
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:44.221
state and that that helps to protect it against a starvation regime.

52
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.140
The problem with that is that predicting the adult environment on the basis of

53
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.210
fetal nourishment might not work.

54
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.320
The correlation between the food environments might not be high enough.

55
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.620
However,
we do have data.

56
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
The effects really are real and the most striking data that really focused

57
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:06.760
people on this problem come from the Dutch hunger winter.

58
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.510
At the end of 1944 the Nazis decided that they were going to starve the Dutch

59
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.370
and this famine lasted from about November of 1944 through into about April of

60
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:27.211
1945 and there were women in the Netherlands who were pregnant at the time and

61
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:33.181
they were either at the start of the famine in late pregnancy or in mid

62
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:39.781
pregnancy or in early pregnancy and the exposure to the famine came basically

63
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.053
right here.

64
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.410
Then the pregnancy's concluded at these dates later on,

65
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.480
so people before and after were unexposed.

66
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.310
The Dutch followed this and these are the characteristics measured in adults

67
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.900
about 50 years later that are broken down by timing of prenatal exposure to the

68
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:13.000
Dutch famine and you have late gestation,

69
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.660
mid gestation and early gestation in these columns.

70
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.560
It's a large column of numbers and you can study it at your leisure,

71
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.370
but to pick out the main points when that stress occurred mattered and it makes

72
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:32.380
sense because organ systems are developing at different times in pregnancy.

73
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.760
Those who experienced starvation early in gestation later had cardiovascular

74
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:40.780
disease in general,
poor health.

75
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.000
Those who experienced in mid gestation later had a higher risk of kidney

76
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:46.834
disease.

77
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.940
It was associated with diabetes and with lung disease and those who experienced

78
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.410
that in late gestation developed insulin resistance and diabetes later in life.

79
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.530
Now,
similar effects occur under normal conditions.

80
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.531
David Barker looked at data from hospitals in Hertfordshire and he looked at the

81
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:11.141
relative risk of heart disease is a function of birth weight here on the x axis

82
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.170
and wait at one year over here on the y axis,

83
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.950
it's normalized to a risk of one for people who had mean birth weight and mean

84
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:24.290
weight at one year.

85
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.890
And what you can see is that the smaller the infant was,

86
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
the higher the risk of heart disease and the larger the infant was the lower the

87
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.240
risk of heart disease.
These are quite dramatic differences.

88
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.160
This is one and a half times is probable and this is half is probable of having

89
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:43.994
heart disease.

90
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

91
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.170
<v 1>What are the mechanisms that might mediate such effects?
Well,</v>

92
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.930
they have to be epigenetic.
Uh,

93
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.080
because this is not dependent upon the genotype of the patient is dependent upon

94
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.820
the environmental experience of the patient.

95
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.120
Those mechanisms include DNA methylation.

96
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.120
Individual Nucleotide sequences are specifically then regulated.

97
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.550
The methylation binding proteins are part of that mechanism.
However,

98
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:20.170
there can also be histone modification which is a broader scale turning on or

99
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:24.340
turning off of sets of genes mediated by Acetylation,

100
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.190
ubiquitination phosphorylation and methylation.

101
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.850
Also micro RNA and RNA editing can be involved in these epigenetic processes.

102
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.120
We do not yet know which mechanisms are responsible for precisely which of these

103
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.344
reactions.

104
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.990
Now the barker hypothesis has been developed particularly by Peter Gluckman and

105
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.830
his colleagues into the predictive adaptive response hypothesis.

106
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.920
This is a change developmental strategy with a delayed benefit and no obvious

107
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:04.810
immediate benefit.
We know what occurs in other species.
For example,

108
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:06.460
altered coat thickness in the meadow.

109
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:11.461
Vole mothers who are giving birth to offspring that we'll be growing up in cold

110
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:16.690
weather give birth offspring that already have heavier coat before the weather

111
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:19.900
gets cold.
So there is an anticipation involved in that.

112
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.150
So we know in principle that can happen.

113
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.280
Now there is a bias in anticipation.

114
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.910
The fitness costs of an error in prediction is not symmetrical.

115
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.350
Predicting a high nutrition environment and ending up in a low nutrition

116
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:35.921
environment,

117
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:40.600
we'll have a greater fitness costs then predicting alone nutrition environment

118
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.430
and ending up in a high nutrition environment.

119
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.020
So there's a bias in prediction.

120
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:51.021
In humans it's more important to avoid the downside than to exploit the upside.

121
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

122
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.020
<v 1>No,
an alternative hypothesis that the effect is a byproduct,</v>

123
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.250
not an adaptation.

124
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.690
And that the response is aimed at the immediate survival of infants which

125
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.400
contribute strongly to fitness.

126
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.170
The costs are paid much later in age classes that contribute less to fitness.

127
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:15.171
So this again is the evolutionary theory of aging and that leaves open the issue

128
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:17.520
of why the cost must be paid at all.

129
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.740
The natural hypothesis is some kind of constraint,
but if it exists,

130
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.000
it has not yet been located.

131
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.040
So this is an area where we know the effects are real,

132
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.540
the data are there,

133
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720
and there is an interesting controversy going on in terms of how we explain

134
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:38.850
them.
So to summarize,

135
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.120
early life events definitely affect late life,
health and disease.

136
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.190
We are beginning to understand how and why these effects evolved,

137
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.530
but the evolutionary issues are not yet settled.

138
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.780
We are beginning to understand the epigenetic mechanisms that might mediate them

139
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.420
and research on the topic is intense.
New results are coming in all the time.
