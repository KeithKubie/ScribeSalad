00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.526
&gt;&gt;Elena: Traditionally there
were these 50-minute periods

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:14.356
where you did this textbook, and
this textbook, and there was lecture;

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:19.736
however even when that was
developing and now we know

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:23.796
that kids don't learn well that
way, and we know that many students

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:28.056
in certain socioeconomic groups
don't particularly don't learn well

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:30.856
that way, and if we want to
close the achievement gap

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.686
and reach those students, we
need to teach differently.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:37.226
And so in some ways it does go
against what many people grew

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:40.976
up with, what they think
constitutes good education,

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.396
even what their administrators
are telling them they have to do.

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:45.636
We have a lot of research
and evidence on our side

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:50.386
that says this is how kids learn
best by integrating studies,

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:56.696
by experience-- learning through
many different modalities,

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.576
by expressing your learning
through different learning-

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:02.816
with different learning styles, so I
think we are being given permission

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:06.176
by the abundance of research
that says this works.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:12.056
This does take more time, it's more
planning, it's more- it's logistics

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:16.386
and thinking but it's so much
more rewarding and it works.

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:22.876
&gt;&gt;To be able to plan an
interdisciplinary unit you need

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:25.946
to know what's expected of those
students in those other areas

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:29.036
so I would need to have the
standards for math, science, history,

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.756
everything, spread out
all over around me,

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.346
and I would be constantly
referring to them and looking

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:35.436
at kind of going back and forth.

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:36.376
These are my goals.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.886
Where are there standards in other
areas that fit in and support that?

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:46.726
Or where- how can I modify my
goals so that I can actually pull

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:49.426
in that sixth grade
math standard that's

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:54.586
like statistics that's rarely
addressed in any depth and pull

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:58.356
that in and support their learning
in this class in this unit.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.116
So I would be doing
a lot of planning.

00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:05.676
I would be talking to other teachers
about what is it in sixth grade math

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:09.896
that you feel like would be helpful
for students to have reinforced

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.386
in my class, or which are standards
that are not addressed enough

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:15.406
that you really wish there was
some way that they could bring in?

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.526
And then I would go back to my
clients and see whether they worked.

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:18.736
No? Sorry, that doesn't work here.

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:22.206
&gt;&gt;I think one of the keys to success

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:25.906
in designing an interdisciplinary
unit is doing a lot of research

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:28.516
on the Internet and books
and everybody you know.

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:31.336
&gt;&gt;I'm a firm believer in
asking for what you want

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:33.336
from everybody even though
you may not even know them.

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:37.136
And just keep looking, keep asking,

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:43.176
and there are tons of
resources out there.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:47.616
&gt;&gt;When you're planning for
any kind of unit again,

00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:49.236
you need to know what do
you want them to understand?

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:52.276
How am I going to know if
they're understanding it?

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.426
And so when you start, before you
start you need to have rubrics

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:59.256
or assessment measures
already created

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:03.286
so you know really clearly what
you're looking for and then you need

00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:07.086
to communicate that to students
so they know it's not a mystery.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.436
What am I expected to do?

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:10.516
What is it going to look
like if I get an "A"?

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:15.496
And then all the way along you need
to be doing formative assessments.

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:16.396
Are they getting it?

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.086
If not, what do I need to
do, how do I need to reteach,

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:20.456
how do I need to restructure
my class,

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.806
what other strategies can I do?

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.766
Changing instruction, give
them another assessment,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:28.846
but you need to know before you go
into it what are you looking for.

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:36.446
&gt;&gt; So at ASCEND I taught a
core of history and English

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:41.506
and my partner-teacher taught math
and science and we followed a model

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:44.766
of teaching of designing curriculum

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.436
and instruction called
expeditionary learning.

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:53.536
And one of the central
curricular components

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:55.416
of that was to integrate curriculum.

00:03:55.796 --> 00:04:01.306
&gt;&gt;To make instruction as authentic
and meaningful as possible for kids,

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:05.756
to connect it to their world, to
the real world, to be responsive

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:07.196
to their needs and interests.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:12.136
In the beginning of 2003 the
likelihood of there being a war was

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:14.556
on the forefront of
everybody's mind and newspapers,

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:18.036
and although I had sort of
mandated curriculum I was supposed

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:21.026
to cover standards the
students really wanted to know

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:25.586
about what was going on with this
war and this conflict and wanted

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:26.696
to understand it deeper

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:31.076
and fortunately there were enough
connections to be made and there were

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:35.726
so many language arts standards
that could be addressed in designing

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:39.196
that curriculum and I'm emphasizing
this sort of external pressure

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.256
of standards and curricula
that we have to teach

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:42.556
because that is the reality.

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:46.396
But what I found then and still
believe now is that you can do it.

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:48.006
It's just about looking creatively

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:50.486
and getting some administrative
permission.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.386
You can say "Look-it, in this study

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:54.716
of the war they did persuasive
writing, they did debate,

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:57.466
they did poetry, they
wrote personal essays,

00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:00.376
they went to other
schools and did teach-ins.

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:01.576
They taught their parents.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:03.716
They spoke to newspapers."

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:09.486
And all of that you can still do and
meet standards and you can do that

00:05:09.486 --> 00:05:11.526
and meet the interests and
needs of your students.

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:18.426
&gt;&gt;If you're a beginning teacher and
you're starting to want to tread

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:21.926
into interdisciplinary studies
and integrating more curriculum

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:26.066
and it seems overwhelming and you
can barely get the kids to sit down

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:27.606
and be quiet and open
their textbooks,

00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:33.146
I would say take small steps and
it's okay and use the textbook

00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:36.356
and make some small
goals for yourself

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:40.176
like once this month I
will bring in a poem.

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:43.196
Or I will have one
guest speaker this year.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:47.386
Or I will take some small steps.

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:53.676
Get- it is okay to get the classroom
management set, feel comfortable,

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:56.656
have- start understanding
the curriculum,

00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:01.296
understanding the standards and then
there may be a unit that you'll think

00:06:01.536 --> 00:06:03.706
about doing, a two-week
unit in the spring.

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:05.136
It doesn't have to be a semester.

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:08.286
It can be a one-week, a two-week
unit where you're going to focus

00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:11.226
on something and you
already have ideas about how

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:14.776
and you can spend six
months mulling it over,

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:17.126
asking whenever you have
a second once-a-month

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.626
to "Do you have any ideas?

00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:22.166
I want to do something about frogs

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.006
and do you have any ideas
about what I can do?"

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:28.206
So it's a great way to start
making connections with colleagues

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:31.166
and asking colleagues what they
if you're a beginning teacher

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.736
and taping on their resources.

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:36.966
But take small steps and think
about it as a long-term goal.

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:40.136
