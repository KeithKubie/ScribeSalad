00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:03.710 align:start position:0%
is is the skill set that you developed
 

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.070 align:start position:0%
is is the skill set that you developed
and<00:28:03.919><c> so</c><00:28:04.399><c> when</c><00:28:04.639><c> I</c><00:28:04.759><c> when</c><00:28:04.999><c> you</c><00:28:05.029><c> come</c><00:28:05.360><c> to</c><00:28:05.539><c> LA</c><00:28:05.659><c> with</c><00:28:06.049><c> a</c>
