00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.930
So let me show you a better
example of doing it.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.190
So here's some input frames taken from,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.420
I don't remember which campus that is,
okay.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.265
And this is the background model, and
that's a pretty clean background model.

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:15.150
You'll notice most of the people
walking around have disappeared.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.850
These people, of course, are still here,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.710
because they've been
here the whole time.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.490
Nothing is here, because these
people have, have walked through.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.860
When I subtract the two images and

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.190
just take the sort of magnitude of the
value, it's a little hard to see here.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.700
I get sort of the general value here.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.420
All right.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.040
What I can do is I I
can threshold those.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.840
I say, which points are above
a particular value?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.100
And those are the points that light up.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.040
I can then run,
what's called a morphological operator.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.000
We're going to do that in
just a couple of lessons.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.210
It's just a way of sort of
cleaning up binary,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.430
and what I mean by binary images,
zeroes and ones.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.140
Right?

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.910
I can then grow those
regions a little bit and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.500
I can apply that and look at that.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
This has pulled out

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.200
all the people moving around
in this area nice and cleanly.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.500
With the exception, of course, of these
people because they've been there,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.800
sitting there, so long that they just
look like they're part of the scenery.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.300
All right?
And that's

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.440
what happens with median filtering.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.770
Anything that stays there for a long
time just becomes part of the scenery.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.820
That's actually considered
more of a feature than a bug.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.130
Right?
So somebody parks their car and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.230
pulls in and stays there for a while.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.210
At some point maybe you don't
want to keep tracking it as an,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.250
as an independent object.
