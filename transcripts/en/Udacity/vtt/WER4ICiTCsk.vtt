00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.870
So as a quick quiz, suppose that we have a token bucket shaper. And suppose that

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.790
the size of the bucket is 100 kilobytes,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.470
that rho is ten packets per second, and that

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.440
packets are one kilobyte. Assume also that we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.050
are talking about an interval of one second. Remember

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.550
than in any given interval, a flow can

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.310
never send more than beta plus tau times rho

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.450
bits of data. Please give your answer in kilobits per

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.540
second. Keeping in mind that one byte is eight bits.
