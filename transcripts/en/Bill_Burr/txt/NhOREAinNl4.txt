Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and ahhh just checking in on you. How are you? How was your week going? What are you paying attention to when the news that's causing you to yell at people you don't know online? Huh? What's going on? Did you hear about this? Somebody did this and then someone said that, and the results may surprise you all fucking day. You know, I walked through the God Damn airport and I'm just looking at all these fucking people looking on their phones and you know what I see, I see me. That's what I see. I'm like, I'm doing that. I'm just sitting there staring at my fucking phone, looking at somebody's flipping a fucking water bottle. Somebody fucking Duncan a basketball and everybody running away like the world just ended somebody fucking playing the drums. What am I doing?

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       I'd sit there and read a book, you know, so I look smart, but no one would even notice. They're all fucking staring at their phone. So what is the point of reading in public? If other people can't even see you're doing it because that's why you're doing it, right. Nobody reads in public. You what kind of a fuck you some fucking asshole walking down the street with a book. You know, you're just across the street like we get it, you're smart.

Speaker 3:          00:01:33       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:01:37       Well maybe you do read in public. Maybe that's what you're supposed to do. You read in public so you get credit for it's everybody. It's like that time back on the Seinfeld episode with Jason Alexander wanted to get credit for tipping. They didn't seem so he reached back in to do it. Then they thought he was stealing. I think it's like the literary version of that or maybe it isn't or maybe it is. Um, anyways, I have something to promote here. Um, all things comedy network. I need you guys to get behind this, you know, if you feel like it and no pressure here. Alright, 10 Alexandra has a new special out that you can, you can actually stream it right now. Um, at uh, ATC specials.com. It's called a senior class of earth. And Ted is just one of those guys, man, I sweated. He's just one of those comics that every comic loves and uh, but you know, you know, this business is for awhile. They like this person, then they want this person. And he just was never that person, which I can relate to. This industry was never looking for a bald, redheaded mail, you know, so I, I had to carve out my own path. You're like, how making his special about me and my struggles. You know why that is? Because I'm on social media all the time and it's fucking frying my brain. Um, do you guys could go on and check out his special, it would be a be great. You'd see. Great. There's

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       actually this fucking killer clip of one of his jokes where he compares the fact that he's in his late forties and his girlfriend's in our early thirties and was saying that, um, he was comparing his sex drive versus hers, which is in the prime to when Shaq played on the Celtics where it was still shack, but it didn't look like Shaq anymore. It took them like half the game to warm up all of that stuff. It's such a fucking killer joke. And, uh, when you watch it, what I love about Ted is there's no wasted words. And even like, even like the physicality of his jokes propels you towards the punchline. He's a, he's an absolute master. So, uh, please check that out. And with that, and with that, did anybody watch the Monday night football game bad? Put it up, put it over the Kansas City chiefs against the fucking Denver Broncos and um, Jesus Christ. I thought that announcer was going to fucking faint. I have never heard an announcer. So God damn excited about a regular season game, but that my home's, he's like shove type Blah homes. Captain Comeback. Fuck something else. Mo did everything that he did, like when he was rolling. I'm not saying that guys, and good, he's not going to be a fucking star. One of the guys said, you know, he came into the game as a legend. He's been playing for a month.

Speaker 5:          00:04:30       Right?

Speaker 4:          00:04:32       Everybody flipping the fuck out. I know why it's a God damn business. Right? You know, Brady's fucking older than dirt. This other fucking guy is like, you know, uh, drew Brees. It's like a year or two younger than Brady. Yeah. Peyton manning fucking were top so old. I can't even get through these fucking names without on a Peyton manning fucking retired. They need new people. All right, how many yards are these new people going to throw for when you can't even like start the hug them and then stop and do the, you know, you know the me too thing. Now we go to hug a friend of yours and you start saying, oh, well you get all fucking nervous. You know, that's the way defensive lineman grab quarterbacks now and they still get a fleck.

Speaker 4:          00:05:14       So anyways, the guy fucking rolls out. He's a right handed quarterbacks. He rolls out to his left, this guys breathing down his neck. He dives at his ankles and right before, uh, my home's goes down, he switched the ball to his left hand and threw it like four yards in. This guy caught it, which I, I've saw Brett Farve too, that I've seen. [inaudible] I've seen people do that before on this guys, I gone, I hope you realize what you just saw here. I think the NFL game, uh, he'll like, listen man, you got to hype this fucking Kiddo. Okay. You gonna have to hype this fucking kid up. And as always, you know, I'm, I'm the fucking Grinch. A sports don't ever listen to me. I'm always telling everybody to fucking relax and not be excited. I'm taken all the fun out of it. But Kansas City, as of right now, he has the worst defense in all of football and everybody's freaking the fuck out. I mean, they should be freaking out cause my homes is looking like the real deal, but it's just like you're not, you don't, if you don't fix that problem, you're not going to do shit in January.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:06:17       So I dunno what all this screaming and yelling is about.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:06:23       I hope you guys realize what part, what I just said here on this podcast. People go, that was like one of the greatest Monday night football games of all it is like was it seemed like what happens every time I sit down to watch a game, somebody up by 10 and then goes into a fucking shit, I don't know what. And then they lose the game when I was a kid. Like that didn't happen. Like it happens all the fucking time. One of the greatest modern guides of all time. It reminded me of three regular season games I saw the day before. You know, if that was, what about the fucking Bengals falcons like that wasn't I guess cause it didn't happen on Monday. I Dunno. Why am I such a jerk? I have no idea. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:07:10       anyways, well, you know, who knows. I'm going to be taking a a, it's Wednesday right now and I am taking a red eye flight out to Springfield, Massachusetts to do shows in Springfield in uh, Boston. And then down in, in, in uh, Connecticut and Paul Verse. He's going to be Ami with all on all the shows. And then I'm also working with the Sim Boston guys that I started out with. I'm working with Frank Santa Rally in Springfield, Tony Vee at Boston Garden and then Dan Smith Down in Connecticut. So it's going to be a, it's going to be a lot of fun and I want to thank everybody that's bought the tickets and a or freckles is going to try to go out there and not put on 40 pounds because of, um, you know, I'm going to go back there. It's going to be all the old haunts, you know, you go back east, they got the fucking insane Chinese food, uh, the pizza, all of that stuff. So I gotta like ice cream joints that I used to, all this shit that I, I'm, this is what I want happens whenever I go back to Boston is I, I, because I left in 95, I, I go back to, uh, you know, I started acting like I'm 22 years old. The way I'm eating,

Speaker 4:          00:08:24       which somehow back in the day, you know, you'd go out and drink a 12 pack and then hit Mcdonald's at the end of the night and go home and the next morning just wake up and go unload trucks. His stomach was flat, you know, you just shook it off back then. You know, it's like doing your first burnout in a brand new car, like the car getting, you know, probably wished you didn't do it. Probably not happy it did it, but it can shake it off. It's still looks new, you know, now I tried to do that shit. There's like fucking parts left in the road. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       anyways, so it's so Ba October and I wasn't going to do it, but now I'm going to do it. Oh, well fuck it, do it. You know, I'm a binge drinker. I gotta stop with this shit. You know, I'll do it. So now I'm on the wagon, a lump date, but they [inaudible] do, you know, it's funny as peep, there's like two different ways of saying you're on the wagon. There's like, um, you know, like, uh, you're on the party wagon or your, your your, whenever I'm, the way I say it, if I'm on the wagon, that always meant like you're not on, you're not party. He fell off the wagon, meant you started partying again. But then other people call the wagon, the party wagon. So I dunno, it's just one of those things, you know, it's kind of like that word cock with white people.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       It met Dick and with book black, older black people, I should say it meant pussy. You know, just a complete inverse. I mean, it's sort of an extreme example, but I remember saying that in the writer's room and an f is for family and they were like, that's not true, is it? And then they end up having this fucking snoop Dogg song from the early nineties where you first do a woman's pussy as his cock. So fucking weird. Oh, people, people have different ways of saying things, don't they? That was sort of my Mr. Rogers moment of the podcast. I know there's a bunch of people right now fucking Google in that. Go ahead and Google it. Go ahead and go. You know what? I'll fucking go, Glenn, I'll, I'll read, I'll read it to you right now. This could be, so maybe this could be something interesting. Um, by the way, have you guys been following anybody like I told you, have you followed, been following anybody sarcastically on Twitter, watching them make all of these news events about themselves, you know, telling you how difficult it is to be beautiful, you know? All right, let me see here. Cock. Oh, Jesus Christ. What fucking, this is going to be on my search engine.

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       Alright. Cock a doodle. Cockroach. Cox, spar cockroaches. Cockapoo alright, cock meaning posy. Thank you. I'm 50 years old. I just searched that. All right, let's see what happens. We'll the FBI show up at my door and we're waiting and we're waiting because bill has the worst Internet service and there we go. Uh, cock means vagina. Let us explain. La Weekly wrote an article about this. Uh, let me see here. Okay, now this is the one coc meeting vagina. Let us explained. Now I don't want his fucking subscribe to the La Weekly. Okay. Rodney Carmichael's early high school years were awkward. Like many young men. He wasn't sure how to talk to girls. This less of a problem for a stepbrother who gives a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       Okay. All right. He never met a grown person, but recalls that his stepbrother promise she was cute. Even better. She'd seen comical from afar and thought the same thing about him. So their phone calls slowly. Miranda meandered from getting to know you phase too. Clumsy Highschool attempts at flirtation. Then she asked a question that stopped him in his tracks. Do you eat cock? Wait, that's not a fucking clumsy flirtation. That's fucking direct. It's like a fucking military due. Cocked for private. Alright. Carmichael was confused, uh, to the young black man. Everything to that point had suggested a typical teenage heterosexual courtship. But the question threw him for a loop. He's like, I didn't know if she was talking about minor Hersey. He remembers. It was kind of nerve wracking. His confusion was understandable. He didn't use the word cock much himself, but he had heard it by white folks in the media, Hbo, old playboy who was slang for penis when it was used by some of his famous rap Fay favorite rappers. However, it meant something else entirely. Take Miami Rep, act two live crew. That group obsessed equally with bass and female anatomy, uh, and most famously by most famous hit me. So horny also had a song called HPC in which they chanted head, booty and cock. Uh, what you like, Foote, fellows, head booty and cock. Oh Jesus Christ. I don't remember that song. And two live crew. Jesus Christ. What? Okay, snoop dog. When I bust my ass up, I'm raising up off the cock. Snoop Dogg wraps in his iconic 1993 hit gin and juice.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       MMM. All right. So we've got enough exam examples. So no surprise that flooding caught courtship quickly wound down nobody's cock was ever eaten, but comic definitely wasn't alone in this confusion. There were surely many casualties in, in an era when hip hop, sudden popularity forced this old bit of slang into a head on collision. With the broader culture for one group of people cock preferred to male genitalia for the other referred to female day. We go, ah, and that's one to grow on. See everybody, you know, every once in a while you learn something here on the fucking Thursday afternoon podcast. What do you think about that? Huh? All right. So you gotta be asking yourself the New England patriots or play in the fucking Indianapolis Colts. A rivalry. Arguably the biggest rivalry in the NFL during the Peyton manning was there. Maybe, you know, I always thought the Steelers ravens was a good one. Yeah. Who the fuck knows? Anyways, it was, it was a big driver, but now, you know, it's a different time. Andrew Luck, you know, took a year off getting healthy. Now he's

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       back. Who knows what happens. I love what the Patriots did on Sunday. Oh, by the way, I did I fucking call the fucking Broncos at what they covered. They still blow the fucking game, but they, I was so hoping they were actually going to win the game. Um, but anyways, uh, the Patriots did so well against the dolphins. That's the team that I want to show up on Thursday. But these Thursday games a weird cause. Everybody's fucking tired. They usually sloppy shit.

Speaker 6:          00:15:18       And um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:20       I dunno, I keep, I keep hearing Edelman is going to be back and then other people say isn't going to be back. I don't know. But if he's back, you know, we got that dude, you know, who likes to party like me. Um, in from Cleveland, it help our defense can get a little pressure on the quarterback. Something. I don't know if we've got a shot. We got a shot to go on a little run here. We'll see. We shall see what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       So I went to the gym today, right.

Speaker 6:          00:15:47       And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:15:49       I forgot my headphones.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       And um, you know, so the plane, you don't gym music and shit. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:59       And Dude, I got to say at my fucking gym, it is so funny. It's such like a, like I've, I've, I haven't been in a gym in like 11 or 12 years. I always worked out in my garage, but now cause I need to do the lat pull downs to finally build strength up in my shoulder so I can finally do a pull up again. So I don't lose like 200 bucks when I turned 70, cause I can't do 10 pull ups. That's the bet. Um, with Virginia that I have. And um, so I joined this gym and I haven't been in the gym so long. Like there is just so many different fucking workouts, Eh, cause you know, back in the day they used to be, I'd go to a gym and I'd be like, that guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. You know? And that person really knows what they're doing. I should ask them for some tips on how to work out. But now I haven't been in there so long and there's just so many. I mean when it, last time I was a member of a gym, like I don't think there was even kettle balls. Forget about all of this other shit where people stand on things like trying to,

Speaker 6:          00:16:54       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:16:56       you know, it's like they've got half a beach ball that they're standing on it while they're doing curls and they're also working their core. I mean, I don't know. So then I see people doing other shit and it's just like, okay, so is that a legit exercise or is that person just fucking weird? I saw a guy on, on, you know, instead of doing dips, he lifted himself up, he locked his arms out and then he was just like scissor kicking side to side. Like he was running in the air and I was like, is that for your ankles? Like what is, what does that, I imagine that's something for your core. He wasn't bringing his legs up though. It was like he was just sort of running in the air. Like you know those douchebags who do pull ups and they act like they're walking upstairs, you know, like one person did it, it was cool and then 40,000 people did it. And that just immediately became Douchey, like rollerblading. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:54       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:54       Oh, what did I hear this guy say today at the gym? It was a self, I was going to fucking write it down. I forgot. He was just talking about a show that he liked and I was just going, there's no way that wasF is for family. He said, I just thought that they were really delicate with the, some sort of, something sort of subject. This was a guy talking. I liked that show because they're really, uh, they cherish something, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't know if he was hitting on the woman he was talking to or whatever. Tronic like we was fucking sensitive, you know, but I know they weren't talking aboutF is for family. And speaking of F is for family. Uh, Netflix put out their first bit of social media about a season three, which I'm very excited about it.

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       Um, it, uh, dropped I think 11:00 AM or something. I guess it's the next day. So you guys probably already saw it if you haven't seen it. Vince Vaughn is doing a voice to season and um, it's probably the most fun I've had in the, uh, in the recording booth was somebody, he, that guy is like, he's completely in his own lane. He is a fucking monster. How funny that guy is. And um, I did my best to try to keep up with them, which I don't think I did, but I'm once again just another, you know, huge person to add to the cast and obviously added the funny, that's why I think this is our best season and um, and it's obviously his production, um, company, wild west fill that whole fucking reason that the show exists to begin with. So a, I want to thank Kim and I want to thank all you guys. If you're even thinking of watching it, hopefully you will watch it and then we will get to do it all over again.

Speaker 3:          00:19:38       And hopefully this time next year I'll be talking about a season four, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. The Yankees, I don't know what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:19:47       It's, it's the fucking day before.

Speaker 3:          00:19:51       Oh No, it's today. It's happening today. Maybe there are they playing right now? They're playing the Oakland A's and I have no feeling about this game. I have no idea who's gonna win this fucking one. But, uh, I'd like to fucking check in here. What do we got yanked

Speaker 7:          00:20:06       the, is

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       the Yankees, are they going to play tonight? What time? It's on TBS.

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       All right, I'll have to check this out. No, you know what? I'll actually be going to the fucking airport so I'm going to miss it. Maybe I'll watch it on the plane. Should be some Yankee fans on there, right flying to wherever the fuck I'm flying to. Um, do you anyways? I got some ad reads to read here, but I don't have them with me, so I'm just going to say I have them and then I'm gonna I guess we'll drop it in through the magic of fucking, I don't know what magic of editing.

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       Yeah. So I'm definitely gonna do the, uh, the sober October thing. I gotta do it, man. I, I don't know what my deal is. What is it? When if you drink, you just fucking take it to the end, but you can also just stop. Where did, where does that exist on, like addiction, you know what I mean? Like, I can literally just stop drinking and I let have alcohol sitting. I just walk by it everyday. I don't even fucking see it. But then when I get back on, then I just fucking, I dunno, just slamming them, man. I'm thinking. I used to be my last one. This will be my last one. And I'm just like, I'm, I'm still not, maybe it's my tolerance. It's like I don't feel anything. And then the next day I wake up, I'm like, oh my God, I feel like Shit. Whoa. I was way drunker than I thought. Um, I'm always amazed at those people that can just sip, you know, maybe it's just how I'm wired. Like if I'm playing drums, I'm gonna fucking play drums. If I'm going to go do a tour, it's going to be really fucking long or some shit. And if I'm going to drink, I'm gonna drink. So

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       I dunno. I'm just too fucking old for it. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:03       I Dunno, but this is what always happens. Now I'll, I'll stop for awhile, month, two months, a fucking year or whatever, and then I just, I just get bored.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:22:15       There's gotta be like a,

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:19       It's gotta be a hobby. They can come up with dude.

Speaker 3:          00:22:22       These fucking people like chasing you around the fucking Internet. Look at this art deco bar cabinet. I looked up maybe getting an art deco bar. Hilarious. As I'm sitting there talking about, I'm not going to fucking drink anymore. I looked that up like fucking six months ago and they just keep, no, I just clicked on it just to talk to you guys about, and this will just never leave. I don't give a shit what I w I could be looking up something about platypuses and in the side of my fucking thing, it's going to say art deco bars look at d sinks. Oh my God. They are

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       beautiful. Expensive as shit though. Jesus. Fuck you. Why are you paying all of that? My God. Oh, but they are beautiful. That's my favorite shit. I think also because I grew up watching bugs bunny that I like art deco shit is if you watch bugs bunny, there's a lot of all the buildings and stuff. You know, which people you know really hate it. To be honest with you. When they first came out, they didn't like art deco. They never liked the new shit. You know, like me, I never liked the new shit. What did I just bitching about? Bitching about fucking Patrick. My homes wasn't even veteran about him. I think he's fucking great, but she that, that announced it. My God, I, I, there was a couple of times like, I think this guy's going to faint. I let him think he's going to fucking pass out if this guy, if he like hands off the ball, then they're given case keen.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       I'm no fucking respect whatsoever. That guy, I only went to the fucking NFC championship last year, right. Only beat the saints in the last play of the fucking game. Right. Granted that was the saints fucking up. Oh. Speaking of which, that guy plays on the colts now, I believe. Um, but uh, I don't know. Yeah, I guess when that Shit first came out, people just did not like it on any level. A look at that one. Jeez, look at this other thing. You can't fucking see unique art deco whiskey bar cabinet. Now how in the fuck am I supposed to not drink when there's bars like this that I can buy? Well what makes this a whiskey bar bill? Well you know what, you put whiskey than, Oh there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       he has little fucking holes in it. What? He reached down and you get the bottle like that comes up like Michael Jackson used to come up out of the stage. I don't know. I don't like shopping online. I'll tell you what I need man. I need a fucking fly swatter and mosquitoes. It just off the hook right now. Did I say off the hook that I say they're raising the roof? Did I used to watch fucking Arsenio Hall talk show back in the [inaudible] they, I think I did. I think I did. Um, yeah, these things are like, they are not taking any prisoners. This is a, this is special forces mosquitoes. I got like welts on me and shit and they are fast as shit. Oh my, my hand eye coordination isn't what it used to be. Um, but [inaudible] really makes the flyswatter is, is the holes in it. You know what I mean? So as it's moving through the air, it's like, it's like the stealth bomber. Nobody can here, you know, even though it's got a fucking jet engine, uh, sounding again here, it's that data. They can't pick it up on radar. Is that what it is? I don't know. I bet they can know. You know, we don't admit it because he spent so much money was like, oh we can't find that thing. And then they, they take pictures of it. Oh that's what it is. Okay. It looks like a, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       it looks like if someone was going to carve a cock, meaning a dick in a life and they didn't quite finish that in quite rounded off. Um, but anyways, the fly swatter cause it has all those holes. It's like a Prius when it first starts off. You know, you can't even, like if someone's trying to run you down with the Prius, when they first left the curb, you wouldn't hear it. By the time you really hear that engine fucking turned on, it will be too late. That's what it is. The flyswatter is the Prius of, um, of fly killers.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:15       I think right. Cause what else you got? You got that tape and you hang down. Um, I always thought that that was just brutal. That fucking, that's like that mouse thing because you just go into the glue trap and they're like fucking ripping themselves apart, trying to get out of it. Um, there's no need for that. All right. Just get a cat, those creepy ass fucking things.

Speaker 1:          00:26:39       MMM.

I don't fucking trust those things as far as I can throw on and I would throw in because it's going to land on its paws anyways. Right. Um, anyways, I have a plane to catch everybody. This had gotta be the biggest bunch of nonsense I've ever said in my fucking life. Um,

Speaker 7:          00:36:30       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       hey, what's going on? This is built bar and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, October 4th, 2010 and I'm doing it really, really late, super late, super, super late. Like that whore you banged a freshman year of fucking high school. You know, we'll stop stressing out about it. That's what's making it not happen. You're not fucking pregnant. And was that girl, everybody had that girl, right? The one girl who gets fucking pregnant like eighth grade, ninth grade, you know, you go back for your 10 year high school reunion and she's standing there with a 22 year old you like look at you. Good for you. Why you still got it? Actually that's my son. Um, that's right. She's standing there with their three kids and they all have like beards and mustaches are a full rack of titties. Um, anyways, I'm super late because, um, I hung around for an extra day in buffalo and uh, consumed about 9,000 calories.

Speaker 2:          00:37:38       I went to a, the buffalo bills New York jets game and then afterwards I went to the Buffalo Sabre Philadelphia flyers game. And uh, I just had a fucking awesome time out there, man. I'm the first night actually worked in Albany, New York. I was working the egg and I want to thank everybody who showed up. Man. I had a great turnout for both shows. It's my first little, uh, my first little dip into the theater market. Stuck my little toe in there. You know? Yeah. MMM. But I gotta tell you, man, I had the scariest fucking flight I've had in like 10 years flying in from Chicago to Albany, right. I live out here on the fucking west coast now. So yeah, for some goddamn reason, Los Angeles is this international airport. But well that's not true. It's because it's the other side of the country. I mean, I can get a fucking direct flight.

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       So like, uh, I dunno Bakersfield, I'm trying to pick some fucking obscure city, but whatever, to get to Albany, I got to fly into Chicago and then I that which was, which was no problem. Then I flew from Chicago to Albany and when we came in on final approach, I don't know what happened, the guys like, we're coming in for final approach and we just was, we were in this fucking soup, we were in this chop or whatever the pilots call and we're just going up 500 feet down 600 backups, seven and we're just in this shit. And, uh, as I, as I've stated before here on the podcast, I don't mind turbulence when I'm way up in the fucking air, I don't give a shit drop a thousand feet worth 30,000 off the fucking ground. I don't care. Right. But when you're like coming in on final approach, all of a sudden drop in five, 600 feet, you know, you start hitting TV and tennis like back in the day, like Fred Flintstone when he didn't want to get busted for whatever the fuck he was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       Right. And he started driving around the neighborhood last. So in the end tennis, what that was he doing? Was He cheating on Wilma? Am I doing some, some stand up comedy material from the 1980s? Is that, is that what I'm doing? Who was the deal? Um, so we're just in this shit and this guy says we're in final approach. Okay. And like 15 fucking minutes later, I'm, I'm, I'm just looking out the window doing what I always do. Go and give me some lights. Let me see some fucking lights of the city so I can figure out how high up we are so I can figure out how much I need to be freaking out. And we just kept flying through this shit and it was like really, really bad to the point I was actually feeling a little bit queasy, right? And this guy's not saying shit and I'm thinking, fuck, we're flying into Albany, who flies into Albany, you know, is that the the fucking, is that Tom Brady flying that plane or do we got the backup?

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       Why don't we know his fucking name? Albany. The studs. They fly into JFK, they fly into Laguardia, they fly in to Newark. They don't fly into Albany. Right. So I'm sitting there freaking the fuck out going out. God, we've got, we got the fucking backup to the backup. We've got Trent Dilfer is backup pliant flying the Goddamn plane. And uh, so I did some, I haven't done in awhile. I started praying to God, Huh? Oh Gee. He h that's how bad it was. Either fucking hedge my bets going, hey, you know, I been talking a lot of trash about you on the Monday morning podcast. Wait a minute, do I even need to explain it considering you know everything? Um, now, seriously. I was like, all right, all right, sorry for this. Sorry for that. Sorry for my ceds. And I'm really starting to get nervous because we're still fucking, you know, people's stomachs to drop in and I'm really fucking praying.

Speaker 2:          00:41:25       And then all of a sudden I heard this woman, uh, puke like 10 rows back, right? Everybody is like visibly nervous and no one has let out the bitchy scream yet. And then I just hear this lady like 12 rows back here, right? So I start laughing my fucking ass off. It's exactly what I need. A little bit of humor so I can just completely pave over any sort of emotion that I'm feeling. And then we were back in the fucking chop again. And then the pilot finally comes on and says, yeah, they have us in a holding pattern because you can see there's a storm. And what I didn't get was, why didn't you fly up above it or fly east of the shit or get away from it? We just stayed in it. We were flying in circles in this fucking storm and we would, we would get to the point where it was sort of tolerable and then go back into it again.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       And uh, it was really getting bad and I was trying to read a magazine and made me like car sick, which I guess is air sick when you're up there, but it's the same shit. And uh, and then I heard this guy like two rows behind me, you know, he let out this really bitchy like, Ooh, as we were going over the thing and I actually made me fucking angry, you know, Christ's sake hold you fucking get yourself together. Fucking start making those noises, making everybody scared you asshole. So we did that, but that's what it was for fucking 40 minutes. We were in this shit and people were puking. People will make an woo woo, like literally like that and a, and I'm sitting there trying to fucking remember what prayers you're suppose to say from back in the days when I was an altar boy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       Right? You're fucking rang the bells. And on the third day he said, this is what I've done for you. I can't remember how to say this is my body, which will be given up for you. That's right. You ring it. Dang it. Dang it. Dang. With the fucking the bells there. At least that's how we did it. You know? That's the only lame attempt at my church we made to try to fucking compete with whatever was going on fucking in the inner city. Right? They probably had Aretha Franklin headline in or some shit. You just had me looking like a young fucking oop Cunningham, whatever the fucking goddamn dude's name was. I never watched that show. The Andy Griffith show. I always found it depressing watching those broke ass southern people that town drunk, who's never funny to me. So anyways, we finally fucking land and everything was good and go to Albany.

Speaker 2:          00:44:05       I do the Gig. Everything's fucking great. Then I go out to buffalo, driving across the state in New York. Absolutely gorgeous day. And this second, I even get within the facility, first of all, every time he was a fucking five hour drive, six hour drive from Albany to buffalo. What? Uh, I dunno, I dunno. I Dunno how people drive, but a, you can go a lot faster than that. Three hours and 50 minutes you pussies. So I go in there and the second I get into buffalo, it's like fucking pouring down rain. I'm sorry. I thought I hit the stop on here. It just immediately was the most miserable fucking weather. And uh, I ended up doing my show and I don't know what's going on. I'm fucking tired and I lost interest in this story. What do you think about that?

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       how do I regroup here? You don't fuck me up cause I thought I stop my recorder. God dammit. This is why I don't do my podcasts on the same day that I fly is because I'm so fucking sleepy that I, I can't, I can't focus. I keep trying to fucking keep the momentum going and I, I just can't do it. I just can't fucking do it. Let's, let's just try to hit the highlights. I get to Buffalo, I do the Goddamn show. I have a great time. And uh, the other comedian I'm working with, me and Paul Versey, we're like, well, you know, this is buffalo. They are known for their wings. They're always talked and shit, right? Philly cheese steak. You go to Philly, you get a cheese steak, right? You go to fucking Atlantic City, you get you, you get fucking, you get your dick suck in the alley.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       Right behind the fucking blue and beige Trump casino. You do. You, you do what the Ryan when in Rome, you do what the Romans do. So fuck it. We're in Buffalo. Let's go get some goddamn buffalo wings. Let's go get some wings. So a, there's two places to go. You either go to Tufts, he got to anchor bar and Tufts was right down the street. So we said, fuck it. Let's go there. And I gotta tell you, you want to talk about living up to the hype. Best fucking wings I ever had. All right. [inaudible] had a crunchy outside. You don't like when people don't know how to make the wings around the rest of the country. When the crunch, the outside is crunchy, that means a, as my dad would say, Christ, you're cooked. They shit out of that. Um, yeah. Usually that means somebody over cooked it. Oh, is my debt eloquently puts it. Cook the shit out of it. That's what he's always here. Christ, you're cooked his shit out of it. Um, face all twisted up. Anyways, that's back when you could curse in restaurants, you know, tell you it's so, we lost so many rights after nine 11, I swear to God. Remember you used to be able to walk into Mcdonald's and you get your French fries and they would call and he could just yell at the manager, Hey, hey fucking dude. Yeah. Yeah. What the f well, they're fucking cold. I'm sorry sir. Let me get you some other ones. Yeah, you do that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:11       Right. Isn't that what you were able to do or those my drinking years, I can't remember. That's how I, that's how I did it. So anyways, once again, I've lost my train of thought. I don't know where I am. Yeah. So we go in there and, and, and they're literally, they're fucking crunchy on the outside and they're, they're juicy on the inside and they got unbelievable sauce. Then we got the duff beer. It was the shit. Now, evidently when Obama went there, there's, there's another place. It's a place called anchor bar. And I guess when Obama went there, he flipped a coin. He went to duff. So we went to the same place the president went to. But then afterwards, um, ah, fuck it. I got to tell that part of the store out. Jesus. You know what this is? This is like, uh, the first draft of a script, except this is all I got budget for.

Speaker 2:          00:47:56       This is [inaudible] be like a fucking Edward Movie Cut. That was perfect. Moving on. So the next day I go to the, the bills game. All right. And I'm, I'm, I'm uh, I'm doing my little hundred dollar bet. I'm picking three games against the spread. Once again, this week I went one and two. I went one and two last week. So I'm two and four, a pitiful two and four. Even if I teased my teams last week, I still would have lost with the fucking, uh, falcons beaten the saints and over time. So this week, who did I have? First of all, dumbest get you can do as a gambler is I bet with my heart. So I'm sitting there going, right, the bills are getting five. I know every football fan and out there right now is going, oh gee. She said, that's cause you know the fucking final result. All right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:41       I'm thinking all right. The jets had been playing great. They should go in and absolutely destroy this team. It's fucking raining hour. It's a divisional Ravelry. This is the exam. They got a couple of injuries in their secondary, these exact kind of a fucking game that goes the exact opposite way, right? And plus I hate the jet. So I say, fuck it, I'm taking the pills. And then I also took the Bengals against Cleveland. I lost that one. And there was one other one that I took. I pick the fucking ravens. I got to stick with the Ravens. Man. The Ravens had been good to me and solve the lions, but I think the cat's out of the bag that the lions can actually hang so then it can be getting fucking 13 point spreads anymore. But anyways, um, so I show up there, right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:22       And I'm walking into the stadium. It's fucking rain and out. Ah, Jesus. I fucked this part of the story up to you know what? Fuck this podcast. Great. She had cooked the shit out of it. Um, yeah, it was fucking raining on. This is one thing I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're dealing with the elements, this is the more of a douchebag you look like the warmer you're going to be. All right. I saw the rain and I said, fuck this. And we went right to Dick's sporting goods and I'm like, I'm buying that fucking, I'm going to buy a raincoat with the matching raincoats slacks. I don't give a fuck. I bought a pair of a wool socks and I was good to go. So I'm with Versie and you know they only had like two raincoats left and they were the exact same color.

Speaker 2:          00:50:20       This fucking grapes, slush puppy purple. So we both have matching extra large fucking, we got the jackets and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and what green we're bringing in the fucking soul plane. Right. That was a purple airplane. Right. That's what we look like. So we show up to the game, right. Neither one of us is comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills fan. So we're in enemy territory and a, it's fucking drizzling it out. It's fucking cold. So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit, right? And right off the bat, Versie starts pumping outgoing, man, I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna wear that. I'm just going to wear the top. I'm just going to wear the top, trying to act like it's not raining out that bed. The reality is, is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to, if the two of us walked in with our purple on Purple fucking raincoats times two, we would've got a ton of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       And I was prepared to take it. I had, I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing. I don't give a fuck. So he punked out. So, uh, we ended up walking in and put my head's cold, right? All I have is a baseball cap on. So I'm like, fuck, I gotta buy a head. Can I buy a bills? Who gives a fuck there? And last pace being owned by a bill's head. And then I saw this, this one with the Patriot logo on it. I said, fuck it. I'll get that. Once I put that one on, I'm nice and warm. We go to, we'll call, we pick up our tickets. We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I actually love. It looks like an old school football stadium. You know what I like about that football stadium?

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       That's about the size of a football stadium that holds real fans. You know what I mean? All these, these new ones that hold like 100,000 fucking pets, all the bandwagon shitheads you know when you're all in for the real fucking fans show up. Oh and three, right? So we walk into the Goddamn stadium with love and life, right? I'm already laughing at [inaudible] cause I know damn well what's gonna Happen? He's going to walk out there. There's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through his God damn jeans and his fucking bbds. And he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up nut sack that's going to be getting hypothermia by second quarter. Why do I know this? Because I've been there. So we get a couple of beers, we get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       We're good to go. We go in there, sit down. He sits basically down in a fucking puddle. He tried to stick a newspaper down, which is a very absorbent and uh, I don't know, we sat there and I had hope for about eight seconds in that game and the jets came down and just fucking Jew. They just kicked the shit out of him. Christ. They kicked the shit out of 'em and uh, it was just over. So we'd, so immediately, our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the masters. We're like, fuck it, let's, let's, let's get going here. Right? So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss. Right? So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this, this fucking six foot five goofy looking jackass, one of those guys who's like six foot five, but you still think he can take him, cause he's just covered in baby fat.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       You know, he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks are rosier than Saint Nick. Right? And he's got this Jersey on and this big stupid, I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it. The stuff, you know, he's the Wacky Guy, so I'm not even thinking shit, right. This is bill's jets. I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm not talking any shit. I'm fine. I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat. And all of a sudden this big goofy jackass starts going, well, what's what? Yeah, were you're a patriots fan. He liked the rats. We got to ran away the rats. He likes to fucking read this shit, right? And I'm like, yeah, you know, whatever. He starts giving me shit. I start giving them shit back. Then the weirdest fucking thing happened. By the time I get in to the actual men's room, I've talked, I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually, there's bills and jets fans at a bills and jets game.

Speaker 2:          00:54:40       They're playing each other. They stopped giving each other shit and they teamed up together and started giving me shit. Right. And then I just said, I don't know what I was thinking. I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd. I wasn't thinking like, Hey, you know what bill? You really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing fucking street hockey in the sixth grade. If I didn't give a fuck, I'm in a goddamn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough by the way. And uh, and then they just started giving up fucking this one dude. Such go on Tom Brady Sucks Dick. He Sucks Dick. And he's like miming it like ridiculously well. So I'm like, Hey, you know, buddy, you do that real well because I learned it by watching Tom Brady or Michael. Yeah. Did you rent that porno?

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       You fucking fag gets a little uglier. Gets a little uglier than this other dude. What the fuck are you doing? I came up with the hell he was saying to me and I just said, look, I'm sorry. You guys have never won a super bowl, you know, then the jets fan pipes in. I go, do you realize the last time you guys won a Superbowl, Charlie Chaplin was still alive? Do you understand that? Do you know what cars look like the last time you won? You fucking morons. And then, uh, then this other guy got the two, we've won three super bowls, I'm sorry. Right? And then the guy goes, well, you didn't play in the games. I go, neither did you. Then he's just standing there with this dumb look on his face. I go, that's right. I keep staring forward. You've got nothing forgetting that I don't know how to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:56:10       So all of a sudden it's my turn to Piss. I take my dick out, I'm ready to Piss. And one of these fucking pussies pushed me in the back hoping that I was pissing at the time. Fortunately I wasn't. So I turn around, I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman. I said, well Gee, I go, is that how you guys do it out here? Really? I go, which one do you guys pushed me like I'm gonna fuck like I'm fucking Jackie Chan. And for some reason none of them said anything. I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my eye, but I'm a fucking 42 year old balding redhead talk and Shit in there. And none of them said anything. So now it's kind of funny to me. I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I didn't have a hand whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       So I don't know who the fuck pushed me, but that's what I mean. Come on. Bitchy is move with the fucking week. How do you do that? How do you do that? How do you, how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss into a fucking trough? I mean, how do you get lower than that? Do you guys have any ideas? How'd he get lower than that? So then after none of them said anything, I go back and I started taking a piss. And then that other dude who was miming somebody's sucking a dick unbelievably well right next to me. Well, one of those stupid hats that has the toggles on the side and he's still trying to give me shit and I'm gonna go fuck yourself. And then he just starts screaming over and over again. Are you looking at my deck?

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       Are you looking at my deck like maniacally, like five times. I just sort of stared at him like, why do you keep going this, this gay angle? Like why is there always a, I dunno. I think he was one of those guys. He was kind of in the closet and then, uh, so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill the families. I think he liked me. That's what I'm saying. So if he's listening to this, I'm sorry. Uh, I'm, I'm spoken for you fucking pants. You fucking believe that. First of all, what's wrong with me? I really replay it, all of that in my head. Cause once I got out of there I was like, I really started thinking like, what? What did you think you were going to do in there? They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things. Clint Eastwood would say, what? What the fuck is wrong with you dude? Like, I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast, a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight. There is nothing soft. There's everything is porcelain pipes that concrete floor and then it has a mist of piss and shit. It's just the fuck it is the worst. So the worst place ever, you know, not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person has begun the pissing process.

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       So, uh, you know, older little bit wiser. So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's what you need after an incident like that. And I was just kinda just sitting there thinking like, all right, now how should I have played that w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started giving me shit. What I should've done was roll with it. I Shit you liked the Patriots. I should've been like, hey, you know you guys scored 30 on his last week, man. You guys look great man. I bet the jets, I mean I bet against the jets. I hope you guys should have just ended it with that and did it. I've, I sh I should have, I should have extended an olive branch. That's what I should've done in the future. That's what the fuck I'm going to do because, uh, that was a, a, that was a potentially ugly situation, but fortunately, mmm. Yeah. I think the people who are doing it, you know, had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that level. Uh, and when I say fortunately, I mean for me and my face,

Speaker 9:          01:00:15       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       Oh, do you know how bad that would have been to get stomped in that fucking purple on purple rain coat laying there with my dirty fucking patriots hat and my team wasn't even playing. I, I would've lost the lawsuit. They would've been like, let me get this straight. You're a patriots fan, you're a patriots hat to a bill's jets game and you somehow manage to get the shit kicked out of you. What the fuck did you say? You know, that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take responsibility for your, for your actions. See, what would it be like? There's no excuse. There's no reason. I don't care what happened, you know, and he had a girl, which is true, you don't in a fucking girl, but there's no learning in that. There's no lesson. Okay. You know, even my best friends would have been like, yeah, those guys are fucking assholes in the, but you know, they wouldn't have been an awkward pause and it would have been like, dude, what the fuck he talking shit for by yourself at a game when your team isn't even fucking play.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       What's wrong with you? You're 42 years old, get your shit together. And they would have been right. So anyways, fortunately the bills, uh, are smart enough to stop serving alcohol at halftime. So when I went to go get more beer, um, there, there, there wasn't any to be had. So I walked back there and I'm laughing my ass off telling Versie the fucking story and he informed me that fucking Sanchez threw a bomb to that fucking drunk driver there. And um, and I was just like, God, Jesus, here we go. Here we go with the fucking patriots, let up 30 points to this fucking team. And the jets are raping them like this other patriots that bad. I say we were in [inaudible] nine and 17. Now I'm thinking fucking seven and nine, so, uh, whatever. So that was rough. And then I ended up getting into it with some other jet Fan.

Speaker 2:          01:02:07       I'm just a dick. I'm a Dick when I'm sober. And then you add alcohol and that goes to the next level. And then I don't, when I go to a sporting event, I become another person entirely. I don't know what it is. I just, uh, I don't know. I love it. I love being at the game. I met the stadium, I get excited and then I'm a dick and I say, I say things that I shouldn't be saying. And I just started giving this lady shit and she was bragging about the jets and I just kept asking her over and over again, what is it like to share a stadium?

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       You know, why couldn't she just sit there and enjoy the fact that she was winning? Why did I have to ruin it? Why is my level of hatred for all New York teams to that, to that level? It's pathetic. It's really pathetic, but it is what it is. So anyways, most people would call it a day after that point, but not me. Not for Z, not us. Fuck Dad. We're going to the sabers flyers game after this, there's more bears to be drank. So, and we got to check out this fucking anchor bar to compare their wings to Duff's. Right. We're fucking doing buffalo up. That's what you do. You sit out in the fucking shit. Uh, whether you watch the bills, get their ass kicked, you almost get beat down with your dick out in the fucking bathroom. And then you go get some wings and hit the Sabres game afterwards.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       If there's something else to do out there. I didn't see it. Alright. Nagra falls. What am I fucking honeymoon anyways? Who goes to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon? Huh? How far back into this staples warehouse are you working that, that's where you go. That's what I want to know. So anyways, uh, fucking cruise back to the hotel. Get Out of our fucking, uh, uh, Barney the dinosaur fucking raincoats and uh, I had to get directions. We fucking flew down to the, the Sabres game. This is what kills me. We, we go to, we go to anchor bar first. I was thinking the game was at seven and eight. Turns out it's at fucking six. So we're pulling into anchor bar at a quarter to six, getting ready to have some fucking wings. We're still, we're just having a great time doing, I can just put the windows down.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       I could smell him. This is going to be the shit right? Just lit. I literally gained like 20 pounds yesterday. So right as we pull in, the radio comes on and says, you know, the Sabres sabers already dropped the puck and 15 minutes. So we're like fuck. And we start driving really fast, not knowing where we were going to go because the plan was to get wings and then you know, with sauce on a face, beer, woo shavers play. That's that. That was, that was the game plan. But now we have to fucking start driving and we ended up pulling over and uh, these three black dudes walking across the street roll down the window. A, do you have any idea where the sabers, ah, look at me breaking down stereotypes and it turns out, uh, the dude, we're after actually African or we go where, you know, how do we get to the HSBC us as see fucking arena. And he's like, oh dude, he's very far [inaudible] I carry, I can't do an African accent, but I could just tell the way he was rolling his eyes that it was really far. But I was thinking, wait a minute, this guy's walking. Does he mean by bus?

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       Who the fuck knows? Whatever. Long story short, we ended up getting up there. So we just think we're going to walk up. It's a preseason game. We're just going to buy tickets at the booth. No can do. I think I bought a bad pack of batteries. They said fucking Duracell on him. I think they will bootleg these God damn things. They're only good for a half a fucking hour. All right, let's pick up the pace with the damn story again. So we walk up there, it's a, it's a preseason game and we go up to buy tickets and they're sold out. Unbelievable for the Sabres flyers that were like, fuck, they're going to drop the puck in five minutes. We go, we got to go scout some tickets and I didn't see anybody selling near the arena. And I came walking out and I see this nerdy looking white dude with a sweater walking up and I just yelled, who's got tickets?

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       And he's girls. I got two right here. I got two right here and then we'll fucking bottom off 60 bucks a whack. Sat right on the club level. They've got everything from Sushi to, I don't think I have Sushi, but they had like ice cream, which is really fucking ridiculous at a hockey game. Maybe you get an ice cream sandwich, but they had like, it looked like a, what's that Italian rest? That restaurant? The Italian uh, ice cream. That's dish gelato. They get like that level ice cream. You know, are you really going to come back with that on a cone licking a cone? As you watch two people beat the shit out of each other. Um, so anyways, so then we get, it's just first of all, the sabers arena is this shit. All right. For the exact opposite reason. Reason that I love the buffalo.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       I love the Buffalo Bills Stadium because it reminds me it's white. It's what football stadiums look like when I was a kid. And I'm not insulting you guys out there. I think it's the shit. I like it. I hate those brand new fucking stadiums that are the size of a god Damn Mountain. I hate him. I can't stand them. They're too fucking expensive. They rape you in the ass for four tickets because they gotta pay for the Fat Fox who sit in the luxury boxes, who don't even give a shit about the damn team and they want to sit inside and watch your game. Fuck all those places. So, but the Sabres, as far as a new arena, man that's right up there with, uh, as far as the new arenas, girl was the best one I've seen. I like the Minnesota wild. The Phoenix coyotes had a really nice one.

Speaker 2:          01:08:07       And the worst one I've been to was the Boston Bruins. We have the worst brand new fucking arena you are ever going to go to. It's like a bomb shelter. They went out, they went down to the fucking Grossman's hardware and they bought up all the cinder blocks in the state. That's what they did. And then they just glued them together and painted them yellow and fucking black. There you go. There you go. That's where we can put the Bruins and the 17 time world champion, Boston Celtics. There you go. Give you some yellow plastic seats. Have Fun. Everybody put the sabers arena, man. It was, it was, it was beautiful. Scoreboard was to shit. And they had the, uh, the sabers head hang on. That was fucking awesome. And it, when the game was nine to two Sabres kicked the shit out of him. And, uh, you know, I was made fun of those people who listen to the radio when they a watch a game, like what?

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       You can't see what the fuck's going on? Well, evidently I couldn't because I saw what I thought was uh, uh, Daniel Carsello getting beaten down to the ice. I saw this saber and this flyer go at it and they appeared to both drop the gloves and the Saber guy went, what? Dash where? Dash twice straight in this guy's face. And by the second one the guy was falling backwards to the ice and he did, you know that final UFC, you're not knocked out enough. I'm going to punch you as you're on the ground overhand, right where [inaudible] to his fucking face. And I was like, wow. Wow. Who was that? Who did that? And who was that? Who got fucked up? And then five minutes later Carsello was over by the penalty box and he got a game is conduct. I go, did he do that to Carsello and was he embarrassed?

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       So he came out and he tried to do a handsome brother thing and fight him. The second the dude came out and, uh, turned out it wasn't him, it was somebody else. And I heard he didn't even drop the gloves, which is explain why. What does we're dodge would doge happened. How do you do that? How do you not drop the gloves when someone else drops the gloves? Even if you don't want to fight, can't you just fucking dropped the gloves to hang on and turn the other way and give up the back of your head?

Speaker 2:          01:10:23       How I would have fought in that bathroom. Oh, the noise. Can you imagine the noise of five people trampling me? The echoing the perfect acoustics of a fucking goddamn men's room. Um, anyways, so, uh, and then we end the night, the end of the night we, uh, we saw a great God damn game, saw that six 48 psychopath that I want to see Chara fight on defense. And then we went, uh, we left and going down to anchor bar and we show up and get this for the third time in the history of that place, they ran out of wings. They ran out of winks. Like, are you fucking kidding me? Went down there to watch the giants game versus a big giants fan. Right. So we go, fuck it, we'll stay here anyways. And uh, I dunno, ask Paul about there. I don't want to trash the place cause I know which legendary, but go on Paul's Facebook page and ask him how he enjoyed the mixed drinks there because, uh, he had a little issue.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       He had a little bit of an issue there. You know what I mean? You know the deal a, let me get, let me get absolute, uh, on the rocks and the, Eh, absolutely. You know, and then you just see them pouring it out of a fucking jelly jar and you're like, what? What kind of absolute is that? Eh, ah, absolutely. Uh, my friends, vodka daddy makes down the street. You fucking pricks. So we actually didn't have a good time and anchor bar. We showed up and uh, they were out of wings and then they tried to pass off some shit. Vodka is the real thing. Is that how they do it at the anchor bar?

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       I'm still going to go back there and try their wings. I gotta I gotta check it out. I mean, I liked everything inside. You go inside there and they had like fucking, it was like a motorcycle museum, like real motorcycles above it. They had license plates everywhere from like Hawaii to like the northwest territories. They like license plate shaped like a bear in there. That's how far north these fucking ice road truckers come to calm down and get the MCL, some fucking buffalo wings. So we did it up. We did Buffalo, you know, actually if I got into a fight and lost but didn't really get hurt, that really would have made, that would have been great. A little bit of blood in my purple fucking raincoat. The fuck is wrong with me, but let's get to the questions this week everybody. This is actually a really a, considering that that happened.

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       And, um, I let me, I just, I had somebody sent me a great podcast question about that under the new topic, sports cuts. Um, and by the way, I'm going to get out of the sports talk after a while, cause like, remember when I went real hardcore conspiracy theory and talked about banks every week and then that got boring. Well, the sports thing is only going to be interesting for so fucking long, but uh, we are, we're really in the throes of it right now. I know for a lot of you, this is like during the soprano's when Tony was in that fucking a out of body state where he walked around, didn't talk like Tony Soprano. Remember that shit? Do you, okay. Um, let me adjust the levels here. Hope these aren't too loud. Okay. So here you go. Sports cuts a bill. Um, all right.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       Anyway, uh, all of your jets hating made me want to email you a, I went to the jets pats game for week two. I'm a patriots fan by the way, and I love to hear you. Uh, your take on fans who attend football games, it's fucking incredible. I went with my girlfriend who was wearing a Brady Jersey. Now know that this is an away game. Everybody, okay. They went to New Jersey to watch the New York jets play in giants stadium. It's [inaudible] which fucking middlish shut up. Um, we pull into the parking lot and every and people were literally moving their chairs into the open parking open parking space, not letting me park saying patriots aren't allowed here. And He, the guy writes, ha ha ha, I get it now. Can you please move? No one would fucking move. It's amazing. It's like, okay, I fucking get it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       You hate the patch now. Get the fuck out of my way and let me park. So they finally move and we get out and start walking towards the stadium. Uh, he goes, these people start following us, calling us every name you can think of. Um, and he's like, like, really? Do you have a f? Do you, what? Do you have a fucking family or anything else in your life? You take this game, this seriously? I would've said something, but there were like nine guys. Well, Hey, welcome to my world. Welcome the Meyer with. He's just thank, thank God you weren't taking a piss at that time. Uh, but they were like nine guys in like six girls calling me up, patriots loving faggot. Then he writes faggot. Really? So we keep walking and pass some normal people who heckle in the right way. You're going down, Brady sucks.

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       I get that. Ha Ha. It's fine. Um, best come back by the way is just to keep walking through the parking lot, responding with 1969. They hate that, but I only pull that card in response. Okay. So now we're going up the escalator. Some guys going the other way on the escalator and starts screaming you Rhombus is ugly as that fucking Brady Jersey you have on. Oh, they're saying that to your girlfriend. Wow. Go Back to Boston. You faggot a what the fuck? Uh, then at our seats there was a fucking Jew. Stupp roid head screaming his fucking face off, turning red, punching the shit out of the seats, screaming the entire game. There was a fucking dad and his 12 year old daughter in front of us.

Speaker 2:          01:16:22       Anyway, I just love to hear your take on these fucking lunatics. Like I get it. You love football, but really, is there nothing else in your life that you take this seriously? Um, all right. Um, while you're talking to a guy who's been on boats, I've never gone, I've never called someone a faggot and I never do that. There's more of us than you. So I'm to try to intimidate you thing. I'm more of the, uh, loan wise ass talking shit to someone who can beat the shit out of me. But this is what you got to understand. All right? Just to avoid these situations as sports fans, um, this is, this is what I've found. You can, all right, first of all, if you're going to go into another person's stadium, okay. And not only were the other team's Jersey, but the Jersey of a team that is literally kicked the shit out of the other team.

Speaker 2:          01:17:20       I mean, the Patriots since 2001 have basically kicked the shit out of the jets twice a year. Every fucking year for almost 10 years, or the very least, we've won like 80% of the fucking games. Um, so that jersey, it's like, you know, you got to understand that you're, you're bringing up a lot of bad memories. Um, and I'm, yeah, those people who actually don't let you park there. Yeah, they are taking it too far. There's a little bit on both sides, you know what I mean? It's like you kind of, you know, you know, slicing your leg and then jumping in a shark infested water and then getting upset that you get your fucking leg bid off. I mean, I think it's bullshit. Uh, I don't know, but I do get it. Like people should get shit. Okay. That roided out guys. Who, who's punching the back of the seats?

Speaker 2:          01:18:18       Like the, I mean that's, that's kind of par for the course. I hate to say it, it is par for the course. Like the eagles fans really get, our Philly fans get way too much credit for psychos. They kind of act, it's kind of like racism, how they act like it's only white people in the south. You know, like that's where it is and it's Kinda like Philly gets all the shit or credit depending if you're proud of it and not that like only moron asshole fans are in Philly. I mean, I've been to games in Philly, the word, one of the worst experiences I had was uh, going to a San Diego chargers game once again with my Patriot fucking hat on like an asshole. You'd think I learned from that. Um, yeah, my take on that is, yeah, you know, there should be this fun talking shit and then there's the talk and shit where it's not fun.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       Like someone pushes you away trying to take a piss or they start, you know, seeing your girlfriend's ugly or whatever the fuck they were trying to say there. Um, but you know, if you wear the Jersey of the o team, you walk in, you got to expect that someone's going to call you a pussy or probably throw the last bite of their hotdog at you. What's going to happen? People are drinking and, uh, you know, a lot of people don't like their lives. They don't like who they're married to. Maybe they don't like their job. Um, or maybe they're just a Dick, who knows? But, uh, you gotta understand that basically, you know, you wore the Jersey of a team that's won three Superbowls into the stadium. Have a team that, like I said, Charlie Chaplin was alive the last time that jets wanting, okay, Harry Truman was alive. Dwight d Eisenhower was alive the last time. The jets wanting all right. And I'm not trying to give the judge Shit, I'm just, I'm just trying to show compassion here. Brett Farve wasn't even alive the last time the jets wanted. Okay, so you gotta, you gotta be a little more compassionate to the jets fan. I mean, like the Dallas cowboys were considered bridesmaids could always get to the big dance, but could never win it. The last time the jets, when the Superbowl, you know, Richard Nixon was president. Spiro Agnew was vice president.

Speaker 2:          01:20:43       Cost of a new home was $27,500. That was the average price. Average cost of a new car was $3,270. The last time that Jay, I'm not giving the judge Shit here by bringing out these staggering facts. I'm just trying to say, you know, you gotta, you gotta show a little compassion. You have to understand that these poor bastards, the last time they won it, the population of this country was only at 202 million. Do you want to stand that they have one in a long fucking time. Price of gas was 35 fucking sense. Do you really think that you're going to walk in with the Jersey of a guy who's created them so much fucking misery, who was a haircut that they can't stand? Who's banging the hottest fucking broad in the planet right now? You don't live in the life that they want to live, but can't, you know as they strain in the upper deck to try to figure out what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       Yes. You're going to get called a faggot. Do I think it's right? No. I wish there was friendlier ball busting. I really wish that more people knew how to break balls and including myself. More people knew when to shut the fuck up like me, you know, like I should have, I should have tapped out buddy and I didn't. So, uh, anybody have any odd, bad sporty, uh, what's your worst experience as a fan? Like I could tell you, like back in the day, I would wear like a red sox hat to a Yankees game in Yankee stadium before 2004, I would do it because, you know, we had, what did we do to them except blow leads and lose. But once we fucking hung the biggest choke and professional sports history around their goddamn next, then it became a different thing. And then we won it again.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       And then all of a sudden I noticed it started getting hostile. I was like, all right, this isn't cool anymore. This isn't being taken as, this isn't a funny thing anymore. This I'm not the fucking, uh, the fucking happy go lucky kid who's just hoping to see it once. I've seen it twice since the last time they won it. And I notice simply got ugly this same way. The Patriot's stadium went from a, an absolute fucking zoo to being this, this sort of classier place to go see a Goddamn game when we were winning. And that was the thing. Anybody can be classy when they're winning, but you know, you see who your fans really are when you're fucking losing. Yeah. Like when the Patriots, I mean, red sox finally beat the Yankees and that they didn't like when a rod slap the ball down.

Speaker 2:          01:23:17       They didn't like that. They didn't get that call. Like they had been so many other fucking years. That goddamn fans, Poland routine fly balls into the fucking stands for home runs, Reggie Jackson leaning into the ball. They always get those calls and all of a sudden they didn't get and they threw fucking tamper tantrum started littering the field. Right. The classy Manhattan nights that they are. So, I dunno. Yeah. Um, yes. Basically all sports fans, behavior needs to be a needs to improve. And uh, it starts with me just like that Michael Jackson Song. Huh? Starting with the man in the mirror. Um, no one did. They push me purple on purple rain coat. I wasn't even fucking ticket, I would have pushed me too. All right. Question of the week. Uh, somebody wrote bill, why do you hate stoners? Oh yeah. Cause last week I was making fun of my stone, a friend. Uh, I don't hate stoners. I was, I'm, I don't like stoners who call me up and trash my life because they don't like their own. All right. Stop making it about yourself. All right. And uh, this person actually wrote and thought that I smoked weed, which is a, that's one of the things that is a known unknowing about stoners is after they smoke long enough, they think that the only way to have creative thought is to be sucking the Dick of that plant.

Speaker 9:          01:24:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:42       Well I just lost my stone or pop. I just don't, uh, um, I don't, you know what it is. I don't like the fucking, I don't like putting smoke in my lungs. Yeah. I just, you know, there's two things. You don't want your lungs, okay. You don't want smoke and you don't want water. So I wouldn't slowly inhale a glass of water, you know, and slowly drown myself over 60 years. I wouldn't do that either. But, uh, I have to admit I've tried weed a couple of times. I didn't try it till I was like 37 to how hilarious is that? And then I finally tried it and it was exactly what I was afraid of was I fucking loved it. But, uh, I just can't, I just can't get that, that image of that person smoking through the hole in their throat. I just, yeah, I don't want lung cancer, so I don't fuck with it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:27       But uh, it's a lot harder to see your liver shriveling up as you booze. MMM. Anyways. Hey Bill, have you seen the uh, the infomercial for the I renew bracelet? I'm sure you have. It's this magic bracelet that makes you have better balance, strength, endurance, and sleep better. Hell, you might even be wearing one right now to bring up, to bring the funny out in you. Uh, it's a little piece of rubber with a shiny piece of metal on it probably cost $2 to make a hundred of them. Yeah. Um, it channels your body's energy or some shit. Maybe it works. I don't know. You know what's crazy? People are buying these things for $20 a pop. Someone's getting rich off this gimmick. God bless them for finding an angle to make some dough. Uh, I think it's in the same category as the $50 gold coins for 10 bucks.

Speaker 2:          01:26:18       Yeah, it's exactly at, I think whoever came up with that as a genius and those really bad actors where they, they act like they can't stand upright. Yet somehow they were able to make it to the mall to go on film with those stupid braces. And the second they put the bracelet on, oh my God. It's amazing. Like I can't believe it. Um, yeah. Bracelets are a great way to go. You know what you do make a bracelet that actually says a, it'll make your dick bigger or give you a flat tummy for the ladies. You know, something like that. I Dunno. I'm getting sleepy again. I told you some good stories here, haven't I? You know the last time that jet's won the Superbowl, Jim Brown was the all time Russia leading rusher and behind him was Joe Perry, not from Smith. Joe Perry from 1948 or so.

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       I don't even all the fuck he played for the top three would Jim Brown, Joe Perry and Jim Taylor. Okay. The guy from fucking Smith was second behind Jim Brown in rushing. That's how long it's been since the jets have wanted. So yeah, you can't wear a Tom Brady Jersey down there by the way. Thank God my patriots fucking one tonight. Jesus Christ. And I'll tell you as much as the score was, uh, you know, lopsided there. Jeez, there's a lot of water. There's a lot of water leaking into that ship. Jesus Christ, I don't know what the fuck is with our defense, but so much of the game we look like we're in a proven, it's fucking ridiculous. So my big prediction this week, now, my big prediction, my big question this week is if Ben Roethlisberger comes back, doesn't miss a goddamn step and just plays the way that guy can play and that defense plays the way it's been playing, uh, I put them on top, the AFC, I would say that they, they are, they are the team to beat the fact that they went three and one with a third string fucking quarterback and basically all, I mean we're what they lost in like the last play of the game.

Speaker 2:          01:28:31       They will, they will, they were that close to going for and oh, that's how good their fucking defenses. And then not only that, that third string quarterback got all that experience. I'll tell you, big Ben comes in, right? And just kicks ass. And then they just stick them in an armored car and they drive him past all those Hooters and just get them home. I think the Steelers might be going for number seven. How fucking Badass would that be? That would be that. That would something. Um, all right, here we go. I remember a couple of years ago, we will want Superbowl behind them. I'm like, here we go, Steelers and next we're going to catch them. And then what happened? Nothing. Then they want to more so we're fucking in the dust again. All right asshole friends. I asked you guys for some stories about asshole friends. Here's one for you.

Speaker 2:          01:29:21       Uh, just wanting to, so, uh, put up the right off the bed. Okay. Where do I start this? Fuck you guys. I'm tired. Why don't I just start at the beginning? Just wanted to say I know exactly what it's like to have a buddy who always seems to have shit in his diaper and just has that puppy dog look in his eye that says, hey bro, can you deal with my shit before I get a rash? Uh, last night I was at a local bar just relaxing and enjoying a couple of beers with the girl I'd been talking to and a buddy I hadn't seen in about a year. Moseys on over. I'm excited. You know, he's an old high school buddy and I'm expecting to have a good couple of good lasts with this guy right off the bat. I asked him how he's doing, uh, just expecting them to say, you know, say something like, good, how about you?

Speaker 2:          01:30:06       Like any normal icebreaking human being. Right? But he says, I say, how are you doing? Uh, he just size and looks at his beer and then do his feet. And I'm just like, Gad, damn it. Here we go. He goes on about, I was, mommy kicked him out of the House that he's got something wrong with his neck, that a heat pad won't get out. Something about a Dui. Then he has the nerve to complain how he got turned down for government assistant checks. It's like, if, have you ever heard of AIDS in Africa, motherfucker of Jesus. You went all the way to the end with that one. Uh, needless to say, I'm getting annoyed at this point and I say, well shit man, you know, we all got to grow up. What a great fucking line. Then I offered to talk to my boss to try and get this guy a job so he can get back on his feet.

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       He then looks offended, pissed off that I didn't rub his belly wipe is bubbling lips and tell him everything was going to be just fine and throw a couple of quarters into his Little Tin Cup. Exactly, exactly. How old are you? Fucking move on and get a Goddamn job, you bum. Um, so anyways, the guy announces when he, after the kids said, uh, you know, we all got to grow up sometime he, and he announces I wasn't born to be a slave dude. Fuck that noise. And I'm just thinking, yeah, maybe you shouldn't have been born at all. As I turned back to my lady, I know that's a harsh thought, but when you're born with the fully functioning brain in a nice area, with a good educational system, with every opportunity in the world to not suck, and you still apply for government assistance, it's like, do us tax rape victims of favor and do a triple Lindy Rodney Dangerfield style down a flight of fucking unforgiving. All right. Uh, yeah. I have to go with you on that one. Um, yeah, those guys, they're the fucking worst. I love that you said that to them too. While you know, we all got to grow up sometime.

Speaker 2:          01:32:13       I wasn't put on this earth to be his slave marriage. What are you fucking King? You're just going to sit around and have other people bring wealth to ya. I Dunno. I got no comeback for him. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm going to wrap this up then I shut it off again. No, I did not know. All right. Let's wrap it up. A little. Overrated, underrated and some youtube videos for the week. Um, overrated. Uh, popular rap and hip hop music since 1994. Um, if a six month old song is considered dated and dead than it wasn't good to begin with. No one listens to jar rule or Nelly or 50 cent anymore, just like no one will listen to Kanye West or little Wayne in five years. If music we're a food than modern mainstream rap would be Mcdonald's. It's on every corner. Easy to put together and it gives grownups horrible diarrhea.

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       All right. I don't know much about hip hop, but you know, think little Wayne 50 cent now, uh, since 1994. What about Biggie? You didn't like any of this shit. There's a couple of guys I know wasn't Nas illmatic wasn't around then. I don't know about that album, but everybody says that is unbelievable. I know what you're saying though. All these auto tune fucking songs out there. I get it. I get it. All right. Underrated. Not going out every weekend and spending $100 at a bar or a club. Yeah, I'm 21 and I'm supposed to get out there and have fun, meet New People and Shit. But like you said, it's hard to meet girls when it sounds like you've got a bass drum chilling in your ear. Just not, just not in a way, it's some broad, you know, you won't sleep, you know, won't sleep.

Speaker 2:          01:33:54       What? Just nodding away at some broad, you know, you won't sleep with and you're just hoping to, God she didn't just ask you a question that requires an answer. Call me lame, but I'd rather hang out on a porch. On a nice night with some good friends, sweet girls. Just fucking drinking a good beer. You ran a country song here hanging out on the front porch with some good friends is a sweet girls drinking some fucking good bear with the game on me and a good conversation and rock and roll in a CD player. I'm not writing these lyrics. Maybe you won't wake up with a hole in your pocket and bleed nears. Let's do it for America. Keep it up, mother fucker. Yeah. All right. Youtube videos. Yeah, I hear what you're saying dude. Yo Chill at home. Fucking try to bang the girl next door. There you go.

Speaker 2:          01:34:46       Save your money. And with that I am with that. I got a a underrated, uh, not having a bunch of dumb dumb whores with their tits and ass is hanging, run out on a football field during halftime. I want the old fucking school bands to come back out again. Did you see that horse shit tonight? You know Kelly Rowland up in the stands said, oh, it was the girl from Destiny's child. We am I survive. Is it gives a fuck. Who gives up and she's up on the stand, like the desperately trying to make music without a band. Interesting. I'm sick of it. I want musicians to come back, you know, and I want them to play in musical fucking, uh, atmospheres. I don't want to see it. A fucking football game. Get a goddamn hundred men marching band to come out there. Right. Just play the old school songs. But I have it up. Bam, Bam, Bam and Amsterdam. Bam, Bam, Bam and eminent. Yeah, but that's shit. You fucking come out there with you God damn shit. Talking about breast cancer. I understand. I know. It's a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:36:00       You didn't write your fucking song for breast cancer. You're trying to use breast cancer now to, to, to sell some more fucking cds. Huh? Because that other one with the awful voice is selling more than you. Is that what you're doing? How was that less offensive than Janet Jackson's titty coming out is fucking beyond me. Tell you that right now. You know all those fucking whores walking around with their fucking asses and titties, hanging out. You know, why don't you fucking get a Goddamn job? You'd dumb whores, Jesus. Fuck. What would you be doing if he didn't have half your goods hanging out of your fucking shorts? You know? Do you have any fucking talent whatsoever? You can do a split. Great, fantastic. Does that mean you got to put on some cowboy boots and get stuck to the goddamn astro turf turf in front of 80,000 fucking people on Monday night football? I don't think it does. I don't think it means that at all.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       I think that's, that's a sign that you suck as a musician. If you sing at halftime at a football game, that pretty much means either you suck your music socks or you've completely sold out as a goddamn musician. All right, and that goes to those fucking kids who play the Superbowl too. I don't give a shit fucking Bruce Springsteen screaming about dip and then sliding around on his fucking knees like he's not 60 Jesus Christ. He got some good plastic surgery, right? That guy was like 35, (455) 055-0640 one he's 41 again, I don't know how the fuck he did it. He got his face yanked back and it actually looks good. You know why? Cause they practiced on all those real housewives of fucking New Jersey in Orange County and all that shit. That's what they did. They practiced on their faces and they want to go look, let's not do that again.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       All right, let's scratch that technique of the list. Let's, let's try this. That's a little bit better. She only looks like half a lizard. That's what you gotta do. Like I said, it's like fucking hair plugs. Hair plugs in the goddamn nineties looked horrific. And now I've got to tell you, these guys swimming around the pools, you know, aside from the psychotic look in their eye, like, do I look okay? Other than that they're their hairline. I mean, I, I can't tell. All right. Youtube videos for the week. I was talking about those free videos, free, uh, climbers or jumpers or whatever the fuck it was. Free runners. I wanted to see a chase scene and somebody said, ah, here's a video district be 13 chasing. Um, I have, these are actually, I have more, these are just weird videos this week. Okay, that's actually a cool one.

Speaker 2:          01:38:51       Here's a weird one, a proper possum, pedicure, search that. Um, and then this is one, I swear to God, I didn't even think it was real, but look up, look up sweet home Alabama and there's some lady singing it. Just scroll down past all the Leonard Skinner and just look for the fat woman with one tooth. And uh, for some reason I don't think that she realized that it got a million and a half hits. Um, and here's another one. Look up fake rapture prank. This is all one word, fake rapture, Ra, p. T. U. R. E, prank, all one word. It's basically, do you guys know what the rapture is? Oji Do you know what that is? That's basically when Jesus, right before Jesus comes back. Now, correct me if I'm wrong. People in Florida, um, I guess right before he comes back, like people who are going to come to go to heaven, like they're going to be sitting across from you, like fucking absent.

Speaker 2:          01:40:05       Mindedly like picking their nose, thinking about, you know what they're going to do that evening, and then all of a sudden they're just not going to be there, but their clothes will be there because evidently you have to be naked to go to heaven, right? So your clothes are going to be there just left behind. And then everybody who's not going to have an gets left behind, and then, uh, the whole world turns into like the, that island on survivor where I think there's only one person's gonna win. I don't know what you can try to do to redeem yourself, but basically Jesus is coming back and this time he's not asking any questions. There'll be no miracles, no fucking seven o'clock show where he does the fish trick with the basket. No walking on water. None that horse shit. He's coming back like fucking Paul Kurzy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:57       Right? Is that the name? Is that fuck Charles Bronson's name and the death wish movies. He's coming back to fucking kick the shit out of all the centers make, he's coming back to slap me around a little bit and then throw me into the fiery pits of hell. So, uh, they found this Jesus Freak girl and these Jesus Freak people thought it would be funny to fake the rapture and make this fucking Jesus freak chick think that she got left behind. And uh, the fact that this girl is an adult and gets this freaked out is really the sad state of, uh, of what organized religion does to somebody that somebody this old could, could get freaked out by something like this is fucking beyond me. And um, it's tragic. I would speak of that. Somebody, I can't find where it was. Somebody wanted me to ask me about that story where those college kids, uh, these college kids taped this other kid either having sex or fooling around this other college kid and it turned out he was with another dude.

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       So then the kid was so humiliated because I guess he wasn't out that he went to the George Washington bridge and killed himself. And, uh, I guess somebody wanted me to comment on that. That's obviously a, yeah, that's one of those fucking things where it's like, even though they're adults, they're still kids. And, uh, I don't think that they, they don't think that people understand. And even at that age, I just don't think that a lot of people understand the ramifications of what they're doing sometimes. Like how, first of all, how fucked up it is to film somebody the invasion of privacy that that is. And then when you discover this about this person, just the level of humiliation that I don't know why you would do that to somebody. Uh, but so for an unprecedented third time, the fucking batteries die. I got, I got a bootleg bag, a fucking thing that Duracell's here.

Speaker 2:          01:43:09       So let me wrap it up here. Yeah. Um, yeah, as a, as a fucking free thinking adult, I would never, I would never do something like that to somebody but that age, you know what? I had the courage to be like, guys, this is fucking wrong. Don't do that. Like I, I don't think I would have to be on, I hate to say that about myself, but I wasn't a strong individual back then as I think a lot of people aren't at that age, which is tragically how something like that unfolds. But what's going to be fucked up is the amount of people getting on their high horse, forgetting what you like at that age and how so much of it is trying to keep the uh, humiliation off of you. It's a lot of humiliation in your teen years, actually. Your childhood right up through those years to you finally just accept who the fuck you are, which is what that kid never got a chance to do, which is really sad thing and then freak the fuck out and it made a really bad decision.

Speaker 2:          01:44:11       So, yeah, it's a fucking tragic story obviously, but, oh, I don't like how people, once they are an adult and they're comfortable in their own fucking skin and who they are, we'll then turn around and they're going to start yelling at these fucking kids like, uh, like they, they would have been, you know, strong enough to go against the, uh, the mob, you know, it's fucked up. All right. You're dealing with kids who are tactically adults, but mentally they don't understand, you know, what are they thinking? Oh, this is going to be funny, you know, uh, then, uh, we'll have the most hits on our fucking youtube page and then maybe everyone will come to our house party and then we'll get laid. Right? I mean, do they, do you really think anywhere beyond that? You don't really think that, okay, this is a fucking huge secret.

Speaker 2:          01:45:02       We just unraveled on this kid. His kid has family. This kid has friends. This kid has a life. You don't think that shit. You just, I dunno. What's that residual? A fucking playground shit. So I don't know, man. I know that's a fucking off. What the fuck did I bring? That story up in the end was already a fucking brutal enough week. Um, I don't know where the fuck did I go that route. All right, let's, let's fucking get off that subject. Um, all right, that's the podcast this week. My Yard DVD, my DVD comes out, um, comes out tomorrow, Tuesday the fifth in stores, whatever stores still sell it. And a, it makes a great stocking stuffer as I said, for someone that you have to buy a gift for but don't particularly like, or if somebody you do like, and I gotta tell you this is really totally different than the special that you saw on TV if you've already seen it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:04       They really took out two huge bits and then I had other bits that uh, we just have on there as extras and a, I would really appreciate if you'd be, if you check it out, if you buy it, that would be a, that would be awesome. And da and that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Once again, thanks to everybody who came out to see me at the egg and Albany and everybody who came out to see me out in Buffalo. And uh, that is it. Everybody have a good week at a, yeah, don't be fucking video tape and people trying to humiliate a, alright. And if you were the jealousy where we got this weekend, don't fucking wear the Jersey or the hat of a team that kicks the shit out of another team and going to their Goddamn stadium and expect that you're going to be treated even remotely human.

Speaker 2:          01:46:51       Okay. All right, ed. Uh, and that's it. That's fucking it. How you like dead fucking jets fans will fucking patriots are slowly coming back together. I still don't, I don't still don't believe yet. I still don't fucking believe you had to still think that jets are going gonna win the Goddamn Division as much as, I hate to say it, but, uh, I still, I think of Ben comes back there. My Hope, because I think the culture reeling, this is how much I fucking hate the jets. I'm actually gonna root for the fucking stealers. Those cons, who always talk about bill Belichick filming the other team and completely ignore that the super Steelers of the 70s were fucking roided out of their minds, out of their fucking minds. You don't believe me? Go ask Fran Tarkington. All right.

Speaker 7:          01:47:36       That's it. Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you next week. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
