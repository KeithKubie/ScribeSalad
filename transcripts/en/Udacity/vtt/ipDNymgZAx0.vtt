00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.179
Okay, so, in this quiz we're going to pretend that you're

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.107
at Redi Memcached and at the heart of Memcached there's a

00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:08.830
dictionary. It's a big hash table. So, what I'd like you

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.802
to do is implement these four main Memcache functions. We just

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.310
talked about three of them, set, get and delete and

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.360
I'd also, also like you to write flush. Let's go through

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.890
what each of these should. So, set takes two parameters, key

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.470
and value. And it sets the value of key in cash

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.330
to equal value, and it returns true after setting the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.670
data. The importance will become apparent in the next quiz. Get

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.530
takes a key and if the value is in the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.230
cash it returns the value, and if it's not in the

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.200
cash, it returns none. Delete takes a key and it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.570
deletes that key from the cache. And flush takes no parameters,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
and clears the entire cache. And so, the behavior you should

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.750
see after you've implemented this, so if you were to set

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.195
x to one, it would return true. If you were to get x, it would return

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.500
one. Because we just set at the one, if we were to get y which doesn't exist,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.410
we would see none. And if we were to delete x and then get it, we would

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.450
see none. None of these functions should be

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.290
particularly complicated, go ahead and give that a try.
