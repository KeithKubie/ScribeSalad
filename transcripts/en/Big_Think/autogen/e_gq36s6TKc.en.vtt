00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.680
well preparing for a dive takes

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690
well preparing for a dive takes
 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.330
well preparing for a dive takes
different forms depending on what kind

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340
different forms depending on what kind
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.400
different forms depending on what kind
of dive you're going to do if you're

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
of dive you're going to do if you're
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.949
of dive you're going to do if you're
just going to go snorkeling or holding

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959
just going to go snorkeling or holding
 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.339
just going to go snorkeling or holding
your breath diving down no preparation

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349
your breath diving down no preparation
 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.470
your breath diving down no preparation
needed just take a big breath and down

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
needed just take a big breath and down
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.029
needed just take a big breath and down
you go of course it's nice to have a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
you go of course it's nice to have a
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.300
you go of course it's nice to have a
face mask it helps to have flippers it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
face mask it helps to have flippers it
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640
face mask it helps to have flippers it
helps if you're in cold water to have a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
helps if you're in cold water to have a
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070
helps if you're in cold water to have a
wetsuit or even a dry suit that'll keep

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
wetsuit or even a dry suit that'll keep

you warm if you want to stay more than

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
you warm if you want to stay more than
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.369
you warm if you want to stay more than
just a moment or two for using scuba you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
just a moment or two for using scuba you
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170
just a moment or two for using scuba you
will first want to make sure that you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
will first want to make sure that you
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.710
will first want to make sure that you
have air in your tank that again the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720
have air in your tank that again the
 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.509
have air in your tank that again the
same old thing if you want to be warm

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519
same old thing if you want to be warm
 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.490
same old thing if you want to be warm
cold diving in cold water you've got to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
cold diving in cold water you've got to
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.380
cold diving in cold water you've got to
prepare for that using self-contained

mainly it's very simple my instruction

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
mainly it's very simple my instruction
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020
mainly it's very simple my instruction
back in 1953 before there were classes

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
back in 1953 before there were classes
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080
back in 1953 before there were classes
in learning how to dive it was very

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
in learning how to dive it was very
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.389
in learning how to dive it was very
simple two words breathe naturally and

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399
simple two words breathe naturally and
 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.340
simple two words breathe naturally and
don't hold your breath because if you do

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
don't hold your breath because if you do
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.300
don't hold your breath because if you do
hold your breath while you have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
hold your breath while you have
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.179
hold your breath while you have
compressed air that you have taken in

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
compressed air that you have taken in
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.109
compressed air that you have taken in
while breathing and you ascend the air

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
while breathing and you ascend the air
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.389
while breathing and you ascend the air
that's in your body in your lungs and

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399
that's in your body in your lungs and
 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.510
that's in your body in your lungs and
your tissues will expand as you come

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
your tissues will expand as you come
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160
your tissues will expand as you come
closer to the surface as you begin to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
closer to the surface as you begin to
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830
closer to the surface as you begin to
take the pressure off that's dangerous

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
take the pressure off that's dangerous
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630
take the pressure off that's dangerous
you can embolize you can get bubbles in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
you can embolize you can get bubbles in
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.599
you can embolize you can get bubbles in
your bloodstream you can get the bends

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609
your bloodstream you can get the bends
 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.550
your bloodstream you can get the bends
so breathe naturally was really good

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
so breathe naturally was really good
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.889
so breathe naturally was really good
advice because as you exhale you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
advice because as you exhale you
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.190
advice because as you exhale you
eliminate the air that you have in your

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
eliminate the air that you have in your
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.330
eliminate the air that you have in your
lungs and so you learn not to stay too

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
lungs and so you learn not to stay too
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.020
lungs and so you learn not to stay too
long

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
long
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080
long
because after a while the air that you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
because after a while the air that you
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.809
because after a while the air that you
breathe the nitrogen actually gets into

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819
breathe the nitrogen actually gets into
 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.639
breathe the nitrogen actually gets into
your bloodstream forms little bubbles

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
your bloodstream forms little bubbles
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.080
your bloodstream forms little bubbles
and you can stay for a short period of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
and you can stay for a short period of
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.640
and you can stay for a short period of
time and all of this is closely

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
time and all of this is closely
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890
time and all of this is closely
calculated you know exactly how long you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
calculated you know exactly how long you
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.580
calculated you know exactly how long you
could say before you have to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
could say before you have to
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.729
could say before you have to
count in decompression before coming

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739
count in decompression before coming
 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.250
count in decompression before coming
back to the surface a lot of this has

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260
back to the surface a lot of this has
 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530
back to the surface a lot of this has
been learned in the last 50 years the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
been learned in the last 50 years the
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930
been learned in the last 50 years the
hard way by people who have made

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
hard way by people who have made
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.990
hard way by people who have made
mistakes who have tried it and have

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
mistakes who have tried it and have
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.990
mistakes who have tried it and have
learned that they need to do things

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000
learned that they need to do things
 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.009
learned that they need to do things
differently I have been part of that

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019
differently I have been part of that
 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.670
differently I have been part of that
learning curve I suppose in 1974 the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
learning curve I suppose in 1974 the
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.020
learning curve I suppose in 1974 the
first time I had a chance to live

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
first time I had a chance to live
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.940
first time I had a chance to live
underwater they call it saturation

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
underwater they call it saturation
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.370
underwater they call it saturation
diving you stay underwater at a certain

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
diving you stay underwater at a certain
 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.110
diving you stay underwater at a certain
depth long enough for your tissues to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120
depth long enough for your tissues to
 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.840
depth long enough for your tissues to
become saturated with the breathing mix

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
become saturated with the breathing mix
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.289
become saturated with the breathing mix
that inhaling in the case of the first

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299
that inhaling in the case of the first
 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.990
that inhaling in the case of the first
case it wasn't just air it was a mixture

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
case it wasn't just air it was a mixture
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.110
case it wasn't just air it was a mixture
of nitrogen and oxygen with somewhat

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
of nitrogen and oxygen with somewhat
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.870
of nitrogen and oxygen with somewhat
less oxygen that we have at the surface

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
less oxygen that we have at the surface
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.780
less oxygen that we have at the surface
and therefore a little more nitrogen

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790
and therefore a little more nitrogen
 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.910
and therefore a little more nitrogen
because oxygen actually can become toxic

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920
because oxygen actually can become toxic
 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.509
because oxygen actually can become toxic
if you breathe it under pressure for a

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
if you breathe it under pressure for a
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.420
if you breathe it under pressure for a
long time at a certain depth below about

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
long time at a certain depth below about
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.490
long time at a certain depth below about
30 feet 60 feet it is it becomes toxic

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
30 feet 60 feet it is it becomes toxic
 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.979
30 feet 60 feet it is it becomes toxic
dangerous you can go into convulsions if

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
dangerous you can go into convulsions if
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.940
dangerous you can go into convulsions if
you have too much oxygen you how can you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
you have too much oxygen you how can you
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.410
you have too much oxygen you how can you
have too much oxygen you might think we

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420
have too much oxygen you might think we
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.680
have too much oxygen you might think we
need oxygen we do but too too much

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
need oxygen we do but too too much
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.800
need oxygen we do but too too much
oxygen even for us under the right or

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
oxygen even for us under the right or
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.099
oxygen even for us under the right or
wrong circumstances can be lethal can

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109
wrong circumstances can be lethal can
 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.319
wrong circumstances can be lethal can
certainly be harmful so these are all

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329
certainly be harmful so these are all

how to dive you can learn and figure out

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100
how to dive you can learn and figure out
 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.280
how to dive you can learn and figure out
and then but it's a bit like using a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290
and then but it's a bit like using a
 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.590
and then but it's a bit like using a
