00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:05.810
(previous show ending)

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.415
We hope that you guys will join us a little bit later this afternoon

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.799
for more of our Innovation Challenge.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.299
We'll see you then, thanks very much. (Applause)

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:22.978
Tom Brokay: Who says that CBS has got a corner on the Amazing Race?

00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:25.578
We've got our own going on here on Education Nation.

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:28.661
I'm joined now by Sal Khan, who, in a fact,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.025
is one of the leading innovators of the country,

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.350
but kind of stumbled into it,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.675
You were a computer science enthusiast.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:37.710
Sal: Yes.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.893
Tom: You got into the venture capital business.

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:41.952
But you had a niece across the country

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:44.011
who was having some difficulties doing her math.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.076
What happened then?

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:46.784
Sal: Yes, it was 2004,

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:48.493
they were visiting me right after my wedding.

00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:52.596
It just turned out.. it came out while we were just talking about it

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:55.043
that she was getting tracked into a slower math class

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:57.443
when she was going into 7th grade right after the summer.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:00.643
And I talked to her.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.226
I said "Nadia, you are clearly a bright girl --

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:03.810
And we share a certain amount of DNA --

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.444
There is no way that you should be tracked into a slower math class."

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:09.744
And so, she agreed that we would tutor each other,

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:12.578
or I would tutor her when she went back.

00:01:12.578 --> 00:01:14.876
Tom: Now where was she living and where were you living at the time?

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:16.762
Sal: She was based in New Orleans,which is where I grew up.

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:18.778
But I was in Boston at the time.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.795
And we agreed that she would go home,

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:23.211
and we would get on a conference cal,l and we'd figure out something.

00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.111
I used Yahoo Doodle to tutor her.

00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:28.210
And a couple months later, that worked out.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.577
Then I started tutoring her brothers, a couple other cousins.

00:01:30.577 --> 00:01:32.211
The whole time, I still had a day job.

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:37.494
And about a year later,

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:39.176
it just became hard for me to scale myself:

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:40.859
I had trouble scheduling with all my different cousins

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.455
and family friends and all the rest

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.329
And I had a buddy who I was talking to over dinner.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.565
And I said: "You know, I'm really enjoying this tutoring thing that I'm doing after work.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:50.383
But it is getting difficult."

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.398
And he said ,"Why don't you just record your lectures and put them on YouTube?"

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:58.117
And I said; "No, YouTube is for dogs on skateboards.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.641
It's not for serious mathematics, "

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:06.565
But I tried it out, and, long story short:

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:09.078
My cousins said that they liked me better on YouTube than in person.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:12.883
And other people did too, and they just kept watching it.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:16.682
So, it's about 2.5 million people a month are watching the videos.

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.016
Tom: And you've got about 2200 videos.

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:22.650
Sal: It is now pushing 2800 videos,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.584
on everything from basic addition to vector calculus,

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:27.617
and biology, and chemistry, and whatever else.

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:29.800
Tom: Is this a commercial enterprise?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.451
Are you doing this just to keep the country better informed?

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:38.938
Sal: No.. a lot of my buddies from the very for-profit

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:41.252
investment world are wondering what happened to Sal.

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:43.735
But I decided to make it a not-for-profit.

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:46.468
And the real idea is that the fun of this

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:48.252
is that it reaches as many students as possible.

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:51.152
So, when I'm on my deathbed, it would be nice...

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:53.702
you know in the for-profit realm a big success

00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:56.893
would have been IPO or you get acquired.

00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:59.166
But here the big success is you can reach millions and millions of kids.

00:02:59.166 --> 00:02:59.933
It's pretty exciting.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:04.001
Tom: What's the appetite for learning that you're finding from this generation?

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.784
Especially in the difficult sciences like Math,

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:08.951
because we know that we're behind in this country.

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.108
Sal: You know, the really surprising thing is...

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:12.485
is my cousins were fairly motivated students,

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:14.334
they were having trouble but I was helping them.

00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:17.117
And when I made the videos, I assumed that they would be..

00:03:17.117 --> 00:03:19.951
that the appeal would be for people like my cousins

00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:22.334
or maybe people like myself..

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.067
I was a pretty good student when I was in middle school,

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:24.886
and all the rest.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.451
But the really big surprise: the letters I get are from students

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.718
who a lot of us would have traditionally labeled as the disengaged students.

00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:33.683
The students who said: "I was about to fail out of Algebra...

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:35.983
I was about to drop out of High School...

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.718
until I found this type of a resource".

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:41.899
And the big message to me is that it's actually a much larger group of students

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.390
who really, really want to learn

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.738
and you just have to give them an outlet,

00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:47.331
so they're not frustrated, so they don't feel that they're being talked down to.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.130
And if you give them that, it's not just the 5-10% students that want to learn,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.750
it's the 90-95%.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.787
Tom: Sal, in proceeding panels, as you know,

00:03:55.787 --> 00:04:01.242
we talked a lot about poverty, socio-economic depravation,

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:03.610
people not having access to the internet.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.059
So are you talking affectively to those who are privileged

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:12.617
or, if not elite class, than certainly in the middle to upper middle class?

00:04:12.617 --> 00:04:15.294
Sal: You know, across the board, we've seen...

00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:19.325
Clearly I think the main barrier here is that there is some type of internet connectivity

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.227
that someone needs to do,

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.893
but people are already taking our videos,

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:23.576
they are being translated into 11 languages,

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:25.042
they're putting them onto DVDs.

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:28.176
I've gotten pictures of people using them in rural Africa and rural India.

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:32.176
So even now, it can be accessed by people anywhere.

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:35.726
And as we go forward, the cost of technology is just getting cheaper and cheaper

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:39.007
and I think that there is some healthy skepticism around technology

00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:41.225
in the classroom or technology for learning.

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:43.043
And I think the reason that I solved these is

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:44.727
because it was nothing to do with technology.

00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:47.127
And we're hoping that between our videos -

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:49.035
we then we have a huge software platform -

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:51.405
to give exercises and feedback to students -

00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:54.543
that that will be a catalyst to really use technology.

00:04:54.543 --> 00:04:59.320
Tom: What's the difference between teaching online and teaching in the classroom?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.671
Sal: The classroom management is a little bit easier. (laughter)

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.088
No, I say that jokingly, but its true.

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:10.555
I get a huge luxury that when I make my videos

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:15.089
I pretend that the students are so enthralled by what I have to say

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:16.539
that I can just imagine it.

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.906
And what's good about that is that it gives me energy...

00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:22.825
It's much harder to sit in front of a room full of 30 kids

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:25.482
and you're not sure whether some are getting it,

00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:27.079
some are there, some are here.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.441
What happens is that.. that energy gets conveyed in the videos

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:32.354
and when the students watch it, they can pause

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:33.960
and repeat as many times as they want.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.706
I just got a letter from a kid who watched one video 30 times

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.489
and it took him 30 times to get the idea.

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:41.673
And what he said was that there no one on the planet that he could have paid

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:45.722
to tutor him that constant 30 times without judging him.

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:47.758
And I think that's what students really like.

00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:51.407
Tom: You do have a non-profit, you're out there in the universe of cyberspace

00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:55.106
but are any of the educational systems in this country

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:58.357
- the districts - either at the local or state level - coming to you

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:03.007
and saying 'how can we strengthen the relationship between what we need and what you do?'

00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:07.157
Sal: Yes, we started some pilots last year, just almost on a whim

00:06:07.157 --> 00:06:08.706
and its gotten pretty exciting.

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:11.724
Some of the local schools in the Bay Area,

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:14.241
they said: 'what would you do if you could do anything you wanted with a 5th grade classroom?"

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.385
We said that we'd have every student working at their own pace:

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:19.157
watching videos, doing the self-paced exercises.

00:06:19.157 --> 00:06:21.289
Only moving forward once they'd mastered concepts.

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.426
Right now you get a 'B' or a 'C' on a topic.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.808
That's fine, you passed,

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:27.528
even though you don't know 10 or 20% of the material.

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:28.956
And then you move on to more difficult topics.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:31.706
So we are saying everyone at their on pace, master concepts first

00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.174
and then what happens to the teachers is that they get all of this data:

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:36.371
who is working on what, what videos are they watching.

00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:37.556
What exercises are they doing.

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:41.489
So the teacher no longer has to give these 'one size fits all' lectures.

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:43.311
The teacher can actually get the data and say:

00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.613
"Hey look, Tom's having trouble with negative numbers,

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:46.797
and everyone else is working at their own pace,

00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:50.950
let me sit down next to Tom and actually have a 1-1 intervention with Tom."

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.454
What we've found in the classrooms has been pretty crazy

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:58.625
before maybe 10% of the teacher's time was spent on that really deep 1-1 mentorship.

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.239
Now it is 90% of their time.

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:03.173
So what we consider to be the relevant metric

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.789
which is the student-to-time-with-the-teacher ratio.

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:06.589
That's gone through the roof.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:10.322
Tom: Do people in their 40s and 50s, or my age,

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.324
and I'm a grandparent at this age,

00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:16.472
do we tend to underestimate the passions

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:20.507
and the almost affinity that young people, now coming of age

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.456
with all this technology around them,

00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:26.682
have for using that technology and the expectation that they have for it?

00:07:26.682 --> 00:07:30.580
Sal: Yeah, it surprised me. I wouldn't have thought,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.248
when I started this up, I wouldn't have thought,

00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:35.815
that when I made videos on sine and cosine and l'Hopital's rule

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.831
that they would become this 'main stream' thing

00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:39.614
but clearly there's this hunger for it.

00:07:39.614 --> 00:07:42.031
And the surprising thing is that it isn't just the younger generation

00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:44.265
we have 30 year olds, 40 year olds, 50 year olds...

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:48.651
I got a letter from a grandmother that said it was her life dream to learn calculus -

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:49.875
who knew?

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:52.782
And she started working on it, so it is really across generations.

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:59.465
Tom: Do you compliment what you do online with conventional text books

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.651
or math books or offer references?

00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:04.844
Sal: Well, it is an interesting...

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:06.127
I think that there will always be a role for books.

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:08.061
But textbooks right now do two things:

00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:11.443
the text tries to teach you something, it is sometimes hard to read.

00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:14.811
And then the exercise try to give you practice.

00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:19.210
We think that on-demand video is often better than the text

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.277
that you see in a lot of text books and that immediate feedback,

00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:24.244
self-paced learning with data and analytics

00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:25.610
and you get the steps of every problem,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.859
and it is kind of like a video game.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.895
That that's better than every other answer in the back of the book.

00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:32.960
So it will be interesting to see what happens to the textbook world.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.609
Tom: What did you learn, if anything, at this point?

00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:38.427
And I know it is empirical of it probably..

00:08:38.427 --> 00:08:41.509
about whether some of us are hard-wired to do math

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:45.777
and others of us, like me, are hard-wired to do other things.

00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:47.994
I mean people ask me how I got to be a journalist and I say:

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:51.360
"Algebra 2". (laughter)

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.444
Sal: That's pretty good.

00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:56.562
No, the amazing thing that we've started seeing in these pilots

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:59.460
in these classrooms is when you let every kid work at their own pace,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.210
right when you start off, you do see what we traditionally see:

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.677
some of the kids race ahead

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:06.561
and those are the kids that we all think will be nuclear physicists and whatever else.

00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:10.110
And some of the kids take a little bit longer on one concept to another

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.745
and in a traditional model, you'd say: those kids are meant to be scientists or engineers.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:19.766
These kids .. maybe they'll become journalists - which isn't so bad.

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:24.599
But what we've seen is that if you let them work at their own pace,

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.382
some of those kids who are spending a little extra time on negative numbers

00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:30.047
or exponents. You give them that extra time

00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:33.432
and as soon at they get that some of them just race ahead.

00:09:33.432 --> 00:09:35.322
And so what we're seeing in our data in the classrooms

00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:39.483
is when we are not grouping kids based on early assessment,

00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:41.415
that every week there is a new leader.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.782
And some of the kids that two or three weeks ago you'd have said were slow or below average

00:09:44.782 --> 00:09:46.370
a week or two or a month later,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.873
they're the best kid in the class.

00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:50.232
So what we are seeing is that maybe we're just discounting kids

00:09:50.232 --> 00:09:52.849
too early and we are assessing them at the wrong times.

00:09:52.849 --> 00:09:56.865
And it is kind of a predetermined future if you do it that way.

00:09:56.865 --> 00:10:00.299
Tom: How did we loose our way in this country when it came to science education?

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.015
Tom: How did we loose our way when comes to science education in this country?

00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:09.632
When I was a younger guy, the Russians were beating us into Space

00:10:09.632 --> 00:10:12.181
so a lot of people went into Engineering, went into Sciences.

00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:15.082
The Space Race helped accelerate all of that.

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:18.815
But then we lost our way, it seems to me, in the last part of the 20th century.

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:20.901
Sal: You know, I think that it has just been bad branding.

00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:22.999
I think, you know its funny, because Science and Engineering

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:25.115
are fundamentally creative professions.

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:27.714
I mean 'engineering', the word 'engineering' is to build things

00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:28.932
that have never been built before.

00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:32.448
And the way it's shown and the way, and all of the hoops

00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:34.082
that you have to jump through in your education,

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:36.515
make it look like its a non-creative field,

00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:37.566
but when you look at it in the real world,

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:38.599
it is a very creative field.

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:41.365
So I think the real thing is to get more kids engaged,

00:10:41.365 --> 00:10:44.651
to show them that 1) the math and science itself is beautiful

00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:46.441
and it tells us more about the universe,

00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:48.632
or as much about the universe, as philosophy or anything else.

00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:51.432
It really is a form of philosophy and not only that,

00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:53.799
but the end point you're going to isn't a boring job.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:57.734
It is a creative job, it is redefining what people's experiences are.

00:10:57.734 --> 00:10:59.340
I think that if you do it that way,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.947
I think that a lot of more people will want to get into it.

00:11:00.947 --> 00:11:04.466
Tom: I take of Cyber Space is the new second 'Big Bang',

00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:06.331
we're creating this new universe our there,

00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:08.890
just like we did with the physical first bang.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.471
And one of the things that's happening is

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:12.746
that we're watching all these planets

00:11:12.746 --> 00:11:14.884
which one is going to drift too close to the sun,

00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:17.335
which ones are going to form together and form new lifeforms.

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:20.403
As you look at your model which has been successful,

00:11:20.403 --> 00:11:22.207
have you already began to think:

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:25.396
how can we expand that model to other areas?

00:11:25.396 --> 00:11:26.851
Sal: Yeah, we've already thought about it.

00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:29.668
So you know that we have the videos I do right now

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:31.401
and we have this whole software platform

00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:32.710
and I think the interesting thing is

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.019
we are going to start branching off from mathematics,

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.635
our videos already cover the things in biology and economics and all the rest.

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:40.160
But our exercise platform:

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.685
try to do economics, physics, chemistry,

00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:44.204
and then start to think about how can we do the humanities?

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.769
How can we give people the basic scaffold of say American History?

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:49.002
And then I think it would be really interesting to see

00:11:49.002 --> 00:11:50.517
how we can do things like creative writing,

00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:51.832
where people are doing projects

00:11:51.832 --> 00:11:54.655
and maybe they can peer review each others essays and things like that.

00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:56.346
I think that there is a whole universe

00:11:56.346 --> 00:11:58.652
that we are just beginning to explore.

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:00.219
Tom: Well we look forward to your exploration.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.852
Sal thank you very much from the Khan Academy.

00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:04.084
Sal: Thank you.

00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:05.453
Tom: And you and I will get together later

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:08.084
and see if we can improve my math skills. Thank you.
