[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.140
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Thanks so much.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.440
That was quite the introduction.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.690
Thanks, everyone, for coming
today, and thank you to Google

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.740
for hosting us and Sam
for being our host today.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710
We really appreciate it.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.990
As many of you are
probably aware,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.610
since 1990, over
a billion people

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.189
have moved out of
poverty globally,

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.730
which is really
exciting, and I think

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.710
gives us all the idea
that it's possible

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.960
and that we can make significant
progress on our goals

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.550
towards ending global poverty.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.710
At the same time,
nearly a million people

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.939
still live in
poverty and many more

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.105
than that live without
access to financial services,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.040
live without access
to health, and live

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.370
in chronic and acute hunger.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.090
And those people are
disproportionately

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.322
women and people
living in rural areas.

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:47.780
And so at Grameen
Foundation, we're

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.779
really committed to
continuing to find solutions

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:51.890
that work for those people.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.500
Many of the advances that have
driven the reduction in poverty

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.800
have been global growth.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740
But there are also
many advances that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.440
have been due to investments
and development initiatives.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.794
So, for example, in
India, some of you

00:01:06.794 --> 00:01:08.210
may know the Aadhaar
system, which

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.680
is the new national identity
and biometric system in India.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.130
Some of you may
have worked on it.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.070
But India has made a
significant investment

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.530
in making sure that
every person in India

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.350
has a national ID, that that
national ID is connected

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.720
to their biometrics so that
they are able to access that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.450
at any time.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.084
National identity is
a significant issue

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:32.750
for poor people.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.430
Many of them don't
have identity.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.180
They don't have a
birth certificate.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030
They don't have any sort of
government documentation.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.654
And without that,
they're significantly

00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:41.810
limited in their
ability to open a bank

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.666
account, in their ability to
access government services,

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.790
in their ability to be
recognized, in their ability

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.730
to vote.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.020
And so for India
making the commitment

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.790
to establish this
national identity

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.260
and connecting it
to biometrics has

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.942
been a significant investment
and a significant advancement

00:01:57.942 --> 00:01:59.150
towards their end to poverty.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.733
Once people are in
the system, they're

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.100
able to access their
government benefits.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.850
They all automatically
have a bank account

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.808
that's opened for them.

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:07.760
So their government
benefits transfer directly

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.384
from the government
into their accounts

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:12.140
without having to pass through
other hands, which makes sure

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.300
that they receive all
of their benefits.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.510
The development of that system
was a development initiative.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.820
It was funded by the Gates
Foundation in collaboration

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.910
with the Indian government
and many other development

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.620
initiatives.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.990
Another one, which many
of you may have heard of,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.500
is M-Pesa in East Africa,
which is a mobile money

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.450
system connected to the
Vodafone system there.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.120
So, although only 15% of Kenyans
have a bank account, over 90%

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.670
of Kenyans use a mobile
money account connected

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.770
to their mobile phone.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.800
And randomized controlled trials
have verified that over 6%

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.700
of people annually move out of
poverty because of their access

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.100
to mobile money.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.510
And there are several
reasons for that.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.060
One is that it increases
their resilience.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060
If somebody has a health
emergency, for example,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.018
they're able to reach
out to friends and family

00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:04.022
near and far to see if they
can gather resources to cover

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:06.230
that health emergency rather
than having to sell off,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.021
say, a productive asset
in their household,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.940
having to sell a cow,
which may be worth $100,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.570
just to pay for a $6 health
emergency, needing malaria

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.080
medication, for example.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.020
So they're able to
increase their resilience

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.270
through their social networks
through the mobile money

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.660
platform and able to retain
more of their assets.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.590
For women, it's an
important resource too.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.820
They're able to save and
save somewhere often that

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.940
is more private
and away from, say,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.530
their husband or
other family members

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.330
who may want access
to their resources.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.150
So for women in particular,
having a safe and private place

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.720
to save is a very important
part of their ability

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720
to have more control
over their own resources.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.000
We live in amazing times,
and with this technology

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.920
development, much
of it happening here

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.540
at Google and many
of you, hopefully,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.830
involved in some of it.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.700
We're seeing big data,
the use of cell phones,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.040
being part of just a host
of disruptive technologies

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.331
that are transforming the
way we work in the developing

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.340
community, the way that
we engage with partners,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.540
and giving us really
unprecedented opportunities

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.090
to make impacts on poverty.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.850
At Grameen Foundation,
we're really

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.160
passionate about
disrupting global poverty.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.840
We're working to
create breakthroughs

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.380
that will reach many of those
still living in poverty.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.180
We design strategies that
equip women and their families

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.990
with knowledge and services.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.100
We really look at how we engage
with frontline workers, people

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.990
who are already engaged
with poor households,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.610
to improve their
ability to deliver

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.440
products and services to them.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.000
And we bring together
partners in an ecosystem.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.432
So we work primarily
with software companies,

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:37.390
with private sector
entities, with governments,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.520
to ensure that
solutions we develop

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.500
are embedded in sustainable
delivery mechanisms,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.320
whether that's
sustainable private sector

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.200
initiatives or sustainable
government initiatives.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.286
Many of you may know
Grameen Foundation--

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:51.860
let's see.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.380
I think I got ahead of
myself on the slides--

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.350
through our history.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.790
We were founded in
1997 through the work

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.700
of Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel
Laureate for his work

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.770
as the father of microfinance.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.715
His breakthrough idea was
really that poor women

00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:08.090
were someone you
could invest in,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.389
that you could lend to them.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.430
They would invest that
money in their businesses,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.830
and then they would repay it.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.420
And we really have grown
on the back of that idea

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.790
that poor households are
good investments and someone

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.130
you can do business with.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.720
In our first 10 years, we
really focused on microfinance

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.620
and developing microfinance
institutions globally.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.360
But in the last 10 years, we
have built on that foundation.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.300
We've really focused on
using digital technology

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.360
to develop sustainable solutions
to reach the poor, especially

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.340
women.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.260
Today, our mission is both
urgent but also hopeful.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.422
It's urgent because 60% of
the chronically hungry people

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:45.505
are still women and girls.

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:47.050
They are
disproportionately affected

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.540
by poverty and global hunger.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.520
Though global poverty
is on the decline,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.409
global hunger is on the rise.

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.450
Two billion people, more
than half of them women,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.860
have no access to formal
financial services,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.530
which is a key enabler to life.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.440
More than 100 million people are
driven into poverty every year

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.000
because of a health crisis.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.290
And that's not a developing
country phenomenon alone.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.470
That's a phenomenon
right here in the US.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.120
And maternal mortality
rates in Africa

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.370
remain virtually unchanged
over the last three decades.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.310
So there is an urgent
need to continue

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.980
to invest in finding
solutions to global poverty.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.130
At the same time, we're hopeful
digital technologies are

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.680
offering unprecedented
solutions, things

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.010
like human-centered design
and private sector's increased

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.410
focus on working with
the extremely poor,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.350
provide opportunities that
we've never had before.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.880
Looking forward,
Grameen Foundation

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.230
is looking to reach 25 million
people over the next 25 years

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.930
and move them sustainably
out of poverty.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.600
Today, we work in
three main areas.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.330
We work in digital financial
services for women.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.880
We work in digital
innovations in agriculture.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.640
And then we work in health
financing and access.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.500
Health financing and
access is primarily

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.960
connected to our
work, particularly

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.804
around financial
services and agriculture.

00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:01.720
I wanted to highlight a
couple of our programs

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.840
that I thought you guys might
be particularly interested in.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.550
The first one is
called the CAN network,

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.965
with the Community Agent
Network in the Philippines.

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:12.090
I think everybody is familiar
with the Philippines.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.970
It's an island nation.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.180
It's made up of over
7,000 islands, which

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.740
makes it extremely expensive
and time consuming for people

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.965
to access financial services.

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:24.340
And it makes it extremely
expensive for financial service

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.881
providers to build
out infrastructure

00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:28.420
across all of those
7,000 small islands.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.100
So we have worked
with women like this,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.461
with Joan, what are called
sari-sari shop owners, kiosk

00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:37.960
owners.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.940
They run little,
small businesses.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.280
They sell daily household items.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.170
And we have worked with
a technology provider

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.260
to equip these
women with what we

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.570
call a point-of-sale or POS
device that enables them

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.980
to do mobile money
and digital payment

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.235
transactions for members
of their communities.

00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:59.650
So now Joan, who is on a small
island in the Philippines,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.440
is able to be the intersection
point for her island

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.590
and for her community for people
to pay their electricity bill,

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.660
for people to make a
deposit or a withdrawal

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.580
into their bank account.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.890
And this is enabling
financial inclusion

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.870
to reach these small
islands and people who've

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.470
never had access to it before.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.480
To date, we've trained over
1,800 agents, 75% of them women

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.960
like Joan.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.800
We cater to 423
low-income neighborhoods

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.480
across this island nation.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.390
We've facilitated over
4.3 million transactions

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.120
valued at 1.3 billion pesos.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.960
So there was a huge unmet
demand for these types

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.179
of digital financial
services, and as soon

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.990
as we were able to put an access
point in these communities,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.560
you saw the amount of people who
were using digital mobile money

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.080
really ramp up.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.861
The other project
we're engaged in,

00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:53.860
which I thought you guys
might find interesting,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.530
is a project we call
Set for Farming.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.750
It's a project that
just launched this year,

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.920
and it's part of our global
partnership with Mars,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.750
which is the chocolate company,
makes most of our candy bars

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.220
these days.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.760
And in this project, we use
satellite digital imagery

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.600
and data to reach 240,000
smallholder cacao farmers

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.050
across Ghana to help them
increase their yields,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.577
improve their incomes, and
build stronger businesses.

00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:22.660
The way we do this is
taking some of the precision

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.640
farming techniques that
have been developed

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.430
in the developed world for
use on large-scale farms

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.829
and large industrial
farms and try and take

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:33.370
some of those technologies and
those techniques and make them

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.270
work for smallholder farmers.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.950
So things like satellite imagery
to help understand whether--

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.230
sorry-- soil conditions
and whether soil

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.770
needs additional
nutrients, to understand

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.610
if your farm needs
more or less water

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.440
during any particular
point of view.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.030
You can use satellite
data imagery

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.390
to understand whether the
pruning on a particular farm

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.500
has been done correctly.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.359
And weirdly, pruning is very
important for cacao trees

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:04.900
and helps improve
their productivity.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.040
So making sure that
it's done correctly

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.300
is an important thing.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.000
So we work with Mars and
some of their partners

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.210
on the ground who have
these field agents--

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.560
extension agents we call them--

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.601
who already go out and
interact with the farmers.

00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:22.240
So we're able to use satellite
imagery and satellite

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.367
data to provide information
to the extension agents

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:26.200
so that when they go
out and visit a farmer,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.120
they can tell him, you need
to improve your pruning

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.630
techniques.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.820
We can see that your trees
need to be pruned more.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.350
We can see that your
soil is low in nitrogen,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.570
and you need to plant
additional plants in order

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.410
to increase the
nitrogen in your plants.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.260
And so it's really taking
that technology that's already

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.144
in use for these
large-scale farms

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:47.560
and figuring out
how we can use it

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.150
to increase small-scale farmers
productivity and their income.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.820
And many people don't realize
that cacao farmers are

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.850
some of the poorest
people in the world,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.350
even though they're connected
to this global chocolate value

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.070
chain.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.200
There are high levels of child
labor in chocolate globally.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.634
And so part of this
work that we do

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:07.300
is not only improving
their productivity

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.940
but bringing these farmers
into a global digital system.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.960
So their information gets
into our system for each farm,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.770
their farming practices,
et cetera, and then

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.040
we are able to work with them
to become fair trade certified,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.900
to become organic
certified if that's

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.260
what they're looking for.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.280
So it's a system that gives
both greater profitability

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.430
to the farmer but also greater
visibility for all of us

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.380
into the global
chocolate value chain.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.810
And it's something that
we're working with Mars

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.550
and looking at blockchain
as the next part of that,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.010
so that as consumers,
everybody can have visibility

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.740
into how your chocolate
products through Mars

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.890
are being produced, and whether
they're fair trade certified,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.970
whether they're absent of
child labor, et cetera.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.260
So I know that that's something
that both sides of the coin

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.400
can benefit from.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.370
One cornerstone that's
consistent across all

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.610
of our projects is our desire to
really use data and information

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.630
to track our programs.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.020
We're, I think in the
developing community,

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.040
still at the nascent
stage of figuring out

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.410
how to use big data and some
of these big data sources

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.160
to really bring to the fight
against poverty and hunger.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.089
But we're trying to use these
smart tools and the data

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:21.380
and the information that we
have on smallholder farmers

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.240
to bring them more fully
into market systems

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.380
and to overcome some
of their challenges.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.130
One of the things, for
example, that we're

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.522
looking at doing
now, we have worked

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:32.980
with hundreds of thousands of
smallholder farmers globally.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.021
One of the biggest
constraints that they all have

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.009
is access to
finance because they

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:38.300
don't have a financial history.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.760
Many of them don't
have bank accounts.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.060
Many of them haven't worked
with a mainstream or large

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.380
financial institution before.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.540
They made do all of their
lending and borrowing

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.070
locally through their community
or through money lenders.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.810
So how can we help
this data that they've

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.850
built up in our system?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.850
We may have three to four years'
worth of their farming data.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.380
We may know exactly
how much they've

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.306
spent, invested in their farm.

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:04.180
We may know exactly how
much they've produced

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.945
and what they've earned off
of that production for two

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:07.570
or three years.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.950
So how can we help
them take that data

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.350
and turn it into a credit
profile or a credit score

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.050
that they can then use
with the mainstream

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.290
financial institution?

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.747
So we've already done
some of that in Colombia

00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:20.330
with coffee farmers,
and we're looking

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.190
to replicate it in Uganda
with coffee farmers

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.830
and then in Ghana, in
[INAUDIBLE],, with these cacao

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.740
farmers.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.950
So we think that's
something very exciting

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.070
and a real growth area for us
and an area where we can really

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.182
use the data that we already
have to really make an impact.

00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:40.640
I think there's
other exciting ways

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.155
we can start to think about
using technology globally

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.030
to alleviate poverty.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.457
I talked about blockchain.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.540
It's something that we're
all trying to figure out

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.370
what the best way to use is--

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.620
this new technology--
and ways that it

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.300
can help impact poverty.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.520
One of the ways that we're
thinking about at Grameen

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.750
Foundation is particularly with
refugees, as they cross borders

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.460
and are receiving
health care, say,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.970
in a country that
is not their own,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.120
how can they develop a
health record on something

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.926
like blockchain that helps
them as they move globally,

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:09.800
whether they repatriate
to their home country

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.779
or whether they're moved
onto a third country?

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:13.820
How can they take their
health records with them?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.070
Something like blockchain
is something that can really

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.010
be very helpful with that.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.440
We're experimenting with
artificial intelligence

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.750
and augmented
reality, particularly

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.770
in our India office.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.250
We've been working with
Accenture Development Partners

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.870
and using artificial
intelligence.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.870
For example, we do a lot of
financial literacy training,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.850
so using artificial
intelligence to help us

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.324
understand how much women have
understood and internalized

00:14:38.324 --> 00:14:39.740
the training that
they've received

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.620
and where women need
additional support

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.070
to ensure that
they understand how

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.750
to use financial
services appropriately.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.890
So I've actually done it
myself, done the little Q&amp;A,

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.110
and it's very interesting
to get the read out

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.285
and the report on
how you're doing

00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:58.160
and how well you're
understanding the lessons

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.243
that you've just received.

00:14:59.243 --> 00:15:01.001
So it's exciting.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.750
And another exciting
area we're looking at

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.290
is remote sensing for
agricultural irrigation.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.390
So, again, it's
something that's being

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.020
used by large-scale industrial
farms in developing countries,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.500
but can we use remote sensing
to help smallholder farmers

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.530
in India use water
more efficiently

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.310
and water more effectively?

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.310
So that's a project that we're
just at the beginning of.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.117
So I'm going to
end it with that,

00:15:26.117 --> 00:15:28.450
and I'm really happy to answer
any questions anybody has

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.620
or talk a little bit
more about our work.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.340
We at Grameen are very
excited about the ability

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.970
to use technology and
information to end

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.182
extreme poverty and hunger.

00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:40.390
We think these can help
create the breakthroughs that

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.556
will move women and their
communities out of poverty

00:15:42.556 --> 00:15:43.579
in a sustainable way.

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:45.370
And we think it can be
helped with the work

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.470
that people at Google are doing.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.110
So we're really excited to
talk with you guys today more

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.780
about the work we're
doing and hear more about

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.930
if you guys think you're working
on anything that's relevant

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.250
or could be adapted.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.050
We're really excited
to hear about it.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.230
I will say that my
colleague, Bee, is over here.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.980
So if you want to sign
up for a newsletter

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.090
to learn more about
Grameen Foundation,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.880
she's the one to see.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.390
But with that, I'll end and see
if anybody has any questions.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.340
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious about where

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:19.690
you see the intersections of
Google's work and development,

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:26.650
so anti-poverty or anti-hunger
efforts or job training

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.940
or other significant
efforts that will have

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.170
an impact on social well-being.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I feel,
probably Google.org

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.410
[INAUDIBLE] philanthropic
arm, because they

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.550
work with non-profits
and [INAUDIBLE] I mean,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.950
she really understand
a lot about that.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.420
But I think that this--

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.410
actually, I met with
Jacqueline in Reno last week.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.430
So I think that they definitely
are a good point of contact.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.330
The only things that
we are working--

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.180
or, myself, I work in
Google Developer Relations.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.270
We deal technology, and
we work with developers.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:13.480
And we have these trainings
around the world that

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.069
focus on social impact,
because, of course,

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.569
we work with big
companies all over.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.810
But this is based
on social impact,

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.670
and we are part of
Grow with Google, which

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:27.079
is becoming a global initiative
in the US, Europe, India,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.030
Indonesia, recently launched
in Africa as well in Nigeria

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.370
in Google for Nigeria.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.900
So, in addition to these
developer trainings,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:40.090
we do internet in railway
stations, digital skills

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.480
training, many of the things
that you were talking about.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.330
I mean, just getting people
increase their ability

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.290
to get employed.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.400
And that's what we do.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.680
So, of course, we are part
Google cloud platform,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.280
which all the technology is
there in terms of whatever.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.980
We have the cloud.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.190
So interesting, I
mean we can probably

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.640
follow up and see
if we can figure out

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.560
if we can collaborate
in some way or another.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.469
Thank you.

00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:11.760
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Yeah, thanks.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760
That would be very exciting,
I think, especially

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.560
with some of the
skills training pieces.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.684
That's something that we're
always being asked for.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.040
AUDIENCE: Do you see the problem
of global poverty getting worse

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.760
with desertification
and lost variable land,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.370
basically due to global
warming and climate change?

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.828
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Absolutely, and I

00:18:31.828 --> 00:18:35.009
think it's very
geographically specific.

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:36.550
And there are parts
of the world that

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.300
are being impacted differently.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.400
So, for example, you see
areas like Mozambique

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.790
or the Philippines that are
being subjected to much more

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.750
frequent natural disasters.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:53.510
So Mozambique, for example,
is much more frequently

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.651
being hit by typhoons or
significant rains that

00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.900
are causing flooding, that
are causing crop loss, that

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.470
are causing loss of life.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.560
So we're seeing those
issues hit some countries.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.590
At the same time, we're seeing
other countries, particularly

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.570
the Sahel region
countries, where

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.680
increasing desertification
is encroaching

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.330
on areas that were
former breadbaskets

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.790
and that were producing
significant amounts of food.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.900
So there are different
impacts everywhere.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.170
But, without a doubt,
particularly the developing

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.960
world is being
disproportionately impacted

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.640
by climate change.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.940
And they are disproportionately
not contributing

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.330
to climate change.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.190
AUDIENCE: I guess the
question to the foundation

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.690
is, are you doing
anything to try

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.010
to prevent that from happening?

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.540
Is it easier to prevent people
getting into poverty because

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.950
of this than trying
to pull them out of it

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.420
afterwards, after the fact?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.878
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:50.660
So one of the projects
we've initiated,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.960
for example, in the Philippines
is an early warning system.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.702
So it's both a weather and
a pest early warning system.

00:19:56.702 --> 00:19:58.910
So one of the things we're
seeing with climate change

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:04.202
is very different pest
patterns globally because--

00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:06.560
and mosquitoes are one
that a lot of people--

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.914
it's not a crop
pest, but mosquitoes

00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:10.580
are coming into areas
that they've never

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.310
been before because the climate
in that area has changed.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.082
So, similarly, with
crop-related pests,

00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:17.540
they are coming into areas
where they've never been before,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.902
where farmers don't know how
to deal with them, as well

00:20:21.902 --> 00:20:23.485
as weather-related
risks, particularly

00:20:23.485 --> 00:20:23.945
in the Philippines.

00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:25.310
So in the Philippines
we've worked

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.851
with both the Ministry
of Agriculture

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.800
and a local university
that runs the weather

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.201
stations in the country to
develop an early warning

00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:34.700
system.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.550
So that early warning system
sends information to farmers

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.280
if there's an
inclement weather event

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.440
or if there's a pest
outbreak in their area.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.579
And not only does it tell
them about the event,

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:45.870
but it gives them instructions.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.020
So, for example, if
there's a typhoon coming,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.350
it may tell farmers, you need
to cover your trees in burlap.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.960
It may tell them, you
need to harvest early

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.580
because there'll
be total crop loss.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.410
You should harvest
what you can now.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.440
At the same time, it allows
for two-way communication.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.709
So, say, a farmer finds
a pest in their crop

00:21:03.709 --> 00:21:05.000
that they're not familiar with.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.870
They can take a picture of it.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.460
They can send it
into the system.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.170
They can receive information
back on what to do about it.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.920
But at the same time,
it will triangulate.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.494
So if several farmers in an
area report the same pest,

00:21:14.494 --> 00:21:16.910
it will then send out a warning
to all farmers in the area

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.743
that the pest has been
spotted in their area

00:21:18.743 --> 00:21:20.270
and how they should
treat for it.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.310
So early warning
system is something

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.950
that we're working on that we've
piloted in the Philippines.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.565
We're working on integrating
it into this Ghana

00:21:28.565 --> 00:21:30.523
project I was talking
about and other projects.

00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:31.697
So, yes.

00:21:31.697 --> 00:21:33.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.630
LAUREN HENDRICKS: So that
may have been way more detail

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.296
than you wanted.

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:36.492
AUDIENCE: That was perfect.

00:21:36.492 --> 00:21:37.920
AUDIENCE: Can I add to
that a little bit as well?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.750
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Yeah, of course.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.720
AUDIENCE: So farmers are the
majority of the world's poor.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.560
70% of the extreme
poor are farmers.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.890
So a lot of what
we do is in terms

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.890
of helping those farmers
increase their productivity

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.560
and the sustainability
of what they do,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.760
which is part and parcel of
adjusting to climate change.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.540
So I don't know if
you want to maybe talk

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.230
a little bit about the
savings groups work,

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:11.282
like in Burkina Faso and how
we're directly doing that.

00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:12.740
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.440
I think climate
adaptation is a big issue.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.590
And it's both a financial issue,
and it's an agricultural issue.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.540
So in Burkina Faso, we
work with women who--

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.419
and a lot of times,
particularly in Africa,

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:28.960
you'll see that men
are often engaged

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.084
in what we call cash crops.

00:22:30.084 --> 00:22:33.100
So they grow a crop that
can be sold at market,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.680
and women are engaged
in household food crops.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.540
And so we engage women in
Burkina Faso in savings groups.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.580
So they get together
on a regular basis.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.270
They save weekly, usually
a very small amount,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.250
and they're able to
pool that savings.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.119
Then they can borrow from it
if they need for an investment.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.660
But at the end of
the year, then they

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.340
receive their savings back, and
they're able to invest in it.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.910
So as part of that project,
we worked with those women

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.000
on understanding the impacts of
climate change in their region

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.766
and helping them
to modify or adapt

00:23:04.766 --> 00:23:05.890
what crops they're growing.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.600
So we've worked
with a lot of women,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.830
for example, to start
growing cowpeas or cassava

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.380
and different kinds
of orange yams, which

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.140
are much more drought
resistant and tolerant,

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.930
given the changes
that are happening.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.001
A lot of times what
happens, particularly

00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:22.750
in these rural
communities, is that people

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.480
have been engaged for
generations in farming

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.056
a certain type of crop, and they
really understand that crop.

00:23:28.056 --> 00:23:29.680
And as climate change
happens, and they

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.630
need to move into
crops that are going

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.510
to be more appropriate,
given what their new climate

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.880
reality is, they don't
have that level of skill

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.010
and understanding of that crop.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.010
And so helping them have the
information on what crops

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.620
are going to work for them now
and how they should grow it

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.994
and how to harvest
it, et cetera,

00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:47.769
is an important
part of our work.

00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:50.310
And then making sure they have
the resources to invest in it.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:55.150
It's very risky for
smallholder farmers.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.100
Cassava is one of the things
I dislike most in this world,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.620
because it's a very
drought-resistant crop,

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.100
and it grows almost everywhere.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.850
So a lot of people
have a lot of incentive

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.040
to grow cassava because it
will come in no matter what.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.480
And you will be able to
feed your family on it.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.500
It is a very low-nutrient--

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.640
cassava's like a
yam, a yellow yam.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.120
But it doesn't have the
nutrients that yams do.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.560
And particularly, for young
children, it's hard to digest.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.700
So you see young children
who eat a lot of cassava

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.070
actually tend to be
more malnourished, even

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.962
though they're getting
a lot of calories--

00:24:30.962 --> 00:24:32.670
because they can't
digest them very well.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.294
They tend to be
extremely malnourished.

00:24:34.294 --> 00:24:37.440
But people plant it
because it fills bellies.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.750
And so if we can give
people the information

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.630
they need on other crops that
will do as well as cassava

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.550
but will have much more
nutritional benefit

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.320
for the household, like yellow
and orange sweet potatoes,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.959
like cowpeas, which are
extremely drought resistant.

00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:54.000
If we can help them to
understand these new crops

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.740
that they can be using,
which are readily

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.770
available in their areas,
and how to harvest them,

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.310
not only will they potentially
have a better harvest,

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.260
but it will be more
nutrient rich food for them.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.070
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about mobile financial services

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.600
and device security.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.300
A lot of these cheaper
Android devices

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.990
basically never get
security updates.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.420
Have you found any practices
that help protect people

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.340
if they're acting as
the financial agent

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.804
for their whole village of
keeping their device secure?

00:25:23.804 --> 00:25:24.720
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Yes.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.520
I would say that device
security is probably

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.110
pretty low on a lot of
people's priority lists.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.680
What is high, and where I think
we're seeing a lot of momentum,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.860
is moving people towards
more and better smartphones.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.450
So you see a lot
of people still--

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.950
most people,
particularly in Africa,

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.544
are still using--
well, Africa, India,

00:25:49.544 --> 00:25:51.960
most development countries are
still using feature phones.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.220
So the big push is to try and
get people onto smartphones

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.175
and to get people
more access to data.

00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:01.050
Because even when people
move to smartphones,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.640
data can be very
expensive still.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.470
So the short answer
to your question

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.960
is, not really doing a
lot on device security.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.680
AUDIENCE: Are
feature phones more

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.130
resistant to malware than a
typical low-end smartphone?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.560
AUDIENCE: I don't
know [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.520
LAUREN HENDRICKS: I don't
know the answer to that.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.130
My guess would be yes,
only because it doesn't

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.195
have very many features.

00:26:21.195 --> 00:26:23.070
They don't have very
many features for people

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.372
to mess with.

00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:26.580
And usually, then, when
you're using a feature phone,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.910
you're using USSD
or SMS technology

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.089
to access your accounts
or do your transactions.

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:33.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.005
I was curious
about something you

00:26:35.005 --> 00:26:38.310
said about using blockchain
for medical records.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.575
I was curious what makes
that technology specifically

00:26:42.575 --> 00:26:45.330
suitable for that purpose
versus some other database

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.370
platform or some other system.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:47.970
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Yeah, I think one

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.230
of the things that
makes blockchain

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.980
interesting in that
particular use case--

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.438
and it's one we're
still exploring.

00:26:52.438 --> 00:26:54.750
We haven't implemented yet--

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.200
is the ability for those
records to be transferable

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.120
across borders and to be
accessible through biometrics.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.070
So if a person returns
to their home country,

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.000
a lot of times when
refugees cross borders,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.710
they don't have
documentation with them.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.751
So they don't have their
national IDs, et cetera.

00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.790
So the ability to build
biometrics into that

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.980
and to make it accessible
when people cross borders

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.880
are what makes blockchain
particularly interesting

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.900
in a lot of these cases.

00:27:26.037 --> 00:27:28.370
I think a lot of people are
very bullish on blockchain--

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.900
and I'm also bullish
on blockchain--

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.420
but I think people want
to use it a lot of times

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.250
when you could just
use a regular database.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.799
And so I've heard
people tell me,

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:43.340
even if it's just
a regular database,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.339
go ahead and put it in
blockchain because that's

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:47.390
where the world is moving.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.510
And then other people have said,
it's a complicated technology.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.810
If you could just use a
database, just use a database.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.790
So we're probably
still on the just use

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.850
a database side of things.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.570
People are thumbing
me up, so I'm

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.981
hoping that's the right answer.

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:04.645
AUDIENCE: I'll try and ask
loudly because the mic's

00:28:04.645 --> 00:28:06.341
over there.

00:28:06.341 --> 00:28:08.630
You talked about the amount
and the wealth of data

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.935
you guys have collected.

00:28:09.935 --> 00:28:12.380
What's your view on
making that data publicly

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.732
available for people to
help you gain insights from?

00:28:16.732 --> 00:28:17.690
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.670
So I'll just repeat
it, in case--

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.190
the question was, because
we have such a large amount

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.430
of data, what our position
is on sharing that publicly,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.677
which is a good question.

00:28:27.677 --> 00:28:29.510
And I have a good answer,
because I was just

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.360
meeting with our tech
person this morning.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.961
So we have a huge amount of
data in different systems.

00:28:34.961 --> 00:28:36.710
So we're going through
a process right now

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.190
of cleaning that data.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.399
I think we're very open to
sharing it in a couple of ways.

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:44.690
One, we're open to anonymizing
it and sharing it widely

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.400
so that people can
do research with it.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.670
We're also open to
sharing it in ways

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.970
that allow people to provide
services to specific farmers.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.600
So, for example, we have
a lot of data in Uganda,

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.350
and we are working
now actively on making

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.060
that accessible to
financial institutions

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.710
so that they can
identify farmers

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.070
who need to invest in their
farms and lend to them.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.820
What we are quite
specific on is that that

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.000
needs to be a relationship
that the farmer understands

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.420
and agrees to.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.430
Centenary Bank is one of
our partners in Uganda,

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.340
which is a large national bank.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.680
So, say, Centenary Bank wants
to access a farmer's data

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.540
to see if they want to
make a loan to them.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.150
The farmer either
needs to receive an SMS

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.657
and say, yes, I
consent to Centenary,

00:29:31.657 --> 00:29:33.740
or the farmer needs to be
able to push their data.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.564
So the farmers talk
to the Centenary Bank.

00:29:35.564 --> 00:29:36.980
They want to send
them their data.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.355
They can push it
from the system.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.999
There needs to be a consent
process where the end user is

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:46.790
able to consent, because
when we originally

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.400
collected their data,
we didn't understand--

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.480
some of them may have
started five years ago.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.780
We didn't know what we
could be doing with it.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.950
They didn't consent at that
time to sharing it widely.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.040
Going forward, we may have
different consent protocols.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.380
But I think it's important.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.430
And this gets back to the
blockchain thing a little bit.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.347
Poor people don't
understand all of the things

00:30:09.347 --> 00:30:10.763
you could be doing
with their data

00:30:10.763 --> 00:30:12.380
and where their
data could be going.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.316
And even if they
sign a consent form,

00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:17.690
is that really
meaningful consent

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.189
if they don't understand
what we're all talking

00:30:20.189 --> 00:30:21.480
about with this big data stuff?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.470
And so how can you make their
data available but still

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.210
give them some level
of control over it?

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.710
We talked a lot
about, particularly,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.510
because we work sometimes
in refugee situations.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.540
What are people's
rights to anonymity,

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.300
right to be forgotten,
and what are

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.480
the dangers that go along
with people's data being

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.390
publicly available?

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:44.030
So, anyway, it's something
we think a lot about.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.160
AUDIENCE: So I grew up
in farming in Florida,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.670
and a lot of the industrialized
techniques that we had,

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.530
they made sense
because of economy

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.090
of scale and heavy equipment
and stuff like that.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.700
How much of that industrialized
techniques, how many of those

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.570
apply, and have you
looked into any research

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.950
with more specific techniques,
smaller techniques?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.640
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
So that all depends.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.960
And I'm going to say I'm
not an agriculture expert.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.490
So things like data for
farming is something

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.360
that you can parse out
pretty easily and cheaply.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.830
Other technologies like--

00:31:29.426 --> 00:31:30.650
I don't know.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.840
I'm trying to think.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.570
There's a lot of work that's
been done, not necessarily

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:39.080
by us, but around cooperative
ownership of technology,

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.580
whether that
technology is a large--

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.217
what's the word I'm looking for?

00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:46.050
AUDIENCE: Harvester.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:46.430
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Harvester.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.930
There we go.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.100
Thank you.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.652
Or other machinery.

00:31:50.652 --> 00:31:52.610
Cooperative ownership
and cooperative movements

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.584
are big in developing
countries, as well as in the US.

00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:59.000
But data I think
is something that

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.200
can be parsed out to
the individual farmers

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.830
so that they can
take action on it.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.040
To add on to that, I do think
even in the developing world,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.306
farm fragmentation is
an issue we deal with,

00:32:10.306 --> 00:32:11.930
particularly because
of climate change,

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:16.490
as arable land is
shrinking in some areas.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.240
You have a farmer.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.470
He has so much land.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.310
He has three sons.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.660
It gets divided
among the three sons.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.535
They have three sons.

00:32:21.535 --> 00:32:22.400
It gets divided.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.470
And so there is a
consolidation process

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.960
that needs to happen in
the developing world,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.007
and it's a lot of what
we talk about and gets

00:32:30.007 --> 00:32:32.090
to maybe some of the skills
training opportunities

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:36.410
because there needs to be
off-farm rural enterprise that

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.680
can pull labor off of
farms and allow for farm

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.860
consolidation in
a lot of countries

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.860
to make smallholding
farming more profitable.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.650
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.090
As somebody at Google
who mostly spends

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:54.110
time thinking about
consumer technologies

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.700
and sometimes enterprise
technologies in the development

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:02.090
world, I am curious
what you've seen out

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.960
in the developing world as far
as interesting or surprising

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.960
uses of technologies that
we've developed here,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.990
big products like Gmail or
Android phones or-- contacts

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.130
and address book is
the area where I work.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.300
What have you seen out there,
them using the products

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.490
that we've developed an
interesting and surprising

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.860
ways?

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.568
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
That's a good question.

00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:28.550
It was interesting.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.620
I lived for seven
years in Tanzania.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.450
I came home about two
or three years ago.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.620
And I was amazed how many
people here don't use WhatsApp.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.000
In East Africa, WhatsApp is the
primary mode of communication,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.710
and WhatsApp is now
being used and piloted

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.984
for mobile money transfers.

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:47.900
So I think there's a lot
of interesting things

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.864
that are happening in
developing countries that

00:33:49.864 --> 00:33:50.780
aren't happening here.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.200
It's interesting, one of
those like aha moments for me.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.360
I went to one of these women
savings groups in Kenya.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.940
And we had worked with
them with a partner bank.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.350
And they had a savings
account on their mobile phone

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.910
that they could deposit into.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.880
So I was asking one of
the women in this group,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.170
OK, you have a savings account.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.429
What type of financial product
do you want next on your phone?

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.080
Do you want access to credit?

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.000
Do you want insurance?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.530
Do you want agricultural credit?

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.196
She said, just put
them all on my phone,

00:34:23.196 --> 00:34:24.780
and I'll decide
what I want to use.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.159
So the hunger for
these tech solutions

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.469
is really, really high.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:33.401
I talked to a woman same day
in a different group who said,

00:34:33.401 --> 00:34:35.150
God I had to turn
Facebook off on my phone

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.389
because I was just
using it too much.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.570
I had flown on an airplane
to a secondary city.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.870
I had driven an hour.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.750
I had taken a boat
across the lake

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.239
and gotten to this
rural community.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:49.021
It was a four-hour
trek to get there.

00:34:49.021 --> 00:34:51.229
And here's a woman telling
me I use Facebook too much

00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:53.479
and I have to turn it off
because it's distracting me.

00:34:53.479 --> 00:34:56.810
So the hunger for technology
is really, really high

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.290
in these communities.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.550
And there's, I think, this myth
that a lot of these communities

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.610
aren't very tech savvy.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:07.106
But they're really taking
up a lot of this technology.

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:09.498
AUDIENCE: Thanks, and I
have another question, too,

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:10.456
as long as I'm up here.

00:35:10.456 --> 00:35:11.622
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Go for it.

00:35:11.622 --> 00:35:14.450
AUDIENCE: So Google is full of
idealistic people with software

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.310
engineering skills.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.385
If one of those
people, hypothetically,

00:35:18.385 --> 00:35:21.820
wanted to put those skills
to work ending world hunger

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.070
or poverty, what are
the opportunities that

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.970
are out there on either a
volunteer or full-time basis

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.230
or whatever?

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.813
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
One of my colleagues

00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:34.310
will be so excited
that you asked.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.010
We have a program in
Grameen Foundation,

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.440
inappropriately named
Bankers Without Borders,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.940
because it started
in our early days

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.994
when we were focused
primarily on microfinance.

00:35:43.994 --> 00:35:45.410
But it is a volunteer
program that

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.210
lets working
professionals volunteer

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.300
their time, either
here from the US,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.840
providing remote assistance,
or traveling to a developing

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.260
country to work with a local
partner for two to three weeks.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.030
And so it's a volunteer program,
and we work with our partners

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.880
in developing countries who
have needs for assistance

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.230
and with professionals here
to try and match them up.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.880
So if you see Bee, she'll
get you some information--

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.056
and anyone else who wants
to volunteer their time--

00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:14.680
get you some information
on the Bankers

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.227
Without Borders program.

00:36:16.227 --> 00:36:17.060
And you can sign up.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.750
And some of it's as
un-time-consuming

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.990
as, say, we're working with
a small business in East

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.170
Africa that is
thinking about using

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.090
a technology in a certain
way, and they just

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:32.450
want to have a brainstorm
session with some people.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.730
And so they'll set up
an ideation session,

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.790
Bankers Without
Borders will, and maybe

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.090
try and find five or six
professionals here in the US

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:46.430
or in Europe who can just sit
in on a Skype call or a WebEx

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.160
and talk through
with the CEO what

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.456
technology might fit his needs.

00:36:51.456 --> 00:36:53.080
And then it could be
everything from we

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.120
have people who do
year-long fellowships funded

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.280
by their employers
to sit in a partner

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.750
and really work
with them in-depth

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.833
over the course of a year.

00:37:03.833 --> 00:37:05.674
And then everything in-between.

00:37:05.674 --> 00:37:07.340
So if you're interested
in volunteering,

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.590
definitely look at that
program and sign up for it.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.158
It's really amazing.

00:37:12.158 --> 00:37:12.824
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:37:12.824 --> 00:37:13.820
Thank you.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.510
LAUREN HENDRICKS:
Thanks so much.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.200
I'm going to let the
Google guy go first.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.600
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to understand what

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.080
parameters that you
look at on deciding

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.286
do you want to service this
country or this area or not,

00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:29.910
because I'm sure
there's a lot of areas

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.560
that need your services.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.480
How do you decide that?

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.561
LAUREN HENDRICKS: That's
a very good question.

00:37:35.561 --> 00:37:37.560
I think one of the things
for Grameen Foundation

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.140
is that we are really looking
at sustainable solutions.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.460
So we often have opportunities
to work on initiatives

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.200
that we think can benefit
maybe 10 to 15,000 people

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.840
but we don't understand
long term how

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.594
we would make that sustainable.

00:37:57.594 --> 00:37:59.010
Could we embed it
in a government?

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.810
Could we embed it
in a private sector?

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:05.249
For us, if we can't understand
the long-term sustainability,

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:07.290
it's a project that we
would probably pass up on.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.635
And there are other groups
who could do that and maybe do

00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:14.010
a good job, and
it has a benefit.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.134
But our long-term DNA is
to look for something that

00:38:16.134 --> 00:38:18.000
can be long-term sustainable.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.460
We are an organization that
has a heavy tech history,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.150
and so primarily, we're
looking at opportunities

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.450
where we can identify
ways to use technology

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.620
in ways that can maybe leapfrog
or find disruptive innovations

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.340
to solutions.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.600
So that being said, it's
a case-by-case basis.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.910
We almost always want a
local partner on the ground,

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.980
be that private sector,
government, or a local entity,

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.840
who can do the
implementation and who can

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.297
be the long-term owner of it.

00:38:50.297 --> 00:38:52.630
AUDIENCE: And do the local
partners reach out to you as,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.210
do they initiate
the first contact,

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.290
or do you see opportunities
and then reach out to the--

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.040
LAUREN HENDRICKS: That
really can depend.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.410
Sometimes if we
have an opportunity,

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.000
if [INAUDIBLE]
puts out a call, we

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.875
may go out and look for
a particular partner.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.410
Other times, somebody
might come to us and say--

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.660
So Musoni is a good
example of that.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.650
They're the first all-digital
microfinance institution

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.410
in Kenya.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.740
And so they came to
us saying, we really

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.087
want to build out an
agricultural financing product.

00:39:25.087 --> 00:39:26.670
So can you help us
think through that?

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.082
So we worked with them, and
we had some BWP volunteers

00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:32.040
who worked with them to
help think through what

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.002
an agricultural finance
product would look like

00:39:36.002 --> 00:39:38.460
and how they could roll that
out across their organization.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.543
And it's now become their
most profitable product.

00:39:40.543 --> 00:39:42.427
So it works both
ways a little bit.

00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:43.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.160
LAUREN HENDRICKS: Thanks.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.370
Thanks, you guys,
so much for coming.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.140
I was really, A, worried
nobody would come,

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.610
and then worried nobody
would ask any questions.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.890
So I really appreciate it.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.720
Appreciate your time
and the work Google

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.220
is doing, because
I know many things

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.050
that you guys do are really
contributing to the work

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.883
that we do overseas.

00:39:55.883 --> 00:39:56.730
So thanks so much.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.563
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:57.563 --> 00:40:00.380
[APPLAUSE]
