In this lesson,
we'll first look at why and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.050
how to break up a complex
app into reusable libraries.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.410
In the process, we'll learn a bit about
Gradle support for multi project builds.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.510
Then, we'll dive into some of the
advanced features of the Android plugin

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.850
for Gradle, including automatic
signing and test support.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.430
Let's get started.
