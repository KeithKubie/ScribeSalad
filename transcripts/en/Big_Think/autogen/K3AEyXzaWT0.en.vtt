trouble we were in has indicated by
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.370

looking at the difference between the

on August 10th on August seventh they

on August 10th on August seventh they
 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.930
on August 10th on August seventh they
were reiterating there that they would

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940
were reiterating there that they would
 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.700

hold the of the federal funds rate
 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.010
hold the of the federal funds rate
steady and I think at that time was five

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020
steady and I think at that time was five
 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.970
steady and I think at that time was five
and a quarter percent that and that they

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980
and a quarter percent that and that they
 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.630
and a quarter percent that and that they
still anticipated the possibility of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640
still anticipated the possibility of
 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.490
still anticipated the possibility of
inflation and then three days later the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
inflation and then three days later the
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.460
inflation and then three days later the
press release said point south at a

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470
press release said point south at a
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.810

number of financial markets are likely

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820
number of financial markets are likely
 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.920
number of financial markets are likely
to experience considerable stress and

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930
to experience considerable stress and
 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.080
to experience considerable stress and
well tell me about it the mortgage

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
well tell me about it the mortgage
 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.790
well tell me about it the mortgage
market had fallen had completely

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800
market had fallen had completely
 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.250
market had fallen had completely
collapsed and it was in the it was the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
collapsed and it was in the it was the
 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.550
collapsed and it was in the it was the
derivatives market that was the tip-off

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560
derivatives market that was the tip-off
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.710
derivatives market that was the tip-off
you see that derivatives market was was

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720
you see that derivatives market was was
 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.990
you see that derivatives market was was
the kind of and its collapse was the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
the kind of and its collapse was the
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.600
the kind of and its collapse was the
first indication that they that the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610
first indication that they that the
 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.690
first indication that they that the
whole mortgage market was in was in

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700
whole mortgage market was in was in
 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.420
whole mortgage market was in was in
serious trouble and no one has I think

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430
serious trouble and no one has I think
 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.210
serious trouble and no one has I think
better expert a econometric and economic

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220
 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.580
analysis and the Federal Reserve but it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590
analysis and the Federal Reserve but it
 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.410
analysis and the Federal Reserve but it
doesn't mean that they can predict what

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420
doesn't mean that they can predict what
 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.460
doesn't mean that they can predict what
is not predictable and and so it's it's

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470
is not predictable and and so it's it's
 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.440
is not predictable and and so it's it's
clear that the experts

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450
clear that the experts
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.280
clear that the experts
were surprised and blindsided by that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290
were surprised and blindsided by that
 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.140
were surprised and blindsided by that
development but I think it's super

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150
development but I think it's super
 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.180
development but I think it's super
Bernanke's credit that he moved pretty

what seemed to be like a pretty dis in a
pretty decisive way at that time to

pretty decisive way at that time to
 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.780
pretty decisive way at that time to
dramatically enhance the liquidity of

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790
dramatically enhance the liquidity of
 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.660
dramatically enhance the liquidity of
the banking system the problem is that

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670
the banking system the problem is that
 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.310
the banking system the problem is that
what was happening I think in the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
what was happening I think in the
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.980
what was happening I think in the
mortgage market indicated that what the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990
mortgage market indicated that what the
 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.350
mortgage market indicated that what the
bank's face faced was a solvency problem

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360
bank's face faced was a solvency problem
 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.930
bank's face faced was a solvency problem
not just a liquidity problem now

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940
not just a liquidity problem now
 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.610
not just a liquidity problem now
sometimes of course it's hard to tell

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620
sometimes of course it's hard to tell
 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.460
sometimes of course it's hard to tell
the difference you have a solvency

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
the difference you have a solvency
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.030
the difference you have a solvency
problem you see if if the fundamental

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040
problem you see if if the fundamental
 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.730
problem you see if if the fundamental
value of your assets are lessened about

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740
value of your assets are lessened about
 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.240
value of your assets are lessened about
the value of your obligations that's

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250
the value of your obligations that's
 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.130
the value of your obligations that's
different from a liquidity problem into

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140
different from a liquidity problem into
 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.190
different from a liquidity problem into
in the sense that you just have a a

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200
in the sense that you just have a a
 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:31.240
in the sense that you just have a a
short-term need for for funds and of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250
short-term need for for funds and of
 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.940
short-term need for for funds and of
course you can have if you have a

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950
course you can have if you have a
 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.370
course you can have if you have a
short-term need for funds and a lack of

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380
short-term need for funds and a lack of
 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.370
short-term need for funds and a lack of
liquidity that can cause distress sales

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380
liquidity that can cause distress sales
 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.860
liquidity that can cause distress sales
and create a solvency problem but and I

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870
and create a solvency problem but and I
 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.180
and create a solvency problem but and I
think that's the way that Bernanke saw

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190
think that's the way that Bernanke saw
 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.090
think that's the way that Bernanke saw
the situation he was in in august two

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100
the situation he was in in august two
 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.780
the situation he was in in august two
thousand seven and it's also i think

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790
thousand seven and it's also i think
 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.800
thousand seven and it's also i think
pretty much how he saw the developments

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810
pretty much how he saw the developments
 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.220
pretty much how he saw the developments
in the early 30s an early part of the

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230
in the early 30s an early part of the
 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.470
in the early 30s an early part of the
great depression that the Federal

think in both cases they're both in in

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320
think in both cases they're both in in

started to had come down and in fact
that that had been developing for all

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710
that that had been developing for all
 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.650
that that had been developing for all

the late 1920s just as it had been

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320
the late 1920s just as it had been
 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.410
the late 1920s just as it had been
developing the defaults were starting to

thousand five six and seven started to
 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.130
thousand five six and seven started to
become then critical in in 2007 but I

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140
become then critical in in 2007 but I
 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:22.980
become then critical in in 2007 but I
think the point is that the point about

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990
 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.150
personal knowledge palani and also hiked

personal knowledge palani and also hiked
 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.990
personal knowledge palani and also hiked
emphasizes this that there's a

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000
emphasizes this that there's a
 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.060
emphasizes this that there's a
difference between knowing that and

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070
difference between knowing that and
 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.320
difference between knowing that and
knowing how you know academic knowledge

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330
knowing how you know academic knowledge
 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.170
knowing how you know academic knowledge
tends to be based very much upon knowing

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180
tends to be based very much upon knowing
 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.340
tends to be based very much upon knowing
about things knowing being able to

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350
about things knowing being able to
 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.710
about things knowing being able to
analyze conditions after the fact but

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720
analyze conditions after the fact but
 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.480
analyze conditions after the fact but
but that doesn't necessarily give you

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490
but that doesn't necessarily give you
 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.710
but that doesn't necessarily give you
good capacity to predict in advance and

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720
good capacity to predict in advance and
 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.280
good capacity to predict in advance and
in particular it's just like those of us

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.290
in particular it's just like those of us
 

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.470
in particular it's just like those of us
that do experimental economics we

00:07:59.470 --> 00:07:59.480
that do experimental economics we
 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.490
that do experimental economics we
realize that and this is true gentleman

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:03.500
realize that and this is true gentleman

and all of experimental sciences and you

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.100
and all of experimental sciences and you
 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.830
and all of experimental sciences and you
find this input on you when he talks

find this input on you when he talks
 

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.060
find this input on you when he talks
about personal knowledge there's a lot

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.070
about personal knowledge there's a lot
 

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.070
about personal knowledge there's a lot
of human capital involved in the

of human capital involved in the
 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.380
of human capital involved in the

form of can-do knowledge that you learn
 

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.340
form of can-do knowledge that you learn
by being involved in doing lots of

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.350
by being involved in doing lots of
 

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.130
by being involved in doing lots of

it's a matter of practice and you can

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.350
it's a matter of practice and you can
 

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.730
it's a matter of practice and you can
have a good understanding of say the

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:17.740
have a good understanding of say the

1930s about what happened then but it
 

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.890
1930s about what happened then but it
doesn't mean yet when you're in in the

doesn't mean yet when you're in in the
 

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.780
doesn't mean yet when you're in in the
middle of the storm you will recognize

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:27.790
middle of the storm you will recognize
 

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.600
middle of the storm you will recognize
that it's happening around you because

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.610
that it's happening around you because
 

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.900
that it's happening around you because
it's just a different kind of

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:38.910
 

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.100
understanding based upon based upon

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.110
understanding based upon based upon
 

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.150
understanding based upon based upon
practice and not necessarily the kind of

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160
practice and not necessarily the kind of
 

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.090

academic analysis and knowledge that we

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.100
academic analysis and knowledge that we
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.100
academic analysis and knowledge that we
get through econometric analysis and

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.110
get through econometric analysis and
 

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.260
get through econometric analysis and
studies and I think that's basically a

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.270
studies and I think that's basically a
 

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.790
studies and I think that's basically a
problem and it means that you shouldn't

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800
problem and it means that you shouldn't
 

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.370
problem and it means that you shouldn't
have too high expectations as to what

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.380
have too high expectations as to what
 

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:12.590
have too high expectations as to what
the ability of our experts to deliver is

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600
the ability of our experts to deliver is
 

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.200
the ability of our experts to deliver is
there going to be fallible and what

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.210
there going to be fallible and what
 

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.180
there going to be fallible and what
we've seen I think in throughout this

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.190
we've seen I think in throughout this
 

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.870
we've seen I think in throughout this
crisis is both in the Federal Reserve

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880
crisis is both in the Federal Reserve
 

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:27.140
crisis is both in the Federal Reserve
and also in the US Treasury and other

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.150
 

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.700
agencies of government you've had people

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:29.710
agencies of government you've had people
 

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.730
agencies of government you've had people
learning as they go and a lot of the

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:32.740
learning as they go and a lot of the
 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.140
learning as they go and a lot of the
policies are being made up as they go

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.150
policies are being made up as they go
 

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:42.560
policies are being made up as they go
and that's I think an inevitable

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:42.570
and that's I think an inevitable
 

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.710
and that's I think an inevitable
consequence of the imperfection

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720
consequence of the imperfection
 

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.390
consequence of the imperfection
imperfection of our knowledge and the

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:48.400
imperfection of our knowledge and the
 

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.840
imperfection of our knowledge and the
limits of our ability to to practically

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:51.850
limits of our ability to to practically
 

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.370
limits of our ability to to practically
manage complex systems like the US the

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:56.380
manage complex systems like the US the
 

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.690
manage complex systems like the US the
US economy and this

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:00.700
US economy and this
 

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.360
US economy and this
and so what's important is really to

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.370
and so what's important is really to
 

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.390
and so what's important is really to
avoid these kind of crisis situations in

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:06.400
avoid these kind of crisis situations in
 

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.540
avoid these kind of crisis situations in
the first place and because they're so

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:09.550
the first place and because they're so
 

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.860
the first place and because they're so
far so difficult to deal with once we

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:13.870
far so difficult to deal with once we
 

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.450
far so difficult to deal with once we
get into them because if nothing else

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.460
get into them because if nothing else
 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.760
get into them because if nothing else
the politics of these situations will

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:20.770
the politics of these situations will
 

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.640
the politics of these situations will
drive policy and that and not and the

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:23.650
drive policy and that and not and the
 

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.390
drive policy and that and not and the
politics is not necessarily a good

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:27.400
politics is not necessarily a good
 

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:33.240
politics is not necessarily a good
long-term economic policy and and of

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.250
long-term economic policy and and of
 

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.450
long-term economic policy and and of
course the way to have avoided this kind

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:36.460
course the way to have avoided this kind
 

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.250
course the way to have avoided this kind
of a problem in the first place was they

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:38.260
of a problem in the first place was they
 

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.110
of a problem in the first place was they
have better federal better

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120
have better federal better
 

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.330
