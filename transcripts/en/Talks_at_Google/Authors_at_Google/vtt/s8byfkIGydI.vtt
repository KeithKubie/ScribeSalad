[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.250
CLINT SMITH: Much appreciated.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.365
How's everybody doing?

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:10.760
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.050
CLINT SMITH: Good?

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.383
I appreciate you all coming out.

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:15.400
It's always funny, these
events at workplaces,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.346
because you're just
not doing your work,

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:19.850
and you're like, we're just
going to put it aside and come

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.350
kick it.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.933
So I appreciate you
coming to kick it.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.250
And even if your
supervisors or bosses are

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.540
like, what are you doing?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.998
Maybe they don't
do that at Google.

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:29.740
Maybe they're like,
yeah go be full people.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.650
Or maybe that's just what it
seems like from the outside.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.420
But yeah, I really appreciate
you all being here.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.450
And so I'm going to
share some poems.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.700
We'll have some conversations.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.074
It's going to be
chill, intimate.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.670
Hello, everybody in
the other places.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.700
This is trippy in this
very Google-y way.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.720
But I am deeply
appreciative of being

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.520
here and deeply appreciative
of Google Maps and everything

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.970
you all do to get me
where I need to be.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.000
And so this was
positioned or talked

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.460
about as MLK, black poems--
thinking about the relationship

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.920
of blackness to poetry and art.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.107
And so we're going
to talk about that.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.440
So for some background-- so
I taught high school English

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.689
for several years in Prince
George's County, Maryland,

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.710
before I went to
start graduate school.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.620
So I'm a fourth year
PhD student now.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.200
I taught in Prince George's
County starting in 2011.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.790
And I tell this
story because I think

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.670
it's necessary to understand
how I'm thinking about this work

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.040
generally is that the
first day of school,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.470
I came into my classroom.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.350
I had this whole plan for how
things were going to work out.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.750
And I had clearly watched
way too many teacher movies,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.240
because I was just like, OK,
I got the whole thing down.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.277
And so my students were
coming into the room.

00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:50.110
They were streaming in,
first day of school.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.490
Nobody's very excited.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.840
They wish it was still summer.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.590
They're coming in, and
I'm sitting on my chair.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.490
And my feet are like
kicked up on the desk,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.390
and my arms are crossed, and
I'm just watching kids come in.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.180
And I don't have a
beard at this point.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.112
So I'm this person who
looks just like them,

00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:05.320
like a bunch of 16-year-olds.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.410
And they're like,
who is this student

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.659
sitting in the teacher's desk?

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.960
[LAUGHING]

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.180
And they're streaming in.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.890
And I get up very dramatically.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.800
And I walk to the
board, and I walk over,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.500
and I pick up the
chalk, and I write,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.720
mass incarceration, food
insecurity, immigration,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.290
poverty.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.600
And I just write all
of these social ills.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.240
And then I throw the
chalk on the ground.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.150
And I say, this year, we're
going to solve all that.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.662
And they were just like,
Mr., where's the worksheet?

00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:37.370
This is too much.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.239
[LAUGHING]

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.030
What are you doing?

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.060
This is too much.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940
And it was clear
that I had watched

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.690
far too many Denzel movies.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.640
But I had also read
Paulo Freire's "Pedagogy

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.390
of the Oppressed."

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.098
I'm not sure if
anybody's read that book.

00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:53.490
But he's a pioneer, in many
ways, of critical pedagogy,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.790
thinking about education
as a emancipatory project

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.610
and thinking about how we
can move away from singularly

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.340
thinking about education in
terms of a teacher bestowing

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.420
information that a student
simply receives and rather

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.792
a collective project to
have young people or anybody

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.000
engaging in this project
understand that the world is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.125
a social construction and
thus can be reconstructed

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.520
and deconstructed and
made into something new

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.870
and that the
existence of the world

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.080
is not an event of inevitability
but is instead something

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.650
that was built and thus
something that can be rebuilt.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.376
And so I was like,
I read that book.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.750
I watched a couple
Denzel movies.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.220
I was like, I'm ready
to be a teacher.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.770
Here we go.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.810
So I come into the classroom.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.140
I do that very dramatic thing.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.770
The students are
like, this is strange.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.540
I don't understand.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.690
And part of why I say that is
I think I came in and expected

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.440
to cultivate this classroom of
young revolutionaries from the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.200
get.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.370
And part of what I realized is
that before you get to shaping

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.900
and having someone think about
their political sensibilities

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.025
and thinking about what
they care about politically

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.904
and socially, I think
what has to happen

00:04:04.904 --> 00:04:06.570
is people have to do
the work personally

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.960
to understand who they are
and what they care about,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.480
what kind of factors and
conversations and people

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.430
and places have
shaped who they are.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.077
And thus, that gives
them a better sense

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:19.660
of how they have a sense of what
they do and don't care about.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.550
And so before I get overly
ostensibly political

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.740
with my work, I'm a new father.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.880
And so I have a little
seven-month-old at the house.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.115
And he has just been sleep
trained, which is a miracle.

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:34.740
It really makes you
look at parenthood.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.240
And you're just
like, man, everybody

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.250
who has more than one
child, you are Jesus to me.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.490
I don't understand.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.070
I really don't understand
how people do it.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.820
It's amazing.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.580
And shout-out to
single parents, too.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.890
I think intellectually
I understood

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.930
that being a single parent
is a difficult thing.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.580
But it's not until you have
a kid that you are just like,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.480
it is astonishing and
astounding what a single parent

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.900
has to do in order to bring
their child up in a world

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.800
that specifically--

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.690
and we have public
policy that specifically

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.300
make it difficult
for single parents,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.110
from your school system to tax
breaks to all of these things.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.830
So I'm going to
start by reading--

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.526
a lot of what I've been
writing and thinking about

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:21.900
and what's been
animating my work

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.500
is fatherhood and a
bunch of dad poems.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.120
And so my first book
was this reflection

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.420
on the history of political
violence against black bodies.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.310
And my second book is, my son
is 2, and he likes to smile.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.280
So it's the full scope.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.980
So I'm going to
read some dad poems.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.847
And just so people know--

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.930
I think people understand.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.781
But this is not a
traditional poetry reading.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:53.780
I think people sometimes
go to a poetry reading,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.613
and they think you're
supposed to sit there,

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:59.870
and you're supposed
to say, hmm, hmm.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.620
And then you do a
polite little golf clap.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.130
That's a whack.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.060
We don't do that here.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.684
So if you like
something, can you snap?

00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:05.696
[SNAPPING]

00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:07.380
If you really, really
like something,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.671
we say you do the delicious
chocolate noise, and that's

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:11.170
when you go, mmmm.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.336
OK, everybody go, hmmm.

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:13.290
AUDIENCE: Hmmm.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.820
CLINT SMITH: If you really,
really like somebody that just

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.945
viscerally moves you, hits
you in the chest, that's

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:18.520
when you say, Jesus,
but with a "SHA"

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.561
because it's a secular
space, so we say "Shesus,"

00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:22.590
and you fall over on
the person next to you.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.290
But please check with the
person next to you first.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.190
This is flu season.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.485
We don't want people
leaving in bad spirits.

00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:32.214
Word.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.310
It's funny because
I always do that.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.480
I perform and read my poems in
high schools, middle schools,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.300
and prisons and universities.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.709
And I would do that little
bit for middle schoolers.

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:49.250
And so I would go and be like,
yeah, and then you say Shesus,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.140
and you fall over on
the person next to you,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.316
which was a huge mistake.

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:54.440
I should have never done
that, because I said that,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.410
and then two seconds
into the poem,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.600
it was just a bunch of
10-year-olds "Shesusing"

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.780
all over each other, and
they were just like--

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.490
I was like, "The history of
slavery," and they were like,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.781
"Shesus," and they would just--

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:08.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.960
They were just rolling
on top of each other,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.940
and I was like, all
right, we're going

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.800
to have to figure out
a new way to enter

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.510
the poem for the 10-year-olds.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.770
So one thing about
having a kid is

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.430
that things that were previously
these quotidian tasks that you

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.310
didn't really put much
effort or thought into

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.510
become these like very
Herculean activities.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.280
And so going to the
grocery store used

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.560
to be this little thing
you did on the way home.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.990
And now it's, you
grab the diaper bag,

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.550
and you grab the
bottle, and then

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.050
you balance him on your foot.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.907
And so this is a poem about me
taking him to the grocery store

00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:50.240
and what our experience is like.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.240
In the grocery store, you are
wrapped tightly onto my chest

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.400
in a cloth that is sturdy
enough to secure you

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.640
but flexible enough not to let
you breathe without straining.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.464
We are perusing
the cereal aisle,

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:05.880
and they are playing
Stevie Wonder

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.460
over the loudspeakers,
which I didn't realize is

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.230
something grocery stores did.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.960
I mean, I guess I didn't realize
they played music at all.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.270
I mean, I didn't realize
they could turn aisle seven

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.910
into a soul train line of
Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Apple

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.900
Jacks.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.210
And at first, I was just
going to nod my head to "Songs

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.410
in the Key of Life."

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.290
But who are we not to take full
advantage of this small moment

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.590
of funky glory?

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.320
So I wrap my right
foot behind my left

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.740
and spin my body like
David Ruffin's taught us.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.240
And when I come back around, I
see you looking at me saying,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.480
dad, is that all you got?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.419
And you didn't use those words
exactly because, you know,

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.199
you have not yet
learned how to speak.

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:42.990
But I could tell by
the way your eyes widen

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.031
and your mouth hung ajar
that you were telling me

00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:46.200
I needed to step it up.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.870
So I took on your clarion
call and pushed the cart aside

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.810
and grabbed the Aunt
Jemima syrup from the shelf

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.630
and turned the aisle seven into
a medley of Motown throwback

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.090
moves, spinning and
dipping past the oatmeal,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.860
bopping among the
Fruit Loops, moon

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.360
walking around the pancake mix.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.790
I mean, we turned the space
between Pop Tarts and Quaker

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.211
Oats into "Showtime
at the Apollo."

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.710
And after what seemed like hours
of loosening our appendages

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.860
to the beat, I looked down to
see the spread of your plump

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860
cheeks.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.650
And I knew that you were proud.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.780
And I looked up and I
saw a store employee

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.977
at the end of the
aisle staring at us.

00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:19.560
And I'm sure she is
about to burst out

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.200
into applause because how
can you not be impressed

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.390
by the swift pirouette
of a father and son

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.130
and your favorite cereal bar?

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.530
And though she does
not clap and though she

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.530
seems to have called the
manager and though he comes over

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.672
to say, Sir, we
appreciate your patronage,

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:35.880
but your sudden movements
are keeping other customers

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.944
from purchasing
their breakfasts,

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.360
we know that we
have put on a show

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.868
that people will never forget.

00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:44.092
[SNAPPING]

00:09:44.092 --> 00:09:45.550
So people always
get this confused.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.320
So you snap during the poem,
and you clap after the poem.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.920
It's fine.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.590
If you snap after the poem,
it becomes this weird '90s R&amp;B

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.970
video, and that's not the vibe
we're trying to create here.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.360
It's not even past 5:00 yet.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.550
You know you've got to hold off.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:09.720
Another thing is that you grow
to deeply appreciate things

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.400
that you did not
necessarily before.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.670
So you have deep
appreciation and love

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.720
for not only people and not
only the small human being

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.340
but some of the
inanimate objects

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.830
that come alongside
this small human being.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.190
And so I find myself writing--

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.082
I just feel overwhelmed with
joy and appreciation, which

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:32.040
I think is really important,
because especially

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.970
over the last several
years and especially

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.184
in a post-Ferguson moment, been
thinking a lot about blackness

00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:42.100
and what it means to be
black in this country,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.460
as I think many of us
have and putting that

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.470
in a larger historical arc.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.570
And I think having a
child and having a son,

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.810
having a black boy,
pushes me to recognize

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.319
the existence of blackness
beyond the violence

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:58.110
that we experience.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.450
And I think that that's
incredibly important.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.700
People are always thinking
about, how do you find joy?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.190
How do you self-care?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.400
And for me, there
is no better joy

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.920
than just getting off
of work and seeing him

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.030
or the first time that he
laughed or when he smiles.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.820
And it's almost
cliche, because it's,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.380
oh, I love it when
my son smiles,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.200
or, I love it when
my daughter laughs.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.480
But it really is a
transformative emotional

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.669
experience.

00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:24.210
But it is not only
with your children

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.350
you have that transformational
emotional experience.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.820
It is with objects.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.512
And so this is my ode to
the electric baby swing.

00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:35.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.170
When we first met, I
wasn't really thinking

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.890
I needed someone like
you, but a friend told me

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.840
we'd be a good fit, especially
with everything happening

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.530
in my life, all the changes,
all the uncertainty.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.560
And he said it would be nice to
have someone you can count on.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.960
He said he used to have
someone just like you.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.660
And while I think he and I
have slightly different tastes,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.510
I thought it couldn't hurt
to at least be introduced.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.120
And my wife said it might be
nice to introduce something

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.270
new into the fold, which left me
a bit confused by how open she

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.190
was to the possibility of you.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.990
I mean, she was never
this open to throwing

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.430
new things into our relationship
before, but anyway, I agreed.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.170
And when you first
showed up at my door,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.378
you didn't look anything
like you did in the pictures

00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:17.840
I saw online.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.890
But you came so broken and
in so many different pieces,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.340
which left me worried because
I wasn't looking for a project.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.417
I need to focus on
my career, you know?

00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:27.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.710
But you were already
here, and the residue

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.650
of my Catholic guilt wouldn't
let me shut the door on you.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.710
So you came in, and we
sat together on the floor,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.840
and I put on my
favorite podcast, which

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.340
I hope you didn't mind.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.890
And I helped you put
yourself back together

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.750
the best way I knew how.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.140
And man, am I glad that we got
past that first awkward stage,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.086
because now you are literally
the best thing that has ever

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:50.710
happened to me.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.370
I literally cannot imagine
my life without you.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.105
The moment I handed you my son,
he fell asleep in your hold,

00:12:57.105 --> 00:12:59.230
and I danced in the living
room, because before, he

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.090
refused to sleep, and now
he sleeps when you hold him,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.900
and my wife thinks I love
you more than I love her.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.170
And I'm not saying she's right,
but I'm not saying she's wrong.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.610
But I am saying you
give me something.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.510
You give me something
she doesn't.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.830
And don't get me wrong.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.417
I love the mother of my son.

00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:18.250
It's just that you make
me feel young again.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.726 --> 00:13:24.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:31.900
And so part of what having
kid does as well is--

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.090
a lot of what
shaped my first book

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.632
is this idea of the
talk, the proverbial talk

00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:40.840
that black parents have with
their children about how

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.970
to navigate a world
that is taught to fear.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.303
And I think there are different
iterations of that talk.

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:47.369
And part of what's been
fascinating about going

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.660
on tour with this book and
speaking to different people

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.450
is you remember how many
different iterations

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.590
of the talk there are.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.190
So when I taught, I taught a
lot of undocumented students.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.380
And I hadn't considered
before that there

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.130
exists a talk in the immigrant
and undocumented community.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.740
I had students who were
coming of age who were

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.259
eight, nine, ten years old.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:08.800
And a lot of what
we did in our class

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.175
was creative
writing, and so they

00:14:10.175 --> 00:14:12.760
would write these first person
accounts of the first time

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.310
that their parents told them
that they were undocumented

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.050
or that their parents
were undocumented

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.950
and that they had this entire
contingency plan for what

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.620
would happen if ICE came
to the door in a way

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.840
that I could never imagine
being nine years old

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.940
and being told by my parents--

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.054
OK, if ICE comes
you need to go out--

00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:32.470
I mean, it was
literally like, you

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.240
need to go out the back door.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.290
Go to your aunt's house.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.294
Don't tell anybody
you know who we are.

00:14:37.294 --> 00:14:38.710
Don't tell anybody
your last name,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.470
and all of these different
things that I had not fully

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.880
taken into account that I
think are really important.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.200
And I think that women
who are coming of age

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.930
have a certain type
of talk oftentimes

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.596
with their parents
about how to navigate

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:54.130
a world that's deeply imbued
with patriarchy and sexism.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.713
And obviously, we're
in a moment where

00:14:55.713 --> 00:15:00.460
we're having a necessary and
unfortunately new, more public

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.580
conversation around that
now and this idea of power

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.770
and this idea of
consent and making sure

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:12.280
that it is not simply women
who have to account for having

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.840
to navigate what different kinds
of power and consent look like.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.930
So a lot of what I'm
thinking about is the talk.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.150
And part of what I'm thinking
about in this context

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.820
is how my father had a
certain conversation with me.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.890
His father had a certain
conversation with him.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.540
And how different
is that conversation

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.270
from the conversation that I'm
going to have with my own son?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.730
And so it's this
intergenerational lineage

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.200
of conversations about how you
navigate a world that tells you

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.210
who you are or
assumes who you are

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.750
before you get the opportunity
to define it for yourself.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.166
And that's something that's
animating a lot of my thinking

00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:45.790
now.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.630
And I recently went
to the National Museum

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.037
of African American
History and Culture.

00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:52.870
And I've been twice.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.430
I went once when
they first opened,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.320
and then I went
once another time

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.330
more recently with
my grandparents.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:07.840
And that was a really
fascinating experience

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.960
because I was there with my
grandfather and also my son.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.890
And so you could feel the
lineage in a very direct way.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.860
But we were in this
place in a space that

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.660
represents a set of
time that we tell

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.860
ourselves was a long time ago.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.130
And I think being there
with my grandfather

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.799
helped me realize that it
wasn't that long ago at all.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.590
And I had been thinking
so much about that.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.870
I remember when I first
read that the woman who

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.640
cut the ribbon to
open the National

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.500
Museum of African
American History

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.900
was the daughter of
an enslaved person.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.430
And I was just like, it
wasn't long ago at all,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.489
you know what I mean?

00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:51.030
I always give this
timeline because I

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.196
think it's really important.

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:54.420
But the first slaves
came here in 1619.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.640
Emancipation
Proclamation was 1863.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.590
Civil War ended in 1865.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.290
The Civil Rights Act and Voting
Rights Act were 1964 and 1965.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.579
So it's only been 50 years in
which black people have even

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.430
had a semblance of legal
and legislative freedom.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.750
For 350 years prior to
that, it was fundamentally

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.119
legal for black people to be
dehumanized, delegitimized,

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.760
disenfranchised in
the eyes of the state,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.880
not in an interpersonal--

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.588
somebody being mean
and using the n-word,

00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:23.250
but you are a state sanctioned
second class citizen.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.040
So if you kick
somebody for 350 years

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.710
and then you stop kicking them
for a seventh of the amount

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.894
of time that you
kicked them, it would

00:17:30.894 --> 00:17:33.310
feel disingenuous to then look
at that person and be like,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.870
why don't you have
the same jobs as me?

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.620
Why are the health
disparities different?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.750
Why aren't your educational
outcomes different?

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.500
But we have that
ahistorical conversation

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.327
in this country all the time.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.160
And you can make a very
compelling argument,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.680
as I would, that it's only
a semblance of freedom

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.010
over the last 50 years because
there is a sort of evolution

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.680
of and different iterations
of a system of oppression

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.140
with regard to zoning
law, housing segregation,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.000
school segregation,
mass incarceration--

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.150
the list goes on and on and on.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.900
And we have to like empirical
data to demonstrate that.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.770
So I think that for
me, I'm obsessed.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.110
With history and I'm obsessed
with the way that we--

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.700
especially in the
American context,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.690
because we're also just
such a young country.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.320
I remember when I went to
England for the first time,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.070
and I was at Oxford, and they
were like, this building was

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.950
built in 1012.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.975
I was like, AM or PM?

00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:26.100
What are you talking about?

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.030
And it was a wild moment
because you're just like,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.440
man, we are not--

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.070
and then if you go to
China or you go to Iran--

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.164
you go to some of
these different places.

00:18:37.164 --> 00:18:38.580
They look at us,
and they're like,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.460
you're little 250 years
is cute or whatever.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.980
But I think that it's just
fascinating because I remember

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.350
growing up, and I would look at
the videos of people spitting

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.240
on the kids integrating
the schools.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.090
I would look at the pictures
of people being lynched.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.820
And I'd be like, man, thank
god we don't live in that time

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.600
anymore.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.760
Thank god we have
moved beyond that.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.610
But like in those moments, I was
forgetting that people I loved

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.109
were there, the people I
loved who are still alive,

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.400
and that the people who were
doing that, the people who

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.550
were in that lynching photo
who were looking and pointing

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.150
at that dead black body are
still voting in our elections.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.550
And I think that when we have
this conversation about how

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.976
far have we
progressed, I think we

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:26.850
should have an honest
conversation about what

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.050
progress looks like and
the proverbial moral arc

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.010
of the universe.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.060
And I think it does move
toward progress when

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.420
it is pushed in that direction.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:43.080
But I think we also misdefine
what progress looks like

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.950
and how it happens.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.440
All that's to say this
is a poem that I'm

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.790
thinking about along
those lines and was

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.910
inspired by my grandfather's
trip to the museum.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.090
We took my grandfather
to the National Museum

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.900
of African American
History and Culture.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.080
He's 85 years old and his breath
still sings of Mississippi.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.940
He is tall but not as
tall as he once was.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.150
He is still here in the
way the ocean is still

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.260
there even when its tide has
receded a bit more into itself.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.480
I ask him if he
wants a wheelchair.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.449
The museum is large
and expansive, I say,

00:20:21.449 --> 00:20:23.490
and the doctor says you
shouldn't be on your feet

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.960
for too long.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.740
He can still walk, though it
is slower and more precarious.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.660
He hates when I
bring up the doctor,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.730
but he knows that his knees
aren't what they once were.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.690
So he sits on the chair,
lays his walking cane

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.112
across his lap.

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.570
And I push him
through the exhibits

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.900
of time we tell ourselves
we're long ago even though they

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.280
were not long ago at all.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.279
We passed the
exhibit on sit-ins.

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:49.320
And he tells me that those
were the same counters

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.400
he tried to eat his lunch.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.930
We passed the exhibit on
Roosevelt's New Deal ,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.110
and he tells me his father
didn't receive any of its

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.400
benefits.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.030
We pass Emmett Till's casket,
its bronze hue radiating

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.200
under the museum lights.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.540
I do not need to see the
dead boy's face in the casket

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.060
to remember its
tragic contortions.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.830
I do not need to listen
to anything other

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.590
than the light softly buzzing
above us to hear Mammy Teal's

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.540
unceasing sobs.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.640
My grandfather
looks at the casket.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.710
He doesn't say
anything for a while.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.230
He just moves his eyes
unhurriedly across its frame.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:26.100
"He was killed in the next town
over where I grew up," he says.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.540
I nod but do not say anything.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.570
I think about the history
of race and racism

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.850
in this country all of the time.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.320
I think about how it shapes the
landscape of everything we see.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.960
But sometimes I forget its
impact on those right next

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.010
to me.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.470
I forget that many of the
men spitting on Ruby Bridges

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.150
in the photo down the
hall are still alive,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.150
that the people who
threw rocks at Dr. King

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.640
are still voting
in our elections.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.520
I do not misunderstand
the language of progress,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.040
though I do not yet have the
words for a crime that is still

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.540
unfolding.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.510
[SNAPPING]

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.060
I do not know how to
say that time does not

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.744
pass as quickly as we
tell ourselves it does.

00:22:03.744 --> 00:22:09.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.950
So another part of what's been
shaping my thinking as of late

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.000
is--

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.790
I think we're in a moment
where, with regard to race,

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.280
we're having a conversation
that is more intersectional.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.190
And so I'm in academia
and intersectionality,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.227
especially in black
feminist circles,

00:22:29.227 --> 00:22:31.810
has been a conversation that's
been happening for a long time.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.430
Kimberlé Crenshaw coined
the term years ago.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.200
And now we are in a moment--

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.930
which is good that it has
become more mainstream.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.150
Online and in news
media articles,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.160
people are talking
about intersectionality

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.570
in a way that does not
remove it as this piece

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.700
of academic jargon that
is separate from the real,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.610
lived material
experiences of people.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.120
And so this idea that when we're
thinking about race that we

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.100
also have to account
for gender, that we also

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.891
have to account for
sexuality, that we also

00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:03.850
have to account for
class is very real,

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.420
and that any analysis of racism
devoid of those other phenomena

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.290
is not a rigorous analysis of
how racism manifests itself.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.230
My experience in the world
as a straight black man

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.692
is uniquely different to someone
who is a queer black woman

00:23:17.692 --> 00:23:19.150
or is uniquely
different to someone

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:24.404
who is a trans disabled
person-- or whatever it is.

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:26.320
I think there are so
many different iterations

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.550
of blackness and different
ways to understand

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.690
how a confluence
of identity factors

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.560
create unique circumstances
and unique ways of navigating

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.380
the world.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.380
Part of what I've also
been thinking about a lot

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.750
is beyond the different facets
of our provincial identity,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.320
this idea of a geopolitical
intersectionality

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.020
and this idea that in
order to understand--

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.990
and I think it's been especially
clear over the last few weeks--

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.620
that in order to understand
racial and social inequality

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.960
domestically in
the United States,

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.520
you can't do that
without accounting

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.370
for a history of
US foreign policy

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.520
and US imperialism and
the role that colonization

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.290
has played in
shaping the landscape

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.160
of our global community.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.990
And I think that
what we're seeing now

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.600
is a very real example
of that, that you can't

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.130
have an honest conversation--

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.210
that we're about to kick
thousands of Haitians

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:30.510
out of this country
and not accounting

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:37.380
for the centuries of economic
and political exploitation

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.040
and isolation that Haitians
have experienced since they won

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.900
the Haitian Revolution in 1804.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.550
After Haitians won
the revolution,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.070
white people in the West
were like, this is crazy.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.250
Slaves are going to
revolt everywhere.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.960
Haiti is the first
black republic

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.340
to exist in the
Western hemisphere.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.590
And so we have to make sure
that they are not at all

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.920
a part of the global ecosystem.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.100
And so every Western
nation completely

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.225
cut Haiti off economically.

00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:07.433
They didn't trade with Haiti.

00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:09.690
They didn't recognize it
as a legitimate institution

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.731
until decades and sometimes,
for other countries,

00:25:11.731 --> 00:25:12.990
centuries later.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.780
And you can't disentangle that
from the economic condition

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.340
that Haiti exists in now.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.820
You can't say, Haiti
is a poor country

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:26.400
that has cholera and
violence and corruption

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.670
without accounting for the
decades of global corruption

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.037
that was specifically
pointed toward Haiti.

00:25:32.037 --> 00:25:33.120
And same with El Salvador.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.040
You can't have a conversation
about El Salvador

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.498
unless you're going to talk
about how the US government was

00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:41.670
specifically funding a civil
war in that country, again,

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.370
for decades.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:49.802
And so the conversation
around immigration

00:25:49.802 --> 00:25:51.510
is not something that
can be disentangled

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.390
from the conversation around
race and racism in the US.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.402
And that conversation
can't be disentangled

00:25:56.402 --> 00:25:58.110
from what the US and
other countries have

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.260
done historically
throughout history in order

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.544
to create destabilized political
and economic conditions

00:26:04.544 --> 00:26:06.210
in these countries
that are subsequently

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.000
seeking refuge in our
country because we like--

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.840
you know what we do?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.310
We bomb these countries.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.050
And then when they
seek refuge somewhere,

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.008
we're like, no, no, no.

00:26:14.008 --> 00:26:15.270
You can't come live here.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.370
And it is so deeply insidious.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.010
And I think that it is
something that I'm trying

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.050
to account more and more for.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.530
And on that note, thinking
about the ways in which

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.370
how does that, specifically
ideas of nationality--

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.490
in what ways does that shape
who we deem worthy of empathy

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.720
and who we don't?

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.907
And in what ways does that shape
who we deem worthy of mourning

00:26:37.907 --> 00:26:39.240
and who we deem worthy of grief?

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.710
And I think we've had a range
of different terror attacks

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.710
over the last few years.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.270
And I think that
it's become clear--

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.980
there more than 300 people
who were killed in Somalia

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.689
a few months ago.

00:26:49.689 --> 00:26:51.729
Right after that, there
were more than 300 people

00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:52.830
who were killed in Egypt.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.010
A year before that, there were
500 people killed in Iraq.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:03.990
So the most violent and
deadly terror attacks

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.250
are happening in places
where there are brown people

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.480
or people who are not from
the west, people in the Global

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.190
South.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.690
And it doesn't get
the same coverage

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.967
that Manchester or Berlin
or London or Brussels does.

00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:22.050
And that's not to say that
those places should not

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:22.633
get attention.

00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:25.710
I think death anywhere
should warrant investigation

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.910
and mourning and attention.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.360
But it does push us
to ask, why do we

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.767
find the death of some people
more morally egregious than we

00:27:34.767 --> 00:27:35.850
do other groups of people?

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.820
And I'm complicit in that.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.520
I have to have a moment,
and I have to be proactive.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.670
I remember when I saw what
happened in Somalia, I

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.230
was like, 300 people, and I
was like, that is terrible.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.730
And then I moved
to the next thing.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.550
And I was like wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.830
What is happening in me?

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.750
What messages have I been
inundated with that make it so

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.770
that this feels normative
but when people are killed

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.480
in a concert in
Manchester, which, again,

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.220
is egregious and horrible--

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.590
but I have a very different
emotional reaction to that.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.490
And why is that?

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.310
Why is it that I've accepted
that some places just

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.830
have drones flying
over them all the time?

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.980
And especially now
that I have a child,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.750
I'm so much more acutely
aware of these things.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.480
But there was a
little play drone that

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.310
was flying around
our neighborhood,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.110
and everybody in our
neighborhood was like,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.330
what is happening?

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.520
This was a little drone
you buy on Amazon.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.630
It was some kid.

00:28:36.222 --> 00:28:38.430
You had an entire neighborhood
of folks freaking out.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.190
I was like, can you
imagine living under drones

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.016
that you thought
had bombs on them

00:28:44.016 --> 00:28:45.390
and that could
drop at any moment

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.120
for every day of your life?

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.360
And then we think about the
trauma that that exacts?

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.990
Anyway, I think that
that is the next step

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.620
in my own thinking around this.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.850
And I think that I've had a very
provincial conception of race

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.390
and racism.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.764
And part of what
I'm trying to do

00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:07.560
is work toward understanding the
intersecting phenomenon of how

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.059
different parts of geopolitical
events and globalization

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:11.850
shape these things.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.266
So these are three
different poems

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:15.850
that I've written
thinking about that.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.850
And I'm going to just
read these three in a row.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.060
Imagine each continent a
splintered tessellation

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.510
of wayward fragments, each
mass of land attempting

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.490
to jostle itself free.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.910
Pangaea was the last of the
supercontinents, a mass of land

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.490
that came together and broke
itself apart several times

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.810
before.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.730
It should come as no surprise.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.500
Don't we all find
ourselves coming back

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.415
to something we can lose
ourselves inside of?

00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:53.540
Can we blame the desert
for missing the breeze that

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.880
tumbles across the grassland?

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.560
Can we blame the
tundra for a desire

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.080
to witness the
wrestling of pines?

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.470
Just the other day, a bomb
killed 70 people in Pakistan,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.810
and no one around
me heard a sound.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.660
These days, I find myself
blaming Pangaea for the sounds

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.100
I cannot hear.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.830
I decry the continents
for their careless drift.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.860
I detest the tectonic plates
for their indifferent quake.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.050
I wake up in love with
the ocean and fall asleep

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.810
despising all that it
has put between us.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.990
Perhaps if the continent had
never shaken themselves free,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.900
we might find ourselves
disabused of this apathy.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.300
Perhaps if we could
hear the bomb dropping,

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.740
we might imagine
what would happen

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.770
if it struck our own home.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.120
I'm nostalgic for a proximity
that may not have mattered.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.670
I find my self-loathing
a miracle.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.170
The drone was once
a scrap of metal.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.080
The drone looked as
if it might be a toy.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.072
The drone is not a toy.

00:30:47.072 --> 00:30:48.530
The drone could
have been something

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.570
other than a killing machine.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.475
The drone could
have been a house.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:55.130
The drone could have been spoon.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.580
The drone could have been swing.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.850
The drone does not know
who is going to kill next.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.250
The drone is going to kill next.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.030
The drone has learned
to disguise itself

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.830
as a shard of sky.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:10.150
The drone's soft hum
is a disembodied echo.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.860
The drone was mistaken
for a star once.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.240
The drone renders
itself celestial.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.380
The drone scoffs at sovereignty.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.080
The drone asks, what is a border
if you can fly right over it?

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.150
The drone was built by a man.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:27.590
The drone killed a man
and a woman and a child.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.740
The drone killed a child
and did not see her face.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.930
The drone does not see a face.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:38.170
The drone sees a body,
and then the body is gone.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.690
"The New York Times" reports
that 200 Iraqi civilians

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.840
have just been killed by
US military airstrikes.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.630
And the man on television calls
it unfortunate yet inevitable

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.360
collateral damage.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.450
And I wonder what it is that
turns mourning into a metonym

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.830
or proclamation of conjecture.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.705
And I read his bio and
see that he has a wife.

00:31:56.705 --> 00:31:58.930
And I can't imagine he
would call it inevitable

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.180
if her body were pulled
from the quiet implosion

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.610
of scattered rubble.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.200
And I see that he has a son.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.800
And I can't imagine
he would call

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.530
the boy who bears his name
collateral in someone else's

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.530
war.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.245
And I see that he
has a daughter,

00:32:11.245 --> 00:32:13.120
and I think of what it
might mean for someone

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.250
to render her final
breath an inevitability

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.170
of global politics.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.910
And I understand what he means.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.880
I know he means that war
is callous and unforgiving,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.190
that a militant can surround
himself with a dozen women

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.410
and children so that
the pilot must decide

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.990
between the target and the
soft ache of his own heart's

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.490
detonation.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.160
I do not misunderstand
the cruelty of war,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.990
but I regret the way we
talked about its casualties,

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.550
how their lives become
tacit admonitions, how

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.660
the tyranny of a border
made out of thin air

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.650
means bombs are only
dropped on one side of it.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.970
But I too have felt the
empathy corrode inside the most

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.430
cavernous parts of me,
have taken the quarters

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.400
from my pocket and used
them to cover my collusion.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.950
Who among us has not used
spare change to ornament

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.190
our contrition, made a garland
of rations atop the bodies

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.950
of names we do not know?

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.110
And I'm not sure what it means
for us not to be the ones

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.290
to fire the bullet but to
behave as if the bullet always

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.091
belonged in that
chest and not our own.

00:33:09.091 --> 00:33:12.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.555
And so to bring it back
more domestically--

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.140
so everybody's familiar
with Thomas Jefferson.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.120
What I was taught my
American history class--

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.270
Thomas Jefferson is one of the
first presidents of the United

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.800
States.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.091
He is the intellectual founding
father of this country.

00:33:36.091 --> 00:33:38.150
He is singularly responsible
for the conception

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.566
of the Declaration
of Independence

00:33:39.566 --> 00:33:40.670
and the Constitution.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.500
He is the intellectual
founding father

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.010
of our time, the
paragon of our ideals.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.100
And what I didn't learn
until much later in my life

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.440
a few years ago when
I read his book "Notes

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.461
on the State of Virginia," which
is his manifesto of sorts--

00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:56.960
and he says in it--
very explicitly,

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.310
he says, "Black
people are inherently

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.110
inferior to white people
both in the endowments

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.010
of body and mind."

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.434
And he says, "The slave
is incapable of love.

00:34:03.434 --> 00:34:05.600
And a slave is incapable
of possessing or sustaining

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.392
complex emotion."

00:34:06.392 --> 00:34:08.600
And he writes about Phillis
Wheatley, who was largely

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.190
considered to be
the first published

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.606
African American poet in the
history of the United States.

00:34:12.606 --> 00:34:14.360
He says, well,
black people don't

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.589
possess the intellectual
or artistic acumen

00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:17.630
with which to create art.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.679
So we can call that
something else,

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:21.080
but we can't call it poetry,
because black people do not

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.929
possess the necessary emotional
capacity to create art.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:26.905
And I think about that.

00:34:26.905 --> 00:34:29.030
And I think about how that's
a version of Jefferson

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.240
that I was never taught.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.210
And I think about how
Jefferson is in many ways

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.489
a microcosm for
the ways in which

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.530
our notions of American
history are presented

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.800
in this very narrow, myopic
way, where we are so committed

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.602
to the idea of
American exceptionalism

00:34:41.602 --> 00:34:43.310
that we inevitably
suppress anything that

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.960
makes us look unexceptional.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.179
Even the people that we look up
to who were not slave owners--

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.754
I think about Abraham Lincoln.

00:34:51.754 --> 00:34:54.170
And I think about how I was
singularly taught that Lincoln

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.460
was the great emancipator.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.642
Lincoln said, slavery is bad.

00:34:57.642 --> 00:34:58.850
I'm going to free the slaves.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:34:59.979
Boom, bam, boom.

00:34:59.979 --> 00:35:01.520
Him and Frederick
Douglass dapped up,

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.710
and it was cool, right?

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.930
Right.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.150
That is how I thought
about what happened.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.316
And then you learn about it.

00:35:06.316 --> 00:35:09.737
And you're like, actually, it's
far more complicated than that.

00:35:09.737 --> 00:35:11.570
You don't have to go
over the whole history,

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.560
but Lincoln had some very
not sophisticated ideas

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.280
around race.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.380
You can go back to the
Lincoln-Douglass debates.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.650
And that man is saying, I don't
think there should be slavery,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:25.360
but I also don't want a black
person living next to me.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.150
So it's this idea that--

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.687
I think you are presented
with abolitionism

00:35:29.687 --> 00:35:31.520
or you are presented
with freeing the slaves

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:37.907
as a representative of
a of universal goodness

00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:39.740
without complicating
that with the idea that

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.200
like there were a lot of
abolitionists who are also

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.400
very racist.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.250
And how do you hold those kind
of two seemingly paradoxical,

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.930
complicated things at one time?

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.519
And then you dig into it and
you realize it's not necessarily

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:53.810
that paradoxical, but it is
complicated in the same way

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.030
that we have to
recognize that Jefferson

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.840
is a brilliant, brilliant man
and that he is deeply racist.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.380
The same way we have to
recognize that Lincoln--

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.284
his thinking was evolving and
changing throughout his life.

00:36:06.284 --> 00:36:08.450
Who's to say where he would
have ended up had he not

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.960
been assassinated?

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.160
But whether it was for
political expediency

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.110
or whether it represented
his personal views--

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.247
although Lincoln signed
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:36:17.247 --> 00:36:18.830
he also didn't think
that black people

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.150
were equal to white people.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.969
And he was for most
of his life, before he

00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:23.510
signed the Emancipation
Proclamation,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.384
he was trying to get
black people to colonize

00:36:25.384 --> 00:36:27.080
in Liberia or South America.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.850
He was like, we got
to free you, but we

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.150
don't want you living here.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:37.400
So another part of my own
political and scholarly project

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.770
is pushing for a more
complicated and holistic

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.310
conception of American history,
because I think without that,

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:48.526
we fail to understand the where
this country is coming from.

00:36:48.526 --> 00:36:50.150
And thus, we kind of
fail to understand

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.810
like where we are as a country.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.230
And we can find ourselves,
after Obama gets elected,

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.320
having what obviously now seems
like a ridiculous post-racial

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:57.880
conversation.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.700
But I'll go back and watch
some of my YouTube videos

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.580
of the coverage right
after he was elected,

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.020
and I was was just like,
man, very, very smart people

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.740
were very serious when they
were like, racism is not

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.850
a factor in America anymore.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.370
And I think that part of
why we even had that moment,

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.420
which a decade removed seems
utterly ridiculous considering

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.204
what we've seen
now, is because we

00:37:23.204 --> 00:37:25.370
don't have a true understanding
of American history.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.517
And we create mythologies
around our history

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:30.600
that are not reflective
of what actually happened.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.150
So this is a poem--

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.907
I'm really interested
in thinking

00:37:33.907 --> 00:37:35.990
about like our founding
fathers and who they were,

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.167
their complicated dualities.

00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:40.250
What we know is that 12
of our first 18 presidents

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.842
owned slaves.

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:43.050
Eight of them owned slaves
while they were in office.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.730
And this poem letter
to five of them.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.260
I used to memorize all
my poems, and I have not

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.210
because I've not gotten
sleep for like seven months.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.960
So if I stumble over this
be like, it's OK, Clint.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.472
I can imagine it's difficult
to not get consistent sleep.

00:37:58.472 --> 00:37:59.930
And then we'll just
keep it moving,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.388
and I'll read
something from paper.

00:38:06.315 --> 00:38:07.690
"Letter to Five
of the Presidents

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.120
Who Owned Slaves While
They Were in Office"--

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.702
George Washington, when
you won the revolution,

00:38:12.702 --> 00:38:15.160
how many of your soldiers did
you sent from the battlefield

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.300
to the cotton field?

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.517
How many had to trade in
their rifles for plows?

00:38:18.517 --> 00:38:21.100
Can you blame the slaves who ran
away to fight for the British

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.270
because at least
the redcoats were

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.520
honest about their oppression?

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.480
Thomas Jefferson, when
you told Sally Hemings

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.820
that you would free her children
if she remained your mistress,

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.830
did you think there was
honor in your ultimatum?

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.300
Did you think we wouldn't
be able to recognize

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.730
the assault in your signature
as raping your slave

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.572
when you discussed it as bribery
and make it less of a crime?

00:38:36.572 --> 00:38:38.530
When you wrote the
Declaration of Independence,

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.820
did you ever intend
for black people

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.140
to have freedom
over their bodies?

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.910
James Madison, when
you wrote to Congress

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.320
that black people
should count as 3/5

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.570
of a person, how long did
you have to look into slaves

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.770
to figure out the math?

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:48.987
Was it easy to chop them up?

00:38:48.987 --> 00:38:51.070
Did you think they'd be
happy being more than just

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.760
half human?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.790
James Monroe when you proposed
sending slaves back to Africa,

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.980
do black bodies feel
like rented tools?

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.110
When you branded them, did
the scar on their chest

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.717
include an expiration date?

00:39:00.717 --> 00:39:02.300
When you named the
country of Liberia,

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.730
were you trying to be ironic?

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.770
Does this really
count as liberation?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.190
Andrew Jackson, was the Trail
of Tears not enough for you?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.350
Was killing Cherokee, Choctaw,
Creek, Seminoles not enough

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.180
to quench your imperialism?

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.620
How many brown
bodies do you have

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.570
to bulldoze before you
can call that progress?

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.272
Mr. Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe, Jackson,

00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:21.730
when you put your
hand on the Bible

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.270
and swore to protect
this country,

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.186
let's be honest in who
you were talking about.

00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:28.150
When the first Independence Day
fireworks set the sky aflame,

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.920
don't forget where we
were watching from.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.540
So when you remember
Jefferson's a genius,

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.914
don't forget the
slaves who built

00:39:32.914 --> 00:39:34.270
the bookshelves in his library.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.164
When you remember
Jackson's victories in war,

00:39:36.164 --> 00:39:38.080
don't forget what he was
fighting to preserve.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.480
When you sing that this
country was founded on freedom,

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.150
don't forget the shackles
dragging against the ground.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.220
My entire life, I've been taught
how perfect this country was.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.220
But no one ever told me
about the pages torn out

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.496
of my textbooks, how black
and brown bodies had been

00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:53.120
bludgeoned for three
centuries and find

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.322
no place in the curriculum.

00:39:55.322 --> 00:39:57.530
Oppression doesn't disappear
just because you decided

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.820
not to teach us that chapter.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.690
[SNAPPING]

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.690
If you only hear one side
of the story, AT some point

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.580
you have to question
who the writer is.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:11.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.039
Keeping the theme
of history going--

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:16.080
and I'll just do this one,
and then I'll one more

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.538
so we have some
time for questions.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.590
Another thing that's
an example of something

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.423
that I didn't know--

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.110
my next book is--

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.330
I'm writing lots of
dad poems, and then I'm

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:33.770
writing lots of, you lied
in history class, poems.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:40.670
And so in the next book, it's
going to be like, oh, man.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.440
His first carrot.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.710
That was so cute.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.720
And then it's like, the
Confederacy is a lie.

00:40:49.007 --> 00:40:50.840
But something that's
an example of something

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.540
that I was taught,
a discrepancy--

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.610
so I was taught the New
Deal, as many of us--

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.940
this was in my
American AP class--

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.222
that the New Deal was the
most progressive series

00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:05.180
of legislative acts that
have ever been signed,

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.580
especially in the 20th century.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.410
They are responsible for
intergenerational wealth.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.950
They are responsible for
millions of families moving up

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.840
to the middle class,
into the suburbs,

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.690
being able to purchase
homes, get an education.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.700
They are literally
the economic bedrock

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.470
upon which the
contemporary middle class

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.130
in the 20th and 21st century
is founded, which is true.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.050
What I wasn't
taught, what I didn't

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.200
realize till much later is that
black people were specifically

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:36.380
left out as beneficiaries of
these pieces of legislation

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.900
for many decades after
it was first laid out.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.340
So black people
didn't have access

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.370
to social security, minimum wage
protection, housing mortgages,

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.030
health care, government,
higher ed assistance,

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.780
Veterans Affairs.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.880
And so you have the thing that
is responsible for creating

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.650
the contemporary middle class.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.820
You give it to one
demographic of people.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.778
Then you don't give it
to an entirely different

00:41:58.778 --> 00:41:59.690
demographic people.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.731
And then people want to
act surprised generations

00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:04.370
later when these groups have
like disparate outcomes, again

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:09.170
along the lines of education,
along the lines of economics,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.570
along lines of political
representation,

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.900
all of these different things.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.630
And so I gave that
timeline earlier.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.572
But again, this is the 20th
century when this happened.

00:42:17.572 --> 00:42:19.280
We don't even have to
go back to slavery.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.070
We don't have to go back to
what happened between the 1619

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.010
in 1865.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.330
We could go back to
what happened in 1944.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.460
We could go back to
what happened in 1963.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.730
And so that's shaping
a lot of my thinking.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.260
And I think the New Deal,
especially because even today

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:41.160
we discuss it as the universally
celebrated singular good,

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.290
and its history is much
more complicated than that.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.910
So this is a poem
about the New Deal.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:53.080
In 1932, the Great Depression
had taken America by the throat

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.930
and rendered it an alchemy
of dust and rations.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.600
The country had been
decimated by a market that

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.175
could no longer hold up
a history of hypocrisy,

00:43:01.175 --> 00:43:03.550
and it crashed like something
that has never before known

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.990
what it meant to fall.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.820
In response,
Franklin D. Roosevelt

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.070
signed a series of legislative
acts designed to lift

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.600
the country from its knees.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.370
The laws transformed
the economy and are

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.200
responsible for the
foundation that created

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.180
the contemporary middle class.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.300
In the 1930s, 75 percent
of southern black folks

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.250
were either maids
or farm workers.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.290
In the 1930s, the
only workers who

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.300
didn't qualify for the
benefits of the New Deal

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.294
were maids and farm workers.

00:43:27.294 --> 00:43:29.710
I was told you can only call
something a coincidence if it

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.400
wasn't done on purpose.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.400
A coincidence is
texting with a friend

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.590
and then running into
them at the grocery store.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.370
A coincidence is
showing up to the office

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.630
in the same new shirt
as your coworker.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.060
A coincidence is walking
past a vending machine

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.010
and finding some
quarters in your pocket.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.500
Taking away all federal benefits
from an entire demographic

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.790
of people feels like
we should call it

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.290
something different,
something a little

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.750
more honest, something a little
more empirically grounded.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.820
But see the thing
about racism in America

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.470
is that if you don't
call it racism,

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.917
people think it isn't there.

00:43:57.917 --> 00:44:00.250
It's the shadow no one can
see when it is standing right

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.060
behind you.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.560
It's the carbon
monoxide killing you

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.210
in a room where
there is no smoke.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.860
A million black folks
end up in prison,

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.529
and people shrug and
ask, what happened?

00:44:07.529 --> 00:44:09.070
An unarmed man is
shot by police when

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.736
he is running in the
opposite direction,

00:44:10.736 --> 00:44:12.190
and people call it self-defense.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.110
Interstate highways are built
through black communities,

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.651
and people suddenly
can't explain why

00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.230
all the businesses have failed.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.330
If you take away social
security, minimum wage

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.370
protection, housing
mortgages, and health care,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.770
you don't get to then turn
around see poverty and act

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.889
like you're surprised.

00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:26.680
How can you take the
water from a fish tank

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.840
and not expect the fish
to suffocate, to gasp

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.210
for its life, to flap
violently against the surface

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.000
while you watch from the
other side of the glass?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.310
When a fish dies
from having no water,

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.110
do we call that a coincidence?

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.060
If you block the sun
from reaching a tree,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.160
do you have to ask
why it doesn't grow?

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.660
The government won't
give you a loan

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.040
to buy a house in a
better neighborhood.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.032
Then they blame you
when your son gets shot.

00:44:47.032 --> 00:44:49.240
The city never built a
hospital on your side of town,

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.510
then they tell you it's your
fault that the cancer spread.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.009
They stuff you in
the public housing

00:44:53.009 --> 00:44:55.510
and then tear it down and ask
why all the schools are empty.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:56.889
If we didn't say
it directly, you

00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:58.180
can't blame us when it happens.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.070
If we continue to
keep our eyes shut,

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.150
it can't be our fault
that we don't see you.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.580
But see, this
country is only able

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.980
to whisper the words
"American exceptionalism"

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.320
because we're so good
at covering our ears

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.918
while someone else is screaming.

00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:14.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:16.170
I'm going to read one more poem.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.860
So this from my book, which I
guess is for sale in the back.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.710
It's been out for a
little over a year now.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.450
I feel very proud of it.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:24.825
I remember when
I first got it, I

00:45:24.825 --> 00:45:28.412
was just touching it and just
rubbing it against my face.

00:45:28.412 --> 00:45:30.370
And I emailed my publisher,
and I was like, yo,

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.960
what is this
texture of the book?

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.260
It feels so good.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.960
I just can't stop touching it.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.150
And he responded, and it
was spelled, M-A-T-T-E.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.600
And I was like, oh, matté.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:47.420
And my wife-- she was
like, no, it's "matte."

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:53.750
And I was like, that might
be "matt," but this is matté.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.792
So I think personally
they messed up

00:45:56.792 --> 00:45:57.750
with the pronunciation.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.490
But I have no control over that.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.030
So I'll read one
more poem from this,

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.250
and then if anybody
has any questions.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.730
And if not, I appreciate
you all coming out.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.500
So again, this book is
thinking a lot about,

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.407
what is the marathon
of cognitive dissonance

00:46:15.407 --> 00:46:17.990
that it is to grow up as a young
black person in this country?

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.420
And how does one navigate
a world in which--

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.000
in my case, in which I grew
up in a home in which you feel

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.204
loved affirmed and
celebrated and then go out

00:46:25.204 --> 00:46:26.870
into a world in which
you are constantly

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:28.960
rendered a caricature
of someone else's fear?

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.790
And how do you make sense
of that constant sense

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.890
of cognitive dissonance?

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.156
Dubois talked about it--

00:46:34.156 --> 00:46:35.030
double consciousness.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.800
How do you make sense
of seeing yourself

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.590
one way and the rest of the
world seeing you another way?

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:46.280
And so that shapes a lot of
how this book is formatted.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.900
And what I wanted to do--

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.020
there are a lot of poems in here
that-- this was written largely

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.090
in the two years
after Ferguson when

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:57.050
I'm trying for myself to
make sense of everything

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.040
that I see happening.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.456
And this is also
at a moment where

00:46:59.456 --> 00:47:03.560
I'm encountering a lot of this
history for the first time.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.410
And so it is thinking a lot
about history and violence.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.330
But I gave that timeline before.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:13.160
But what's most remarkable to
me about that timeline is not

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.525
simply how long it is
or even how short it is

00:47:17.525 --> 00:47:21.642
but what black folks have
been able to do despite it,

00:47:21.642 --> 00:47:23.600
what black-- and this is
another wonderful part

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.210
of the African
American History Museum

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:32.630
is that you move from slavery
to reconstruction to Jim Crow,

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.070
and you continue to move up.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.060
And as you ascend floors,
you get to the top.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.450
And it's like all of the
things that black people have

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.370
contributed culturally
to this country,

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.660
and it is astonishing
that you've had your foot

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.860
on people's neck for centuries.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.260
And while you've had
your foot on their neck,

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.090
they have still
created and deeply

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.664
embedded themselves into
cultural and social fabric

00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:56.330
of this country.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.480
And for me, that's astonishing,
and that's something

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.612
I think about all the time.

00:48:00.612 --> 00:48:02.570
So I wanted those moments
captured in this book

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.700
as well, the moments of
celebration and laughter

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.510
and levity.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.910
And there was a lot
of that in my home.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.760
And my parents always listened
to Maze and Frankie Beverly.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.850
Do you folks know who Maze
and Frankie Beverly is?

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.187
The black folks are like, yeah.

00:48:15.187 --> 00:48:17.270
The white people are like,
I'm going to Google it.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.760
And so it's a funk
band, and it's

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.060
played at every black
family function of all time.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.750
And it was a just like
ever-present fixture

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.280
in my home.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.190
And it was always on.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.146
And so my parents
used to dance together

00:48:34.146 --> 00:48:36.770
a lot in the kitchen, which when
I was a child, I was like, ew,

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.474
that's gross.

00:48:37.474 --> 00:48:38.390
You're doing too much.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.140
I'm trying to eat my
spaghetti, and you're

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.510
out here jiggy, jiggy.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.720
That's too much.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.040
And now as an adult, as a
married person with a child,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.415
I'm like, OK, you all just
trying to keep the fire alive.

00:48:48.415 --> 00:48:49.190
I see you.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.126
Do your thing.

00:48:50.126 --> 00:48:51.500
I'm going to go
to the other room

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.220
and finish my Thanksgiving
turkey, but do you.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.950
And so this is an ode to them.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.700
When Maze and Frankie
Beverly come on in my house,

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.380
mom's eyes close.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.940
She raises the
spatula as if she were

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.910
going to orchestrate
the gumbo into existence

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.040
turns the knob so that we
feel the bass thundering

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.270
in the walls.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.200
At the start of verse
one, she points to pops,

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.000
walks over, shoulders
oscillating back and forth

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.470
between the melody.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.280
Pop does the same dance
he's been doing since '73--

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.660
left knee, right me, pop, snap,
left knee, right knee, pop,

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.660
snap.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.480
At the start of verse two,
pops drops his shoulder,

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.330
bites his bottom lip, and does
some sort of spin move pivoting

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.590
on his left foot.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:38.560
When he does this, it's
unclear if he's hurt his back

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.290
or if he's doing an unauthorized
version of the sprinkler.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.360
The way his hands flip
and turn and slap boxes

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.030
the sky between them, the
way mom looks confused as

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.890
to what exactly is
happening, but she

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.830
goes with it because she's fly
like that and has never left

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.650
pops hanging on the dance floor.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.790
At the start of verse
three, smoke alarms

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.260
are going off in the kitchen.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.260
Their hands are
clasped now, fingers

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.850
interlocked, swinging
each other back and forth.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.010
Their feet are now
music of their own.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:06.280
At the end of the song,
Frankie's voice begins to fade,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.840
but they keep dancing.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.180
She holds her hand on
the back of his neck.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.800
He pulls her in closer.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.950
She looks at him, kisses him
between the sweat rolling down

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:20.200
his forehead, and they
laugh and laugh and laugh

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.140
and laugh, long after
the song has stopped.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.088
Thank you all.

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:27.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:28.504
Any questions?

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.360
AUDIENCE: How'd you
get into poetry?

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.824
What inspired you?

00:50:35.824 --> 00:50:38.264
Was it a figure who
resonated with you?

00:50:38.264 --> 00:50:40.710
Or was this all [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.120
CLINT SMITH: How did I
first get into poetry?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.450
I remember the first poem
that I wrote was at a place

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.840
called Sonship Earth.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.980
And it's this program
in Louisiana where

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.360
they take public school kids.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.650
And they bring them to the
woods for this environmental and

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.360
conservation training.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.044
It's a little three-day thing.

00:51:02.044 --> 00:51:03.710
We had this thing
called our magic spot.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:05.834
And so every day, we were
supposed to go out into--

00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:08.610
this is held in the woods,
and you go to your magic spot.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.580
And it's this weird
thing, looking back now,

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.387
because it was these benevolent
white people who were standing

00:51:13.387 --> 00:51:15.470
in front of these little
black and brown children,

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.399
and they were, like, run, go.

00:51:17.399 --> 00:51:19.940
And then they stood behind us
as we ran into the woods, which

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.440
is a strange aesthetic.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.959
But we ran into the woods.

00:51:23.959 --> 00:51:25.000
We ran to our magic spot.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.980
And in my magic spot was where
I first started writing poems

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.880
that I can remember.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.530
I remember I came
back that night.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.070
And at dinnertime, everybody
presented, if you wanted,

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.160
the work that you had done.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.690
And I came back and
I remember the poem.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.030
It was, "An animal is a thing
that lives and breathes.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.280
We must not mess with its needs.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.000
If we do, we'll pay the price
with a future world not so

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.926
nice."

00:51:50.926 --> 00:51:52.800
And then all the girls
were like, oh, my god.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.090
And I was like, oh, this
is the joint right here.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.070
Who needs to play sports when
you can just make rhymes?

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:01.930
So that is real.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:06.560
But more seriously, I think--
in 2008, I went to a place

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.914
not far from here, the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

00:52:08.914 --> 00:52:11.330
If you haven't been, it's the
Lower East Side of Manhattan

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:11.829
here.

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:14.030
It's every Friday night.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.910
I know that they're
closing soon.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.440
But I think it's still
happening on Friday nights.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.925
And it's just astonishing.

00:52:20.925 --> 00:52:22.910
And I remember the
first time I went there.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:26.390
The first poem I ever heard was
a woman who had cerebral palsy.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.779
And in three minutes, after
I heard that poem, the way

00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:30.320
I thought about an
entire demographic

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.874
of people completely changed.

00:52:31.874 --> 00:52:34.040
And I had never experienced
spoken word vibe before.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.456
I had seen Def Poetry Jam, and
I was like oh, that's dope.

00:52:36.456 --> 00:52:37.040
That's cool.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.780
But seeing it in person
was an intimately different

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.680
experience.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.847
And I remember being
like, man, disability

00:52:46.847 --> 00:52:48.680
is never something that
was at the forefront

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.513
of my consciousness.

00:52:49.513 --> 00:52:52.310
And then I heard this poem
that was fundamentally

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:55.310
transformative for the way
I thought about the lives

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.750
and rights of disabled people.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.760
And from that moment
on, I have like never

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.551
thought about the issue
the same way again.

00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:03.860
And I was like, I
don't know that I've

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.540
been moved by a
piece of art that

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.890
quickly in that way before.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.473
So I was like, I don't know what
this is, but I want to do it.

00:53:09.473 --> 00:53:11.810
And I started writing very
bad spoken word poems,

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.320
like many of us do
in college, I think.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.619
And I just wrote bad
poems for a long time.

00:53:19.619 --> 00:53:21.410
And I started to poach
a group where I went

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.030
to college, Davidson College.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.629
And then I lived in
South Africa for a year.

00:53:25.629 --> 00:53:27.170
And in Johannesburg,
there's actually

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.169
a very vibrant
performing arts scene.

00:53:29.169 --> 00:53:30.710
And so I think I
learned a lot there.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.751
And I came back and moved
to D.C. Where I taught,

00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:34.670
and I was on the DC Slam Team.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.324
And that's where I got very
immersed in the poetry slam

00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:38.240
competitive community.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.220
And I don't slam any
more in the sense

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.705
that I don't do competitions.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.050
But I think, for
me, that community

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:49.792
has shaped every
part of my writing

00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:51.500
and political life,
honestly, since then.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.791
And it's interesting to now
be in a moment in my career

00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:57.740
where I contribute pretty
regularly to "The New Yorker"

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.400
and different
publications like that.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.220
And I think people
sometimes have

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.060
this idea that, oh, either
explicit or implicit,

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.520
they're like, I have
graduated from spoken word

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:13.370
on to like the more like
esteemed literary spaces.

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.250
And I have to like remind people
that that's not a compliment,

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:19.010
because part of
what it is, is it

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:24.350
reflects this a historical
and both racist and classist

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:28.670
conception of what is a
legitimate literary product

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.910
and the idea that spoken word
exists lower in many people's

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.360
minds on the literary hierarchy
than writing for "The New

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.370
Yorker" or things like that.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.580
I try to disabuse people
of that false dichotomy,

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.830
because I'm like, I
recognize that these

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:46.460
are uniquely different types of
mediums through which writing

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.910
is presented.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.900
But only reason we think that
one is better than the other

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:53.390
is because we've been
inundated with messages

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:57.110
that are like
based on capitalism

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:59.600
and white supremacy and
notions of what is legitimate

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.080
and what is not.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:07.100
And there's nothing more
legitimate about publishing

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.960
something in a fancy
New York magazine

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.780
than there is about doing an
open mic in southeast D.C.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.650
And so for me, whether it
be an essay in a magazine

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:19.790
or whether it be me presenting
my poems, whatever it is,

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:21.560
I think that for me,
they are all just

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.130
extensions of the same
intellectual and artistic

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:30.650
project and not reflective
of thinking that one

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:31.790
is better than another.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.100
It's simply recognizing
that each of them

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.390
resonate in different ways.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.070
And there are
certain things that I

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:40.340
write that I think are better
poems than other things

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:43.160
that I think are better
essays and other things

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.080
that I think are better social
science peer reviewed article

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.580
journals.

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.740
And that's a very long way
of answering your question.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.926
But yeah, I guess
that's my therapy, too.

00:55:52.926 --> 00:55:54.050
I'm like, let me tell you--

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:56.105 --> 00:55:58.230
AUDIENCE: Sort of building
on [INAUDIBLE] question,

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.200
what are some of your favorite
or most influential authors,

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.775
works, books?

00:56:03.775 --> 00:56:05.900
I was going to ask, what
are you reading right now,

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.998
but then I remembered you
have a supplemental, so feel

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.190
free to pass on that one.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:11.570
CLINT SMITH: That's fair.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.750
And I appreciate the
consideration and the empathy.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.210
What am I reading right now?

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:20.660
And what authors have
been influential to me?

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.390
Man, so many.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:27.930
Right now, I am
reading Jhumpa Lahiri's

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.740
"The Lowland," "Lowland."

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.390
She's also one of
my favorite authors.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:35.770
I remember the first time I
read "Interpreter of Maladies,"

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.500
I was just knocked out.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.590
I also had a huge crush
on her for many years.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.600
I was just like,
this was amazing.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.510
So I'm reading that.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.176
I'm reading "Stamped
From the Beginning"

00:56:46.176 --> 00:56:50.450
by Ibram Kendi, which is a book
about the history of racism

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:53.580
and racist ideas.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:57.860
I'm reading "The Can't
Kill Us Until They Kill Us"

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.630
by a friend of mine,
Hanif Abdurraqib, who's

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.380
an amazing poet and
cultural critic.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.810
Generally, people who
have been influential--

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:15.230
Jhumpa Lahiri, Juno Diaz
Dave Eggers, James Baldwin,

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:17.210
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison.

00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:23.340
She's only written one
book, but it blew me away.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.070
Yaa Gyasi wrote "Homegoing."

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:28.460
And that book was
just like, oh, my god.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.760
I recently read "Exit
West" by Mohsin Hamid.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.520
I never read him before, and
that was my favorite piece

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.510
of fiction last year.

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:38.300
I admire fiction writers because
writing a novel in my mind

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.350
is one of the hardest--

00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:42.800
I wrote a novel for
my senior thesis.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.760
It was a "novel."

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.230
It was a very thinly
veiled memoir.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.400
I showed my mom.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.790
And it was very clear that
certain people in our family

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:55.350
were the characters whose
names were just switched,

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.190
and it was the exact
same biography.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:05.300
But yeah, so those are
more literary folks.

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.316
But a lot of sociologists
and historians--

00:58:09.316 --> 00:58:11.315
David Blight-- writes a
lot about the Civil War.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.680
What's his name, who wrote--

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.390
Ira Katznelson,
who's the historian

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.280
who wrote about the New Deal.

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.590
He wrote that book.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:27.230
I can send you a whole list
if you want to email me, yeah.

00:58:30.188 --> 00:58:32.065
Yeah.

00:58:32.065 --> 00:58:32.981
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:38.076 --> 00:58:41.520
Do you think Lincoln can
be forgiven as [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.020
his time?

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.978
And in contrast,
50 years from now,

00:58:44.978 --> 00:58:48.264
what do you think
maybe people of color

00:58:48.264 --> 00:58:52.880
will not forgive
white people of today?

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.160
CLINT SMITH: Can
Lincoln be forgiven

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.590
as a product of his time?

00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:00.260
And 50 years from
now, what do I think--

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.880
what people of
color will be not be

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.260
able to forgive
white people for?

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:14.150
So Lincoln's complicated,
because in many ways,

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.590
I admire Lincoln a lot.

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:20.300
I think that Lincoln
is someone who

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.060
did something that was
incredibly unpopular when

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.270
he did it, despite
the objections

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:31.460
of like many, many people,
despite months before he signed

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.390
that document of it looking
like the Confederacy might win.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:41.150
Did he have not very
sophisticated, not very

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.520
well-developed racial
analysis and ideas?

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.060
100%.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.900
He was racist.

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.030
He was racist lite.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:51.140
He wasn't lynching people.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.570
It depends on what the
metrics of that time are.

00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.020
If everybody else around
you is lynching slaves,

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.610
and you're just
like, I'd rather not

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:04.850
live next to a black person,
but I'll shake their hand,

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.260
you're not not racist.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.900
You're just-- but
it's all relative.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:12.650
But again, it's this
strange kind of factual.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:18.430
Lincoln was killed in
'65 after the war ended.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.560
And what Lincoln-- what
I admire about Lincoln

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.010
is that his ideas evolved a lot.

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.170
And that he was open to being
pushed and that he was open.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.649
I mean that's what the whole
Doris Kearns Goodwin book is

01:00:30.649 --> 01:00:31.940
about, "Team of Rivals," right?

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.800
That he's surrounded
himself with people--

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.820
[INAUDIBLE] himself
with people who

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.230
didn't agree with him, who
didn't agree with each other.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:41.180
And I think that that is the
case along lines of race to me.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.680
The movie "Lincoln"
was great, but I

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.179
wish that Frederick Douglass
was in it because in real life,

01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:47.685
He and other black and
white abolitionists

01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:50.060
played a huge role in pushing
Lincoln to get to the point

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.150
where he would sign something
like the Emancipation

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.980
Proclamation.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.970
So I think that we
should just call it

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.890
like it is-- that
Lincoln was a very

01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.930
impressive man on many fronts.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:03.440
He could have been less racist.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.080
But-- and if he
had not been killed

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.790
at a relatively
young age, maybe he

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.710
would have come around
to thinking even

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.086
more differently, because he
was on a certain trajectory.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:13.168
But it's difficult to say.

01:01:13.168 --> 01:01:13.940
So it is not--

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.040
I bring up about
Lincoln what I did

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.040
because I think it is important
to analyze people holistically,

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.670
not because I think that he is
worthy of like a specific sort

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.490
of castigation or
anything like that.

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:27.230
What do I think that
people 50 years from now

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:31.580
will think about what
white people have done?

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.040
There's probably
a lot of things.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.970
What I will say is--

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:41.270
so I'll say one more thing
about the person of their time.

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.580
Part of me is sympathetic
to that and part of me

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.790
is like, there were many
people of that time who

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.660
weren't racist.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.190
There were many people
of that-- you know, like,

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:50.330
that's the argument
that's like, oh, well,

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.830
can't we forgive
people because they

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:54.290
were products of their time?

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:56.390
I think that that
is in part true.

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:59.360
I think it is difficult
to grow up in a world

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.860
where something is
seen as normative

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.600
and then to move beyond that.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.010
I think about the way
that this country--

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.980
and it happens in different
ways at different times.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.780
I think this country clearly--

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.071
you know, just over the course
of the Obama presidency,

01:02:14.071 --> 01:02:18.122
the way that issues of
LGBTQ folks was discussed

01:02:18.122 --> 01:02:19.580
was completely
different at the end

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.420
than it was at the beginning.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.128
You know, represented
mostly through him,

01:02:22.128 --> 01:02:24.920
who started his campaign being
like, I don't think gay people

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.839
should be able to marry, and
then ended with like rainbow

01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:28.880
flags on the White House.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.820
And I think that that is
reflective of people's capacity

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.407
to change.

01:02:32.407 --> 01:02:34.490
And I think that those are
moments where I'm like,

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:37.100
Lincoln could have changed
in a similar sort of way,

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.480
but we'll never know.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.230
But it is also important
to know that the "they

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:46.190
are men of their time" argument
doesn't go all the way,

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:49.520
because there were many people
of these times who did not

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.670
subscribe to these sorts
of really harmful mindsets

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:57.440
around these things.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.630
The thing that I think about,
50 years from now and 100 years

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:04.830
from now, that I think
many of us participate in,

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:07.280
and that I have
to wrestle with--

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.130
I think that people are
going to look back and say,

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:13.380
I think there are many-- so
I'll say it on two fronts.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.230
I think that people
generations from now

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.450
will look back at the
way we use fossil fuels

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:20.060
and they will be like,
how could anybody--

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:23.990
how could you all know what
you were doing to the planet

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.865
and then still do it?

01:03:24.865 --> 01:03:25.365
Right?

01:03:25.365 --> 01:03:26.180
In the same way--

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.590
in a similar way that
we look at people

01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:29.990
who owned slaves and we're
like, how could you do that?

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:32.323
I mean, not to make them
analogous, because they're not,

01:03:32.323 --> 01:03:34.670
but I'm just thinking to
create sort of analogs,

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:36.800
like, we look back
and we're like,

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.457
I would never own a person.

01:03:38.457 --> 01:03:40.040
And I think that it
is not far-fetched

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.220
that people decades from
now will look back and be

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.031
like, I would have never put oil
in my car, like, that's crazy.

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.280
How could you do that when
you knew what it was doing?

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.270
I think about it--

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.100
I'm doing my
dissertation on people

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.250
who are serving life sentences
and in my scholarly work

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.990
thinking a lot
about incarceration.

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:59.850
And I think about that in
terms of the death penalty

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:00.890
all the time.

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:04.700
I think it's egregious
that we still kill people

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.386
in the name of the state.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:08.970
We, like, murder people, right?

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.910
And that we have
convinced ourselves

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:12.660
that there is any
sort of justice

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.360
in that is utterly bizarre.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.154
But I think to go further, that
like putting people in prison

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.320
for the rest of their lives.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.630
I mean we are the only
country in the world that

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:23.060
sentences children to life
without the possibility

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.720
of parole.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.702
Only country in the world.

01:04:25.702 --> 01:04:27.410
And many of the men
that I'm interviewing

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.035
for my dissertation,
the men and women,

01:04:29.035 --> 01:04:33.270
they've been in prison since
they were 15, 16, 17 years old.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.510
And I'm just like--

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:37.120
I've been working in prisons
for the past few years.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.320
It's not until you
are in a prison

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.560
that you are fundamentally
aware that you are in a cage

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.500
and that you have human beings
that have been sentenced

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.930
to spend the rest of
their life in a cage

01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:49.310
with no opportunity to get out.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:51.920
I think that generations from
now we will look back at that

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.650
and be utterly disgusted
by the fact that we--

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:58.706
the same way we look back
now at the guillotine.

01:04:58.706 --> 01:04:59.330
The guillotine.

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:01.790
You know, the French were out
here chopping people's heads

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:02.610
off left and right.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:04.430
And we look back,
we are like, those

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.320
unsophisticated silly people.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.050
Even hanging-- like hanging.

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:11.780
It wasn't until a
couple of decades

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.930
ago-- in some countries,
they still do that, right?

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.630
Not only do you get the death
penalty, but you will be--

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:19.985
you are lynched and
you are put in a noose.

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:21.860
So those are a couple
of things that I think.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.567
And it is hard.

01:05:22.567 --> 01:05:24.650
And I think that part of
what we have to try to do

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:27.140
is think about
the things that we

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.150
are doing that seem like
normative for what's around us,

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:33.960
even though we know
they are harmful.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.600
And that's easier
said than done.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.695
But it's important
to think about.

01:05:37.695 --> 01:05:39.320
SPEAKER: Clint, will
you say, are there

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.290
any other questions on the GVC?

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:44.950
CLINT SMITH: Any other
questions on the TV?

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.830
Hey.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.452
AUDIENCE: We are in
Boulder, Colorado.

01:05:48.452 --> 01:05:49.799
CLINT SMITH: Oh, that's so cool.

01:05:49.799 --> 01:05:51.090
AUDIENCE: So, nice to meet you.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.381
CLINT SMITH: It just popped up.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:55.450
AUDIENCE: My question is
geared towards the conversation

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.050
that you will eventually
have with your son about how

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.880
he is to do this space, just
emphasizing general-- like,

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.136
what is that conversation
going to look like between you

01:06:07.136 --> 01:06:07.720
and your son?

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.280
And how is that going to
vary the conversations

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.010
that you've had from
[INAUDIBLE] in the past?

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.080
CLINT SMITH: Yeah, thank
you for your question.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.720
I would say I think the thing
that's most important about

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.230
navigating that conversation
is, how do you convince a young

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.940
person-- and a child--

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:33.190
how do you make them aware of
the very real realities that

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:37.300
exist in the world and
the very real dangers that

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.960
in many ways for many people
are like an existential threat

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:46.750
to their very existence,
without making them seem or feel

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.980
as if it is their fault?

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.480
Right?

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.700
Like, how do you navigate
that difficult line between--

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.280
people make a decision about
who you are before you ever

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.450
open your mouth.

01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:57.639
And the fact that
people are doing that

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.930
is not a reflection of you,
it is a reflection of them,

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:04.030
it is a reflection of a
larger culture in society

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:09.140
that has problems around
racism or sexism or-- you know.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.470
And I think that there
are a lot of conversations

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.540
I'm going to have to
have with my son that

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.380
are similar to conversations
that my family had with me

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.707
that are also different.

01:07:18.707 --> 01:07:20.290
I think the nature
of the conversation

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:26.161
that I have with my
child about consent

01:07:26.161 --> 01:07:27.910
will probably be
different than the conv--

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.493
I didn't really have
any conversations

01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:30.550
about consent growing up.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.690
That wasn't the-- not because
my parents didn't care.

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.364
But that wasn't
something that they were

01:07:36.364 --> 01:07:37.530
thinking about in the same--

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.190
I think we're in a moment
where we're thinking

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:40.273
very differently about it.

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:44.020
And I think that's the power of
the #MeToo movement and Time's

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.350
Up.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.710
I always think of
political change

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:50.890
with a big P and then the little
P. So I think big P is like,

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:54.640
Black Lives Matter happens,
progressive DAs are elected,

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.850
mass incarceration decreases,
better police practices

01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:58.810
are implemented.

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:00.430
Those are all important.

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.490
It's also different-- there were
some Pew polls that came out

01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:05.290
a couple months ago,
and they've asked--

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.190
this is kind of tangential
to your question,

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.939
but still related.

01:08:07.939 --> 01:08:11.290
And they've asked
black people who

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.420
over the course of the last--
since like '74 or something.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.990
These are rough numbers,
but essentially one

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:18.550
of the-- they've asked a
series of questions every year.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.091
One of the questions
is, do you think

01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:24.975
black people are responsible for
their own economic conditions?

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:27.100
And they did split it by
Republicans and Democrats.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.729
For Republicans, it was
like 70% or 80% think yes,

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:33.529
and that's remained
pretty steady throughout.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:36.580
And then for Democrats,
it was like 60% think yes.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.420
And then in 2014, there
was this precipitous drop--

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.180
not for Republicans, which
is a whole other talk,

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.080
but like for Democrats--

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.722
that went from like
60-something to 30-something,

01:08:48.722 --> 01:08:50.680
in terms of people
responding to that question.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.830
Because we found ourselves in
a cultural and social moment

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.630
where people were
having completely

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:58.420
different conversations
about the history

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.600
and different manifestations
of race and racism.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.840
And so then, like a 30%
drop in like three years,

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.602
around people thinking
that black people are

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.310
responsible for their
economic conditions

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.470
and political conditions,
and then not thinking

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.660
that is pretty significant.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.839
In the same way that
the #MeToo movement,

01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:18.740
in the way that
it is navigating--

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.830
and all movements
are messy and are

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:24.321
going to have things that
are difficult for anybody

01:09:24.321 --> 01:09:25.029
in that movement.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:27.399
But I think what it has
done, because it has brought

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.490
to the forefront an entirely--

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:34.180
it has shifted the framework
and paradigm of the conversation

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.520
around consent in
a very public way,

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.319
in a way that was
simply not the case.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:41.439
I'm having conversations with
my friends on my group chats

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.510
that are talking
about consent in a way

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:45.870
that we have never
spoken about consent.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.620
And that is powerful to me.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.964
And that's important.

01:09:48.964 --> 01:09:50.380
And so those are
all conversations

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.680
that I'm going to have to figure
out how to have with my son.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.210
And some will be the same,
some will be different.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:00.880
And I think one
thing you also learn

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.900
as a parent is how imperfect
your own parents are,

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.650
because you realize
how imperfect you are.

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:07.620
Because I think you
grow up and you know,

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.370
sometimes you're like,
oh, there's-- like,

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.530
something happens when you
become a parent that you just

01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:12.488
got it all figured out.

01:10:12.488 --> 01:10:15.530
And you like definitely don't
have it all figured out.

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.170
And so part of it
is giving myself

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:21.145
space and room to go back
into the room the next day

01:10:21.145 --> 01:10:23.020
and be like, you know,
I said this one thing,

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.270
but I really want to correct
myself or build on that.

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:29.935
So yeah.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:31.270
SPEAKER: Two more questions?

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.490
CLINT SMITH: Sure.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:33.430
Or two more questions.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.097
One, two.

01:10:36.097 --> 01:10:37.722
AUDIENCE: First of
all, I'm a huge fan.

01:10:37.722 --> 01:10:39.692
I listen to you all
the time, Clint Smith.

01:10:39.692 --> 01:10:40.192
I, I, I--

01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:43.480
CLINT SMITH: [LAUGHS]
Subscribe to "Pod Save

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.510
the People," if you've not.

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:47.362
Rate us, it's five stars.

01:10:47.362 --> 01:10:49.445
AUDIENCE: How do you think
race relations and race

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.403
dynamics will change as the
population or the demographics

01:10:52.403 --> 01:10:55.361
become a little bit
more interracial?

01:10:55.361 --> 01:10:56.840
And how do you
think racial lines

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.300
will start to blur in
terms of [INAUDIBLE]??

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.290
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:05.040
Yeah, I think you
alluded to it there.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.550
How do you think that
race is going to shift,

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:13.360
and racism and ideas
of race and racism

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.860
will shift over
the course of time

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:19.240
as the demographics of this
country shift, in essence?

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.640
So do I think the final piece
you brought up, around how

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.960
race--

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.140
that alluded to the fact that
race is not a definitive line,

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.040
right?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.890
You know, I always tell people
that the Irish and the Polish

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:34.540
and the Italians,
they were not white

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.540
when they came to this country.

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.914
They were not-- they were
considered like a fundamentally

01:11:37.914 --> 01:11:38.584
different--

01:11:38.584 --> 01:11:40.000
of a fundamentally
different race.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.630
And it was only over time
that they became white,

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.490
that they were acculturated
and assimilated

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.990
into whiteness in
the way that we

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:50.420
think about it in a
specifically American context.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.630
And so we have all these stats.

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.870
What is it, by 2043 or
something like that,

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:59.900
that it's going to be a
majority minority country.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.010
Yes, and I think it's
important to consider

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.560
the ways that certain people
who may not necessarily

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.820
be considered--

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.970
who are considered brown
now, or may not necessarily

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:11.800
be considered such
30 years from now.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.065
I think all you have
to do is look at--

01:12:14.065 --> 01:12:17.380
think about if Ted Cruz didn't
have the last name Cruz,

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.770
you know, what--

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:23.020
there's nothing about his
politics that reflects brown--

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.850
not to say brownness
and blackness

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:27.370
is homogeneous in terms
of political talk.

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:30.700
But you know, you
have Marco Rubio

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.530
and you have Ted
Cruz as examples

01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.740
of people who but
for their last name,

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:38.260
they would navigate the
world as white men, right?

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:42.100
And I think Latino folks are--

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.960
that is the next sort of--

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.270
you have many people coming
to the United States who

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:56.230
are of Latino origin
who marry white people,

01:12:56.230 --> 01:13:01.570
and their children might
not necessarily identify--

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.910
depending-- and part of it
depends on their last name,

01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:05.159
it depends on a lot of things.

01:13:05.159 --> 01:13:07.390
But they might not
necessarily readily

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:11.926
identify as a brown
person more than they

01:13:11.926 --> 01:13:13.050
would do as a white person.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:15.754
I think you see that
already beginning to happen.

01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:17.920
And I think that's going
to continue to happen and I

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.336
wouldn't be surprised-- and
that's why I think people were

01:13:20.336 --> 01:13:21.453
kind of surprised at--

01:13:25.195 --> 01:13:28.090
at the exit polls from
the 2016 election,

01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:32.680
people were like, oh, like the
Latinx community is going to--

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.980
like, that is who's going to
overwhelmingly vote Democrat

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.190
and going to save everything.

01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:43.570
And I think it's 35% of
people who are on the census

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:46.450
Hispanic voted for Trump.

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:49.140
So like, it is, again,
these political blocs

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.450
are not homogeneous.

01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:52.950
You have a lot of
people who think

01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:54.990
of themselves as
Hispanic, but also think

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:57.060
of themselves as white.

01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.104
And over time, that is going
to continue to look different.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.020
The demographics of this
country are certainly

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.930
shifting in ways that
are important and helpful

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:08.940
for progressive politics.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.140
I think you also have a party
on the right who knows that,

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:16.350
and that is why they try very
hard to suppress the vote,

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:20.550
to gerrymander districts, and
to make it so that there's only

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:23.619
a certain type of political
power in certain communities.

01:14:23.619 --> 01:14:25.410
SPEAKER: So before we
go to your questions,

01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:29.218
will you ask over GVC if
there are any more questions,

01:14:29.218 --> 01:14:30.430
just since you're here.

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:31.971
CLINT SMITH: GVC,
any more questions?

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:37.770
I appreciate you all.

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:38.310
Yes?

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.225
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.950
I'm curious having the
context in the media.

01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:46.190
So earlier you brought up
when Obama was elected,

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.740
how many people
in the media were

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.224
eager to say racism is dead, and
clearly that wasn't the case.

01:14:52.224 --> 01:14:53.640
Where I think we're
still seeing--

01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.630
I'm probably not
phrasing this correctly.

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:00.425
Like with the #MeToo
movement, I think

01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:03.230
the media has been a lot
more willing to say--

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:05.790
call out sexual assault,
condemn Harvey Weinstein,

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:08.290
but we're not necessarily seeing
that when it comes to race.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.623
Like you've seen it time and
time again with the problem

01:15:10.623 --> 01:15:12.940
last week with the
shithole comment,

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.500
they weren't willing to
call out racism within that.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.920
And I'm curious what you
think we as Americans and we

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.780
as consumers can do to
push the media to call it

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.930
what it is and kind of
spur that social change,

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.930
because they do have power.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:30.680
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.450
I mean, I think
that there were--

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.262
AUDIENCE: --the question?

01:15:34.262 --> 01:15:36.530
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.270
CLINT SMITH: In essence.

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:41.240
What do I think about the
difference between the #MeToo

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.634
movement, making it so
that people call out sexism

01:15:43.634 --> 01:15:45.050
in a way that does
not necessarily

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:48.710
seem analogous to how people
call out or don't call out

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:51.420
racism in the media.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.400
So I think a couple things.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.592
So I think that there were some
people who did call it racism.

01:15:57.592 --> 01:15:59.675
I think I always remember
the clip that went viral

01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:03.950
with Anderson Cooper, who
was saying very explicitly,

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.511
unfortunately that was not
reflective of the larger

01:16:06.511 --> 01:16:07.010
landscape.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:12.230
People still using "racially
tinged" or "racially charged"

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.840
and creating a whole
set of euphemisms

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.650
for what is very explicitly
and clearly racist.

01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:20.870
So part of why I think
that happens is--

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.120
and this is just my own theory.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.036
But like, intuitively,
I think that part of it

01:16:27.036 --> 01:16:28.430
is the issue of proximity.

01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:32.380
And so I think that half
the country is male,

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.090
half the country is female--

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.110
generally.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:40.900
Obviously, people who are gender
non-binary and things like that

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.970
also exist.

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:47.100
But that is--

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.670
I think because of that,
as compared to, what, 13%?

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.864
12%, 13% in this country
being black if we're

01:16:52.864 --> 01:16:54.780
thinking specifically
about anti-black racism.

01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.340
People exist in a
different proximity

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:03.090
to someone of the opposite
sex in a fundamentally

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:06.450
different way than they do
someone of the opposite race.

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:11.010
Part of that is because the
history of segregation, most

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:15.000
people in this country do
not live or work near anyone

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.420
or alongside anyone who
does not look like them.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.340
Obviously, offices
like this are very much

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.680
the exception to that rule.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.180
And I think because
of that, there's

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:33.690
a different level of empathy
that exists in people's ability

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.990
to think of--

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:39.875
part of this is like-- a lot of
times it's framed as, you know,

01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:41.250
this could have
been my daughter,

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.771
or, this could have been
my sister or my wife,

01:17:43.771 --> 01:17:46.020
which in and of itself is
like, even if you don't have

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.394
a daughter or a
wife or a sister,

01:17:47.394 --> 01:17:49.540
like this is a
human who has been--

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.260
experienced violence, and that
in and of itself should be bad.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.117
But that is the way that
people often frame it

01:17:55.117 --> 01:17:56.200
in their own minds, right?

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.050
And if you don't know
any black people,

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:01.200
when somebody does something
that is imbued with anti-black

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:07.350
racism, you may or may not feel
that viscerally in the same way

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:11.070
you would because you
can't say, oh, that could--

01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:12.570
in the same way
that like somebody--

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:14.820
you know, you hear Harvey
Weinstein, you're just like,

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.427
I can't imagine if
that was my daughter.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:21.010
There's not-- for most people,
lots of people in this country,

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.520
there's no analog for
that, for black-- there's

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.910
like, oh, that's not
nice, or, that's not good.

01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:29.850
And I think also
the other part of it

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:36.420
is that what it means to
be honest about racism

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.780
in this country is
not always analogous

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.150
and tied to what is
like politically--

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.100
tied to political efficacy.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.740
And that part of what's
happening on the left

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.530
is this conversation
about identity politics

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:53.280
or not identity
politics, da-da-dah.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.160
And some people-- people who
are advocating to move away from

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.650
identity politics, and like,
let's all find the common

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:02.730
ground between the white
coal worker in West Virginia

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:05.760
and the undocumented
da-da-da-da-dah.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.840
I think there's a lot
to be unpacked there,

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.450
but part of that rationale is
like, that is what is most--

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:14.370
has the most
political efficiency

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:17.880
as compared-- and instead
of people saying like,

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.690
Black Lives Matter, or Dreamers
marching through the street,

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.456
or whatever that
is, people doing

01:19:23.456 --> 01:19:25.080
things that are based
on their identity

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.121
feels more divisive to folks.

01:19:27.121 --> 01:19:28.870
And I don't necessarily
subscribe to that,

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:30.894
but there might be
people who do, right?

01:19:30.894 --> 01:19:33.310
And again, this is like thinking
about complicated truths.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.600
It might be true that
three years of Black

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.730
Lives Matter protests
propelled a lot of white people

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:44.110
who were feeling very
scared and fed up by that

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:46.730
to go to the polls and
vote for Trump in a way

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:50.120
that they may not have, had
there not been Black Lives

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.460
Matter protesters
blocking highways.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.820
That doesn't mean that
Black Lives Matter shouldn't

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.960
have been doing that.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.330
That doesn't mean that they
were doing something wrong,

01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:03.740
but the complicated truth
is that any time a group

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:08.960
has advocated for their most
basic human and civil rights,

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.200
there has been political
pushback and blowback.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.590
So yeah, I do think
that there needs

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:23.180
to be a sort of
accountability around people

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.730
who do egregious things
in terms of race.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.680
I mean, imagine if
people were getting--

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.660
the way that men have
been fired and let

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:34.227
go, rightfully so, for sexual
harassment and assault.

01:20:34.227 --> 01:20:35.810
Can you imagine if
people were getting

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:39.992
fired for racial
harassment in the same way?

01:20:39.992 --> 01:20:42.200
And that's a question, like,
why doesn't that happen?

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.510
And I think part of
why that doesn't happen

01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:49.710
is because as unsophisticated
as our dialogue and conversation

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:53.040
and discourse is around
sexism and patriarchy

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.670
in this country, which it
is very unsophisticated,

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.770
I think there is
a different level

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:01.740
of a lack of sophistication
around the conversation

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:04.260
around racism,
because to some people

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:07.550
it feels even more charged.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:12.460
And like there's more
at stake in some ways.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.770
So like in a roundabout way
of answering your question,

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:16.414
but I hope that helps.

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:17.330
Thank you all so much.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.530
I appreciate you.

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:21.880
[APPLAUSE]
