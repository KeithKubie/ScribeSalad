00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.460
“Good evening. In a landmark ruling,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.920
the Supreme Court today legalized abortions.”

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.320
That was then.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.700
“And I think that January  22, 1973,  will be a historic day.”

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.420
This is now.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.380
“Hhheeeeyyyyy, save a baby. Oh, oh, oh, oh, stop abortion now.”

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.060
The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision wasn't the end of the fight over abortion rights in the United States.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.940
It was just a bell signaling another round in a lengthy match.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.220
"This fight that we have, we don't have to be having it the way that we're having it.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.560
It doesn't make much sense."

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.840
Proponents on both sides of abortion accessibility have pounced out of their corners

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.780
and are ready to box it out over the future of this issue.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.780
Now that President Trump has nominated this man for the high court, even more eyes are fixed on Roe v. Wade.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.040
“This Supreme Court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh, is going to destroy women's reproductive freedom.”

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.920
“Shut it down so Trump don’t get it! Shut it down so Trump don’t get it!”

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
“If it were to be overturned, I think it would happen in a very slow way. I don't think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.060
there'd be a big headline one day in the paper. I think, rather, over a series of rulings over the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.700
course of many years, we wake up one day and discover,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.660
‘Heck, you know, Roe v. Wade was more or less overturned.’”

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.360
Hey, fam. I'm Imaeyen, and I'd love for you to hit that subscribe button right now,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.600
because we're about to explain what the U.S. would look like in a post–Roe v. Wade world.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.180
And it turns out, we may already have the blueprint to that future.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760
This is what the United States looked like in the 1970s.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.820
The Vietnam War had generations in conflict.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
President Richard Nixon won reelection, and just one year later

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.300
Watergate had already begun to consume his presidency.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.260
“Let me remind you that the finest steel has to go through the hottest fire,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.900
and I can assure you, my friends, that this room is full of fine steel tonight.”

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.420
And when the 1970s began, women still weren’t allowed to have credit cards.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.080
This was the nation’s backdrop when the Supreme Court’s historic Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
But the minute it was revealed, it was contested by anti-abortion advocates.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.260
“In this instance, the Supreme Court has withdrawn protection for the rights of unborn children,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.560
and it is teaching people that abortion is a rather innocuous procedure.”

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.820
The decision has been on the books now for 45 years,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.300
and today’s stats show one in four women in the U.S. will have an abortion by age 45.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.100
But erasing Roe v. Wade isn’t the way some anti-abortion advocates view success.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.340
Instead, activists like Eric Scheidler believe throttling it is the best way to neuter it. He

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.860
says people who oppose abortion access should focus on chipping away at the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.540
precedent by finding ways to restrict the procedure.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.200
“I think the chances of Roe v. Wade being reversed anytime soon are very low.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.000
It would take just the right sort of case and just the right sort of cultural moment.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.720
I think we're far more likely to see the Supreme Court allow further restrictions on abortion.”

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720
Scheidler says cases like 1992’s

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.000
already have done that and he believes they’ve been more impactful than Roe.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.040
In Casey, the Supreme Court ruled that states could regulate abortion to protect

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.840
the health of the mother and the life of the fetus.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.080
It affirmed most of Pennsylvania's 1982 Abortion Control Act,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.840
which required a 24-hour waiting period before a procedure and that women be given “informed consent.”

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.100
And the pursuit for restrictions didn’t end there.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.780
If Roe ended right now 22 states are likely to end abortion

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.620
thanks in part to trigger laws. Those are laws some states have passed

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.620
that say the procedure is immediately outlawed in the even Roe is overturned.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.560
The states most likely to eliminate access are concentrated in the south and midwest.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.660
Even right now there are cases working there way up the system to help restrict Roe’s precedent.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.880
“There are any number of measures that the Supreme Court has allowed over the years to restrict abortion and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.780
regulate abortion in some way or another. And the standard that they're using now isn't the sort of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.480
arte blanche of abortion on demand that we saw in Roe v. Wade.”

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.960
Scheidler admits that even if Roe were reversed immediately, it wouldn’t mean

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960
the end of abortion access in the U.S.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.880
The choice would just revert back to the states. That’s where you’d see the difference.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.480
Today, 42 states require licensed doctors to perform abortions.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.580
And that Pennsylvania law I mentioned earlier – in total, 27 states require a woman to wait a specified amount of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.480
time between when she receives counseling and when the procedure occurs.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.840
Author and attorney Michelle Oberman says these differences impact women differently

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.840
depending on their financial status.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.860
“The correlation between abortion and economics is crystal-clear. Women have abortions when they feel

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.240
that they cannot afford to have another child, or to have a child, and we see that playing out

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.740
when we look at the statistics of who has abortions in this country.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.240
The poorest 13% of women in this country have over half the abortions in this country.”

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.800
Around 75% of abortion patients in 2014 were poor or low-income. Fifty-nine percent had at least one birth.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.700
”The way in which we frame the debate as sort of as a symbolic matter actually

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.760
diverges pretty dramatically from the way in which abortion plays out.”

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.940
Oberman, who has spent years studying the issue, says restricting abortion access disproportionately affects

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.680
the financially insecure and adolescents, because wealthier people can afford to travel to areas

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.040
where the procedure is available.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.100
They can travel out of state if they need to do so. They can afford to take days off work.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.220
Abortions restrictions don’t thwart them as much.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.980
That disparity doesn’t bother Scheidler.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.020
“I don't really see a problem with anyone having difficulty getting an abortion.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.020
I think that's good. I think it should be very difficult.”

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.760
Like many people, Oberman says she once assumed that if abortion

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.920
was illegal in a country, then the nation would see fewer incidents of it.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.220
“Abortion rates actually are higher in countries with the strictest laws around the world.”

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.300
“Even if abortion is completely against the law, it doesn't go away. And we know this from looking at countries

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.500
around the world like El Salvador, where abortion is completely banned, with no exceptions.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.860
And the abortion rate in El Salvador is actually higher than it is in the United States.”

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.800
El Salvador is a place where abortion has been completely outlawed since 1998.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.000
Women and girls face a prison sentence of between two and eight years for having an abortion.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.740
It’s a place where clandestine abortions are common

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.980
and  where a woman named Teodora del Carmen Vásquez spent

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.140
11 years in jail for the stillbirth of her child.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.580
El Salvador is one of six Latin American countries with total abortion bans.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.320
And generally speaking, the Global South has the world’s most restrictive abortion laws.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.140
The lowest abortions rates are in North America and Europe, with northern Europe having the lowest rates.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:09.660
Many European countries also have federally paid family planning programs ranging from 35 weeks to a year.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:16.000
France gives expectant mothers 16 weeks off. Germany allows mothers to take up to three years off.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.200
Oberman believes having this type of support for pregnant parents is what contributes

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.200
to those decreased rates of abortion.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.800
Scheidler says he’d like to see any support that decreases the number of procedures.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:35.180
“I'm happy to see any kind of measures that would assist families, that would make it more possible

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.900
for women to choose life for their babies. You know, it's often made out that, you know, everyone who is opposed

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.420
is, you know, also opposed to healthcare or opposed to any kind of program, any kInd of social programs.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.140
And I just don't see that to be true. Not from where I'm sitting in, it certainly isn't my position.”

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.160
Scheidler has always been anti-abortion, but not always conservative.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.780
He voted for Bill Clinton, and for a decade identified as an atheist.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.300
And though he doesn’t believe it’s fair to compare the U.S.’s abortion outlook to countries like El Salvador,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.540
he did say a U.S. with strict abortion laws would probably look more like Ireland.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.460
Until May 2018, Ireland had a nearly total abortion ban.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.360
Ireland has a low abortion rate – 17 per 1,000 women.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.480
Ireland also has public healthcare and six months’ paid maternity leave.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.040
Global comparisons aside, if Roe were reversed, there’s one big reason the U.S.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.620
wouldn’t go back to looking like it did before the ruling.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:40.580
“The biggest change since 1973 in terms of illegal abortion is the advent of abortion drugs.”

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.080
You see, even in places where the procedure is restricted, if there’s internet access,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.560
then there’s accessibility to abortion drugs with a simple search.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.800
But Oberman warns that increasing abortion restrictions will have a tangible cost.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.920
“There will be women who do die from illegal abortion, though. So let's just be clear about that,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:08.160
because there'll be a population of women who don't access abortion drugs so easily, find out too late in their

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.440
pregnancy or who take the wrong drug at the wrong dose. And we also know, we can

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.160
predict who those women will be. They'll be the poorest and most marginalized.”

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.660
The future of reproductive rights is threatened regardless of Roe v. Wade’s future. And the

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.300
truth is that, for some women in some states, a United States without abortion access

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.480
already a reality. It’s just that now, many more women are at risk for being in that same pool.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.220
