and you know there's a lot of interest
in what happens to brain function as

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

people get older and a lot of worry

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
people get older and a lot of worry
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.649
people get older and a lot of worry
about loss of memory and dementia but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
about loss of memory and dementia but
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929
about loss of memory and dementia but
there's real you know there's real data

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
there's real you know there's real data
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840

whole there's that whole field of
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.139
whole there's that whole field of
experience and wisdom which which would

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149
experience and wisdom which which would
 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.289
experience and wisdom which which would
kind of feed into creativity and the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
kind of feed into creativity and the
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.410
kind of feed into creativity and the

that will have huge payback you know as

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
that will have huge payback you know as
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.530

it the real fountain of you if it really

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
it the real fountain of you if it really
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.590
it the real fountain of you if it really
is I mean exercise has been shown to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600
is I mean exercise has been shown to
 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.050
is I mean exercise has been shown to
prevent many diseases that are

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
prevent many diseases that are
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.150
prevent many diseases that are
associated with aging and it's all it's

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
associated with aging and it's all it's
 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.449
associated with aging and it's all it's
also been shown to really maintain brain

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
also been shown to really maintain brain
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.240
also been shown to really maintain brain
function as well so you know eating a

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
function as well so you know eating a
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.960
function as well so you know eating a
healthy diet staying physically active

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970

know to really be engaged with life
those have all been shown to really

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479
those have all been shown to really
 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.230
those have all been shown to really
promote preserved brain function

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240
promote preserved brain function
 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.029
promote preserved brain function
we still don't you know we still don't

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039
we still don't you know we still don't
 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.980
we still don't you know we still don't
know what causes Alzheimer's disease and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990
know what causes Alzheimer's disease and
 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.159
know what causes Alzheimer's disease and
that is just a subjective huge amount of

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169
that is just a subjective huge amount of
 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.339
that is just a subjective huge amount of
research going on so so of course it's

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349
research going on so so of course it's
 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.379
research going on so so of course it's
true that brilliant people get

alzheimer's disease and you know it's a
 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.719
alzheimer's disease and you know it's a
very tragic disease but if you look at

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
very tragic disease but if you look at
 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.680
very tragic disease but if you look at
you know the whole population if people

you know the whole population if people
 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.719
you know the whole population if people
pursued healthier lifestyles that would

because that is just going to play out
 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.270
because that is just going to play out
into you know adults being obese it's

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280
into you know adults being obese it's
 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.460
into you know adults being obese it's
that's already a huge number

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470
that's already a huge number
 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.430
that's already a huge number
and it's it's said that now this next

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440
and it's it's said that now this next

the elderly age group it might start to

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500
the elderly age group it might start to
 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.170
the elderly age group it might start to
be true that people live less long than

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180
be true that people live less long than
 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.510
be true that people live less long than
their than their parents and that's

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520
their than their parents and that's
 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.720
their than their parents and that's
gonna be because obesity which really a

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:28.730
gonna be because obesity which really a
 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.820
gonna be because obesity which really a
big part of it is that obesity leading

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830
big part of it is that obesity leading
 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.790
big part of it is that obesity leading
to type 2 diabetes and all of the

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800
to type 2 diabetes and all of the
 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.440
to type 2 diabetes and all of the
problems with with diabetes and

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.450
problems with with diabetes and
 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.540
problems with with diabetes and
premature death so you know it's really

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550
premature death so you know it's really
 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.670
premature death so you know it's really
scary so I kind of you know I really

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680
scary so I kind of you know I really
 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.020
scary so I kind of you know I really
applaud all the efforts that are going

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030
applaud all the efforts that are going
 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.510
applaud all the efforts that are going
on now to try to turn that around to

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
on now to try to turn that around to
 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.630
on now to try to turn that around to
reduce obesity to get kids to be more

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640
reduce obesity to get kids to be more
 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.220
reduce obesity to get kids to be more
active I think that's really going to be

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.230
active I think that's really going to be
 

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.010
active I think that's really going to be
a key to what you know what we're seeing

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.020
a key to what you know what we're seeing
 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.060
