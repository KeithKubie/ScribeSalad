00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.570
Consider the functions f and
g with the graphs shown below.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.500
If capital G of x is
equal to lowercase

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.870
g of lowercase f of
x, what is the value

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.810
of capital G prime of 2.5.?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.790
So G of x is a
composition of g and f.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.470
So it's g of f of x, or
lowercase g of f of x.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.460
And they don't graph
capital G of x here.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.860
They just give us the graphs of
lowercase g of x and lowercase

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.820
f of x.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.810
This is the graph
of lowercase f of x.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.110
This is a graph of
lowercase g of x.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.060
So let's just try to think
how we could evaluate this

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.120
and then see if they've given
us the right information here.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.430
So let me just rewrite a lot of
what they've already told us.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.130
They've already told
us that capital G of x

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.035
is equal to lowercase
g of f of x.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.470
So if we wanted to take
the derivative of capital

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.370
G of x-- and we do want
to think about what

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.620
the derivative of capital G
of x is, because they want

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.880
us to evaluate the derivative
at x is equal to 2.5.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.590
So let's do that.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.420
Let's take the derivative
of both sides of this.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.910
So if we take the derivative
of the left hand side,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.230
we end up with G prime of x.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.910
And on the derivative
on the right hand,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.993
since we have a composition
here of two functions,

00:01:23.993 --> 00:01:25.820
we would apply the chain rule.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.900
So this is going to be the
derivative of g with respect

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.340
to f.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.310
So we could write
that as g prime

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.650
of f of x times the derivative
of f with respect to x.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.420
So times f prime of x.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.310
So if we want to evaluate
what G prime of 2.5

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.930
is, then every place
we see an x here,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.640
we have to start
with 2.5 in there.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.300
So let's try to do that.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.410
So G prime of-- and I'll do this
in white so it sticks out-- G

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.470
prime of 2.5 is going
to be equal to lowercase

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:30.397
g prime of f of 2.5
times f prime of 2.5.

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.480
So let's think about what
these would evaluate to.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.500
What is f of 2.5?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.330
Well, when x is
equal to 2.5-- let

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.840
me just get a color
you can actually see.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.290
When x is equal to 2.5, our
function here is equal to 1.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.610
So f of 2.5, so we know
that f of 2.5 is equal to 1.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.180
Let me write that down,
f of 2.5 is equal to 1.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.750
And we also need to figure
out what f prime of 2.5 is.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:08.350
So f-- let me write it
this way-- f prime of 2.5

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.990
is equal to.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.860
Now what is f prime of 2.5?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.940
That's just
essentially the slope

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.640
of the tangent line
at the function

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.450
when x is equal to 2.5.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.600
So it's really just the
slope right over here.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.850
And at least right over at
this part of the function,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.725
it's actually a line.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.770
And the slope is actually
very easy to spot out.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.092
If we were to go from this
point to this point here--

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:32.050
and I'm just picking
those points because those

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.740
are on kind of
integer-valued coordinates--

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.030
we see that for every three
that we run, we go up two,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.900
or that we rise two for
every three that we run.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.500
Or that our change in y
over change in x is 2/3.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.270
So the slope of the function
right over there is 2/3.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.910
So this is equal to 2/3.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.480
And so we can substitute back
in here, f of 2.5 is equal to 1.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.500
And this right over
here is equal to 2/3.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.850
Now, we're not done yet.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.140
Now we have to evaluate,
what is G prime of 1?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.760
So when x is equal to 1,
this is the function g.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.550
We're not evaluating g of 1.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.370
We're evaluating g prime of 1.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.520
So what is the slope
of the line here?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.740
Well, our change in y
over change in x is 2/1.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.250
If we go one in the
horizontal direction,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.860
we go up two in the
vertical direction.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.860
Change in y over
change in x is 2/1.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.100
So g prime-- let me write
this down-- g prime of 1

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.400
is equal to 2.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.597
So this whole thing
evaluates to 2.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.430
And so this simplifies--
let me scratch that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.020
out-- the simplifies to 2 times
2/3, which is equal to 4/3.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.384
So we could write G prime
of 2.5 is equal to 4/3.

00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:11.800
And this is a
pretty neat problem,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.870
because we didn't get to
see the actual function

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.996
definition from G of x.

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:17.370
But just using the chain rule
and the information they're

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.030
giving us, we were
able to figure out

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.920
what the value of
this derivative

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.673
is when x is equal to 2.5.
