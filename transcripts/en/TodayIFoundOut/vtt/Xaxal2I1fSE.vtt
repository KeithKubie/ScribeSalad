00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:47.019
The 
sickly sweet sugar water known as Coca-Cola

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.320
was initially marketed as a magical cure-all
tonic for every kind of “nervous affliction”

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
imaginable from headaches to hysteria- a condition
that, fun fact, used to be treated in women

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010
through medically administered orgasms.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.540
This ultimately led to the creation of vibrators
to help out the no doubt cramped handed doctors

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.660
who just didn’t have the stamina to keep
up with the countless hysterical women banging

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.830
on their doors…

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.710
(More on this in our article Why Women Fainted
So Much in the 19th Century)

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.539
Of course, as with so many new ventures, when
it first became available to the public on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.789
May 8, 1886, Coca-Cola was a bit of a flop,
averaging only about 9 glasses per day sold

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.580
in the first year.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.399
This was despite the fact that it debuted
at one of the most popular soda fountains

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.630
in Atlanta, Georgia, located in Jacob’s
Pharmacy.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.259
For reference here, their gross earnings on
soda sales, according to the owner of the

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.890
pharmacy, Dr. Joseph Jacobs, was about $150
per day (or about $4,100 today), of which

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.739
Coca-Cola accounted for about 45 cents daily
in the first year.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.959
This is mildly surprising considering not
only is Coca-Cola reasonably tasty, but it

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.119
was also, as mentioned, being marketed by
the medical professionals involved as a cure

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.930
for countless medical issues, including a
rather serious one in morphine addiction.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.660
On top of that, they also pitched it as something
of the Viagra of its day…

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.310
(No doubt this effect on men is partially
how it was supposed to go about curing hysteria

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.310
in women…)

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.680
And if the marketing and flavour didn’t
work, their trump card was the fact that it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.890
contained coca leaf extract, a.k.a. cocaine,
as well as lime juice which aids in cocaine

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.820
absorption in the stomach for maximal bang
for your buck on the drug element.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.770
Seemingly this should have seen it become
a huge hit rather quickly, though it is noteworthy

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.590
that various cocaine products were widely
available at the time, so perhaps people didn’t

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.590
have need to come back to Coca-Cola to get
their fix.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.600
Whatever the case, as to how its inventor,
pharmacist John Pemberton, came up with the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
tonic, he was specifically looking for a cure
for his own morphine addiction.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.130
You see, Pemberton was a former Confederate
soldier who nearly had his head lopped off

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.420
in the Battle of Columbus.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.580
During his recovery from his wounds, as with
so many others at the time, he became addicted

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.400
to morphine and so was looking for something
to wean him off the habit.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.270
This all led him to experimenting with coca-leaf
extract, and thus Pemberton’s French Wine

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.310
Coca was born, which he claimed did the trick.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.380
(Though it should be noted that when he died
of stomach cancer two years later in 1888,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.430
he was still addicted to morphine.)

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.740
Unfortunately for him, his initial concoction
also included alcohol (from wine), which became

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.260
banned in Atlanta where he lived in the same
year he debuted his tonic, resulting in him

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.070
substituting the wine with sugar and citric
acid.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.600
He also, of course, mixed the whole thing
with carbonated water, owing to, at the time,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.660
fizzy water being thought to be good for your
health.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.200
Finally, in 1886 Pemberton was ready to start
selling what would eventually become arguably

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620
the most famous non-water beverage brand on
Earth.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.730
After a deal was struck with Dr. Joseph Jacobs
of the aforementioned Jacobs’ Pharmacy and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.920
the soda fountain operator within, Willis
Venable, Coca-Cola finally graced the world

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.580
with its presence, selling for 5 cents per
serving (about $1.38 today).

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.580
Poor sales and a loan Venable had received
from Jacobs’ to build a house ultimately

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.140
saw Venable trade his 1/3 stake to Jacobs
in repayment of said cash advance.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.190
As for Jacobs, he had little interest in producing
and marketing the drink and was generally

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.230
annoyed with having to deal with Pemberton
and his huge financial problems.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.530
Thus, not long after he acquired Venable’s
share, he sold his entire stake in Coca-Cola

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.530
to fellow pharmacist Asa Candler, for, to
quote Jacobs “some stock in a glass factory

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.009
on South Pryor Street…

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.139
This factory, on which the insurance had been
allowed to lapse, was destroyed shortly afterward

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.139
by fire.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.550
In addition to the stock I was to receive
some odds and ends such as bed pans, pewter

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.650
syringes, wooden pill boxes, and empty bottles.”

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.669
Candler, after buying out the remaining shares,
including from Pemberton, would start the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.660
process that turned the brand into the beverage
powerhouse it is today, by 1919 himself selling

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.130
the brand and recipe for a cool $25 million
(about $361 million today) to a group of investors.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.529
As for Pemberton, when he sold his stake to
Candler he did have a thought to leave a partial

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.520
share to his son, Charles, in the hopes the
morphine-addiction curing drink would someday

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
become a huge hit.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.840
However, ultimately Charles and he opted to
just take as much money as they could get

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.759
at the time and forgo any further stake in
Coca-Cola.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.879
Pemberton died shortly thereafter in poverty
and his son Charles followed him about six

00:05:11.879 --> 00:06:29.610
years later, ironically dying of a morphine
overdose.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:37.219
The name “Coca-Cola” was suggested by
Pemberton’s bookkeeper, Frank Robinson,

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.479
stemming from two of the key ingredients:
extracts from the coca leaf and kola nut.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:48.580
Robinson was also the one to first pen the
now classic cursive “Coca-Cola” logo.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.849
To fully replicate Coca-Cola, in the United
States at least, you’d need something only

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.319
one company has legal access to- unprocessed
coca leaves.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.749
Currently, only Stepan Co. can import these
leaves into the United States.

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:06.160
They then process the leaves and sell the
cocaine-free extract to Coca-Cola and the

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.789
cocaine to the pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.229
Thus, to make your own Coca-Cola with the
exact correct recipe, you’d need to convince

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.900
Stepan Co. to branch out and sell to your
company too.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:29.729
This is likely a tall order considering the
pressure Coca-Cola would put on them not to.
