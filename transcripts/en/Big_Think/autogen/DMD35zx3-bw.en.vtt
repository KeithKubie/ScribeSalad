was vaguely petulant quality that came
into that as well the other thing that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
into that as well the other thing that
 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.920
into that as well the other thing that
struck me not at all original was that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
struck me not at all original was that
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.330

Iran it worked pretty poorly and then

moving like Iran and Afghanistan I think

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
moving like Iran and Afghanistan I think
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.280
