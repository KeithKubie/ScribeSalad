00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.580
As video games have gotten more and more ambitious
with their stories and action, developers

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
have started to turn to established Hollywood
stars to give their games an added boost.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.750
But not every well-known actor is easy to
spot by their voice alone – and sometimes,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.990
the events that put them in the game to begin
with are hard to believe.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.930
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors You Didn’t
Know Were in Video Games.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.489
Michael Fassbender - Fable 3

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.760
The fantasy game series had turned to plenty
of English film and TV stars for voices, but

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.980
with Fable 3, they swung for the fences.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.230
Before he became a household name and Oscar-nominated
actor, Michael Fassbender was brought on to

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.130
voice Logan, the game’s villain.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.510
He’d soon launch to the top of the American
box office playing Magneto in the X-Men universe

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.050
– along with his Fable co-star, Nicholas
Hoult.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.860
Matthew Perry - Fallout: New Vegas

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.470
There’s nothing game fans love more than
finding out one of their favorite actors is

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.850
a closet gamer.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.390
So when Friends star Matthew Perry was promoting
his film “17 Again” back in 2009, he had

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.829
to admit that his love of open world RPG Fallout
3 had literally crippled him.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.780
The developers took notice, and invited him
to voice the character of Benny, one of the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.439
antagonists of their upcoming shooter, New
Vegas.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.829
Who says being addicted to video games can’t
take you places?

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.659
Haley Joel Osment - Kingdom Hearts

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.030
After the success of The Sixth Sense and Pay
it Forward, actor Haley Joel Osment was an

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.330
overnight sensation.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.520
Unfortunately, that level of fame didn’t
last for his entire film career.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.380
But he’s never faded from the memory of
Nintendo fans.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.710
He was first called on to voice the hero of
Kingdom Hearts in English versions of the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.990
game at the age of 14, and has kept up the
role ever since, spanning across 9 games over

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.070
the course of a decade.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.149
He may not stay a teenage forever, but his
voice can try.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.319
Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton - Deadly
Creatures

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.159
A Nintendo Wii game letting people play as
a deadly scorpion or tarantula might sound

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.509
odd, but the voice talents signed for Deadly
Creatures is even more surprising.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.310
Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton starred
as two humans in search of gold who wind up

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.100
tangling with the game’s tiny heroes instead.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.109
The game proved to be a surprising success,
but it’s still not the usual storyline audiences

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.349
expect from two Oscar-winning writers.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.900
Susan Sarandon - Dishonored

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.269
It's not every day that an Oscar winning actress
accepts a supporting role in a triple-A video

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.950
game, but when the makers of Dishonored needed
a voice to bring the mysterious, ragged aristocrat

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.829
Granny Rags to life, one actress seemed the
perfect choice: Susan Sarandon.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.230
To their surprise, Sarandon took them up on
the offer, since she respected the game’s

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.970
choice of letting players complete it in a
completely non-violent way.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.209
In the end, she brought the kind of sinister
performance to the creepy quest-giver that

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.439
only five Oscar nominations make possible.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.829
Cara Delevingne - Grand Theft Auto 5

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.540
Rockstar Games has called on dozens of Hollywood
stars to flesh out the world of Grand Theft

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.690
Auto, particularly when it comes to the DJs
and shock jocks of their in-game radio stations.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.519
But they caught one rising star early - before
fashion model Cara Delevingne was turning

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.129
heads in Paper Towns or DC's Suicide Squad
movie, she was owning the airwaves in Grand

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:07.540
Theft Auto 5, as the on air host for Non Stop
Pop FM.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.500
Will Arnett - Call of Duty

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.080
As the Call of Duty series has gotten more
successful, A-level stars have been brought

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.940
in to blur the line between video game and
certified blockbuster war movie.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.799
But actor Will Arnett was hooked ever since
the first Modern Warfare - a fact he discussed

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.829
while making the late night rounds.

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.180
The developers noticed, and even though the
sequel was too far along to give the Arrested

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.580
Development star a role, he did get to lend
his voice to a handful of in-game barks and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.569
quips.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.609
Eliza Dushku - Wet

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.569
This hack-and-slash title had all the potential
to be a grindhouse hit featuring guns and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.209
swordplay, starring a ruthless mercenary Rubi
Malone.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.209
Actress Eliza Dushku was cast in the role,
having plenty of experience as a deadly martial

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.480
artist in TV shows like Buffy the Vampire
Slayer and Dollhouse.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.180
The game’s Tarantino-esque style made it
a hit with some players, but a sequel was

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.239
cancelled – meaning fans of the actress
will have to stick with one game for now.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.819
Steve Carell - Outlaw Golf

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.139
Who says golf games can’t be marketed as
loud, offensive, or not suitable for all ages?

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:13.930
In 2002, Outlaw Golf proved every sport could
be extreme, injecting humor into the gentleman’s

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.030
game – especially when it came to the game’s
commentator.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.920
Years before The Office and The 40 Year Old
Virgin, comedian Steve Carell was giving play-by-play

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.540
breakdowns of digital golf, but gave up the
job for the game’s sequel, moving onto bigger

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.680
and better things.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.740
John Goodman - RAGE

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.301
When the developers of the post-apocalyptic
shooter finished designing Dan Hagar, the

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:37.820
first character players would meet, they realized
that his glasses, hunting vest and shorts

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.190
meant he looked an awful lot like the character
Walter Sobchak in the movie The Big Lebowski.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.470
Figuring they should run with the idea, they
sought actor John Goodman to play the part

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.580
again, giving a booming voice to the no-nonsense
father figure ushering players into their

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.190
world.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.830
