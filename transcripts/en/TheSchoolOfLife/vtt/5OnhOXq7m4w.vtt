00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.500
Jacques Lacan was the greatest French psychoanalyst of the 20th century.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.740
He was also something that's come to feel rather odd - an intellectual celebrity.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.240
As much of a focus of gossip and curiosity as a pop star.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.520
He hung out with famous artists and writers, he had a fabulous head of hair, he attracted beautiful women.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.340
Jacques Marie Ã‰mile Lacan was born in Paris in 1901.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.520
His father was a successful businessman, a major figure in the emerging soap industry.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.360
His mother was a pious Catholic.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.980
His older brother became a Benedictine monk.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.980
But Lacan stopped believing in God at a young age.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
He became obsessed, instead, with philosophy and mathematics.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.300
At the age of 15 he wallpapered his bedroom with pages torn from Spinoza's Ethics.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.200
At university he studied medicine and specialized in psychiatry.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.740
Lacan wrote many essays and published transcripts of the seminars he gave.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.880
He liked to present his ideas in highly complex ways and often deployed mathematical equations and diagrams.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.100
He didn't write very clearly, but beneath the complex surface Lacan made some extremely useful additions to our understanding of ourselves.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.440
Lacan was deeply interested in an event that occurs in the life of every child:

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.000
the first time that they recognize themselves in a mirror.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.460
They have the hugely distinctive and strange experience which no dog or chicken has ever had

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.540
of looking at their own reflection and thinking: "THAT is ME."

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.300
Crucially, the moment which Lacan called "the mirror phase" can feel very unsettling,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.440
because the face in the mirror doesn't necessarily look as we feel.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.440
Inside we are a formless, continuous stream of consciousness made up of speeding thoughts, desires and images.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.080
We are polysexual, chaotic, ever-changing and ambivalent to the core.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.660
But on the outside we seem like a more or less stable entity with composed and symmetrical features that betray almost nothing of what's going on within.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.660
We have only words to try and transcend the gap, and most of the time they fail to do justice to our real intentions.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.880
Not knowing how to say what we feel isn't a personal failing - it is an existential truth.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.900
The image in the mirror is, by necessity, far more one-dimensional than the entity that beholds it.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.780
This leads to a problem that follows us throughout life.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.860
As adults, we long for others to understand us in the deepest ways.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.560
But Lacan is preparing us to face the darker possibility that in fact, other people will be resolutely stuck on the outside of us,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.140
assuming us to be pretty much as we seem, but heavily caricaturing us without meaning to.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.820
We're understandably reluctant to accept this loneliness, and are consequently very concerned to control the external appearances that we present.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.400
That's what the fashion industry trades on. We hope that if we could tinker sufficiently with what other people see externally of us,  perhaps our hair or the design of our collar,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.620
we may eventually be properly understood.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:13.880
But Lacan suggests a more difficult, mature move - that we accept that other people simply won't ever experience us the way we experience ourselves.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.420
That we will be almost entirely misunderstood, and will, in turn, almost entirely misunderstand.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.900
Lacan was famous for his extremely negative statements about romantic love.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.120
"There is no such thing as a sexual relationship."

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.540
"Men and women don't exist."

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.840
And most dramatically, "Man knows nothing of woman, and woman knows nothing of man."

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.440
Lacan was trying to get at an unpopular yet critical fact about romantic relationships,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.820
the extent to which we don't truly comprehend our lovers and simply peg a range of fantasies drawn from childhood experiences to their physical forms.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.320
It's a dark but, in a way, liberating idea.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.260
It invites us not to be upset when we don't feel a perfect rapport with someone who initially seemed like a soulmate.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.480
And it recommends that we certainly don't rush off in search of some more "ideal" partner if we're feeling less than perfectly understood.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.600
The connection we worry that we've lost is something we never actually had.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:25.400
Our relationship hasn't gone wrong through folly, error or bad luck. It's following the ordinary path of love, which is to come to an awareness of it's own fundamentally illusory nature.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.720
With Lacan's help we can hold on to a more accurate picture of what is normal.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.540
To be more or less always alone.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.900
This is a foundation upon which we can build more mature and less frustrated relationships.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.200
Lacan was very active in intellectual life in the late 1960s.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.060
It was, of course, a time of great excitement around social change.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.260
There was the sexual revolution, great interest in Communism, and lots of protests.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.060
Lacan's friends were extremely excited.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.980
Lacan sympathized. And yet, when he saw the increasing numbers of student protesters, he told them:

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.740
"What you aspire to as revolutionaries is a new master. And you will get one."

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:17.380
Lacan suggested that though we believe ourselves to be democrats, most of us are remarkably interested in finding and then worshipping authority figures who will promise us the earth.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.720
We desire to have someone else in charge, who can make everything OK.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.880
Someone who is, in a sense, an ideal parent.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.680
And we bring this peculiar-sounding bit of our psychological fantasies into the way we navigate politics.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:40.200
For Lacan the truly talented politician isn't the one who knows how to whip up the crowd and ignites their semi-conscious, childlike dreams of perfection -

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.740
it's the one who dares to be an adult.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.260
Someone who has the skill to persuade people of the disappointing nature of reality.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.260
and who has the tact to do so without provoking unbearable rage and tantrums.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.340
Lacan never stopped trying to communicate a very difficult fact -

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.780
what odd, immature and lonely creatures we are.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.140
It's because we refuse to recognize this and don't budget enough time to absorb the grief, that we're more miserable than we need to be.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.040
Lacan constantly tested new and often unconventional methods to try to make psychoanalysis a greater part of our lives.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.020
He saw it as the natural place to wrestle with the conundrums of being human.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.520
He didn't like to call his clients "patients" because he didn't want them to think of themselves as sick or unusual.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.620
The only qualification for coming to analysis was to be human.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.640
Lacan thought a session could be quite short, sometimes just 5 minutes, if that's how one happened to be feeling.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.960
He even allowed his barber and pedicurist to visit while he was conducting analytic sessions.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.380
He wasn't doing this to be provocative but rather because he was interested in exploring how insights might be delivered in a more relaxed way,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.720
so that they could reach many more people.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:05.520
Lacan was unafraid of mixing intellectual truth with worldly succes, and thought it was just as important to influence politicians, artists and everyday people as it was to teach philosophers or psychoanalysts.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.060
He continued to lecture around the world right up until his death at the age of 80.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.320
Though an atheist, Lacan had occassionally spoken of a wish to have a grand Catholic funeral,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.980
ideally either in Venice or Rome. But it was not to be.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:26.240
He was buried quietly near his country house in the modest village of Guitrancourt not far from the northeastern suburbs of Paris.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.160
Lacan had big ambitions for psychoanalysis.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:36.240
He hoped that it might transform the most powerful collective bodies of the era, like the Catholic Church and the Communist Party,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.240
and liberate them from some of their errors.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:47.700
He believed that in the future psychoanalysis would become widespread and normal, ingrained in the way people think, a part of the business of ordinary life.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.360
It's an important project, and we're still at it today.
