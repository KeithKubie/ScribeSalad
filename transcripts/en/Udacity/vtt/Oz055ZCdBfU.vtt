00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here are two ways of transporting a heavy object.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You can put it on the backseat or you can transport it on the roof.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, imagine that you brake in this situation or in that situation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In which situation does the front of the car lower more or is there no difference at all?

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Think about the center of mass and think about levers.
