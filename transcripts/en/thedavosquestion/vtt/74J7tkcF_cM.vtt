Ebenezer Essoka

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.380
Ebenezer: Well absolutely, I believe African
continent would benefit from the event. Yes

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.030
it's look at it in South Africa. I have been
in South Africa now for some time. I know

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.990
it's seen increased investments in South Africa.
We've seen investment in infrastructure transform

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.669
the landscape of this country. And I believe
the more people who come to South Africa for

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.580
the workshop, the more we create a positive
life after the World Cup Events in South Africa,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.079
more companies benefit from that and with
that in mind, there really is a possibility

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.579
that those companies will now make a positive
ability to flow through to other countries

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.940
in the continent and thus create a positive
environment for the entire continent of Africa.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.600
So welcome everybody to the continent of Africa
via South Africa for the World Cup.
