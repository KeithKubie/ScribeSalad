So let's have a quick review of the

00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:05.520
config files in an App Engine Maven project. There

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.650
are config files to set up the Maven dependencies.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.060
There's a configuration file to specify the configs specific

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.530
to the Web application. And there are config

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.910
files that are very specific to App Engine applications.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.630
So now, you're going to match the config file with

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.244
it's purpose. So some of the config files that

00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:33.220
we're talked about include web.xml, pom.xml, and appengine-web.xml. So

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.800
go ahead and match each of these XML files. To its purpose, by checking the box.
