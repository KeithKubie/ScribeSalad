00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.038
Multiplying each term in the first set of parenthesis by each term in the second

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:08.084
set of parenthesis. And doing this, of course, for both sides gives us this long

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:11.855
messy thing. Thankfully, it will start to look a little bit prettier in a

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:15.802
second. Now we need to combine like terms. Our like terms are of course, as we

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.822
can see, terms that have an x to the first power in them. And for now, we're

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.877
only going to do that within either side of the equation. Of course, it doesn't

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:27.497
matter what order you have the terms in either side of the equation in. So let's

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:31.156
say, for example, you have 24x squared as the first term in the right-hand side.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.150
That's totally fine.
