00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.460
&gt;&gt;commentator: So I wanna start by thanking
Natan Sharansky for coming to Google, and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.309
he is gonna be giving us some, a talk and
we're gonna have some question and answer.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.980
And I'm gonna give a few highlights of his
background, but not too many because I know

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.720
Natan's story of his background will be much
more exciting than me repeating it now.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.570
But I will say that Google and Natan Sharansky
share a lot of things in common.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.420
So the first thing I'll say is that he graduated
with a degree in computer science. So you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.930
are in good company here; probably about more
than half the company probably has a degree

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.070
in computer science or something close to
it. So you're in the company of friends.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.530
And the second thing I'll say about Natan
Sharansky is, well I first heard about him

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.250
when I was a-a kid in-in the 80s as really
being one of the foremost dissidents and spokesperson

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.830
for Soviet Jewry. So for really anyone living
here, this was a huge initiative for us and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.700
I certainly heard a lot about him, and he
did a great job of putting a face to the Soviet

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Jewry there.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.840
But kind of how that relates to Google is
he has really been an-an advocate for human

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.930
rights; for speaking his mind. And I think
Google shares those two common characteristics

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.000
in our company culture.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.560
So anyone here who works here knows that everybody
here speaks their mind; sometimes that's a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.119
challenge to get things done. And the company
has a very, very deep commitment to human

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.149
rights. I think probably illustrated most
recently by what we, our statement with China.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.689
And he also has, he has done a number of really
important things. After leaving Russia in

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.009
term, especially being in four successive
Israeli governments, which I'll sure you'll

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.209
hear more about and being an author.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.140
One of them is very close to our company motto;
it's a variant of it. Our-our motto is, well

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.950
one of them is, "Do No Evil," and his is,
"Fear No Evil."

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.090
So I see a lot of commonality here between
the company and Natan.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.050
So I welcome you to hear all your thoughts,
questions, or anything we can answer for you.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.340
I would like to start by thanking the Jewish
Community Federation for hosting and sponsoring

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.120
the visit to the Bay Area, and I would like
to invite Jennifer Gorovitz to come up here

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.069
and say a few words, and then we'll kick off
with Natan's talk.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.590
Thank you.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.590
[pause]

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.390
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Gorovitz: Thank you.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.390
[applause]

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.050
I'm not gonna use the chair because my feet
clearly won't touch the ground.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.840
[laughter]

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.640
[pause]

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.209
It's wonderful to be with all of you. We're
grateful that you have us here today.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.930
I wanna thank Susan and Dennis for your gracious
hospitality.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.840
This is really a-a fitting place for us to
be today. Fitting because Google has been

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.330
such a revolutionary and a change agent, and
Natan Sharansky has been a revolutionary and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.209
a change agent for all of his adult life and
is truly responsible for saving or improving

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.299
more than a million lives.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.450
It's also fitting because a year ago, when
I assumed this role, our leaders began to

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.070
say and have consistently said since that
time, "Jen the Federation really needs to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.190
be like Google: nimble, adaptive, visionary,
a connector to the utmost degree."

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.180
So I thank you for setting this benchmark
for me.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.280
I'm currently leading the Federation through
a strategic reinvention with you very much

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280
in mind.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.170
In the meantime I thank you for making it
infinitely easier for people to find us and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.920
all that we do and to connect with one of
our many community building groups either

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.790
online, in person, or both.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.410
Federation, for those of you who may not know,
was created 100 years ago to solve the most

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.180
significant Jewish challenge of the day. Then,
in 1910, it was a massive immigration of thousands

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.990
of Jews with five dollars or less in their
pockets; my great grandfather included.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.720
There were brand new social welfare organizations
and the need for very significant fund raising,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.150
collaboration, and organization for the community
as a whole.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.020
In 1910, remember, Jews had never been fully
accepted in any society; never completely

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.900
safe anywhere they landed. By then, it had
become very clear that we are stronger when

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.120
we are organized and that we need to care
for our own anywhere that they may be.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.180
Couple that with the Torah's 32 references
to the Mitzvah of Tzedakah, social justice,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.340
and the 18th century rabbinic convention of
Tikkun Olam, the imperative to repair not

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.840
just the Jewish world but the broader world
in which we live and these became the pillars

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.870
of the Federation; solving big challenges
and working as a community foundation to strengthen

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.160
community.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.610
Year after year, decade after decade, enormous
issues continued to face the Jewish community

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.889
as well as the rest of the world and Federation
was always and continues to be the first responder.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.180
We have always been there to make sure the
community is safe, strong, vibrant, including

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.020
through two world wars, The Great Depression,
the Holocaust, Israel's independence and five

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.880
wars, and ongoing terrorist threats through
today.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.240
Beginning in the 1970s the Bay Area community
took on the human rights and immigration issues

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.330
of Soviet Jews, and after years and years
of local sit-ins, demonstrations, trips to

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.370
the former Soviet Union, and a campaign locally
that raised 29 million dollars in support

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.449
of a one billion dollar national effort, Natan's
dream and the dream of a million Soviet Jews

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.800
was realized to leave the former Soviet Union
and to live freely and openly without fear,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.389
hunger, imprisonment, or injury.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.350
This year in addition to celebrating our 100th
anniversary, we celebrate the 20th anniversary

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.139
of this incredible rescue and relocation effort;
one that involved so many of this community's

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.330
leaders very intimately.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.520
Throughout these many years, Federation, in
its dual role as the ongoing philanthropic

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.789
engine for vibrant Jewish life and a caring
community, has done this in two ways.

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:56.360
First, raising over 20 million dollars annually
to invest in the community to strengthen Jewish

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.240
life here, in Israel, and around the world,
and also through the Center of Philanthropy,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.169
which I'll talk about in just a moment.

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:10.830
Annually we invest in specific portfolios:
First Engagement. We open as many doors as

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.020
possible to Jewish living, remove as many
barriers to access including those that make

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.919
Jewish life not affordable for many people,
and focus on youth education and young adult

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.720
philanthropy.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.569
For example, a few years ago, we made our
largest endowment gift of 10 million dollars

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:33.509
to build the local Taube Koret Campus for
Jewish Life.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.539
In the last year alone, we granted more than
1.6 million dollars in scholarships for our

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:40.720
day schools and camps.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.900
And we have just launched a venture style
philanthropy initiative in which 21 to 45

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.919
year olds will connect with each other to
select among their peers the very best models

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:57.449
of innovative Jewish living. This sector,
the key ingredient for Jewish connections

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.990
and continuity, garnered an investment from
us of about 10 million dollars of annual funds

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.050
this year.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.259
Second, Israel and overseas.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:12.569
There we strengthened Democracy in Israel,
build bridges during a time of increasing

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:16.479
isolation, and care for Jews everywhere around
the world.

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:21.580
This is a time not to shy away from Israel's
complex issues, but to educate ourselves and

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.889
to find ways to help. We do this work by making
it possible to send as many kids as we can

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:34.110
on birthright trips; these are free trips
for young adults to Israel.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.760
By populating all of our Northern California
college campus-campuses with Shalichim, that

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.060
is young adults who come from Natan's organization,
Jafi, to work through our Hillels and by funding

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.260
disadvantaged youth and elderly in Israel.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:02.120
We also work on pluralism by creating leaders
in Israel who will strengthen tolerance in

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.920
Israeli society. This sector garnered an investment
last year of more than 4.3 million dollars.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.670
And finally, our third sector, creating a
caring community of Jews especially for those

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.310
who would be virtually invisible; those Jews
who live in poverty in the Bay Area, the former

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:27.180
Soviet Union, and in Israel; single parent
families, children with special needs, and

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.279
the elderly poor. In this sector, we also
invested 4.3 million dollars this year.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:38.740
And second, as I mentioned earlier, we are
really a center of philanthropy providing

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.300
donor involved solutions that are tax efficient;
provide great investments; and provide a staff

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:50.510
of experts to advise on the philanthropic
vision, mission, and values of each donor

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.860
and to research the world's charities so that
we can facilitate philanthropy to any public

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.080
charity one could imagine.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.450
We appreciate that in this era of globalization
and nearly complete Jewish integration, our

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.550
efforts to help anyone, anywhere in the world
are just as much our imperative as insuring

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.120
that the Jewish community is strong.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.890
The JCF enables the individual to leverage
his or her own dollars for good through collaboration

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:22.700
with us, with other funders, and with networks;
the leverage that comes from acting as an

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.410
interconnected group.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:31.140
The Jews as a people have always seen themselves
as a global people through time and space

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.760
just as many philanthropists have come to
view themselves as global in their orientation

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.700
through time and space.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.180
And so the Federation, as a community foundation,
construe the world in this way too. As a connector,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.750
a convener, a collaborator, and a leveraging
resource, we really do have something in common

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.750
with Google.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.970
I know it's a stretch, but we're trying.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.970
[laughter]

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.530
The message of the Federation is that each
and every one of us plays a vital role in

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.610
a collective that has the power to have enormous
impact on our community and on our world.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:13.079
In our own individual ways, acting on our
own values, thinking creatively, strategically,

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:18.380
and generously through an annual community
investment, through a donor advised fund,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:26.029
or through an endowed fund, we are part of
a powerful and generous interconnected community

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:31.450
We are all in this together to save lives,
to improve lives, and to transform lives.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:37.149
That's the power of our Federation community;
one that manages and stewards over one billion

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:43.360
dollars of assets and last year granted more
than 154 million dollars all over the world

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.550
from our annual fund, our 900 plus donor advised
funds, and our 70 foundations and endowed

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.550
funds.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:57.600
A thriving community needs many things: great
vision, financial investment, builders, sustainers,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.680
a thick web of connection, and heart.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.120
We are here to make sure that all of these
ingredients come together for joy, for meaning,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.490
for family, for continuity from generation
to generation.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:17.070
Please join me in welcoming Natan Sharansky,
our featured speaker today.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.740
[applause]

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.380
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Thank you.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.829
Well I'm very glad to be here and thank you
for my introduction where it was said that

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:33.720
we have something in common that I was implied
in the semantics that we follow with this

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720
parallel.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:43.910
In fact it was a more powerful parallel because
I, when I, when I was a school child in Soviet

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:49.500
Union the first Soviet computers appeared;
it was in the 60s.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:57.560
And the first computer that I was working
on was doing one hundred operations per second;

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:07.100
it was all on, built on radio bulbs; it was
before transistors; so these bulbs, so in

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.899
fact the speed of the computer was defined
with the speed with which you can replace

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:14.430
the bulbs because they were broken all the
time.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.430
[laughter]

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:21.529
And with this technology, then I went to one
of a very prestigious Soviet university became

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:28.630
a special in the department of medicine as
it was in my master degree that I invented

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:36.550
the first chess program, computer program
to play chess – Anspiel files; the Anspiel

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.610
chess games.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.660
It was then the first attempts of writing
such programs and Anspiel was especial difficult

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:51.261
because well the all the al-algorithms then
were based on your analyzing the tree of all

00:13:51.261 --> 00:14:00.190
possible developments and then you compare
them, or you have to count up to them, what

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.270
was then simply impossible or you have to
have some kind of comparison based on some

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:11.500
criterias. And at the end of the game, those
who know chess it is, was especially difficult.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:18.120
And so I created the semantical program which
was dealing with artificial intellect which

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.949
tried not only to have formal comparison but
tried to have some logical the battle; how

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:29.800
you building strategy; go from the beginning
to the end then you go from the end to the

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.610
beginning and then again I will not into the
details, but really I tried to simulate the

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.460
building of the strategy by in a, in a logical
way.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.840
And I was very proud of it. It was written
on the first time you have this end game.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.519
And then I was arrested and I spent nine years
in prison and when I was released though I

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:51.360
while in prison and punishing and in solitary
confinement, I had a lot of experience of

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.640
playing chess in my head with myself and I
won all these games --

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640
[laughter]

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.850
but here I didn't an ability to improve my
what was computer program so though, after

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.750
nine years that I was in prison, four generations
of computers were born and died.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:15.240
So I went into the absolute new world; it
was just, there were personal computers, it

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.180
was absolute different there. So I assumed
there was no way that I can compete and all

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:24.839
my powerful program already had no meaning
because it appeared a few years after this

00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:31.139
real powerful search engines like Google which
denied all what I was doing. In fact they

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.630
simply ignored all this. [chuckles]

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.630
[laughter]

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.390
And-and so I decided there is, that I really
have to change my profession so I didn't go

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:44.250
back [ ] and simply enjoying them as a client
of Google and these great things that you

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.279
are doing.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.910
Now the second thing which I wanted to say
and I am glad that it was said in the beginning,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:57.610
in fact I was very pleased, I tried to send
my personal appreciation to the head of Google

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:03.180
who worked for the position that you took
in China. Because the one who spent a lot

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:09.580
of years in struggling for freedom and democracy
and then in the last years trying to build

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.970
international support of democratic dissidents
all over the world.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.060
I organized big international conference of
democratic dissidents you will see Garry Kasparov

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:26.199
just saw one of my good friends, but people
like him acting in China, in Egypt, in Syria,

00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:32.279
and many other countries. And I know from
my experience and their experience how international

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:39.740
solidarity is important and how betraying
is the behavior of those people in the free

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.079
world who are ready to cooperate with all
the dictators of the world only to have their

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:48.440
business. And all those explanations if you
will not do it, somebody else will do it.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.740
And about China, I've heard it from many businessmen.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.970
And it was also very upsetting to see how
this great weapon of freedom which was invented.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.320
In our times when we were dissidents in the
former Soviet Union there were no CNN and

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:11.110
no Internet and it was so easy to authorities
to cut us from all the world. It was so difficult

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:18.010
to bring information to the, to the citizens
of the Soviet Union which we were doing through

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.510
in a very difficult ways through foreign radio
stations by risking the lives of many people.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.300
And here we have Internet; here we have such
powerful weapon and which is used if you know

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.039
Iranian dissidents it was one of their main
weapons.

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:39.210
So and then this Internet is used by secret
police to dis, to-to discover their political

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:44.210
opinions and to repress them. That was very
painful and disappointing. And so I'm very

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:53.010
glad that Google became pioneer in this field
and I can only hope that in spite of many,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:18:01.430
many business, businessmen who think that-that
making business is the best contribution to

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:06.230
peace and that well let's ignore all this
moral restrictions that in fact the example

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:12.500
Google will be broadened, supported, and that's
something extremely important. And for this

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:19.610
you-you deserve a lot of credit in addition
to the fact that you invented search engine

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.070
which destroyed all my theories which I was
building before --

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.070
[laughter]

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.140
I went to prison.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.140
Okay.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.730
Now let's talk about the topic that I really
feel myself; special statement and that's

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.730
 ?

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.730
[pause]

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.740
freedom fighting against dictatorship, and
what is the source of the power which they

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740
are getting.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.750
And the, I, based mainly on my personal experience.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:50.980
Well I see for good and for bad most of you
are so young that you have no idea what in

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.100
the world is Communism.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:04.120
But there was a regime which technically was-was
taking one-sixth part of the earth; political

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.919
was controlling one-third of the earth; physically
it was a regime which controlled 200 million

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:14.490
people of the, citizens of the former Soviet
Union.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:22.190
And it was controlling not only their-their
physical life, but their minds. In fact, the

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:27.270
regime which ideologically in the beginning
of the 20th century came with idea that now

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.910
we are creating society of equal people, that
everybody's equal; there is no exploitation

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:37.230
of one or the other. But in order they will
be absolutely, completely equal there should

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.090
be no differences. And that's why they should
have no property; all the property will be

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.750
taken by the State and State will decide how
to distribute the property.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:52.230
And there will no national or religious differences.
And that's why we will destroy nationalism;

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:58.549
we will destroy religion. Everybody has to
be loyal to our idea-ideology and not to anything

00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:59.549
else.

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:04.290
And because the nature of the people was resistant
to this, so they in the beginning as Lenin

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:11.340
wrote, if you will have to kill bunch of capitalists
who are preventing us from having society

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.070
where everybody will be equal, so we will
have to kill them.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.559
So they start killing from hundreds and then
thousands, and tens of thousands, hundreds

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.419
of thousands, tens-tens of millions.

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:26.770
Then now historians are discussing whether
the number of victims of this regime of their

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:32.600
own citizens was 20 million or 30 million
or 40 million; so really even difficult to-to

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
appreciate.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.600
But that was the result of this attempt to
create society where there is no, everybody's

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.679
equal.

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:46.020
As a result I am, I was already the second
if not the third generation of absolutely

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:52.830
assimilated Soviet Jews. And when I was assimilated,
I lived in the big city in the Ukraine with

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:58.950
half a million population with at least 50,000
Jews and they knew nothing about my history,

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.960
about my holidays, about my tradition, about
anything.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.200
More than this, I was born few years after
Holocaust in the places where hundreds of

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.679
thousands of my people and also many of my
relatives were killed and we grew knowing

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:18.640
nothing about Holocaust. We knew of course
about great victory of Soviet Union over Hitler,

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:25.140
but the fact that there were millions killed
only for being Jewish, we didn't know. It

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:32.059
was deprived from our knowledge; it was deliberately
done in order not to do anything which can

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:40.560
give us kind of all national pride, all national
desire or whatever.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.020
And the same time we knew where it was that
we were Jewish, why? Because it is written

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.980
in the idea of your parents and there is a
lot of anti-Semitism; lot of restrictions;

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.179
all the discussion told us what is possible
not what was not possible to do.

00:21:53.179 --> 00:22:00.059
And as a result, the message which we are
getting from our parents is that because you

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:07.840
are Jews, you must be the best in physics
or in the semantics or in chess or in music,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.530
it doesn't matter in what. But you must be
the best in your profession. That's why, that's

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:20.670
you can go to this tower of science or what
and maybe then you'll be protected as Jews;

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.720
maybe you'll suffer less.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:31.320
And that was the idea how to survive, to become
good specialists and how to survive.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.460
And then we totally were deprived of identity,
but we also were deprived of freedom. It was

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.309
clear for us from our childhood that we live
under dictatorship.

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:45.720
The, I always tell the story when I became
loyal citizen simply-simply because it's,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:52.400
shows in one short story, it shows immediately
what was the state of mind of Soviet people.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.420
I was five years old when Stalin died. Though
you are young, but probably you know who was

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420
Stalin.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.930
And so when Stalin died, I came home from
kindergarten and my, and we lived then in

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:10.950
communal apartment: three, four, five families
in one apartment with one kitchen, with one

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.950
toilet, and so on.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:20.010
And father making sure that neighbors don't
hear told me that Stalin was awful man; he

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:25.970
killed a lot of people; we Jews we are in
big danger, but now we are saved and I should

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.900
remember all my life that miracle happened,
Stalin died. But he said don't tell it to

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.190
anybody. Do what everybody does and next day
go to kindergarten and there in the kindergarten

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:42.710
I cried together with all children because
Stalin died and I sing song how grateful we

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:47.480
are to the great leader of all the people,
Stalin, who gave us such a happy childhood

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.210
that was the [ ] of the song.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.420
So I sing it; I cry; and I remember miracle
happened I should be very happy Stalin died.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.420
[laughter]

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:02.230
That is typical state of mind of loyal Soviet
citizen. It's double think. You don't believe

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:10.110
in this regime and with time every dictator
in the regime as I later tried to show in

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.670
my books every dictatorial regime the number
of double thinkers is growing with the time.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:20.070
So they are not already true believers they
are double thinkers, but they're not dissidents.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:25.029
Because dissidents are those who are crossing
this line and who are ready to risk their

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:26.029
life.

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:30.410
But to think that people cross this line and
would become dissidents, what, why to risk

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.150
a life; there is no value in this life. The
only value is how to survive; how to become

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.159
good specialists and then work in your ivory
tower and that's it. And of course you feel

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:45.370
yourself very uncomfortable; you don't have
any strength to fight against it.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:52.850
So I was deprived of freedom, and over identity.
And I had no force to struggle for anything.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:58.159
When it all changed. Two events happened,
very important.

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:04.950
One was in 1967 Israel emerged victorious
against its neighbors who wanted to destroy

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:09.410
Israel. And for Soviet Union, that was a very
big humiliation, very big humiliation. And

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.720
because Soviet Union sent a lot of money and
lot of soldiers in fact, a lot of weapons

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.840
to Syria to, and to Egypt and already started
celebrating the victory.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:29.299
And so suddenly, it's all changed and you
see how for the people around you they are

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:33.090
changing their attitude to you; those who
like you, those who hate you.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:38.740
But they connected with Israel that even anti-Semitic
jokes and there was every day, there was another

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.740
anti-Semitic joke there about different Jews.
Yesterday they were about Jews who are cowards

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.600
and who want to take money off somebody. Today
they are about Jews who are hooligans, who

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.280
are fighting, who are beating the others.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.150
So you understand that for these people somehow,
you're connected to Israel and you want to

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.570
understand this connection. And you start
reading in the underground because there is

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:08.050
no way to read it publicly. From the books
which are brought mainly by tourists, American

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.380
Jews and not only American -- tourists.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.961
And you discover there is great history which
starts from exodus from Egypt and it's so

00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:20.830
easy to feel yourself part of that exodus
and which continues with the Exodus of Leon

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:26.820
Uris. And Leon Uris, if you read today it's
Bubba Meisah. It's interesting but whether

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.289
it's true or not.

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:34.210
But then it was such a powerful discovery
that people of our age can be part of this

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.400
great history.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.610
And so suddenly discover this great history
and you discover there are Jews who are all

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:46.059
over world who feel solidarity with you. And
you feel stronger; you want to part of this

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:51.420
history. And that what starts giving you this
feeling that there are things more important

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:57.370
than your physical survival. And that what
will, what will become the big source of strength

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.120
for me to fight for my rights, for rights
of other Jews, and for the rights of many

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120
non-Jews.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.289
And there was another important event. Another
important event is the letter -- Andrei Sokolov.

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:15.550
Andrei Sokolov who at the time became a great
friend, my great leader, I would say my great

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.640
rabbi but he was not Jewish so he could not
be rabbi.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.640
[laughter]

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.740
But-but that is, that was scientist number
one of the Soviet Union. There was nobody

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:36.010
even close to him. He was the father of hydrogen
bomb; he was the great, made great discoveries

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:42.210
in theoretical and experimental physics. From
the age of 29 he not only was the member of

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:47.870
academia but he had all the top Soviet awards.
There was nobody even close in com-compared

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.870
to him.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.880
And this man ?

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.420
[pause]

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:59.130
published a letter; in-- it was 1968. Published
a letter to the Soviet leaders where he writes

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:05.919
that if Soviet leaders will not permit freedom
of thought for their citizens there is no

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:11.161
chance that Soviet Union will be a superpower;
because the best physics in the world, the

00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:17.750
best mathematics in the world, the best talents,
but it-it will mean nothing if you're not

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.200
giving the freedom of discussion, the freedom
of thought to-to our citizens.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:29.700
Of course they immediately changed his status;
he immediately became a dissident and he lost

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.250
all his privilege in this society.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:38.220
But what it meant for me, I thought, "Look
I am trying to find the way into this castle

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:45.549
of science as a young scientist with my funny
programs in chess and in computers and I hope

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:51.480
to find the piece to my course." Here is a
person who's already on the top. He is at

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.799
the top of this ivory tower; nobody can be
higher than him.

00:28:56.799 --> 00:29:02.860
And he feel that he cannot continue this life
of double think that we all have. That he

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.710
has to say the truth and he has to demand
the truth. And so that had tremendously powerful

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:13.890
influence on me. I understood that all these
attempts to find peace of mind by hiding in

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.280
the world of science impossible.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:22.490
So on one hand, this understanding that it
is impossible to adjust yourself because you

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:28.200
have freedom of thought, and freedom of consciousness,
freedom of will. On the other hand, I discovered

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.860
my identity which gives me a lot of strength;
the strength to start fighting.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.409
In the beginning all if I did was say publicly,
"I really don't want to live in this country

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:43.630
I want to leave this country." But that's,
that's -- the moment you said it you already

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:49.590
crossed the line. You're-you're apart, you
will lose your job, your apartment will be

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:55.120
searched, your, you will be called for interrogations,
many of your friends will ask you to take

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.260
their names from your telephone book because
they don't want to be, to have problems with

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.890
the secret police.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:07.340
But you, but from this moment you stop having
this double life, double life which you started

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:11.380
in the age of five from the death of Stalin
and which you continue to this day.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.520
And then you-you have enough strength to start
fighting for your right to immigrate and then

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.370
for the rights of the other people.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:25.910
It's a moment I became the unofficial spokesman
of two movements: Soviet Jewry Movement and

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.240
human rights movement of the Soviet Union;
and was very actively working with Andrei

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.250
Sokolov and the other dissidents.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:38.210
And at the same time I was very active in
the struggle of Soviet Jews to leave as Jews

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.440
and to go to Israel or to other places.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:47.340
And I got to say that I remember there were
people on both sides who were telling me that

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:53.770
I cannot continue in this. That you really
have to choose or you are Nationalist or you

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:59.470
are Universalist, or you are for the rights
of that small tribe, small family which is

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.630
called Jews, or you are for the human rights
of all the world.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:10.090
And I have to say I-I never felt that I have
to choose. Not only because I enjoyed being

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:15.130
in both of these movements, I really enjoyed
fighting the regime being in both these movement.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.130
[laughter]

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:22.399
But-but because I felt there is deep connection;
that in order you have the strength to fight

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:28.669
for freedom of all the mankind, you must have
things which are more important for you than

00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:30.070
your physical survival.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:38.320
You must have your identity; your desire to
belong is -- that is the source of power to-to

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.919
meet your desire to-to be free.

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:45.269
And I believe these are two basic desires
of people: to belong and to be free. And only

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:48.519
when they are connected together you can have
great results.

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:54.750
And this, from this point, our experience
was to some extent opposite to experience

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.080
of our grandfathers of those of our grandfathers
who joined Communist Revolution. Because what

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:05.840
was the idea of Communist Revolution? The
idea of them many Jews decided at that moment

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:14.010
finally we don't have to think only about
our small tribe; about our shtetl. We can

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:19.460
finally fight with a great ideal of equality
and freedom for all the world; the big people

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.460
of humanity.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:27.360
And those who believed in it they helped to
create one of the most awful regimes in-in

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.649
the history which killed tens of millions
of its citizens including all those naive

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:34.179
idealists who joined the Revolution.

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:40.360
For this one to be, went in the opposite direction.
We went back to our schtetl, to our tribe,

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:47.610
to our people, to our language, to our history.
And there we found strength to fight for the,

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.059
for the better for all the world.

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:56.769
I can tell you that not only in my dissident
activity but in prison my best friends were

00:32:56.769 --> 00:33:04.240
people with strong identities. Why, because
in prison you-you-you can never know who is

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.410
the real and who is not. Because KGB succeeded
to create it was to feel it among two hundred

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.380
million people; nobody knows who is informer,
who is not.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.750
But in prison, where they -- KGB decide with
who you will be in one cell of course they

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.830
can decide, you-you suspect everybody.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:31.159
And what you find out that the bet-best way
to-to-to know something about person if this

00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:38.820
person has strong identity of his or her own.
If this person has things for which he is

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.220
ready to die for.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:46.720
My closest friend was religious, Christian
activist who was persecuted for-for teaching

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:54.220
Christianity to-to-to the, he actually himself
was young, but for the young people.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.399
And in the prison, he was ready to die for
his views but not to cooperate with KGB.

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:03.870
So you could know that because for you, there
are things which are more important than your

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.810
physical survival and when they-they threatened
me with death sentence, you know that you

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.540
really don't want to cooperate with them because
you want to remain free and you became free

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.149
only when you found your own world.

00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:24.079
So the-the same is to other people. That's
why Pentecostals and Ukrainian Nationals and

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:30.109
Armenian dissidents they were my best friends
because I knew that I can rely on them as

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:32.149
they can rely on me.

00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:39.720
So this connection between freedom and identity
was very powerfully seen there.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:48.230
Now the free world, we could never survive
in our struggle in one day if from the very

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.960
first day it didn't become the struggle of
all the Jews of the world and then also all

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.090
the free people of the world.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.090
Because if we were organizing small demonstrations:
five people, for five minutes, standing in

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:59.870
the Center of Moscow. Why, because you couldn't
have more than five people because then KGB

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.880
will know at once and there'll be no demonstration.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:10.740
You couldn't, even if KGB does know in advance
it -- you cannot stand with a slogan, "Freedom

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:22.060
to political prisoners," in the center of
Moscow more than five minutes be-before you're

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060
arrested.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.640
And then your partners, establish partnership
by years of prison and you get asked, "So

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.780
what is the sense of this stupid demonstration
for five minutes of pleasure or standing in

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.850
the center of Moscow, you're getting five
years of prison?"

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.220
But the thing is that it was organized well;
that was one-one of my obligations. Meaning

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:43.660
that at least one foreign journalist knows
in advance and he will come and he will inform;

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.880
and there is no Internet, there was no CNN,
but in the evening on BBC or Voice of America,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.320
or Radio Liberty it will be broadcasted that
five Jews went on demonstration.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.970
Next day they'll be hundreds of thousands
of Jews who will go on demonstrations; really

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.400
physically hundreds of thousands of Jews.
They will write to their senators and congressman;

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.440
they'll demand from the State Department to
protest. The Soviet ambassadors will be called

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.250
in down in street in-in Paris and in Washington,
demand.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:17.260
American legislators will pass, they pass
special legislation connecting freedom of

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:22.070
immigration with all the trade interests of
the former Soviet Union.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.800
And that is how the struggle was built.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:31.320
KGB when we were there for a year and half
and they were interrogating me and threatening

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.520
me and so they were saying, "What are you
building your hopes on? Look who you're supporting

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.510
you; they are a bunch of students and housewives.
And we are KGB."

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.420
And they-they give good, great, gave great
definition about it. Nine years later when

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.710
I was released I went from one community to
the other to thank you, the army of students

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:52.380
and housewives because for 20 years this army
of students and housewives was fighting and

00:36:52.380 --> 00:37:00.329
didn't let Soviet Union even one day of peace.
And they mobilized, of course, all the leaders

00:37:00.329 --> 00:37:01.329
of the world.

00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:05.820
And they were Father Drinan, too young to-to
remember there was such member of K'nesset,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:13.830
member of, congressman in America, Christian,
Catholic, Father Drinan who left -- the Pope

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:18.460
demanded for him to resign because he said
the that Catholic leader cannot be member

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.369
of congress so unfortunately he left, he resigned.

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:25.140
But he was the leader who mobilized millions
of Christians for in support of Soviet dissidents.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.390
There were many others.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:33.960
By the way, we are still close to Stanford
 -- Google didn't exist then. But standard

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.500
universities, Stanford University existed.
Stanford University became the center of all

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.290
of the gold Nobel Prize winners to fight for
the freedom of Soviet Jews and Soviet dissidents.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:49.930
There was an organization Source organized
in Stanford University —Save Aharon Sharans.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.839
In fact it was big scientists of the world
united to-to for the freedom of Soviet democratic

00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:53.839
dissidents.

00:37:53.839 --> 00:38:03.369
And I have to say that it was not easy to
struggle not only because of KGB, but because

00:38:03.369 --> 00:38:09.730
many people in the free world believed that
Soviet Union is forever; it will never change;

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.640
and we have to know how to live in peace with
the Soviet Union.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.370
And that's why they were saying, "Trade is
better than, when we have trade there is no-no

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.440
wars. So let us have trade with them."

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:28.470
Here Senator Jackson comes with the amendment
to connect all the trade agreements of United

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.720
States of America with the creation of freedom
in Soviet Union.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:38.140
And even businessmen and President, then it
was Nixon, speak against it. They speak that

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:44.241
we don't want these restrictions. We cannot
dictate to Soviet Union what-what is freedom;

00:38:44.241 --> 00:38:49.210
they have their own principles but we want
to live in peace with them.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:54.450
And we, and Andrei Sokolov was very good with
them and he had to explain again and again

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.230
to the free world that the only way that there
will be stability and peace is if it will

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.369
support Soviet dissidents.

00:38:59.369 --> 00:39:06.760
As long as it is a totalitarian regime, it
will need you as the enemy. So they will have

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.849
trade with you, but they will build everything
so their own people will hate you because

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:15.190
otherwise this regime cannot survive. And
that was a big battle.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.880
And that's why I say that what Google is doing
now is so important.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.320
Some days ago I published an article in support
of Nobel Prize Committee which gave the Nobel

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.910
Prize to Chinese dissident in prison.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:36.430
And again if you know immediately after this
there was again voices the West, what it has

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.079
to do with peace? Why-why tell it to Chinese
people what to do?

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:44.540
And I -- that article I went back to the logic
was dissidents of the Soviet Union explaining

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:51.329
why for the security of United State of America,
it is very important what is happening with

00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:53.680
human rights there in-in China.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.810
So I want to say that that is in fact one
battle; one battle which continues; there

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:06.329
is no borders in this battle. There must be
people for whom physical survival is not the

00:40:06.329 --> 00:40:14.650
most important thing; who have principles,
identity for which they are ready to-to-to

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.940
sacrifice everything, and who believe in freedom.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.450
And these people have to be supported by all
the free world and that is the only way to

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:26.670
guarantee freedom and stability in the world.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:31.910
Well I say it in about, in about 10 minutes
all my three books are about it so those of

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:37.810
us who want to dissent why it is better, please
go to Google find my three-three books.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:46.030
One is about my experience in Soviet prison,
another is about the case for democracy, and

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.030
the third is about defending identity.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:56.690
So it's all these topics together today, then
I was in Israeli governments when Prime Minister

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:02.089
Netanyahu proposed me again to go to politics,
I said, "No-no I was nine years in prison.

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:05.540
I was nine years in these early politics.
I think I have good balance.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540
[laughter]

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.540
I really don't want."

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.840
He asked whether I want to be in the government.
I told him, "Look, I was in four different

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.760
Israel governments and that why I resigned."

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.380
In comparison, I was in four different prisons
and never resigned. They asked me many times

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.089
to sign letter to resign and I refused to
resign.

00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:21.089
So probably something wrong.

00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:25.350
And then he said, "So what you want?" I said,
"I want to be chairman of The Jewish Agency."

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.771
That's why I'm the chairman of Jewish Agency.

00:41:27.771 --> 00:41:33.630
Jewish Agency is unique organization which
tries, which is global table of Jewish people

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:39.370
and the Israeli government which tries to
connect between Israel and Jewish communities

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.680
all over the world.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.560
And I know the power of this connection; I
know how this connection inspired us and gave

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.750
us strength to fight for freedom and I know
that it is also true today.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:56.240
So thank you for inviting me. I'm glad to
be here and see that in two days from now

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.010
there will be a Garry Kasparov speaking. My
great friend the last, in the last, when I

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:07.700
gave him my last book I wrote there, "To Dissident
Kasparov from Chess Player Sharansky," –

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.700
[laughter]

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.170
'cause so the life has very interesting twists.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.339
I am very glad that you are a place which
attracts leading democratic dissidents. They

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:23.010
need your support. You have a very powerful
weapon in your hands which gives opportunity

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.380
to make dissemination information much easier,
unbelievably easier.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:33.140
But what the biggest problem was, was how
to reach Soviet people in the Soviet Union

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:39.069
with our truth, and today you have this weapon
which also can be used by our enemies.

00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:43.569
So don't let it [ ] our enemies and keep supporting
freedom of the world.

00:42:43.569 --> 00:42:44.569
Thank you.

00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:46.819
[applause]

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:54.500
So, if-if you have any questions, I'll be
glad to answer.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.500
Yeah, please.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you very much for coming.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.880
It must have been very hard along the way;
you must have had doubts. How –

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.220
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Um, um.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.720
&gt;&gt;female #1: [unintelligible]

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.760
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: I can amplify it up here.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.294
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you very much for coming.

00:43:12.294 --> 00:43:14.510
You must have had doubts along the way. How
did you maintain your focus and your ability

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:23.069
to com-continue going on despite how hard
it was? You must have along the line thought

00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:24.069
it wasn't worth it.

00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:25.069
[pause]

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:30.400
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Well, that's an interesting
question. I recommend you to read my three

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.530
books about this. [chuckles]

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.530
[laughter]

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.810
But-but briefly I'll tell you.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.880
[pause]

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.770
It's true that it was a long and difficult
way and I think if in the beginning before

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:48.329
I made my first step somebody would tell me,
"That if you'll do it, you'll go to prison

00:43:48.329 --> 00:43:52.550
and you can be sentenced to death. You'll
be accused in high treason and you will be

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.880
405 days in the punishment cell, and you will
be five years in solitary confinement, and

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.140
you'll be this, this, this" probably then
I would not do it. Probably, I don't know.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.140
[laughter]

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.510
But it's doesn't go this way. It goes step
by step.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:12.450
First, you feel yourself enslaved. Then you
discover the power of identity, and it gives

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:18.180
you a lot of big desire to belong to this
history and to these people. Then you discover

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.589
the power of freedom. You start saying your
mind; speaking your mind.

00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:27.040
And it is such a powerful state of mind; you-you
really don't want to go back.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.710
And then you're becoming part of the struggle
which becomes very important. And you really

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.730
feel yourself part of some important historical
struggle.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:42.990
And then in prison, where they start proposing
you different types of compromises: big compromises

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:49.990
and small compromises. And you know you're,
the moment you start making their compromises,

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.960
you will lose this freedom. You really feel
yourself even in prison, you feel yourself

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.740
free person and there you are slave. You don't
want to go back.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:02.010
And that of course then there is a question
of how you keep it every day. For example,

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.390
especially I was 405 days in punishment cell.
Punishment cell, by their law, you're not

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:12.329
supposed to be more than 15 days because you
can become crazy. It's very cold, very dark,

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:17.940
three pieces of bread, three cups of water,
nobody to talk to. You are supposed to become

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.940
crazy simply.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:24.550
And officially it is to no more than 15 days.
I was kept 405 days there.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:30.069
So first of all, every day you have to remind
yourself how important you are; that it, that

00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:34.359
it, that you are part of that great history
and one word of you can influence and everything.

00:45:34.359 --> 00:45:39.290
They tried to convince me that there was Galileo
Galilei such a great scientist and he cooperated

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:44.060
with inquisition. So who you are not to do
it? Be clear – it was Galilei.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:50.260
And I was thinking, "If Galileo Galilei cooperated
with inquisition and 400 years after this

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.329
they are using it, the inquisition, using
it against me, so if I'll make any compromise

00:45:55.329 --> 00:45:59.170
for them 400 years after this, somebody will
be using it." That's how we think.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:01.980
So first of all you have to self-aggrandize
yourself.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:02.980
[laughter]

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:08.349
On the other hand, you have to understand
that nothing is serious. You have to be able,

00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:13.930
to be able to laugh at everything. And it's
such an idiotic organization, this KGB.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.990
And it is so easy to make laugh of them and
you're making all this jovial, you're telling

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.369
to these KGB people anti-Soviet jokes. There
was a lot of anti-Soviet jokes which of course

00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:22.710
we were told one, one.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:28.921
And here telling them some joke about Brezhnev
and it's so funny that you, you speak and

00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:33.330
you laugh. And you see that they are almost
exploding from desire to laugh but they cannot

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.380
laugh. They will lose their job –

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.380
[laughter]

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.380
one place or the other.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:40.500
And I tell them, "And you want to say that
I'm in prison. You cannot even laugh when

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.140
you want to laugh. And you want me to be like
you."

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.510
So you're laughing while all of this [ ].

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:52.869
The third thing is you have to use your brains.
As I said, I had great hobby, chess; absolutely

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:59.349
great. I at the age of 12 I thought I'll be
world champion and then at 14 I understood

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:09.170
I cannot be such a [ ], number one and number
two I was not interested so I went to look

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:10.470
where I can be number one and it was prison.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.470
So –

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.470
[laughter]

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:22.300
so, but I was playing single ten years games
and went and so I didn't know for what I am

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.300
doing it.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:28.820
In prison it became sense. In punishment cell
I played thousands of games in my head. I

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.820
won all of them.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.820
[laughter]

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.820
I, each game next day I'm improving the previous
result because then they black horse so now

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:37.750
I'll play this option for the black and I
improve it and so instead of being degr-degradating

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.750
intellectually I becoming better and better.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:46.329
And the final, most important thing my great
other hobby was singing. And I enjoyed singing,

00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:51.100
but the moment I start singing in the Kindergarten
the nanny says, "And you wait, you will sing

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.000
after." Because people really didn't like
what I was singing; I was destroying every

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.510
one melody. And they tried in school and summer
camp and everywhere people say, "No, please

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:00.510
don't, don't, don’t."

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.510
[laughter]

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.510
So finally in the punishment cell I understood
that is the moment which nanny promised that

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.910
you will sing light.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:07.910
[laughter]

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:13.080
So in political prison where must be silence
like in grave because you are not supposed

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:18.070
to say, you are not supposed to know what's
happening, who else is in prison.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:23.340
So I say here, "I have nothing to lose. I'm
already 400 days in punishment cell; five

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.579
years in solitary confinement."

00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:29.839
I sing with all the power of my lungs something
very Zionist, very good. And they become crazy.

00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:35.540
First of all they don't understand what I'm
saying in Hebrew. And second they don't enjoy

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.540
my singing.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.540
[laughter]

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:44.190
And so it-it's such a pleasure. And so that's
how I sang for nine years, okay?

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:45.190
[laughter]

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.190
[pause]

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:47.190
[applause]

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:54.010
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you
again for coming and both for Googlers and-and

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.150
in honor of my father who spent the war in
Ukraine and Russia. And anyway, but thanks

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.150
for being here.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.210
I have a question. I just recently read the
book, "Bargaining with the Devil", which has

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:08.450
a chapter about you. And he discusses the
fact that I guess you were offered the ability

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:13.930
to leave prison at any time you wanted to,
you'd have to sign something, but you could

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.990
renounce it as soon as you left the Soviet
Union and you would have been a free man.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:25.569
And yet your decision was not to, not to bargain
with the devil; not to sign those papers.

00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:26.569
Could you discuss the-the rationale behind
that?

00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:31.530
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharanshy: Yeah, well again it's-it's
really it's deep one and important question.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:37.030
And my first book, Fear No Evil, half of this
book is exactly about this why not to bargain

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.920
with devil. Why-why.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:45.970
Let me give you all only episode because that
can-can give you a flavor of why it is also

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.430
important today.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:52.180
Yes it is true that during interrogation they
were in fact hinting and even more than hinting

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.200
they're saying that, "Become a man. Say that
we are right; you are wrong. You're so young.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.960
You're a great scientist," they were saying.
"You're so bright. You have such a beautiful

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.190
wife." An insult, that was true.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.190
[laughter]

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:08.630
"So and you are ready to sacrifice all this
for what? For some views." And I felt very

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.410
strongly that the moment I do it I lose my
freedom.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:17.550
And that I betray all that ideas from which
I came.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:22.859
At some moment in prison already I was for
few years in prison, and I was on the long

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:28.200
hunger strike, hunger strike which continued
110 days where they were not letting me write

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.760
letters and then they gave up.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.300
There was big pressure all over the world:
President Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Mitterand;

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.849
everybody was demanding from Soviet Union
to release me.

00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:43.410
And finally they gave up and let me write
letters. And they denies me the meeting with

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:51.710
my mother and I had, in nine years I had two
meeting. And she tells me later on that it

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.920
was the end of Madrid Conference, Madrid Conference
was a continuation of Helsinki process, and

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:05.090
there Americans put a condition that they
will not sign this agreement without my release.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:11.911
And the Russians agreed that if I will sign
the letter they will write that because I

00:51:11.911 --> 00:51:20.809
have, I am in bad health after hunger strike
and they asked Soviet Union to show human-humanism

00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:23.079
and to release me, I will be released.

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:26.330
And Americans were in rapture; American two
leaders that were American delegation and

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:32.410
I don't want to mention their names, they
are very respectable and good people. They-they

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:38.000
rushed to my wife who was leading campaign
for my release and they said that they got

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.589
great agreement. Russians don't demand for
me to-to say that-that I'm criminal, don't

00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:48.990
demand to me that they are right or wrong.
They only ask be human, I am a poor ill Jew,

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:53.340
release me please. And I will be released.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.660
And they thought it big victory.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.520
I will tell my wife, "Tell them it's bull.
There is no chance that my husband will do

00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520
it."

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:05.609
They were so furious. They said, "We reached
such an agreement so you have to do everything

00:52:05.609 --> 00:52:07.270
to convince them, him."

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:14.040
Well my mother comes to the, they give her
special meeting in order she will tell me

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.040
conditions.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.670
And she said, "that some dissidents think
that you can do it." I said, "I'm sure that

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:25.990
my wife didn't say it." Mother said, "No,
my wife, your wi, Avital said that she leaves

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.990
it to you."

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.920
And then mother said what was-was very difficult
for her. She was 75 years old; she was a big

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.920
fighter; she wanted me very much to be out
and she said, "And I am not telling you what

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.609
to do. We leave it to you." And I said, "I
don't have even to think for a moment. There

00:52:39.609 --> 00:52:45.910
is no way that I'll sign it. There is no way
that I will give them any legitimacy to-to-to

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:52.870
what they did. If they want to release me
they don't, they don't need my letters. But

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:58.570
they want this letter in order to give some
kind of legitimacy to what they were doing."

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:05.520
And so I have say to this day some American
officials believe that because of some radical

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:11.990
views I betrayed them; President Reagan was
okay, he was okay. He continued his struggle.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:18.750
But I say that then, in this clear moment
of confrontation you really feel and see it

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:26.700
very clearly that any moral compromise which
will give legitimacy to their right is strenthening

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:32.420
them and weakening in fact all this time which
you had. After all these years that you already

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:38.819
put it this moral plan so high and they had
such desperation they really feel themselves

00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:40.490
pressed; they cannot decrease the pressure.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:48.319
And I want to say that who knows if they decrease
the pressure then if our moral [ ] could be

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:52.310
weakened, if the world would stop pressure
with Soviet Union; maybe Soviet Union would

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:53.950
have exist until this day.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:54:01.290
But only because some moment is becomes uncompromised
moral struggle and Soviet Union then has to

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.319
make some concessions that what they-they,
I was released, other political prisoners

00:54:05.319 --> 00:54:10.270
was released, and then the moment regime is,
has less control, it simply fell apart; exactly

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:11.940
as are we are predicting.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:18.550
So I-I believe that at some moment when you're
dealing with evil, if you really want that

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:24.180
this evil will disappear, you cannot make
a moral compromise with them.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.180
Thank you.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.180
[pause]

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:32.230
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi. Thank you again for coming
to speak to us today. It was a really interesting

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.230
talk.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:38.829
And one of the points that you had mentioned
was about the story of identity and kind of

00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:43.911
freedom fighting and kind of wearing the dual
hats of both fighting for freedom for the

00:54:43.911 --> 00:54:47.500
Jewry as well as for universally.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.401
So I was curious you-you've been a member
of Parliament and Cabinet for a few years,

00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:59.369
kind of what is your outlook of the Palestinian
struggle for freedom? And how Israel is going

00:54:59.369 --> 00:55:01.010
to make that happen?

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:04.660
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Well for this, you have
to read my second book,

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:05.660
[laughter]

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.910
"The Case for Democracy".

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:10.589
But okay I'll tell you.

00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:11.589
[pause]

00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:16.700
I'm not big believer in the so called peace
process. The reason for this is very simple,

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:21.819
because all the peace process, at least until
the-the very recent times, was absolutely

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:27.170
disconnected from the question of democratic
reforms.

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:34.010
As a result from the very beginning we were,
in '93, I don't know if you were born, but

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:35.010
in '93 –

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.010
[laughter]

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:42.059
was-was-was signed, was signed Oslo Agreement.
And-and when we took Yasser Arafat who before

00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:48.790
this was world renowned terrorist and gave
him legitimacy it brought him to Palestine.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:55.339
And our Prime Minister then one week after
they sign an agreement said, "It is very good

00:55:55.339 --> 00:56:01.850
that Yasser Arafat is a dictator and not democrat.
Because as a dictator who is not restricted

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:08.780
by human rights, Supreme Court, and heart
bleeding liberals," I quote, "he will fight

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.049
Hamas much better than we can do it."

00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:16.970
That's when I wrote my first article against.
I wrote, "We will do everything to strengthen

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:22.390
him as a dictator, and he is a dictator in
order to survive. We'll do everything that

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:26.869
Palestinians will hate us because otherwise
he cannot really control his own people. And

00:56:26.869 --> 00:56:32.310
that it should be our interests that he will
be controlled by Supreme Court, by his Supreme

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:37.750
Court, by his human rights organizations,
and by real heart bleeding liberals or free

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:41.990
press whatever was of them."

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:48.250
And well we know historically how, who won
in this battle; Arafat won; Hamas-Hamas won.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:55.970
And so I-I do have friend, first of all I
do believe in peace in Palestinian democratic

00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:03.500
state. I don't believe that our efforts, and
I said it to Clinton, I said it to Bush, I

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:07.549
said it to all our governments, and I unfortunately
I was dissident of this.

00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:14.940
I said, "I don't believe that our attempts
to build peace with dictators ignoring the

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:20.329
real needs of Palestinians can bring stability."

00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:26.170
And unfortunately each time when we were doing
this it happened to be right.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:32.150
Now I do have friends, Palestinians who are
real democrats. But each time when I was trying

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:38.960
to bring them to the corridors of power in
Jerusalem, in Washington, or in Europe, the

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:45.770
most difficult was in Europe, the answer also
always was, "But how much strength these people

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:50.490
have? We have to deal with those who really
can control the situation. That's why we have

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:54.840
to deal with Yasser Arafat. That's why we
have to deal with Abu Allan and Hamas and

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.059
so on, because they have the real power."

00:57:57.059 --> 00:58:01.859
I can speak a lot about situation with human
rights, opposing authority or the rights of

00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:04.991
women. About the rights of gays, sometimes
I appear on campus with Palestinian gays and

00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:16.619
with some others who can tell you a lot about
the situation. I believe that as long as we

00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:21.380
are ignoring the real-real issues of freedom
of Palestinians, we are deceiving ourselves.

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:30.770
And I'll tell you from my own experience not
only when you are a man [ ] but specifically

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:35.640
Palestinians can be closer to democratic way
of life than maybe any other group of Muslims

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.251
because they have been in Diaspora, because
they were involved in free economy, because

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:48.119
through-through Israel, and because they are
so close to-to they can appreciate the real

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:49.700
advantages of democracy.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:55.440
The fact that in the last 17 years we gave
so much power to dictators who are interested

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.079
to destroy all this democracy is only weakening
chance for peace.

00:58:59.079 --> 00:59:02.431
But again that is my private opinion which
has nothing to do with my chairmanship of

00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:06.150
Jewish Agency.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:11.741
&gt;&gt;female #2: Thank you.

00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:12.741
[laughter]

00:59:12.741 --> 00:59:13.741
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Okay.

00:59:13.741 --> 00:59:14.741
[pause]

00:59:14.741 --> 00:59:15.741
&gt;&gt;commentator: It's time for one last question.

00:59:15.741 --> 00:59:16.741
&gt;&gt;male #2: How did you find out that you were
going to be released from the Soviet prison?

00:59:16.741 --> 00:59:25.100
&gt;&gt;Natan Sharansky: Ah. Well first of all things
that I didn't know; what I didn't know in

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:32.839
19, in November of 1985 there was summit,
first summit between Reagan and Gorbachev

00:59:32.839 --> 00:59:34.380
in Geneva.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:41.059
And of course my wife, as all these years,
she came there and demonstrated in front of,

00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:50.049
together with some students and housewives
from-from New York, from Toronto, from Paris,

00:59:50.049 --> 00:59:52.299
who came and demonstrated with her.

00:59:52.299 --> 00:59:55.940
And she was demonstrating, she was in the
uniform of the prisoner or as the westerners

00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:03.799
think that that of the uniform of the prisoner,
it doesn't matter -- it was.

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:08.549
And President Reagan as he later told me,
President Reagan, when Gorbachev started telling

01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:14.200
him, "Let us speak about real issues why you
again you're speaking about all this bunch

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:20.920
of criminals, who they represent. They represent,
nobody exactly what we today say about dissidents.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:30.230
Reagan took him to the window and said, "You
see you-you know that I know that Sharansky

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:34.960
is not American spy and you know. But you
know after all it doesn't matter," he said.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:42.540
"My people believe to that lady," he said.
"And as long as she is demonstrating, they

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:49.170
will not trust you. So we-we really have to-to
start from this."

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.460
I knew nothing about it.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:58.710
Three days after this I am in Siberia in punishment
cell again very weak lying on the floor, I

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:01.000
don't have any strength to-to move.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.500
Suddenly they take me from this punishment
cell and move to the hospital. And they start,

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:13.059
to the prison hospital. And they start feeding
me. And they feed me with things which I already

01:01:13.059 --> 01:01:17.470
forgot that they exist. When they brought
me eggs, I didn't understand what it is -- for

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:21.980
nine years I didn't see eggs; and meat and
butter and milk, things which I didn't see

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.750
these nine years.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.930
Well thank God at that moment I didn't know
that as a Jew I'm not supposed to eat butter

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:29.930
 –

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:30.930
[laughter]

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.340
and bread or meat together so I ate everything-everything
what they brought me I ate, ate, ate.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.770
One of these days they started giving me injections
of glucose and some special vitamins which

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:46.800
they were injecting me in another and it gave
me a lot of strength. They gave me two hours

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.900
of walk every day in the snow and the sun;
in Siberia for half a year I didn't see any

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.900
sun.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.420
And suddenly I start feeling a bit myself
stronger and stronger. I could walk, I could

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:03.750
make exercise. I added 15 kilos, now I added
another 20 kilos –

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.750
[laughter]

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:11.320
Suddenly, and I was sure that they were preparing
me for another meeting with some KGB leader

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.930
from time to time they wanted to do that.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:20.299
Suddenly well I will not go into details you
can read it in my books but at that moment

01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:31.271
they take me from the prison, change my clothes,
put me in the car, take a few hours to the

01:02:31.271 --> 01:02:38.569
airport in [ ], and then put me in the airplane.
And huge airplane, 200 seats, only I and four

01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:39.569
KGB –

01:02:39.569 --> 01:02:40.569
[laughter]

01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:44.970
people like in good old days when they were
following me day and night were there for

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:45.970
me and we are flying.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.010
They don't say where.

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:54.140
By sun I see that we go to the West. And so
after some hours it's clear that Soviet Union

01:02:54.140 --> 01:03:01.580
is a huge country that also has its [ ]. They
inform me officially in solemn voice that

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:08.809
there is a special decision of Soviet Government
for my bad behavior on behalf Soviet citizenship

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:10.290
I am deprived of Soviet citizenship –

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:11.290
[laughter]

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:12.290
and exiled from Soviet too.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:13.290
[laughter]

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:21.990
So then I tell them it's such a solemn moment,
I say, "I want to make a statement." They

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:26.099
say, "Oh no, you don't say it, it's enough
you've just spoken up."

01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:27.099
[laughter]

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:28.609
But I feel that such a great audience - four
KGB men -- I had to something to say. And

01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:36.200
I insist and I say that, "I declare now that
I never was American spy, but I was fighting

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:42.869
for freedom and I hope and I'm sure the day
will come when all 200 million Soviet people

01:03:42.869 --> 01:03:44.520
will get freedom as I get it today."

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.160
And I say it. I felt it's very important for
me to-to say this. [laughs]

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
[laughter]

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.171
I don't know why it was important for me to
say to them that I'm not American spy, but

01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:52.589
it was such an important moment.

01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:58.369
And then we landed and I all time looked at
now I will see my wife. And then I see there

01:03:58.369 --> 01:04:02.490
is DDR. DDR is German Democratic Republic,
it doesn't exist today. I say, "Oh my God."

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:07.410
Then I will not see her because German Democratic
Republic.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:14.700
And they tell me, "You see there the car.
We don't --" there is a lot of journalists,

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:22.260
cameras and they say, "We-we don't want to
go out now you will be soon free. You go straight

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.490
to that car. Agreed?"

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:26.170
And the moment he said, "Agreed," I said,
"What do you mean, agreed? All these years

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:31.329
I never agreed with you. You tell me to go
straight I'll go zig-zag so."

01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:32.329
[laughter]

01:04:32.329 --> 01:04:38.140
So they said, well because it was really very
important not to give up on anything to them.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:44.730
So they say, "Okay." Then, so they went on
two sides to the car and I, as promised, went

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:50.010
zig zag to the car, but shortly speaking,
they took me on the Glienicke Bridge between

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:54.150
Eastern Berlin and Western Berlin which don't
exist today -- between Eastern Germany and

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:55.920
Western Germany -- it doesn't exist today.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.760
Between the world of Communism that doesn't
exist today and the world of freedom.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.210
And there American Ambassador took me through
over the bridge and then I said, "Where is

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:10.020
the border?" He said, "This line is the border."

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:16.471
I-I – And I forgot to say they gave me few
clothes and all it was very big on me as you

01:05:16.471 --> 01:05:23.690
can understand. But they didn't give me the
belt because of course prisoners are not supposed

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:28.160
to have belt. So they gave me some rope which
was keeping my pants. So when they said, "There

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.900
is the border," I jumped over it. And the
rope broke.

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.900
[laughter]

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.900
And I get there and each hour they ask, "What
was your first thought when you entered freedom?"

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.660
I said, "How not to lose my pants."

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.660
[laughter]

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:40.661
[applause]
