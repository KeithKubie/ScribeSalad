You've seen a lot of different parts of
user experience for specific products.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.130
Now I'd like you to find a relatively
new product and try it out and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.060
document all of your thoughts
about the user experience.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.830
This can be anything from the home page,
to emails, to checkout,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.470
to interactions on the site.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.550
You want to build an eye for
amazing products, and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.990
the best way to do that is to see
how others have done it in the past.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.100
So, write a post that describes
the tasks you attempt in the product,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.980
how the product did and did not help
you, how you felt along the way, and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.790
any design elements you feel
contributed to your experience.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.900
Once you've written your post and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
shared it on the discussions,
check this box to continue.
