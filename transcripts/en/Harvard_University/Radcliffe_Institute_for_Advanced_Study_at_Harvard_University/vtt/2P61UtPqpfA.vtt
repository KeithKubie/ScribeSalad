00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.230
- Good afternoon.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.170
My name is Immaculata De Vivo.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.340
And I am the interim co-director
for science programming

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.400
for academic adventures
at Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.010
So Radcliffe
Institute is comprised

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.230
of three large programs.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.630
There is the
Schlesinger Library.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.880
There's the very prestigious
Radcliffe Fellows.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.630
Thank you to any of the
Fellows who are here today.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.580
And then, of course,
Academic Ventures,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.470
which Rebecca Wassarman is the
executive director and Sean

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.150
O'Donnell also is part
of the Academic Ventures.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.580
And under Academic
Ventures, they

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.530
are the ones who are
actually sponsoring

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.420
"This Next in Science."

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.920
It is a very
innovative programming

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
that brings in lots of
diversity with respect

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.240
to humanities, science, art.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.470
And predicated on that are
all of the programming.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.680
So Academic
Ventures, in addition

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.810
to the "Next in
Science" series, also

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.060
sponsors these
exploratory seminars

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.050
and accelerated workshops.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.130
These are funding opportunities
to bring in, again,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
a very multidisciplinary team
to ask the big questions,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.720
to have--

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.750
to brainstorm, essentially.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.840
And they are submitted by
Harvard faculty or a Radcliffe

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.550
Fellow or a prior
Radcliffe Fellow.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.490
But you can go to the website
to get more information.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.790
In addition to these
symposiums and workshops,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.820
Academic Ventures sponsors
these very large symposiums,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.380
the very successful
"Undiscovered" on October 26.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.270
And there was such
great buzz about that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.790
we're continuing to run series
from that "Undiscovered."

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.470
They also sponsor exhibits,
like the "Measure" exhibit

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.010
on Thursday and, of course,
the "Next in Science" series,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.520
which is what I'm going to
briefly tell you about today.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.530
But more importantly, the
richness of Academic Ventures

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
is to open up these
incredible symposiums

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.200
and lectures and
events to the public

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.640
so we can all be
enriched by the events.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.040
So the "Next in
Science" is really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
an opportunity for early career
scientists, the rising rock

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.990
stars.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.850
And we bring them together.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.670
They have overlapping
research interests.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.600
And they not only meet each
other, but they meet all of you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.810
and exchange ideas
to the Harvard-wide,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.450
campus-wide, Boston-wide.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.180
And today's "Next
in Science" idea

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.880
came from this
understanding of evolution.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.380
Most people think we're
done with evolution.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.840
But really, we're not.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.510
So we have the past,
the current, and what

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.340
is the future of evolution.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.200
And the four bright
stars today will address

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.240
some of those questions.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.390
So the focus is on evolution.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.700
And I don't want to
take too much time.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.910
But just the overview
is that we will

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.300
start with Neanderthal
human integration.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.410
And then we'll move on to
human migration and the impact

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.720
of environment and
just change, how

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.210
natural selection
works with respect

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.610
to disease and other traits.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.350
And then we'll have a break.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.470
And we'll have two other-- the
two speakers in the afternoon--

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.630
later afternoon will speak
about rapid evolution in fish.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.640
And then our last speaker will
speak about urban evolution

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.050
as measured with white
clover, a plant, which

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.340
everyone has in their garden.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.530
I can guarantee you,
whether you want it or not.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.960
So with that, I would like
to introduce our very first

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.980
speaker, Sriram Sankararaman.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.560
He is an assistant
professor in the Department

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.810
of Computer Science at the
human genetics at UCLA.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.360
And his interest is the
interface of computer science,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.529
statistics, and biology.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:22.650
He's pretty much the genomicist
that we are very familiar with.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:31.260
They give us lots of data on
a lot of different aspects

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.280
of biology.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.210
But I was intrigued by
Sriram when his paper

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.370
on the Neanderthal
integration with humans--

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.620
and that's what he's going
to talk about today--

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.570
"Archaic Admixture
in Human History."

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.381
So Sriram?

00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:49.197
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:57.970
- All right, firstly, I'd like
to say, I'm really excited.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.590
This is a great meeting.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.960
And I'm looking forward
to interacting with you

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.060
and learning about
everybody's work.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.880
What I'm going to
talk about today

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.210
is basically to give you
an idea of this revolution

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.910
and our understanding
of human evolution

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.930
that's been enabled by the fact
that we can now get DNA out

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.630
of ancient individuals.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.240
So specifically, I'm going
to talk about the fact

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.800
that we have genome sequences
from archaic populations.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.530
By that, we mean populations
like the Neanderthals, which

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.480
are closely related
to modern humans,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.450
but not quite modern human.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.110
And given the genomes of
these archaic populations,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.360
we'd like to understand
the relationships

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.140
between archaic
and modern humans.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.050
So specifically,
we're going to talk

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.050
about intermixing or admixture
between archaic and modern

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.670
humans.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.120
And what I'd like to give you a
feel for is, how do we actually

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.210
learn about this
given genomic data?

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.670
And given that we've
learned about it,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.740
what are kind of
the consequences

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.340
of this archaic admixture
for human evolution

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.540
and human biology?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.440
So by looking at genomes
from present-day humans,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.420
we have acquired a broad
outline of human evolution

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.850
or human history over the
last couple of 100,000 years.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.470
So we know that modern
humans evolved in Africa.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.030
And about 100,000
years ago, there

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.030
was a migration or
exit out of Africa.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.670
All populations
outside of Africa

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.400
trace their ancestry
to this small subset

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.880
that exited Africa.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.830
Now there's a
wrinkle to the story.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.730
And that comes from the fact
that as this population left

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.990
Africa, there was another
population in much of Europe

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.870
and Central Asia,
the Neanderthals.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.780
And so the Neanderthals were
in this geographic range

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.900
from about 300,000 years
till about 30,000 years

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.540
when they disappear
from the fossil record.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.081
So there's a lot of debate--

00:06:58.081 --> 00:06:59.830
there was a lot of
debate, there continues

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.890
to be a lot of debate about the
interaction between these two

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.510
populations.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.950
Did these two populations meet?

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.370
Was there interbreeding?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.420
So one major step in trying to
understand this relationship

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.260
came with the sequencing of
the first Neanderthal genome.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.670
So this was the cave
in Croatia from which

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.820
the bones that yielded the
first draft Neanderthal genome

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.530
were obtained.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.360
And given this first
draft Neanderthal genome,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.410
it made sense to look at this
question of interbreeding.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.620
And so the question or the
statistical test that was asked

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.590
was, if you take a
Neanderthal genome

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.430
and compare it to the genomes
of two modern human individuals,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.470
for example, if you look
at an African genome

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.890
and a non-African genome, is
the Neanderthal genome closer

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.260
to one relative to the other?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.480
And what was observed
in this initial study

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.050
was non-Africans as
a whole tend to be

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.940
genetically closer
to Neanderthals

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.840
relative to Africans.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.220
So this observation is
consistent with a history

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.190
where there was interbreeding
between Neanderthals

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.590
and non-Africans
after non-Africans

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.480
split from Africans.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.540
In other words, there was this
population that left Africa.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.600
And before the dispersal into
the different non-African

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.960
populations, they met and
interbred with Neanderthals.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.380
So given that this was
a plausible history,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.960
a question is, can we
come up with estimates

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.640
of when this admixture
might have happened?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.620
So to do this, we use the
fact that when genomes

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.840
are transmitted from
parents to offspring,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.060
there's a process
called recombination,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.680
which shuffles up the genome
that gets transmitted.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.460
So, for example,
in this cartoon,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.300
you have a modern
human and an archaic.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.340
And the offspring, for
example, this individual,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.730
inherits one genome from the
archaic parent and the other

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.200
from the modern human parent.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.270
But in the next
generation, the offspring

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.874
is going to have a mosaic.

00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:08.540
And that's because
of this recombination

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.140
that ends up shuffling the
genome that gets transmitted.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.566
And this happens
after every generation

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:16.190
so that when you look
at an individual,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.060
say, 50,000 years later,
this individual's genome

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.070
is going to have
this mosaic pattern

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.260
with the modern human
chunks interspersed

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.470
with the archaic chunks.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.380
And roughly the length
of these segments

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.900
is indicative of the
time of admixture.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.700
So the greater the
time since admixture,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.830
the shorter the chunks.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.710
So by looking at the length of
the chunks of Neanderthal DNA

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.140
that are present in
non-African genomes,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.120
we were able to say
that interbreeding

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.040
between Neanderthals
and modern humans

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.590
is roughly about 50,000
years before present.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.210
So this is consistent
with what we

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.980
know about the "Out of Africa"
event, so the "Out of Africa"

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.080
event being dated to
about 100,000 years.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.330
So this is consistent
with integration

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.090
into the non-Africans
after they left Africa.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.730
We can also use other kinds
of statistical techniques

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.960
to estimate what fraction of the
non-Africans' ancestry traces

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.580
to Neanderthals.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.590
And our current
estimate is about 2%

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.650
of the ancestry of
non-African populations traces

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.780
back to Neanderthals.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.370
So with this, we
have what I would

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.640
think of as a global
picture of the relationship

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.670
between modern humans
and Neanderthals.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.980
We think that humans
and Neanderthals

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.870
split about of the order of
300,000 years in the past.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.880
And then Africans
and non-Africans

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.640
split about 100,000
years ago, followed

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.580
by interbreeding between
Neanderthals into the ancestors

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.610
of non-Africans.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.800
So this gives us
a global picture.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.470
And the implication is if you
look at non-African genomes

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.360
today, they're
going to be carrying

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.900
these chunks of Neanderthal DNA,
these chunks that are actually

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.500
quite distinct and diverged
from the rest of the DNA that's

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.700
floating around.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.620
So this begs the
question, what was

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.110
the effect of this highly
distinctive DNA that's

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.490
embedded within the
modern human gene pool?

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.260
Does it have a functional
impact or is it

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.330
just random bits of
DNA floating around?

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.610
So here's one example of
a concrete impact of some

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.450
of this Neanderthal DNA.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.830
So this was a study that
happened four years back, which

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.780
was a scan for genes that are
associated with type 2 diabetes

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.460
risk.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.960
And this scan turned
up a particular gene.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.470
And it turns out that the risk
variant in this particular gene

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.510
has a very specific
and interesting

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.910
geographic distribution.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.260
The risk variant is found
mostly in the Americas

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.420
at high frequencies.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.500
It's quite rare
outside of America,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.180
maybe at lower frequencies in
Europe, but essentially absent

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.690
in Africa.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.910
So this is exactly the
kind of distribution

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.790
you would expect if this
risk gradient was introduced

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.580
into the modern human gene
pool through interbreeding

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.860
with Neanderthals.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.240
And it turns out, if you do
some additional analysis,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.442
this risk variant can be
shown to actually have

00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:17.275
Neanderthal origins.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.830
So this was one
specific example,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.240
one gene that we traced back
to Neanderthal interbreeding.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.540
The question is, what can we say
about the rest of the genome?

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.630
Can we systematically go and
label individuals' genomes

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.930
and try to identify the
origins of Neanderthal DNA

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.010
within individual genomes?

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.410
So what we need to do is we
need to build what we call

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.710
a map of Neanderthal ancestry.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.450
What we mean by
that is if you look

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.420
at present-day
non-African individual,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.970
their genome has
this mosaic pattern.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.180
There are these red chunks of
Neanderthal DNA floating around

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.730
in the rest of their genome.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.677
And we'd like to
be able to identify

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:00.760
what these red chunks are.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.410
And so we built a
statistical method

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.370
that actually goes and
fishes for these chunks

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.750
in a modern human genome.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.050
The basic idea is that it looks
at the modern human genome

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.570
and compares it to a
Neanderthal as well

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.340
as to an African genome.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.950
The African genomes don't
have Neanderthal DNA.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.900
So by doing this
comparison, we can

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.750
try to identify places
which are likely to be

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.830
of Neanderthal origin.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.400
And what we get from this
kind of a statistical models

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.770
looks like this.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.510
So what we are looking at here
are places along the genome.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.340
And you're looking
at places where

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.920
the model says it's highly
confident that there

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.730
is Neanderthal DNA.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.410
So that's what
these spikes denote.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.270
And what you're
seeing here is when

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.634
we look at genomes of a European
American or an East Asian,

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.800
there are a number of regions
along the genome where

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.350
the model is highly
confident of Neanderthal DNA.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.040
However, when we apply
it to an African genome,

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.889
there are relatively
few such regions.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.180
So this is telling us that
the model is doing something

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.050
reasonable, that it's actually
consistent with our knowledge

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.550
of history.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.610
So using this technique, we can
build what we term population

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.200
maps of Neanderthal ancestry.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.430
In other words, we can go
to a given population, say

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.780
European genomes, and for
every region we can ask,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.250
what percentage of individuals
carry Neanderthal DNA

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.300
at this region?

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.840
And so you're sliding along the
genome of these individuals.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.850
And you're building these
maps which tell you,

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.850
in this position, many
European individuals carrying

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.720
Neanderthal DNA, whereas in
this region, relatively few do.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.810
And so what I'm showing
here is this map

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.710
of Neanderthal ancestry
for European populations

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.840
and East Asian populations.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.170
So what is interesting
about this map

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.690
is this rapid variation
in Neanderthal DNA

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.150
as you move along the genome.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.610
There are places where there
is a lot of Neanderthal DNA

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.480
concentrated, what we term as
peaks of Neanderthal ancestry.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.790
And then there are places
where, essentially, there

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.310
is no Neanderthal DNA across
these populations, what

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.315
we term as deserts.

00:15:20.196 --> 00:15:21.570
So it's interesting
to understand

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.070
what might be causing
this variation

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.510
in Neanderthal ancestry.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.780
Is this just a random
occurrence or is there

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.780
some biology, is there
some selective advantage

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.740
for some regions to be peaks
and others to be deserts?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.220
So here is one extreme example
of a peak of Neanderthal DNA.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.830
This is a place in the
genome where more than half

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.930
of Europeans carry the
Neanderthal version

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.740
of the gene.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.010
So to give you a sense of
this, today more than half

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.160
of Europeans carry the
Neanderthal version

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.210
of the gene.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.010
50,000 years ago,
it was about 2%.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.870
But this is a place
where the frequency

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:06.640
of the Neanderthal DNA has risen
over the last 50,000 years.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.030
And so there are several such
regions in the genome which

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.230
are peaks of Neanderthal DNA
and which we can strongly say

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.530
are places where the Neanderthal
DNA has risen up in frequency

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.880
not by chance, but
because it must

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.890
have had an adaptive impact.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.500
It was beneficial once it
entered the modern human gene

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.260
pool.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.490
And that's why it
rose up in frequency.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.190
We can then ask what
might be the functional

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.350
impact of these peaks
of Neanderthal DNA,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.030
were there specific
kinds of functions

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.430
that they were associated with?

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.930
And in fact, there
are several kinds

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.840
of functions that we
associate with these peaks.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.270
For example, we find
that many of these peaks

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.340
of Neanderthal DNA are
associated with skin

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.320
and hair-related function.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.960
So the suggestion here
is that the reason why

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.790
this Neanderthal DNA
rose up in frequency

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.034
was because they affected
skin and hair biology.

00:16:58.034 --> 00:16:59.950
And that might have been
adaptively beneficial

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.560
because Neanderthals were
already in the environments

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.710
into which modern humans
were then expanding.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.069
So borrowing this
DNA from Neanderthals

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.170
was a quick way
for modern humans

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.092
to adapt to these new
kinds of environments.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.790
So now we can turn our
attention to the deserts

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.780
of Neanderthal DNA.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:27.710
So these are large places in
the genome several million bases

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.200
long where, essentially,
nobody seems

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.900
to be carrying Neanderthal DNA.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.210
That's quite surprising.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.430
And the question
is, is it because

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.410
of the fact that
these places are

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.690
resistant to Neanderthal DNA?

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.880
Is it driven because of
the fact that these places

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.654
are functionally
important for humans?

00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.320
So these are places
which are preserving

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.750
some kind of human
function and that

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.310
is why the Neanderthal DNA is
being resisted and removed.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.790
So here is one such a
striking example of a desert.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.250
It's a desert in every
population we've looked at.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.880
It's a desert in Europeans
and in East Asians.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.851
And this desert overlaps a
famous gene called FOXP2.

00:18:09.851 --> 00:18:12.240
And this region, this
gene is interesting

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.890
because it's been
shown to be involved

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.420
in speech and language.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.970
So our hypothesis is
that, potentially, there

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.240
is some function conferred
around this region that

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.340
is important for modern humans.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.900
And that is why
this is resistant

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.290
to the Neanderthal
version of the DNA.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.290
So to look at this a little
bit more quantitatively,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.470
we looked at different
places in the genome.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.480
And we binned them
according to how constrained

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.935
they are by selection.

00:18:41.935 --> 00:18:43.560
So there are places
in the genome which

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.040
are very constrained where
there is no toleration

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.900
for new kinds of mutations.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.530
And those are on the left.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.000
And then there are places which
are more relaxed on the right.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.626
And what we see is both in
Europeans and East Asians,

00:18:56.626 --> 00:18:58.750
as you move towards regions
where they are strongly

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.000
constrained, there's a
reduction in the amount

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.400
of Neanderthal ancestry
or the Neanderthal DNA.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.370
So this is telling us,
overall, the genome

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.010
is purifying away most of
the Neanderthal ancestry.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.890
So the Neanderthal
ancestry, on average,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.020
tends to be deleterious.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.510
So even though there are
peaks of Neanderthal DNA

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.960
which are beneficial,
the big picture

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.550
is the Neanderthal
DNA is deleterious.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.380
So one question is,
what causes this?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.690
And there are still
several models out there.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.360
One model is, the
study is Neanderthals

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.210
had a very small population
size over a long period of time.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.930
So they accumulated lots
of deleterious mutations,

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.440
bad mutations.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.260
And these came into
the human population

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.360
through the admixture.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.810
And they were quickly removed
from the human population.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.990
That's one model to try to
explain this kind of impact

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.140
of Neanderthal ancestry.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.740
There is a second model
and this comes out

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.185
of what we know about
how species form.

00:20:01.185 --> 00:20:03.310
So, for example, when you
have two populations that

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.890
split and evolve and
become two species,

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.230
there's a question
of what is driving

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.830
this formation of species.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.070
And so this is a model called
a hybrid sterility model.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.040
The idea is these
populations accumulate

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.180
mutations, which do just fine
as long as they are isolated.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.400
But the moment they come
back together and they mix,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.596
these mutations tend to be bad.

00:20:25.596 --> 00:20:26.970
So, for example,
the Neanderthals

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.700
accumulated some mutations.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.600
They came into the
human gene pool.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.530
And they have interactions
that causes them to be removed.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.310
It turns out, this model makes
two kinds of predictions.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:43.760
One is, if you look at the
X chromosome, one of the sex

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.610
chromosomes, and compare it
to the rest of the genome,

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.740
the effects of Neanderthal
DNA getting purged

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.560
will be much more stronger
on the X chromosome

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.060
compared to the
rest of the genome.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.380
And that's, indeed, what we
see, where the X chromosome has

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.840
substantially reduced
Neanderthal DNA compared

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.400
to the autosomes in
Europeans and East Asians.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.660
There's a second prediction
from this model, which

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.690
is the effects of this
kind of a model would

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.600
be substantial on
genes which are highly

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.860
expressed in the testes.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.300
And what we find is when
you look at testes genes,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.121
again, there is a substantial
depletion in Neanderthal DNA.

00:21:21.121 --> 00:21:23.370
So it's plausible that there
are both kinds of models,

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.680
both the hybrid sterility model,
as well as this model where

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.920
there is reduced population
sizes in the Neanderthals

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.539
contributing to
their DNA being bad

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:33.330
and being removed from
the human gene pool.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.570
So so far I've talked only about
the Neanderthal population.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.150
But what's emerged in
the last several years

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.630
is this discovery of a second
arctic population which is

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.520
a cousin of the Neanderthals.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.890
So this population is
called the Denisovans.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.660
And this is a notable
population because its discovery

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.730
came mainly from
genetics so there

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.610
was no prior fossil evidence
suggesting the existence

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.846
of this population.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.030
So after the Denisovan
genome was sequenced, again,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.000
there was a question, has there
been intermixing or admixture

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.730
between Denisovans and
certain human populations?

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.260
And what was discovered was that
populations in Oceania today,

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.610
present-day Oceania--

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.850
so these are populations
like the Papuans, Aboriginal

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.050
Australians--

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:32.670
have admixture from the
Denisovan population.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.720
So Oceanian populations have
both Neanderthal DNA as well as

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.845
Denisovan DNA.

00:22:39.845 --> 00:22:41.220
Like we did for
the Neanderthals,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.430
we can also try to figure out
the date of this interbreeding

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.050
event.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.990
And by looking at the
lengths of the Denisovan DNA

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.630
that's segregating
in the Oceanians,

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.642
we estimate this to be
around 45,000 years ago.

00:22:55.642 --> 00:22:57.600
So this was after the
Neanderthal interbreeding

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.870
event.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.690
Again, we can build maps of
Denisovan DNA around the world.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.450
So here, I'm showing
you the results

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.300
of looking at a
worldwide population.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.700
And every dot here
is a population.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.850
And the color is telling you
how much Denisovan DNA is there

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.430
in this population
across that genome.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.440
So we see this red spot here.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.670
Those are the Oceanians.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.900
So they have substantially
higher Denisovan DNA.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.690
But then you see
this smear of green

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.040
in a set of other populations.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.190
So East Asian
populations, South Asian

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.720
populations also have a small,
but non-negligible proportion

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.450
of Denisovan DNA.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.570
So what the spread is telling
us is this Denisovan population,

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.390
which we don't have as
much fossil evidence about,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.920
we only know it
from the genetics,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.410
could potentially have had
a wide geographic range.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.910
And we also have
evidence that there

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.190
was multiple mixing
events involving

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.770
Denisovans and modern
human population groups.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.890
We can also build maps
along the genome looking at,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.410
where is this Denisovan
DNA distributed?

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.910
So we can build, like, maps of
Denisovan and Neanderthal DNA

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.320
and compare them.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.600
And, again, we see a
very similar picture

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.380
of peaks and deserts of
Denisovan and Neanderthal DNA.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.780
So there are regions
like this that

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.060
also include the
FOXP2 gene, which

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.870
are deserts of both Denisovan
and Neanderthal DNA.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.210
And then there are
peaks of Denisovan DNA.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.870
The most notable one, this
amazing story in Tibetans,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.810
focuses on a gene called EPAS1.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.780
And this is a gene where
there is a high proportion

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.030
of Denisovan DNA in Tibetans.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.340
And that has been
useful in adaptation

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.210
to high altitude environments.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.110
So it's a clear example
of this archaic DNA being

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.091
useful in human adaptation.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.770
So finally, we can again
ask, is the Denisovan DNA,

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.915
like the Neanderthal DNA,
deleterious on average?

00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:00.540
And, again, when we
look at the genome,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.610
as we move towards highly
constrained regions

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.100
of the genome, like
the Neanderthal DNA,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.150
the Denisovans are also purged
in this highly selectively

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.280
constrained regions
of the genome.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.360
So what it's telling us is
archaic DNA, both Neanderthal

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.960
and Denisovan, on
the whole seems

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.420
to have had very
similar effects.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.199
On average, it was bad.

00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:22.740
But there were places where they
could have actually provided

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.422
an evolutionary advantage.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.500
So just to summarize,
I think the key message

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.930
that I want to
say is ancient DNA

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.150
is this amazing new
technology that's

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.950
giving us a new way
to ask questions

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.190
about human evolution.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.600
I've mainly focused on
archaic genomes, genomes

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.070
from Neanderthals
and Denisovans,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.340
but there are now
hundreds, maybe thousands

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.980
of genomes from what we'd
call ancient modern humans,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.080
people who lived in
the last 10,000 years.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.480
And that's giving
us new insights

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.269
into very recent
human evolution.

00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:58.810
So using these
archaic genomes, we're

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.360
able to build maps of
Neanderthal and Denisovan

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.746
ancestry across populations.

00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:05.620
And the key picture
that's coming out of this

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.540
is the complexity of the
interactions of Neanderthals,

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.600
Denisovans, and modern humans.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.330
It's not just one
interbreeding event.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.580
There are multiple
interbreeding events separated

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.060
across space and time.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.800
The other interesting
idea is you

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.050
can think of using
this integration

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.870
or interbreeding as a tool
to understand human evolution

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.856
and human biology.

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:27.480
And I think that's
going to be powerful

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.470
and something that's what
thinking more deeply about.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.360
With this, I'd like
to thank everyone.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.440
I'd like to thank the members of
the Neanderthal Genome Analysis

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.130
Consortium.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.580
This is where all
of this work began.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.960
And I'd like to thank
all my funding sources.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.148
Thank you.

00:26:44.148 --> 00:26:48.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.540
- Thank you, Sriram.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.010
That was great.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.590
So we only have about five
minutes of questions right now.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.600
OK, yes, can you please
state your name and question?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.840
- Yes, can you give me
a number about how long

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.440
a segment of
Neanderthal DNA would

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.680
be inside me or in a
random Homo sapien.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.640
So are we talking 50
bases or 50,000 bases?

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.360
And how many of them are there?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.280
- Right, so the question
is, how many, how long

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.380
are these segments
of Neanderthal DNA?

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.880
So based on these time
estimates of around 50,000 years

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.830
on average, these segments are
of the order of 50,000 bases.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.377
So that's kind of
the average length.

00:27:37.377 --> 00:27:38.960
Although, there is
a lot of variation.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.880
There can be extremely long
and extremely short segments.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:48.010
In terms of numbers, I
don't have a specific number

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.070
to quote because it
depends on which individual

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.450
genome you're looking at.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.480
Different individuals will
be carrying different subsets

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.990
of Neanderthal DNA.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.620
- Thank you.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.212
- I'm Heather [? Ramoff. ?]
Bit of a fanciful--

00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:03.670
- Can you please
talk into the mic.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.045
- Yeah, I'm Heather
[? Ramoff. ?]

00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:07.370
And this is a bit of
a fanciful question.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.500
But I'm thinking of the
traits [? most ?] where

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.780
their concentration of traits
relating to skin and hair

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.380
and those where there's
a desert with the FOXP2--

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.290
is that what it is--
relating to language.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.420
And it seems to
me that those are

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.970
things that would
express themselves

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.330
both by looking at an individual
and behaviorally in terms

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.820
of the speech.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.950
Do you consider at all
whether, in addition

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.190
to natural selection,
some sexual selection

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.690
is coming into play here?

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.910
- Absolutely, I
don't think we can

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.610
differentiate whether
this was sexual

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.230
versus natural selection.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.410
I think the effects of either
of those modes of selection

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.430
are going to be quite similar.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.104
So it is entirely possible.

00:28:56.104 --> 00:28:57.770
And it's entirely
possible, for example,

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.490
that there were
different mating systems

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.830
across these populations.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:06.350
And that plays into how
selection functions.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.270
So it's very plausible.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.280
I don't think we can
differentiate those two

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:10.960
scenarios here.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.720
- Yeah, thank you.

00:29:14.954 --> 00:29:19.230
- All right, I noted that your
distribution of genome types

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.620
did not include any
symbols in Africa.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.000
So I thought there was
evidence that there was re--

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.142
certain people returning
from Europe to Africa.

00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:31.850
But of course, over
the last 1,000 years,

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.320
this would have
been entirely mixed.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.060
So I was wondering if there
was evidence from samples

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.680
of more than 1,000 years
old of whether there

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.760
was, for example,
any Neanderthal DNA

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.190
introduced into Africa?

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.900
- Right, so the question
is whether there

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:55.000
is evidence for Neanderthal
DNA in any African population.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.830
We do see traces
of Neanderthal DNA

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.920
in some African populations.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.010
We think that most of that is
explained by black migration

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:08.650
from some of these out of Africa
populations back into Africa.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.890
The traces are quite small.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.090
So you could imagine if an
out of African population

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.050
carries 2% DNA and
2% of them come back,

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.160
that's going to be
maybe 4 parts in 10,000.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.150
So there's a trace amount
that is detectable, mostly

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.512
explainable by these kinds
of back migration events.

00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:33.640
- This will be the last
question for this--

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.659
- Well, well, it'll be a high
point, I hope, for the break.

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:38.950
- There's plenty of time later.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.450
- So I'm [INAUDIBLE],, 59,
recently retired pediatric

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.120
neurologist and former redhead.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.180
And I read somewhere
that only 2% or 3%

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.030
of the population in
the world is red-headed.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.150
And that they trace it
to the Neanderthal genes.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.940
Is that the BNC2 gene?

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:03.490
And is that something that's on
my genome that could be found?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.100
Or is that a bit of a stretch?

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.540
- So the question is, you're
asking about a specific gene

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.380
being Neanderthal--

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.796
- Apparently, this
is what I read,

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:18.490
that red-headedness is traceable
to the Neanderthal population.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.820
And it's only 2% or 3% of
the world's population.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.830
And I wondered, you mentioned--

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:29.230
I think it was BNC2 gene
was related to hair color.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.960
And I just wondered
if that was the gene

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.330
or is there a gene
for red-headedness?

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.860
I'll probably leave it at that.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.960
- Yeah, I couldn't catch
the name of the gene.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.435
So maybe we should
take it offline.

00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:42.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.469
- Sure, we could
do that offline.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:45.510
We'll have a break later.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.110
And we can talk offline.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.260
OK, Sriram, that was fantastic.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.940
I didn't even get
to ask a question.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.140
So I'll have to wait.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.880
I have a big question
for you later.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.040
OK.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.700
So with that.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.550
