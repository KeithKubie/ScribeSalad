00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.110
To shade a diffuse surface, we need the cosine of the angle between the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.932
direction to the light and the surface's normal. We can perform a vector

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:11.741
operation called the dot product to directly compute this cosine. First, you

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.774
must normalize the surface normal and the vector to the light. Normalizing means

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:19.790
rescaling a vector so that it has a length of 1. Normalized vectors are the norm

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.816
in reflection models. As we'll see, if a dot product of two normalized vectors

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:28.172
gives a value between negative 1 and 1, which will prove useful in computing the

00:00:28.172 --> 00:00:33.870
effect of lighting. For example, say, I have the vector 3, negative 4, 0. To

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.654
normalize it, I find the length of the vector. This is simply the Pythagorean

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:41.808
theorem. Take each component of the vector and square it. 3 squared is 9,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:47.366
negative 4 squared is 16, and 0 squared is 0. Take the square root of 25 and you

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:52.062
get the length of the vector, 5. It's lucky that turned out so easily. By

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:58.304
dividing the vector by its length, you get to normalize vector. So, 3, negative

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:05.725
4, 0 normalized is 0.6, negative 0.8, 0. Looking at this vector, it goes the

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:09.892
same direction, but only travels one unit. Note that normalizing a vector that's

00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:13.498
already normalized leaves it unchanged. Try normalizing this vector again and

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:17.322
you'll find the length is 1. Dividing the vector by a length of 1, of course,

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:21.320
does nothing. It's very handy to normalize vectors in this way. Usually, we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.981
store the surface normals as normalized vectors. We'll see exactly why in the

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:27.753
next lesson. For now, a quick quiz.
