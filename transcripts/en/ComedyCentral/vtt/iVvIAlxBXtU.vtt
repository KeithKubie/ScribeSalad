HERE'S THE FIRST ONE -- TWINSIE.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.131
IT'S LIKE A ONESIE, BUT TWICE AS
EMBARRASSING.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.799
ALWAYS BE READY FOR A
THREE-LEGGED RACE.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.787

â™ª

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.107
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY.

CIRCUIT THREEWAY, IF THAT MAKES

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.655
ANY SENSE.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:29.957
ANNIE.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.193
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE
IN A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.996
YOU NEED A COLD PLASTIC THING
FOR YOUR OTHER LIPS.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.831
