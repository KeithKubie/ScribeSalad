MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.108
Welcome to another outstanding
Talks at Google event.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.095
And today for our
Food Google program,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.860
we're very thrilled
to welcome back

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.230
Jody Eddy and Gunnar
Karl Gislason.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.230
They will be
speaking to us today

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.850
about their latest
cookbook, which

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.500
is called "North: The New
Nordic Cuisine of Iceland".

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.180
And some of us in the audience,
I know myself personally,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.680
have traveled in the
beautiful country,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.220
seen the food that was there,
the fish and everything.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.010
And really with
what the book does

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.380
is not only talk about Gunnar's
restaurant-- which is Dill,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.330
and very well known, one of
the top Nordic restaurants

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.280
in Iceland and a continuation
of the new Nordic cuisine

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.020
tradition from Rene Redzepi.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.330
But the book also
goes into background

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.890
about the various producers
throughout the country.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.710
So from the folks that provide
the salt, to the goat's milk,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.710
to the people that
are harvesting bird

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.530
eggs off the coast
of Iceland, there's

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.260
a story for each one involved.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.210
And so we will have some
time for Q&amp;A at the end,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.000
so I encourage you to
check the book out.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750
We are sampling some
Icelandic cuisine as well.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.120
Hop on down to the beautiful
country if you get a chance

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.330
and please join me in welcoming
Gunnar and Jody to Google.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.805
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.480
JODY EDDY: So thank you
so much for coming today.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.390
And I thought it
would just start out

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.510
by talking a little
bit about my history

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.150
with Gunnar where we met and I
met him maybe five years ago.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.310
It was right when the economic
collapse of Iceland's economy

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.915
had just happened
and I was shooting--

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:43.260
I was an editor at
a culinary magazine

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.200
and I was most excited
to meet with Gunnar

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000
of all the chefs
I met in Iceland.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.070
And when I got there,
to the restaurant,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.390
they said that he wasn't there.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.300
And I was really disappointed,
I had to leave the next day.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.132
But then he walked into Dill
carrying a basket of angelica

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:02.840
that he had just been
collecting outside,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.610
and so he had been there.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.530
And we just stayed in
touch throughout the years,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.380
and then a variety of
projects together and.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.610
He was in my last book on
restaurant staff meals.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.100
And when we finished
that up, I didn't really

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.660
have a project in
the works with him.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.550
And we had a conversation
that night at the photo shoot

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.060
and talked about how we
should do something together,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.180
profiling the traditional
food producers of Iceland

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.440
because they're so
important to Gunnar.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.300
Can you talk a little bit about
why they mean so much to you?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.280
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Well the thing

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.510
is when I first opened
up the restaurant,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.630
it was five and half years ago.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.060
It started up us
being-- like, it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.065
was supposed be, like
a Nordic restaurant.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:51.359
And I wanted to try
to collect ingredients

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.900
from all around the
Nordic countries.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.360
The collapse came and
pretty much everything

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.580
that I was going to import was
going up in prices like crazy.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.890
So we somehow started
going another way.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.410
We started with
the usual suspects

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.060
and then went from there
trying to find something more,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.070
trying to find something
new-- in my case,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.990
maybe trying to find
something old, actually.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.210
And very quickly I
found this passion

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.300
for finding those
producers that are

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.380
making their things the old way.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.480
And so I was trying
to find them.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.760
And even harder
was to find out how

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.230
I could take those ingredients
and make something,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.140
like new out of it, something
new that would be like-- that

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.510
would fit perfectly into
a fine dining restaurant.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.480
And for some things
it was really easy

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.690
and came very natural.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.995
For other things, it was
like months of headache.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.770
But--

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.770
JODY EDDY: Why was that?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.050
Why was it a challenge?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.180
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: I mean
to take a little dried wolffish

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.070
and make something really
enjoyable out of it.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.300
Not that I'm saying
it's bad like it is,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.597
but it's more like you will
have to do something with it

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.680
so it fits the restaurant.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.940
Usually we just eat it.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.055
Like at home, we just tear it
down, cover it with butter,

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:33.930
and eat it like that.

00:04:34.962 --> 00:04:37.170
But obviously I had to do
something a little bit more

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.820
interesting so I could
serve it at the restaurant.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.300
And especially, the
dried fish actually

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.680
was kind of a headache.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.070
But now I have a
couple of things

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.910
that I like doing with it.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.850
JODY EDDY: Hardfiskur,
what he's referencing,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.430
is that a dried wolffish.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.970
It's dried in drying
houses on the ocean.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.980
And it's certainly
a tradition that

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.920
is disappearing
in Iceland, and I

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.520
think that's what inspires
me most about Gunnar,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.850
is that he is taking these
traditional ingredients

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.120
that even maybe Icelanders
aren't appreciating anymore

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.410
and he's transforming
them into something

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.250
beautiful and contemporary, but
still pays homage to the past.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.900
And his connections
to his producers,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.280
I've so often seen
that he's really

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.400
keeping the traditional
alive in some cases,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.070
and in some cases
actually transforming

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.040
a tradition, and also
just making Icelanders

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.735
appreciate what they have.

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:42.130
GUNNAR KARL
GISLASON: Yes, right.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.480
It's like when I started
researching those things

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.240
and finding all those
people at the same time,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.320
I was finding out that
they were really, really

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.670
slowly fading away.

00:05:54.981 --> 00:05:56.730
And all the companies,
they were coming up

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.630
with both easier and cheaper--
and most of all, faster-- ways

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.950
to do their things.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.320
Like for example
with the dried fish,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.940
it's mostly dried now
in some kind of ovens.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.210
Which is fine, there's
nothing wrong with it per se.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.402
But it's just not the
same as other one.

00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:19.680
The other one obviously
is like really

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.210
packed of flavors from the
sea after hanging there.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.310
So the thing is that you have to
find the place for your house,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.960
and you should find
the place where

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.170
it's as windy as it
can be, pretty much.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.270
And then it's only dried
during the wintertime

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.560
because the temperature
has to be below zero.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.250
And it takes one month,
up to two months,

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.070
depending on everything.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.500
And obviously the fish will
be really packed with flavors.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.390
And there are many other
assembles-- for an example,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:01.060
with a salted cod-- that
is like, back in the days,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.857
it takes almost like up
to a year to make it.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.760
But nowadays it's more
starting to be new ways,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.650
injecting saltwater and
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.150
But still we are
so lucky to have

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.960
a couple that are still
doing it the old way.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.454
And obviously we buy theirs.

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:23.370
JODY EDDY: Absolutely.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.550
And can you talk a little bit--
because I think there's maybe

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.350
a bit of misconception about
what New Nordic cuisine is all

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.650
about and what Nordic cuisine--
contemporary Nordic cuisine--

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.240
is about?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.210
And maybe talk a
little bit about what

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.620
the manifesto for the new
Nordic kitchen was and--?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.220
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah,
well it's like-- I don't know.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.390
It's actually quite
a long time ago

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.540
since the manifesto was made.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.790
It was actually a couple of
chefs from the Nordic countries

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.650
that actually all got together
and made this little manifesto

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.210
of things that
should be something

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.600
that would embrace
our countries.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.390
The whole idea--
the first idea, I

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.460
guess-- was to try to
make a kitchen that

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.750
could be well-known,
like worldwide.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.520
And I guess people like, they
saw that it could be a problem

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.345
to make like one country to
make a Norwegian kitchen,

00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:25.000
or a Danish kitchen
for that matter,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.020
and make it like really, really
big so it could get like longer

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.910
and wider like the Italian
kitchen or the French kitchen,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.390
et cetera.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.070
So they decided
somehow-- and I think

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.159
that was one of the reasons that
it would be good to take them

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.740
all together,
somehow like trying

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.850
to take the Nordic countries
and everybody like work together

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.210
and try to embrace
each other and that we

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.200
could get that Nordic
kitchen on the map.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.760
And it happened
so fast and so big

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.060
that I think nobody believed it.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:10.830
And now it's, I don't know, it's
like somehow maybe those words,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.860
like the Nordic
kitchen, are-- for me,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.190
at least-- some people
use it to describe

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.290
a certain type of food.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.380
But for me, it's more
like a Nordic kitchen

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.090
would be like a
restaurant that are using

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.270
those ingredients that
are close to them.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.640
But they could be
really different

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.880
when it comes to
how to make the food

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.950
or how to plate it or
serve it for that matter.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.990
So for me it's like
a very big umbrella

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.840
for a lot of things for a lot
of kitchens, techniques, and et

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.444
cetera.

00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:53.110
JODY EDDY: And I think
one of the things

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.130
that we really talk a
lot about in our cookbook

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.010
is that you can take
these techniques,

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.680
or you can take this
philosophy and really apply it

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.210
anywhere in the world,
and incorporate it.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.920
They talk so much about a sense
of place in Nordic countries

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.370
and associated with
the term New Nordic.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.230
And it really does mean that,
you know-- look outside.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.900
If there's something in the
cookbook that you can't source,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.720
just find out what's in your
own backyard and use that.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.010
And I think that's really
the philosophy of what

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.051
Nordic cuisine is about, as
opposed to specific techniques

00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:30.675
or ingredients.

00:10:31.244 --> 00:10:33.410
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: You
just go into your backyard

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.254
and find whatever
you have and use it.

00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:36.920
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.940
Can you talk a little
bit more about--?

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.580
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Just make sure not

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.830
to eat something poison.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.121
JODY EDDY: Exactly.

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.440
Can you talk a little bit
more about the techniques--

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.780
like the specific
techniques-- in Iceland

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.210
that are really
unique to Iceland?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.105
Cooking techniques,
maybe your hay smoking

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:57.062
and smoking with
manure and those.

00:10:58.517 --> 00:11:00.350
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, probably now you

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.600
want to hear about the manure.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.020
It's actually like-- that's
one of the old traditions

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.180
as well, probably since
the time of Vikings.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.470
It's something that was
a technique that-- so,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.580
during the winter
time, the sheeps

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.960
would be inside the houses.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.560
They would all,
obviously, they would

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.130
do number one and
two on the floor

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.695
and have some hay in between.

00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:29.320
And they'd walk on
it the whole winter.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.419
So it's thick like this in
the beginning of the summer.

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.210
In the beginning of
the summer, the sheeps,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.685
they just go up to the
mountains and live really

00:11:36.685 --> 00:11:39.572
freely there all summer.

00:11:39.572 --> 00:11:41.030
The farmers on the
other hand, they

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.826
would go and cut it into layers,
take it outside, and dry it.

00:11:44.826 --> 00:11:46.450
And it's actually
it's like-- I thought

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.300
it was like a really
basic technique,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.980
but it's really kind
of complicated to find

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:57.700
the exact right manure to use.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.420
Because it cannot be too
dry, it cannot be too wet.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.640
If it's too dry, it will
just go up in flames.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.010
If it's too wet, it
obviously won't burn.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.440
So it's a kind of
complicated technique.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.657
And obviously it
takes a long time,

00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.240
and obviously you
have to have sheeps.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.330
But it's probably like
something that-- I mean,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.460
they didn't start doing
it because they really

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.740
just love their shit so much.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.760
But it's probably
more because they

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.520
didn't have anything
else to burn.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.170
So there were a serious, serious
lack of trees in Iceland.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.840
And it actually went so
far that at a certain time

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.180
they started to try to protect
those few trees that we

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.780
had left.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.430
So obviously people have
to find something else

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.650
to dry and burn or
smoke with, or whatever.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.807
So this was one of the things
that they came up with.

00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:58.890
JODY EDDY: And I think
that's certainly something,

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.050
after traveling in
Iceland for many years,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:08.880
that I see over and over again
is that they-- often, it's

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.150
a matter of survival, really.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.820
And so you really have to
be clever and figure out

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.200
how to use what you have.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.860
We'll talk a little bit later
about the geothermal salt

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.010
maker who makes salt using
geothermal heat, the rye bread

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.172
producer who uses, instead of
wood, using geothermal heat

00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:32.255
from the ground in baking
the bread in the ground.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.820
There's just so many different
ingredients and techniques

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:45.030
that I think really reflect
that tradition of not having

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.230
anything and just
having to be clever.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.220
Yeah, and can you just
talk a little bit more

00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:02.700
about the geothermal
energy and the heat,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.410
and also about how Iceland
is such a pristine country?

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.030
They've tried to market
Iceland as one of the only 100%

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.680
sustainable nations
because of the fact

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.845
that you don't have chemicals,
the animals are free range,

00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:17.970
they don't use antibiotics.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.170
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Most of it, at least.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.750
We try to use that heat from
the ground for some good things,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.030
definitely.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.400
But obviously it can sometimes
be a little bit hard,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.860
because, I think,
I can't use it,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.870
because I would have to drive
pretty far away to find one.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.420
But on those areas where they
have that geothermal heat,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.460
it is used quite a lot.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.000
I think we can use it even more.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.295
But for an example, we
have that salt producer.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.710
And they're-- it's
somehow it's like I really

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.876
don't-- it's really only
like a couple of years old,

00:14:58.876 --> 00:14:59.430
that company.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.700
And now there are two
companies making high-end salt

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.080
in Iceland.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.210
But for me it's
just really strange

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.500
that we haven't been
doing this like always,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.510
because it's so simple.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.410
The only thing they do is
they pump some seawater up

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.780
from the sea and
up in some tanks,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.520
and they dry it over
geothermal heat.

00:15:20.415 --> 00:15:21.290
JODY EDDY: That's it.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.070
And it's the best
finishing salt and salt

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.925
that I've truly ever eaten.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.550
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
It's really good.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:32.880
But the same with the heat,
obviously like on those places

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.430
where there is a lot
of heat in the ground,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:41.311
people will use it to cook
with, like to bake the bread,

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:41.810
for example.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.505
And obviously we use
it for our greenhouses.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.620
So it's like-- I mean,
greenhouses in general

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.030
may be quite often
looked down at.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.350
But I think it
could be something

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:02.490
that we could be proud of in
Iceland because of that heat

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.950
from the ground
that has been used,

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.000
and how green our
electricity is.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.750
JODY EDDY: And also--
here's a picture.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.310
What you're seeing
there is whale.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.340
And I thought we could talk
a little bit about some

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.310
of the products that they use in
Iceland, because so often it's

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.290
all they have, and I think
it can be very controversial.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.560
But I also think it speaks
to using what's around you.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.590
And if you can talk a little
bit more about things maybe

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.190
they would call taboo,
horse meat and whale and--?

00:16:39.912 --> 00:16:41.370
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, I mean,

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.720
it's like-- definitely,
back in the days, people,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.040
they had to survive.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.720
And they were not going to have
some big issues about if it

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.700
was a whale or something else.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.100
If they could cook
it and eat it,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.391
they would probably just do it.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.580
Now, it's like whale--
there's not really

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.385
many people in Iceland who are
eating it, not many at all.

00:17:04.385 --> 00:17:06.760
I'm actually pretty sure it's
like most of the whale sold

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.364
in Iceland is sold to tourists.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.589
But there are some more
things like, for an example,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.740
horses, which are
eaten all year round.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.880
And I actually had
issues eating horse,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.530
but it is because I came
from the countryside,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.540
and we raised horses.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.840
So it was a little bit
like eating my dog.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.857
But then again, people
do that as well.

00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:33.940
JODY EDDY: Not in Iceland.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.648
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Not in Iceland, no.

00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:41.610
But then I decided a couple
of months ago, I was like, OK.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.800
Let's go.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.950
So obviously, I had eaten
some horses back in day.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.550
But it's actually really good.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:54.440
If you find the right producer
and you find the right horse,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.470
actually it's
really, really nice.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.610
JODY EDDY: I think one
of the questions I always

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.130
get when people hear
that I'm working

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.360
on an Icelandic cookbook
is, what is the shark like?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.560
And again, I think it's one
of those tired questions

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.610
that, there are some notorious
ingredients in Iceland that

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.120
are very traditional and really,
again, speak to that time

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.040
when food was about survival.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.990
It was about getting
through the winter

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.580
and using preservation
techniques.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.640
They don't necessarily
appeal to the modern palate,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.960
but I think it's important
that these traditions continue,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.820
because it's really
the legacy of Iceland

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.240
and the legacy of
surviving and perseverance.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.740
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.990
And I mean it's like a good
question about that shark,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.740
because it's something-- I
mean, I wouldn't go so far

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.170
to say that I really dislike
it, but it's not really pleasant

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:51.880
at all.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.150
It smells like
really, really strong.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.610
But actually after you
start you eating it,

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.690
it smells more than
it actually tastes.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.110
And a lot of people
actually, it's

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.670
like-- I met a lot
of foodies people

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.625
that are really
into strong cheeses.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.840
And they actually just
happen to enjoy this a lot,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.495
because it's like the texture
and everything is actually

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:20.620
a lot like a strong cheese.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:27.520
And it's like again, even though
I don't really love eating it,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.120
it would be a big shame
if it were to die out.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.120
And the technique, again, is
something that takes months.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.490
Yeah, it would be a shame.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.156
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:44.600
And we did meet with
a-- so it's a fermented

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.900
or, essentially,
putrefied Shark.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.160
And we met with a--
it's called hakarl--

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.670
with a hakarl producer.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.890
And talking with him-- he's
in his, I think, 80s now--

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.420
and there isn't
anyone who is going

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.630
to take over what he's doing.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.350
And so even if this
ingredient isn't something

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.630
that appeals to
everyone, it's really sad

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.170
that it might disappear
when he disappears.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.420
I have a picture
here of puffins.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.160
And that's another ingredient
I think in Iceland that it's

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.440
a part of Icelandic tradition,
but not necessarily something

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.240
that you would--

00:20:27.122 --> 00:20:29.580
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: It's very
like-- what do you call it?

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.590
It's very like, a local thing.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.000
So he's not just everywhere.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.630
But, yeah definitely like
[INAUDIBLE] and Grimsey,

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.310
they will have a lot of it,
[INAUDIBLE] and in the west.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.540
But now it's
protected, in a way.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.026
I think you're allowed
to go and hunt it,

00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:51.400
but you're not
allowed to sell it

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.260
and you're not allowed to
sell it in the restaurants.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.040
Yeah, but it's a very
big tradition in Iceland

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.010
to eat those.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:04.480
And not only those, but to a lot
of birds in their same family,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.220
and even at a time of
some of their eggs.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.860
JODY EDDY: And here's a photo
of somebody baking-- I'm sorry,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.700
cooking, eggs in
geothermal water.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.160
And again, that's an old
tradition that is not common

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.830
anymore, but it is
something from the past

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.835
that I think is really
fascinating and very uniquely

00:21:25.835 --> 00:21:26.335
Iceland.

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:33.510
And so I just thought we could
talk a little bit about what

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:39.140
Viking stock is, if
you can address that,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.920
and talk about why
Iceland's animals are

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.350
truly unique in the world?

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.000
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
So it's like Iceland

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.680
has those rules somehow like
to protect their species.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:00.500
So it's illegal
to, for an example,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.102
if you were going to take this
horse to a show in Denmark,

00:22:04.102 --> 00:22:05.560
you're not allowed
to take it back.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:12.630
And you're not allowed to
import other types of horses.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.300
And this goes for, more
or less, every animal.

00:22:16.105 --> 00:22:17.480
JODY EDDY: And
these were animals

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.900
that were introduced by the
Vikings in the 9th century.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.610
So they are unique species
on the planet because they

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.435
have never bred
with other species.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.480
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Exactly.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.480
And it's is like-- maybe you
can speak about your goats?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.440
JODY EDDY: We met a
goat farmer in Iceland

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.770
who had been a
nurse in Reykjavik.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.340
And she quit her job
maybe eight years ago

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.660
because the Icelandic
goat population

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.730
had dipped to below 90 animals.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.010
And she realized that if
she didn't do something,

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.300
they might go extinct.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.600
And so the goat
population now hovers

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.470
around 900 animals in Iceland.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:05.630
And, truly, thanks to
Johanna Thorvaldsdottir,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.910
I think, because
of her work, people

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.550
are starting to appreciate
the goats again and really see

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.380
that it's important
to not only protect

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.770
the goats for the sake of
the goats but it's a legacy

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.280
and it's history that
they're protecting.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.890
But Johanna runs the
only commercial goat

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.650
farm in Iceland.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.440
And she has about 400 of
the goats on her farm.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.830
And her farm was about to go
into foreclosure-- actually,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.510
next week.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.600
And so they were going to
slaughter her goats, which

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.920
would mean it would wipe
out half the population.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.670
And so we started an
Indiegogo campaign for her,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.460
just me and a friend.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.600
And we've raised over
$110,000 in about a month.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.810
And her farm will be safe now,
and her goats will be saved.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.930
But I think the
important thing about it

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.570
is that it really
speaks to the fact

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.210
that the Icelandic
people are starting

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.930
to appreciate what they have.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.170
And she has said to me,
since this campaign started,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.860
her tours on the farm have
increased exponentially

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.800
because now there
is an appreciation.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.880
And I think it speaks to what
you're all about as well,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.000
that you have often used
ingredients that weren't

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.730
necessarily-- they weren't
used by Icelandic people,

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.320
such as blue mussels.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.684
They have the most beautiful,
pristine blue muscles

00:24:26.684 --> 00:24:28.350
in Iceland, but they
weren't using them.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.820
And then when they
show up on your table,

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.274
they start to show up on
other restaurant tables.

00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:35.190
And then maybe they're
bought by the consumer,

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.990
and it's just interesting
to watch it trickle out.

00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:40.170
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Definately, definitely.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.660
And I mean like a lot of other
things, like for seaweed,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.960
for an example.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.510
JODY EDDY: This
is actually-- he's

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.170
the seaweed and blue
mussel harvester

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.450
that Gunnar works with.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.350
Can you talk a little bit
more about him and his work?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.290
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, so his name is Simon.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.470
He lives in the west.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.400
He lives on the Snaefellsnes.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.300
So he has a small company.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.980
I think there are like three
or something working there.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.220
And so he grows blue
mussels and then

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.880
he collects a couple
types of seaweed

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.190
and sells to the
local restaurants.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.650
And he is even exporting
some of his seaweed as well.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.348
So he's doing great.

00:25:32.348 --> 00:25:35.631
JODY EDDY: Absolutely, so we'll
get to some of our producers

00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:36.130
here.

00:25:37.546 --> 00:25:40.925
So these are some of the herbs
that they use in Iceland.

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:43.330
And what are some of
those common herbs

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.580
that you'd find in
your kitchen at Dill?

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.495
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Well, I
use probably most of angelica.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.140
Angelica, maybe chervil,
those are probably

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.100
the most common ones
that I use a lot.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.540
Arctic thyme obviously,
really, really delicious,

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.910
especially when it's in bloom.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.140
But it's like, then
we take the trees,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.280
we go for birch trees,
pine trees and et cetera.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.520
And probably like the best
part about foraging in Iceland

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.890
is there are pretty much
nothing in the nature

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.760
that will actually kill
you if you taste it.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.070
So you can actually go,
you can just go there.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.087
You just go and taste
everything and you don't really

00:26:34.087 --> 00:26:35.045
have to worry about it.

00:26:35.045 --> 00:26:36.319
So that's pretty good.

00:26:36.319 --> 00:26:37.360
JODY EDDY: It's very fun.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.580
So Gunnar and I-- these are just
a few shots of Iceland itself.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.179
And we traveled, we probably
ringed the country--

00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:44.970
two or three times?

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.080
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, probably.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.880
JODY EDDY: We hit every
corner of Iceland.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.080
And it is very fun
to travel with him,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.770
because you do eat
everything and you

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.100
learn so much about
what's around you.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.380
And I found myself, when I
travel in other countries,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.430
thinking about now
what I could try

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:02.770
that I'm seeing on the ground.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:07.960
And so these are just a few
shots of us on our road trip,

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.650
Gunnar relaxing.

00:27:09.724 --> 00:27:11.640
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
There is no place better

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.030
to relax than Icelandic moss.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.685
JODY EDDY: It's really, I
think, maybe challenging.

00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:20.170
Our photographer, his
name is Evan Sung,

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.610
he's talked about how it's
challenging in Iceland

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.850
because everything is beautiful
and every corner that you turn,

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.750
it feels more beautiful
than the last.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:33.220
And it's a good problem to have,
but it can be overwhelming.

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:35.150
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
A thing as well

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.830
is like one of the first
ideas about this book

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.480
was because I really
wanted to have it

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.540
in almost three chapters.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.320
I wanted to try to talk a
lot about our producers,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.940
and especially
those that are doing

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.845
their traditional stuff and
maybe kind of fading out.

00:27:56.845 --> 00:27:59.880
And I really wanted to have
a whole lot of landscape,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.750
because that somehow
it's like-- that's

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.900
what inspires me, mostly.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.826
And then of course,
like the food.

00:28:07.826 --> 00:28:08.750
So it's-- yeah.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.560
JODY EDDY: This is bacalao,
which is salted cod.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.160
And can you talk a
little bit about Elvar,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.470
our bacalao producer
in the book.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.595
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:24.530
So I've been buying
bacalao from Elvar

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.720
for a lot of years,
many years actually.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.030
He lives in a really,
really small village

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.075
in the North part of
Iceland called Hauganes.

00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:37.330
I think it's like 70 people
or something that lives there.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.020
And I think it's
like-- I think he said,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.860
I asked how many people
there from the village

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.290
actually worked for him.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.820
I think he said all, except
two old ladies or something.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.770
JODY EDDY: He sustains
his entire village

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.470
with his bacalao factory.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.261
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
He's a fantastic guy.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:04.170
So he's like third generation
of salted cod maker.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.490
So what he has
there is obviously

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.410
very important and dear to him.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.990
So he uses like
this old technique,

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:23.080
so it takes up to a year
to make it, to salt it.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.630
And then they put it in
water actually, after.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.510
And he makes two kinds.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.350
He makes this one,
and then he makes

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.090
one that is dried out
in the sun as well.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.970
And you can only imagine how
often that is in Iceland.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.480
It's like it rains
constantly, so it's--

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.690
JODY EDDY: It's a challenge.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.898
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah,
you have to jump out dry,

00:29:45.898 --> 00:29:48.680
and-- so it's a challenge.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.320
But as well, it's a lot
of fun to go and visit

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.500
him and talk to him.

00:29:57.372 --> 00:30:02.740
And get all his feelings
that he has for his company.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.310
And it makes it so much more
fun to actually use the product.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.550
And even to hear him say
like we've been asking him

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.290
if he's pressing
his kids because--

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.420
JODY EDDY: To take over.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.128
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Yeah, to take over,

00:30:18.128 --> 00:30:19.620
because they have
to be the fourth.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.120
JODY EDDY: He was
telling me that he

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.760
might skip his daughters but
that his grandchildren are

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.190
very interested.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.260
But I think Elvar
really speaks to me

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:38.020
about-- if his work disappears,
he is maybe the last,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.909
if not one of the last
bacalao producers in Iceland.

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:43.200
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: I think
there are probably three.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:43.900
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.410
And so he's a very
jovial person, one

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.960
of the funniest people I've
ever met in Iceland or anywhere.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.830
But his work is important.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.390
It's really critical.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.070
There was always that question
in the book to each producer,

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.390
will somebody take over
this work do you think?

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.044
With him there's optimism
there because his grandkids

00:31:02.044 --> 00:31:02.835
do seem interested.

00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:05.230
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.834
Definitely.

00:31:05.834 --> 00:31:07.750
JODY EDDY: But it's been
interesting, as well,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.791
to meet with these producers
throughout the years

00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:12.130
because, you know, with
Elvar, he was really

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.600
struggling after that
economic collapse.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.285
And I visited him.

00:31:16.285 --> 00:31:18.110
I do some Iceland
culinary tours,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.800
and I visited him
maybe last month.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.740
And he's doing better.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.200
He's selling to companies
throughout Europe.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:32.100
So it's been really great
to watch their evolution

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.750
and to see that they're
surviving and thriving

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.250
in some cases.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.580
So this is the Arctic char
that you actually tried today.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.525
Can you talk a little bit
about him and his work?

00:31:45.525 --> 00:31:46.650
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.420
Those are the ones
that are smoking

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.810
the old traditional way, the
one with the lamb manure.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.392
So his name is Gisli, and
he's married to my niece.

00:31:58.392 --> 00:31:59.220
JODY EDDY: Cousin.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.428
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Cousin.

00:32:00.928 --> 00:32:04.000
And they live in
[INAUDIBLE] which

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.450
is in the north part of
Iceland, actually not

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.940
so far away from
where I actually come.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.580
I pretty much told you
all about that technique

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.980
about that smoking.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:23.250
But it's actually a good story
as well because he actually

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.465
smokes his fish like this so
it still has a lot of skin

00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:28.270
and a lot of bones on it.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.100
He will then, after
smoking, he will cut off

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.130
the bones and all that stuff.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.220
And he actually
puts it in barrels

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.500
and keeps the barrels outside
pretty much fermenting

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.820
until the winter.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.640
And then he actually
gets the sheeps

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.386
into the houses and he
actually feeds it to the--

00:32:48.386 --> 00:32:49.260
JODY EDDY: The bones.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.843
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
--to the sheeps.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.745
So it's like this
really nice circle

00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:55.620
because then they do
their thing on the floor

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.370
and he uses it to smoke it.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.170
JODY EDDY: And these are
the geothermal bread ovens

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.720
that you tasted the
geothermal bread today.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.580
And talk a little bit about
that and that tradition.

00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:12.270
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Especially in [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.150
it's a big, big tradition.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.105
And each family usually
has their own hole.

00:33:20.105 --> 00:33:22.442
So it's like they just--

00:33:22.442 --> 00:33:24.650
JODY EDDY: That they inherit
through the generations.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.899
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Exactly.

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:27.240
So they just continue using it.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.030
And it's actually
quite interesting,

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.020
you would think that they
would have to dig quite deep,

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.730
but it's not deep at all.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.200
It's just like this
and the heat is there.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.240
JODY EDDY: They put their batter
in a bucket or sometimes a milk

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.995
container and they leave it
for 24 hours and it cooks.

00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:45.245
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Exactly.

00:33:45.245 --> 00:33:45.745
Yeah.

00:33:45.745 --> 00:33:48.754
And usually it's baked in
those used milk containers

00:33:48.754 --> 00:33:49.420
for some reason.

00:33:50.805 --> 00:33:51.930
JODY EDDY: And there it is.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.720
They sometimes call
it geyser bread.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.450
And then this is a lamb
farmer that we met.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.820
And tell her story
and his story.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.739
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: I
actually used to work on a farm

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:12.467
back in the days for his
grandmother and grandfather.

00:34:15.615 --> 00:34:19.260
So actually after his father and
mother stopped being farmers,

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.250
he took over their farm.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.150
And that farm is
called Mother Daughter,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:29.060
and there's no farm in Iceland
that is on a higher level

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.060
than their farm is.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.030
And it's actually
really impressive

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.130
to come there and meet
them and especially

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.250
see their sheeps actually,
because it's so high up

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.550
and there's so little grass.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.049
So those sheeps, really
have to-- well, there's

00:34:49.049 --> 00:34:53.679
obviously a lot of grass
there-- but it's very, sandy.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.750
JODY EDDY: That's
a turf house, so--

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.409
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
It's very sandy.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.033
So the sheeps, they
really have to work

00:34:58.033 --> 00:35:01.950
hard to find the right spots
and they do a lot of climbing.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.445
And they are massive.

00:35:03.445 --> 00:35:06.850
They are really,
really in good shape.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.805
JODY EDDY: And this is a
barley farmer in the east.

00:35:10.805 --> 00:35:12.590
He has a farm called Vallanes.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.770
Just quickly, Iceland
had prohibition on beer

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.580
until, I think, the 1990s.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.577
And so they lost
their barley tradition

00:35:24.577 --> 00:35:26.660
because they weren't using
it for beer any longer.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.780
And he is really an
incredible person.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.660
I feel he maybe
single-handedly returned

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.210
the tradition of using barley
to the Icelandic people.

00:35:38.295 --> 00:35:39.420
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.420
I think he's like one of very
few that actually grows barley.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.090
And it seems to go
very well for him.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.175
He as well makes a whole lot
of fantastic vegetables--

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.510
JODY EDDY: That's
his barley fields.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.594
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
--that are organic and nice.

00:35:53.594 --> 00:35:54.093
Yeah.

00:35:54.093 --> 00:35:54.910
This is his barley.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.840
JODY EDDY: And he started
this farm in an area

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.330
where there were no trees.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.660
And he said the
elevation is pretty high.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.360
And he said there was criticism
of him in the beginning

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.680
because they said there's
not enough oxygen there

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.860
to grow your barley.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.174
And he said, you know what?

00:36:10.174 --> 00:36:11.590
I'm going to create
my own oxygen.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.950
And he started his
farm 25 years ago

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.620
and he's planted over a million
birch trees on his property.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.990
And he really has
created his own forest

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.580
and his own ecosystem.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.210
He's incredibly inspiring.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.520
He has a company now
called Modir Jord

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.300
that sells his barley
and other products.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.050
And you see it everywhere
in Iceland now.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.030
And, again, when I started
traveling in Iceland

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.530
you couldn't find it anywhere.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.180
And it's encouraging
to see now that there's

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.205
an interest in Iceland
for these products.

00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:41.670
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.170
Definitely.

00:36:47.466 --> 00:36:53.490
When the crisis actually hit us,
which was obviously not really

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:57.770
good, but there came a lot of
good things out of it, though.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.130
There seemed to be like a lot of
people that actually obviously

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.350
lost their jobs, and they
would start thinking, OK, now I

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.550
have to do something else.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:10.580
And there was no job to
get, so they pretty much had

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.080
to find out something
new, something

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.970
that they would like to do,
something that they obviously

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:17.810
knew.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.950
So they opened up like a
whole lot of new companies

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.059
doing really, really
interesting things.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:24.600
JODY EDDY: And I
think as well, we've

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.450
talked about how with
the economic crisis,

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.300
beforehand everyone was
importing everything.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.317
And so they have this incredible
lamb, an amazing smoked lamb,

00:37:34.317 --> 00:37:36.400
but they were importing
prosciutto and eating that

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.106
instead.

00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:38.980
I mean, I think that's
a really good example.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.870
And after the crisis they could
no longer afford to do that.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.610
And so they started to
appreciate their smoked lamb,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.050
their other products that
were right around them

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.392
at their feet.

00:37:50.392 --> 00:37:51.850
And it's certainly
a silver lining.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.990
You endured so much.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.490
But--

00:37:55.205 --> 00:37:56.330
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:56.829
Definitely.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.850
JODY EDDY: Can you talk a little
bit about the dairy in Iceland?

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.840
Icelanders consume
more dairy, I think,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.707
than any other
population in the world.

00:38:05.707 --> 00:38:07.290
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
I'm pretty sure.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.956
JODY EDDY: Talk a
little bit about skyr.

00:38:09.065 --> 00:38:10.190
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:14.892
I think with the
dairies, I mean,

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:16.850
there's not so much to
say about them, I guess.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.010
They are really good.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.230
But the biggest
tradition probably

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.870
is an Icelandic milk
product called skyr.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.400
It's somewhere between a
yogurt and a cheese, actually.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.920
And it's actually originally
it's made with live bacterias.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.100
So the farmers would usually
just skim their milk,

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.130
so they would take
all the cream away.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.360
And they took the
fat free milk out.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.600
And even the story says that
when they were moving or were

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.813
starting a farm somewhere,
they would split it

00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:55.860
in a couple of
jars-- take one down

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.670
to the river, another
one to the sea,

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.830
and one up to the
mountain or something

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.383
so they could find
out where they

00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:04.140
could find the best starter.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.850
So they would have
some live bacterias

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.890
that they would sit down in
the milk and actually make it,

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.305
what do you call it?

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.484
Curdle, right?

00:39:14.484 --> 00:39:15.150
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.180
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
And then they

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.510
would get this product skyr,
and the other one called whey.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:29.290
That's like-- skyr is-- it's
like everybody in Iceland

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.064
eats it at least
once a day, I think.

00:39:31.064 --> 00:39:31.980
JODY EDDY: Absolutely.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.600
GUNNAR KARL
GISLASON: It's crazy.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.766
JODY EDDY: And it's amazing.

00:39:34.265 --> 00:39:39.290
This is a birch forager
and producer that we met.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:43.529
And if you tasted Gunnar's
schnapps and liqueur,

00:39:43.529 --> 00:39:45.070
this is the forest
that it came from.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.760
And the birch twig inside
is from this forest.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.560
I think she's in
the east, as well.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.000
And she also
produces birch syrup,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.300
which, again, I think was
a tradition that you used

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.400
to have in Iceland and it
would decrease a little bit.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.210
And she now sells her birch
syrup throughout Iceland.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.260
And it seems to be
something that Icelanders

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.969
are appreciating.

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.260
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Oh, yeah.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.780
Definitely.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.320
And she makes a lot of spice
blends and salts and et cetera,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.592
all just using the
birch three, actually.

00:40:17.008 --> 00:40:18.690
JODY EDDY: And there's
one of his sous

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.000
chefs with his birch tattoo.

00:40:20.965 --> 00:40:22.090
That's how important it is.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.670
This is the salt maker from
Saltverk, the geothermal salt

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.620
company that we covered.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.090
And I think that story's
very interesting.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.275
And tell a little bit more
about how that started.

00:40:34.275 --> 00:40:35.650
GUNNAR KARL
GISLASON: Definitely.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.520
Well it started
actually in Denmark.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.640
So there were like
two friends that

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.915
went to Denmark to
study to be engineers.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.560
For some reason that
I can't remember,

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.490
they started reading some
books, like old books.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.210
And then they found out that
the Danish king actually

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.600
had people making salt
in Iceland for him

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.020
back in the days.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.390
So they started to
take a look into that

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.552
and actually ended up opening
up their own salt company.

00:41:04.552 --> 00:41:06.260
JODY EDDY: And they're
doing really well.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.307
And that, again,
when we started,

00:41:09.307 --> 00:41:11.140
you really couldn't
find their salt anywhere

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.290
and now it's everywhere.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.510
Every restaurant table
that I saw last month

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.512
seemed to have
Saltverk on the table.

00:41:17.512 --> 00:41:18.220
It's encouraging.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.823
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
The thing as well

00:41:18.823 --> 00:41:20.073
is that it's like for Iceland.

00:41:20.073 --> 00:41:22.090
And in Iceland, at
the end of the day,

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.440
it's like we're only
like 320,000 people.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.040
So it's like, if
you will come up

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.230
with a product that is
actually really good,

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:32.800
it's actually kind of easy
to-- what do you call it?

00:41:34.439 --> 00:41:35.480
JODY EDDY: Distribute it?

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.896
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Get it
to the market, yeah, exactly.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.964
People will talk about it.

00:41:40.964 --> 00:41:41.630
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.796
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Like
one restaurant to another

00:41:43.796 --> 00:41:45.600
or one house mother to another.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.114
People will talk and
it will go really fast.

00:41:48.114 --> 00:41:50.030
But at the same time,
it's like if you come up

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.290
with something horrible
it's never going to work.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.581
JODY EDDY: Because everyone's
going to talk about that.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.710
And this is hardfiskur
that you tried today.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:06.980
So, again, what I
think is inspiring

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.680
as well in Iceland
is they really try,

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.500
I think, to use
all their products.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.460
So these are drying racks.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.850
They use only the fillets
of the wolffish fish

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.440
for the hardfiskur,
but they then

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.620
dry the heads and the
bones and they send them

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.540
to parts of Africa where
they're used in stews.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.665
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:25.164
Exactly.

00:42:28.474 --> 00:42:30.140
A lot of those
companies, and especially

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.639
the companies in
fish, they will try

00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:35.880
to use every single
part of the fish.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.010
And it's the same as
like with the restaurant.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.260
It's something that we focus
really, really hard on.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:47.800
We want to get whole pieces
of whatever we are buying

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.510
and we want to use
every single part of it.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.800
Or even if we are not
going to buy whole things,

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.860
we will buy some strange part
that nobody else is using.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.800
As well, it's like
with everything--

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.290
like with vegetables,
for example--

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:09.690
it's like we try to use
if it comes with roots

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.290
and it comes with the
leaves, we will use it all.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:20.560
And unfortunately, so many
farmers and people in general,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.310
they don't know
what-- like, they

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.620
will get a celeriac
or something.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.850
And they will get it
so they have already

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.290
cut the roots and
the leaves off,

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:34.530
which is a shame because it's
really, really good, as well.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.090
So we try to talk
about those things

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.850
and get people to bring the
whole thing so we can just

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:41.350
use it.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.160
We even have our
farmers bringing us

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.240
the wheat that grows
around the vegetables

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.020
because we will use
that for salad, as well.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.880
Everything from like
the peel from the onions

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.291
we will put on a hot plate
in summer until it's dry,

00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.790
and then we'll use
it to smoke with.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.360
So we try to question
every single piece that

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.570
goes into the truss and
ask, what can I do with it?

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.070
JODY EDDY: I think this is
the blue mussel producer

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.770
that Gunnar works with.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.600
And he has told
this story about how

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.750
when Gunnar started
placing his mussel orders,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.030
they were the only
orders coming in.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.840
And he would go out to
sea to collect sometimes

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.790
2 kilos for you and that was it.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.190
And now he really is
having a hard time,

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.216
I think, keeping up with
business and the demand.

00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:32.340
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.450
I think it's going good.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.908
JODY EDDY: But I
think it certainly

00:44:34.908 --> 00:44:37.560
speaks to you just
really putting

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.070
that on the table at Dill and
allowing people to experience

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.800
it and then to want it
everywhere they go in Iceland.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.120
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.570
And for me it's really fun
to keep this good connection

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:57.040
to those guys and being able
to know what is behind it

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.600
and what they have been
doing or sacrificing

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.700
to bring those products to me.

00:45:04.954 --> 00:45:05.830
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.330
Absolutely.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.575
And this is our sea
bird egg collector.

00:45:08.575 --> 00:45:09.700
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.650
So this is out in Grimsey.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.900
It's actually the
northest part of Iceland.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.420
It's a three hour
trip on a ship.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.125
JODY EDDY: It's an island
on the Arctic Circle.

00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:22.250
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.900
It's a very small island.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.399
Yeah.

00:45:23.399 --> 00:45:25.750
The Arctic Circle goes
through it, literally.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:31.100
And my friend, Sigi, he actually
goes on a rope down those

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.190
cliffs to collect those eggs.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.900
JODY EDDY: There's
some pictures of him.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:35.950
It's really intense.

00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:39.000
And they're not attached, too.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.530
In contemporary climbing, you
attach yourself to the ground,

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.320
but his rope was wrapped
around a tractor hitch

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.190
that Gunnar was holding,
and that was it.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:53.820
And we asked him if
there are ever accidents

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.265
and he said, yeah, all the time.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.220
But he continues to do his work.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.280
And it's inspiring, but
a little disconcerting

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.320
too, what he's doing
to collect those eggs.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.360
But I think certainly,
again, it speaks

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.690
to the perseverance
and the determination

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.600
to keep tradition alive
amongst some people.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.230
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
And it's funny,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.770
he would go and collect them
and then he just has a lot.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.440
And the other people
from the island,

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.990
they will know that
he went yesterday

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.880
and then they'll come
and get a couple of eggs.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.690
JODY EDDY: They have kind
of a collecting area, right?

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.240
A cooler.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.230
There's 86 people on
the island, so it's

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.546
a small, tight-knit community.

00:46:30.546 --> 00:46:32.670
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: A
very, very small community.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.378
JODY EDDY: The eggs
are shaped like cones

00:46:34.378 --> 00:46:36.800
because the birds
don't build nests.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.105
And so they just have
evolved into cones

00:46:39.105 --> 00:46:40.980
so they don't roll off
the side of the cliff.

00:46:41.921 --> 00:46:42.545
Very practical.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.780
And we had some fantastic
hard boiled sea bird eggs

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.310
that night.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.870
Sigi is also a
fisherman and so we

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.410
went out with him about 40
kilometers into the ocean

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.400
and fished.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.940
And he, as well, talked
about the challenges

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.985
with the fishing quotas now.

00:47:06.985 --> 00:47:09.750
The government can
be-- it's a struggle.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.290
And he's actually gone north.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.580
His family is not
from the island.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.440
They used to fish in
the southern parts,

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.130
but because the fish are moving
further north because probably

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:24.099
from global warming, he's had to
move north to follow the fish.

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:25.640
But he's on the top
of the world now.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.360
So you have to wonder what
he's going to do next.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.526
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: He's
not going any more north.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.960
JODY EDDY: And this is some of
the goat sausage from the goat

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.304
farmer that we mentioned before.

00:47:38.304 --> 00:47:39.720
And those are her
Icelandic goats.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.650
There's Gunnar.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.780
We spent a lot of time
with those goats one day.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:45.900
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.775
That was pretty neat.

00:47:47.195 --> 00:47:48.320
JODY EDDY: There's Johanna.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.270
And these are the lava fields on
the way to the hakarl producer.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.485
He's the shark maker.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:02.610
And there's his putrefied shark.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.460
He eats his shark--

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.660
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
It tastes like cheese.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.201
JODY EDDY: It supposedly tastes
like a really strong Stilton.

00:48:09.779 --> 00:48:10.320
I don't know.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.450
I've had it a few
times and I could never

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:13.500
discover that flavor.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.160
He eats a shark sandwich
every day, this producer.

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:20.260
And he swears by it.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.180
And he's 80 and his
skin is fantastic.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.530
I think there's something
to the shark oil.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.075
And he's so enthusiastic
about his work.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.220
And there's the
shark fermenting.

00:48:34.492 --> 00:48:35.950
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
They actually

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.370
start with like fermenting
the sharks in those barrels

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.820
under like a pressure before
they actually then hang them up

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.750
to dry.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.880
JODY EDDY: Here's some
pictures from our photo shoots.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.240
It was really challenging
to shoot outside.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.530
So we didn't do all
of our shoots inside.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.165
With Icelandic weather--

00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:00.510
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: So
if you're doing a book

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:01.910
and the photographer
says that he

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.600
wants to use the natural light
because it's so beautiful,

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.500
don't listen to him.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.340
JODY EDDY: Just say no.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:12.380
In a rainstorm all his mise en
place strewn across the stones.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.970
It was a challenge.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.560
And there's Gunnar's-- I love
this picture-- your daughter,

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.437
who is contemplating
one of your dishes.

00:49:20.437 --> 00:49:22.020
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
Checking it out.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.080
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.580
Absolutely.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.590
And for the book Gunnar's
friend, August, took us out

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.020
in his prop plane and we
did some aerial shots.

00:49:32.397 --> 00:49:33.480
I was sitting in the back.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.450
It was a little
nerve-racking every time

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.450
he would open up the
window and they would shoot

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.310
and then he would
tip to the side right

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.910
over the volcano
that had exploded

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:45.677
in 2011 or over
a glacier, but we

00:49:45.677 --> 00:49:47.260
did what we had to
do to get the shot.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.740
It was really fascinating
to see Iceland

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.260
after all these
years from the air

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.593
and see how it all fit together.

00:49:58.655 --> 00:50:02.080
I have a picture here of coffee.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.000
I think it really speaks
to where Iceland is at now

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.440
and how it's evolved
since the crisis.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.970
This is a friend of Gunnar's
who runs this company.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:16.150
And I think just the care that's
going into his product I think

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:20.860
speaks to a lot of the care and
diligence that a lot of people

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:25.720
have now to creating artisanal
beers and products that really

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.780
are of high quality and using
Icelandic-- coffee isn't

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:33.820
an Icelandic ingredient, but
in terms of just focusing on

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.855
of making it the best.

00:50:35.305 --> 00:50:36.430
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.650
Actually if you're
importing it, then you

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.134
should import something good.

00:50:41.134 --> 00:50:41.800
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.460
Absolutely.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:45.260
To talk a little bit about
the serviceware in the book,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.320
everything was sourced
from Icelandic potters.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.110
And we even had some of
the service wear brought

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.939
from the National Art Museum
that he was shooting on,

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:56.230
and then we had to run it
back to the museum that night

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.400
because they were not happy.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:04.010
But even some of the pelts that
are used in the background,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.335
we had a seal pelt and reindeer
hides and it's very inspiring.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.890
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON:
And it's all right now

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.662
everything at the restaurant.

00:51:16.662 --> 00:51:17.995
So those pictures are actually--

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.980
JODY EDDY: Those are my
photos that I took at dinner.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.940
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: They
are from our ex-location.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.690
So we just moved
like four months ago.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.150
And if I was moving
anyway, we decided

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.330
to take the whole
thing even further,

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.820
make it even more Icelandic.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.660
So now everything
in the restaurant--

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.830
like the chairs, the
tables, every plate,

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.210
and all this stuff, everything
is handcrafted in Iceland.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.230
We have some lamb
leather on the chairs.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:58.350
And it's really, really, really
pretty and it's very Icelandic.

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.330
And I'm very happy.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.110
JODY EDDY: Very
much you, I think.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:05.486
GUNNAR KARL
GISLASON: Definitely.

00:52:05.486 --> 00:52:07.526
JODY EDDY: So there's our
photographer and Gunnar

00:52:07.526 --> 00:52:08.050
on the road.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.405
Does anybody have any questions?

00:52:09.957 --> 00:52:12.040
AUDIENCE: You've obviously
done a really great job

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.840
of telling the story
of the producers

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.860
and the origins of the
ingredients and everything.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.960
Is that a responsibility
that more chefs should do?

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.500
Is it something that needs to
be done in more restaurants?

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.810
And if so, how best to
do it to a dining crowd

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.920
that's here to eat
their meal and then they

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.090
leave to do something else.

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.175
How do you balance
the story that you've

00:52:33.175 --> 00:52:35.300
told in the book with the
guests in the restaurant?

00:52:35.555 --> 00:52:36.680
GUNNAR KARL GISLASON: Yeah.

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:43.270
I definitely think that those
stories should be told more.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.550
But, obviously, I
mean, I really don't

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:48.610
know how the situation
is somewhere else.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.220
But I just felt
really like in Iceland

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.170
and especially at this time
that those stories should

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:59.430
come out and I really,
really just wanted

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:02.780
to embrace those things that
they were doing because I was

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:07.547
really, really impressed
with their stuff.

00:53:07.547 --> 00:53:09.130
JODY EDDY: Thank you
for coming today.

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.380
