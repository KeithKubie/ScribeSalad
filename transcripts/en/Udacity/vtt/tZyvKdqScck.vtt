00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.780
Here's a helpful rule that
is worth writing down.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.970
Whenever you multiply two
integers that have the same sign

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.070
the product will always be positive.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.663
For these pairs of integers, do you
think their products will be positive or

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:16.381
negative?

00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.379
