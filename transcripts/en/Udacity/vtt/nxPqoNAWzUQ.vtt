00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is exhausting the frontier won't work,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because the frontier might be infinite.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this particular problem, there's only a finite number of states,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but in some problems there might be an infinite number.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we kept on generating new elements onto the frontier

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we may never get to the end.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Doing one step won't do it either.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this case, if once we found the solution from this 14,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we then gave all the other guys one step, it would work in this case.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But it might be that it took two steps.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Maybe from the 15 there'd be one step that costs 1 and another step that cost 2.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I might not just be one step, so that's not going to work.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The test later part will work.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The reason it works is because now we've guaranteed

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that everybody on the frontier is sorted,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we're pulling off the shortest one first.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we put it back onto the frontier rather than recognizing immediately that it's a goal,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
then since we're pulling them off in order of increasing cost,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then we know that the first one we pull off the frontier that is a goal

00:01:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that must be the cheapest path to the goal.
