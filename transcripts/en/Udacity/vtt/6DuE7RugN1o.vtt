00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.430
In the first lesson, we are able to simplify radicals because they were perfect

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.635
squares or perfect cubes. But not everything we come across is going to be so

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.770
perfect. What about this square? If this square had area of two units squared,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.826
what do we think of the side length of the side link would be? Choose one of

00:00:16.826 --> 00:00:20.654
these answers for the side length, is this one of these numbers or it is

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.923
something else?
