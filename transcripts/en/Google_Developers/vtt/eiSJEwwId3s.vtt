IKAI LAN: Hey, guys.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.700
Welcome to another edition of
YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.590
We're here in York City
in the studio.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.190
We have Mark and Sandeep.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.500
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Hi, guys.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.430
IKAI LAN: They're here from
BuzzFeed, and they're going to

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.580
talk to us about using BuzzFeed
in their mobile

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.500
application.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.370
So first off, before we get
started, why don't we go ahead

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.820
and tell people what
BuzzFeed is.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.030
MARK SHUSTER: So, BuzzFeed is
the best place on the internet

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.670
to get new, irreverent,
breaking, and viral content,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.530
and then share it with
your friends.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.280
IKAI LAN: Best place?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220
MARK SHUSTER: Absolutely.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.440
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: And it's
full of cute cats.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.230
MARK SHUSTER: And corgis.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.440
IKAI LAN: What makes
it the best place?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.690
MARK SHUSTER: We have a big
editorial staff that's out

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.390
there combing the internet for
the best content, and putting

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.570
it together in a way that makes
you want to read it,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.080
makes you want to share
it with your friends.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.300
We've kind of taken it
to a whole new level.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: And we have
the best users who are

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.010
sharing it across the web.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.495
IKAI LAN: The best users.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.340
You hear that?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.530
If you're using BuzzFeed,
you're the best users.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.060
In the words of Mark
and Sandeep.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.720
MARK SHUSTER: Absolutely.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.110
IKAI LAN: So tell us what you
guys do for BuzzFeed.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.440
MARK SHUSTER: So I'm
a senior designer.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.180
I work primarily on our mobile
products across all platforms.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: And I'm
the director of mobile

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.460
technology.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.190
As such, I lead the
mobile apps team.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.650
IKAI LAN: So if you haven't
gotten the hint yet, this is a

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.620
show about mobile.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.020
So being that it is a show about
mobile, why don't you go

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.730
ahead and show us the
mobile application?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.280
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Certainly.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.370
It's an awesome app.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.050
IKAI LAN: Ahh, it's
a praying mantis!

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.270
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Sorry.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.520
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.760
Here's our YouTube
integration.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.330
IKAI LAN: Your YouTube
integration is a mantis?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.150
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yes.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.530
It's a true fact about praying
mantis by Ze Frank.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.780
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.820
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: It's in
fullscreen, so let's go back

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.600
and see how this came up.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.645
IKAI LAN: So where are we now?

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:04.990
What are we looking at here?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.530
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: This
is a Buzz page.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.110
MARK SHUSTER: An article.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.150
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI:
An article.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.260
It's from Ze Frank.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.770
And it's about the true
facts about mantis.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.800
And we have an embedded
YouTube video.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.310
However, the web view is
displaying an image, and as

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.000
the user taps, we intercept the
tap and launch the YouTube

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.520
player in the app.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.740
So this provides a seamless
integration to the user, and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.710
they can share this video,
email their friends,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.320
or tweet about it.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.260
MARK SHUSTER: So outside of Buzz
pages specifically, you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.650
can see that this
is the overall

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.940
architecture of our app.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.480
You can find our main
feed, essentially--

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.100
our newest content--

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.350
on the home screen.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.210
Our various sections and
verticals that we've launched

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.040
in the last year.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.930
We have almost 11 of
them at this point.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.670
If you're interested in
politics, technology, food.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.050
We even have an animals
vertical.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.730
If all you want to do is look
at cute animals all day, you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.000
can do that, too.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.890
You as a user can go on and
react to content with your

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.060
favorite reaction.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.780
If you think it's LOL, if you
think it's a fail, win, if you

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.890
just can't believe
it and it's OMG.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.780
You can see content sort
of that way as well.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.580
And then you can see what's hot,
on BuzzFeed and on the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.060
web with our partners online.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.920
We're partnered with dozens
of websites that give us

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.750
analytics, and we link
out to them as well.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.100
IKAI LAN: So you guys didn't
start out as a mobile app, if

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.770
I'm not mistaken.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.750
You guys started
out on the web.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.365
So what were some of the
motivations of building a

00:03:59.365 --> 00:03:59.910
mobile application?

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.590
Now, this might seem kind of
silly, only because it seems

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.750
like the thing that
everyone's doing.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.470
But usually, it's a good idea
to have a very good

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.830
reason for doing so.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.800
MARK SHUSTER: Absolutely.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.280
BuzzFeed started as a community
based website, and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.440
we wanted to go where
our users were.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.959
A lot of our really heavy
users are on the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.149
site all the time.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.310
They're digging through content,
they're reacting and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.410
sharing content.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.750
And the mobile experience
is just a more intimate

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.885
experience where they can have
that interaction in the palm

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:33.760
of their hand, and very easily
be able to find the things

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.070
that they're interested in.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.870
So we wanted to branch out onto
where our users were, and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.050
give them the tools that they
need to kind of enjoy our

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.390
content the best.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.120
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Plus, it
passes the one minute test.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.296
Say you're in a meeting,
and you're bored.

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:53.690
You launch the app, and you
can see the cute cats.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.430
MARK SHUSTER: Not that we
encourage looking at cute cats

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.540
during business meetings, but
you can with BuzzFeed.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.530
IKAI LAN: And do you guys
ever do this at

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.800
your meetings at BuzzFeed?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.110
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yes.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.520
MARK SHUSTER: It's part of our
job, actually, to look at cute

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.730
animals during meetings.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.550
IKAI LAN: So how long has the
mobile app been out there?

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.220
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: I'd say
it's been out there

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.560
for two years now.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.160
IKAI LAN: For two years.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.350
And you launched on iOS first,
and the Android version's been

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.870
out for how long?

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.080
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: A year
and a half to two.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.860
IKAI LAN: What are your primary
learnings after

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.880
launching a mobile application
in how your users differ in

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.270
web and mobile usage?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.460
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: We found
that the mobile app's users

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.200
are always on the app.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.600
They browse through the content
more than they browse

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.610
through our site.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.070
MARK SHUSTER: Right.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.220
Typical BuzzFeed users often
come to BuzzFeed when they're

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.380
linked in from Facebook or
Twitter, and they might not be

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.200
familiar with BuzzFeed.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.260
IKAI LAN: This is
BuzzFeed web.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.510
MARK SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.480
They'll be linked--

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.845
maybe they're on their phone,
looking at Facebook, and

00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:55.020
they'll be linked out onto
the BuzzFeed website.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.470
And they'll get their content,
but they might not stick with

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.420
BuzzFeed as a site.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.940
The difference, I think, in our
user base is that you have

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.590
these really dedicated users who
are using the app that are

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.390
firing it up multiple
times a day.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.760
They're digging through feeds
and feeds of content.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.500
And then they find the articles
that interest them.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.880
Where essentially, it's the
opposite, where you have

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.080
somebody that comes and sees an
article first, rather than

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.820
our great lists of content.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.870
And then we need to encourage
those people to either use the

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.350
app or engage more with our
mobile web content.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.760
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Exactly.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.670
They're more engaged
on the app.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.180
MARK SHUSTER: Absolutely.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.990
They're sharing more, they're
reacting more, they're more

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.430
engaged with the content
that we're producing.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.750
IKAI LAN: Do you notice any
major classes of users?

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.460
For instance, you guys
have mentioned

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.630
the very heavy users.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.570
But beyond the heavy users, are
there typical classes that

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.500
you would put them into?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.170
Like, the top three
or four buckets?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.110
MARK SHUSTER: I can try.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.400
No, I mean, I think you have--

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.080
as far as app users, I think,
there are people that are

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.450
going to react to a lot of
stuff, and maybe aren't going

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.510
to be as inclined to share
with other people.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.220
And there's a lot of people
that are just looking for

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.520
things that kind of
represent them.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.410
If they're really into animals,
they'll find the best

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.000
animals posts, and then they'll
have to show it to

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.480
their friends.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.500
They'll have to show it.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.310
And those people will
just share a lot.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.100
And then there are people that
are going to have their

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.460
favorite types of content.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.640
They're going to look at just
tech posts, or just politics.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.140
We have a great politics section
that's become really

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.140
big recently.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.940
And people can use the app and
just look at politics content,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.540
and they can just use that as
a new vector of obtaining

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.860
information about politics.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.440
So we want you to share, and
we want you to react and

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.110
engage, but really, we also want
you to be able to get the

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.180
kind of experience that you
want with the application

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.380
regardless.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.600
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yes.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.293
We do have casual users
who come to the

00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:03.500
app through the content.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.190
Either they saw it on the web,
or email link, or tweet.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.130
It's not just for
the heavy users.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.370
IKAI LAN: I think that's the
bucket that I fall into,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.670
because when I use BuzzFeed,
if I'm in line at the bank,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.130
and there's no one to talk
to, my first inkling--

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.700
I'm different from most people
in that I will talk to random

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.490
people on the street.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.290
And this is very awkward
for many people.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.990
But if there's no one to talk
to, I'll pull it out and I'll

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.760
look for a funny cat
picture to save and

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.929
send out for later.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.730
So on that note, what types of
analytics do you guys do, and

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.890
what are your most important
metrics?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.900
At least on mobile.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.120
And maybe if you can share
anything about the web, that'd

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.300
be great for our viewers
as well.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.710
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: We use
Google Analytics, obviously.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.900
IKAI LAN: Yay!

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.000
I did a show about Google
Analytics a few months ago.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.710
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Oh, nice.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.085
MARK SHUSTER: We have it
integrated in everything.

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:59.190
And I mean, we're interested
in pure how many people are

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.670
coming to the website, how many
people are using the app,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.680
but we also want to see how many
pages, how many articles

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.100
each of those people are using
to see, is our content

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.990
compelling enough?

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.950
Do we have more content
available for these people?

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.050
Is the content that we're
showing them relevant?

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.540
And then on the web side,
especially people who are not

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.480
familiar with BuzzFeed, they'll
see links to BuzzFeed

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.285
content on Facebook
or Twitter, and

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:23.220
they'll come here.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.000
And are they staying with us,
or are they bouncing off?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.040
So bounce rate's something
really important, because we

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.030
want to capture those people,
and we want to encourage them

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.850
to use our application.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.300
Because we know that if you're
interested in BuzzFeed

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.580
content, you're going
to love our app.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.890
You're going to love the kind of
content that's on the app.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.700
IKAI LAN: So I cannot
stress enough the

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.690
importance of using analytics.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.190
I'm not just talking about
Google Analytics.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.170
I mean, using data to
drive your decisions

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.540
and your app design.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.110
So I've got to ask
you guys this.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.510
What's something that's happened
in recent history

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.010
where you have used analytics
to make a decision about the

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.346
product or design or
type of articles--

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.700
article selection?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.540
MARK SHUSTER: Well, we get
really granular with analytics

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.200
at BuzzFeed.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.320
And we're always trying to
figure out new ways to

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.680
encourage people to
share content.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.070
So you might not see it every
time you look at it, but we're

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.620
always bucket testing what
kind of designs of share

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.470
buttons, where do we put them,
how do we prompt people?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.090
And so just recently, we did a
few AB tests on how buttons

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.560
and text labels, and we wanted
to see whether or not we show

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.040
you how many other people have
shared this content is going

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.580
to encourage you to share
more content.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.410
And we found that some of the
results were surprising.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.040
Some of them weren't.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.840
And based on that, we came
up with a new format for

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.450
displaying that information.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.220
IKAI LAN: Anything
you can share?

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.510
MARK SHUSTER: Well, we found
that people might not actually

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.380
care that there are 2,000 likes
on this article if they

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.910
really like it themselves.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.910
And our results were pretty much
inconclusive that just

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.640
because there's a count there
doesn't mean it's going to

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.790
make you share more.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.080
In fact, it was the opposite.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.290
So we put the text labels back
that tell you what the

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.390
button's going to do, and
I think people were more

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.320
inclined to click on something
where they knew what the

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.010
action was going to result in.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.890
And that was something we
learned through a test that

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.150
only took a week.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.650
And it's something that I think
everyone out there can

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.950
do with basic analytics
software.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.280
And we have a big data team at
BuzzFeed that is constantly,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.410
constantly crunching numbers
and trying to figure out

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.780
what's going viral, and the
best way to share it.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.580
What platforms, and--

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.513
IKAI LAN: I'm going to
ask you about that,

00:11:29.513 --> 00:11:29.730
just in a little bit.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.500
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:31.760
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yes.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.660
Not on the learning front, but
on the surprising front, ever

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.200
since we released the YouTube
integration on Android, the

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.750
number of videos played is
actually more than the number

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.700
of Facebook shares.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.540
IKAI LAN: Wow.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.960
That's amazing.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.150
And that's very encouraging
to our developers.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.050
So if you guys haven't started
integrating the YouTube API

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.350
yet, and you're doing any kind
of video sharing, I highly

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.330
encourage you to start looking
at the YouTube SDKs.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.540
So before we go on to technical
section, can you

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.440
share anything about the big
picture things that are

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.700
happening at BuzzFeed?

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.380
MARK SHUSTER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.220
There's a lot going on at
BuzzFeed right now, especially

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.690
with BuzzFeed video.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.550
We've hired Ze Frank to be our
VP of video production, and

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.140
he's out there creating brand
new custom content and posting

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.560
it to YouTube.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.940
IKAI LAN: A little bit of
background for our viewers

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.100
that don't know who
Ze Frank is.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.280
MARK SHUSTER: Yeah.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.390
Ze Frank is a great YouTube
personality who's been

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.160
creating videos for
a very long time.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.640
He was one of the pioneers
of YouTube video.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.460
And he's really talented
and really funny.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.890
So you should check him out.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.470
You can go to
YouTube.com/BuzzFeed, and see.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.630
We have five channels
already on YouTube.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.560
And we have more than a quarter
million subscribers,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.480
and over 50 million video
views so far.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:56.360
So we're really excited to use
YouTube to expand our reach,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.270
to not just use YouTube as
a platform for displaying

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.530
videos, but also integrate that
social aspect that people

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.170
use with commenting and
subscribing and being able to

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.140
foster a BuzzFeed video
ecosystem both on YouTube on

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.670
BuzzFeed, and kind of
integrate both of

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.410
them to each other.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.500
I think that's where we're
definitely moving forward,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.710
too, with how BuzzFeed and video
and YouTube are going to

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.020
work in the future.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.110
IKAI LAN: Very, very cool.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.610
Was there anything you wanted
to add to that?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.100
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: No.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.480
That's it.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.710
IKAI LAN: Well, I'm going to
ask you the engineering

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.570
version of that question,
so get ready.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.730
So on that note, let's start
talking a little bit about

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.840
your tech stack.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.010
So tell me, what are
you guys running?

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.420
What technology or frameworks
are you guys using?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.560
If you can share that,
of course.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.910
Using some super secret thing.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.040
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yeah,
nothing secretive.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.080
On the apps, we do the
stock Android SDK.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.150
And we have integration tests
that run through each of the

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.660
features that we have.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:04.500
And as an ongoing effort, we are
integrating the bins into

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.680
our integration--

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.240
the tests and the bins would
be integrated into Jenkins.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.850
Everybody knows what
Jenkins is.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.270
IKAI LAN: I'm familiar
with Jenkins, yeah.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.410
I'm familiar with Jenkins when
it was called Hudson.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.690
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Right.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.010
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: So that's
the next step for us.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.250
And Eclipse as the
SDK standard.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.770
the Git is our version
control.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.230
IKAI LAN: A lot of repos
up on GitHub.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.970
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI:
GitHub, yeah.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.340
We go with GitHub.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.870
IKAI LAN: And do you
use anything--

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.850
you use Jenkins for builds.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.100
You guys mentioned big data.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.400
What systems you guys use
for data analysis?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.530
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Well,
I'm not actually

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.020
involved in that, so--

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.430
MARK SHUSTER: Our data team is
really huge, and they're using

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.260
all kinds of technologies to
kind of pull stuff together.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.630
I know they're building stuff
in Python right now.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.880
They're huge.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.590
I wish I could answer the
question for you, but they're

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.770
doing crazy, crazy
number crunching.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.780
We'll have to get them
on a different--

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.090
IKAI LAN: You're seeing that
trend a lot now, where you see

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.010
big data and analytics teams,
and there's technologies

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.910
they're all using.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.990
It's different every single
shop you go to, right?

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.340
You're saying you're using
Python, and usually there's

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.450
some kind of Hadoop used at
every single shop, but just

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.640
how people are using
Hadoop is just--

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.470
it's different everywhere
you go.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.960
MARK SHUSTER: It's crazy.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.110
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: And it's so
specific, as in the numbers

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.210
that come out obviously drive
the [INAUDIBLE] decision.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.700
Probably it's different
at different places.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.770
MARK SHUSTER: And we build their
own tools to display the

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.210
results of that on the
front end, too.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.370
And we have developers who
are only looking to do

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.010
infographics and infographic
systems, and being able to

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.320
display relevant and interesting
charts and graphs

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.160
so that we can take all this
data and crunch it down and

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.630
display it in a few concise
graphs and snippets.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.600
And that's really valuable to
our development department,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.150
but also to our editorial
team.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.230
They're able to use that to
decide what they want to work

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.830
on in the future.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.060
And also our partners and
advertisers, who are able to

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.060
get really good data out of our
back end, and use that to

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.600
make advertising decisions.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.633
IKAI LAN: So, Sandeep--

00:16:17.633 --> 00:16:21.120
hold on, I'm getting a brain
freeze at the moment.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.520
The question I was right
about to ask--

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.650
OK, it's this.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.240
So, in working with the YouTube
APIs, you guys are

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.270
using the mobile SDK.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.190
What else are you using?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.650
Which of the APIs are
you using, if any?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.350
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: We do
Facebook integration, so we

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.760
use Facebook SDK big time.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.160
So yeah.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.320
And we use Crittercism to
record all the bugs.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.895
So we get live bug reports
as the app crashes.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.160
We use that particular data--

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.770
MARK SHUSTER: Which it
doesn't do a lot.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.030
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yeah,
it doesn't crash--

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.500
MARK SHUSTER: But if it does,
we know, so we can fix it.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.000
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Yeah.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.329
And that gets added to
the next release.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:09.329
IKAI LAN: Was there anything
you learned that you would

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.339
like to share with other
mobile developers, or

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.859
developers working with
the YouTube APIs?

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:15.770
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI:
Yes, certainly.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.869
So when we started out, one
YouTube API on Android is well

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:27.770
documented, so we had no issues
integrating the API.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.180
And the other thing was, we
had a choice between using

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.900
either the fragment
or the activity.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.710
We chose the activity.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.500
Your mileage might vary.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.730
But there's no difference
between going either way.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.840
One technique we added was we
wanted the user to have a

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.120
seamless experience, as in, we
wanted the user not to feel as

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.247
though he or she was taken
outside of the app when they

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:55.810
were viewing the video.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:01.940
So we do this very subtle
fade animation.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.640
And the activity that hosts the
YouTube view also has a

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.980
background bitmap, which is a
screenshot of the web view

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.880
that they were on.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.250
And it has a slight gradient,
so that the view pops up.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.270
And this is something we
added, and it's pretty

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.990
straightforward.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.400
Anyone can add it.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.130
MARK SHUSTER: It gives you
a smooth transition

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.040
to the video player.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.250
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: Right.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.480
And it gives a good experience
to the user.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.180
MARK SHUSTER: Absolutely.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.370
IKAI LAN: I've seen that
before, where I've seen

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.390
applications, and you go to a
new kind of-- it looks like a

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.775
new page that's being pushed
on top of the stack, where

00:18:35.775 --> 00:18:36.880
it's just a black background.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.130
Whereas I've looked at BuzzFeed,
and I was looking at

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.910
this going, how are
they doing this?

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.640
How did they put the video on
top of the app like this?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.790
MARK SHUSTER: And I think the
great part about using this in

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.350
the future is that
we can add--

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.740
right now, we're kind of
Chromeless in that view.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.140
But in the future, we can add
right there, sharing and

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.120
reacting, so that as you're
watching the video, you can

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.780
still be able to do that kind
of behavior and not have it

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.220
interfere with the playing of
the video, but make use of

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.270
that black space that would
otherwise appear.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.480
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: And we have
great video content, and

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.020
we want to slowly expose
that to our users.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.760
And the YouTube API has a
YouTube bitmap or image view

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.610
class, which we are
planning to use.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.560
IKAI LAN: And it looks like you
guys are starting to move

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.430
into content creation as opposed
to just curation.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.800
So we do have an API to YouTube
Analytics API, which

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.192
is something that I would love
to see you guys integrate with

00:19:32.192 --> 00:19:33.330
your tool chain at some point.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.340
Because, with the Analytics
API-- and we're starting to do

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.420
this too, with our shows--

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.310
we're tracking how many minutes
are being watched.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.190
This is something that's very
important to YouTube.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.420
Not just how many views we have,
but how many minutes are

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.150
people watching?

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.590
I mean, the problem is, if you
watch a video for five seconds

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.040
or if you watch a video for
10 minutes, if you're just

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.110
counting views, that's just
a view, and it's not quite

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.660
meaningful.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.610
MARK SHUSTER: So I'd like to
encourage people out there

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.640
that are not using the iframe
API in their mobile websites

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.340
to start doing that, because
we actually have an

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.300
implementation using the
iframe API, where we're

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.600
logging percentages of videos
that are watched.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.660
And it's been really helpful
since switching over to the

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.700
iframe API to make sure that
videos are going to display

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.490
more or less uniformly over all
platforms, and it's really

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.580
saved us a lot of headaches
with dealing with Flash on

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.550
older Android devices, dealing
with videos displaying

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.800
properly on iOS devices.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.860
So switch over to that
if you haven't yet.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.990
IKAI LAN: So it sounds like the
tips that we have here are

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.630
use Analytics, use
the iframe API--

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.130
there are a few other ones?

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.140
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI:
Bitmap background.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.640
IKAI LAN: Bitmap background.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.980
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: To give
the smooth animation.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.650
IKAI LAN: So, anything else that
you want to-- anyone's

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.070
feedback you would have
for us for the

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.550
YouTube API or the SDKs?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.400
Anything you'd like to see?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.990
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: The one
thing I'd like to see is a way

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.310
to measure, as you
said, the ones

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.550
you do with the analytics.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.550
We want to measure how many
seconds, or whether they

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.340
played the full video or not.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.280
It would be nice to have that
kind of feedback in either the

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.640
fragment or the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.430
IKAI LAN: I see.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.230
OK, well that's very
good information.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.825
We'll pass that along.

00:21:15.825 --> 00:21:17.460
You definitely get that
information when using

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.960
Analytics API, but for the
videos that you upload.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.240
So for other people's videos,
it's not going

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.710
to be quite as easy.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.250
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: So, yeah.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.560
From the app.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.750
Yeah.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.170
MARK SHUSTER: Yeah, I think
we've only really scratched

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.530
the surface of what we can
do with YouTube APIs.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.570
And I think that in the future,
integrating more

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.890
features that are out there,
like being able to comment,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:45.040
like, and subscribe to YouTube
channels directly from where

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.420
you're watching videos is going
to help bring those

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.380
ecosystems together, and create
a better experience for

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.456
the user so they can see their
content wherever they want.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:54.800
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.630
Great.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.340
So I'm guessing that after we're
done, this show is going

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.560
to be posted to YouTube, and
maybe we can get that into

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.120
BuzzFeed, huh?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.130
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.000
MARK SHUSTER: And if you're a
user out there on BuzzFeed,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.470
you can post any video
you create, and try

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.360
to make it go viral.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.270
And our editors, if they pick it
up, you can be the next big

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.010
BuzzFeed YouTube star.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.800
So who knows?

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.990
IKAI LAN: Well, I want to thank
you guys for coming into

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.935
our studio today.

00:22:17.935 --> 00:22:19.590
It's been an absolute blast.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.040
MARK SHUSTER: Thanks
for having us.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.010
IKAI LAN: Thank you guys for
sharing all this information.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.720
I think this is really good
information that other

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.610
developers need to know.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.280
Because some people are starting
to look into this,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.450
and they haven't dived in yet.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.040
And we really like working with
you guys, because you

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.820
guys were one of our first
partners to jump in and help

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.700
us ship the Android SDK.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.800
So thank you guys for that, and
we look forward to working

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.920
with you guys in the future.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.665
MARK SHUSTER: Yeah, we will.

00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:41.275
Absolutely.

00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:42.525
IKAI LAN: All right.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.840
And one more thing.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.380
I just got the voice
from above.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.070
We are hiring.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.400
Yes.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.140
We are hiring at Google
Developer Relations--

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.310
and that was so awkward.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.530
Which was--

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.690
go to google.com/jobs, and
you should be able to

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.970
find a list of jobs.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.510
I work in Developer Relations,
as do my colleagues.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.190
Sometimes if you watch this
show, you'll see Jeff or

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.980
Abraham, or Jarek or Jeremy.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.970
Just check us out.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.640
Take a look to see if it's
something you want to do.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.930
And send us your applications.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.670
What about you guys?

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.310
Are you guys hiring?

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.460
MARK SHUSTER: We are
always hiring.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.570
IKAI LAN: What are you
guys hiring for?

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.780
MARK SHUSTER: We're hiring for
editors, and sales, and also

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.380
development.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.800
So check out our job postings.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.510
We're growing.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.780
We're growing.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.120
IKAI LAN: Where are
the jobs at?

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.532
Which location?

00:23:32.532 --> 00:23:33.740
SANDEEP CHAYAPATHI: That's
a good question,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.410
which we don't know.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.330
MARK SHUSTER: You'll have
to check it out.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.340
