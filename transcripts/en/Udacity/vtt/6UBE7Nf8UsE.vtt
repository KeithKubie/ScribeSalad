This makeGreyScale function is fairly similar to what we did before.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
After retrieving the data from the imageData object, we call makePixelGrayScale

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.370
on it, and then we store that information back into imageData.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.200
I used a slightly more optimized formula to calculate the grayscale

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.000
of the pixel.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.990
It takes 30% of the red value, 59% of the green value and 11% of the blue value.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.530
So when we go over here and

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.630
refresh our page, we'll see that it's gone to a grayscale.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.360
There's some interesting science that explains how and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.760
why we perceive color the way we do.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.820
See the instructor's notes for links if you'd like to learn more about it and

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.610
also for a link to the image that we used in this example.
