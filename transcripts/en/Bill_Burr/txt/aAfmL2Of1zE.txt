Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast farm by day, October, October 2nd oh my God. Get Out. You fucking Barracuda, dude. It's a fucking fall. It's officially the fall, isn't it? Lovely. Honda's leaves turning different colors, falling off the trees and crunching under your feet. Halloween comes and then Thanksgiving and it'll be a good 75 80 degrees with a whatever, but the oceans rising, but whatever's going be very interesting. It's going to be very interesting. False. I feel coming up. Oh, do you feel it, bill? Was this your own idea? Did you stick your head out the window and assess it or did you listen to a bunch of Shit on TV? All right, you got me. You got me. But it is the fall, the falls, one of my favorite seasons, what I loved about the fall was the beginning of the school year and I absolutely love school.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       I just, when I was a child, I just, I crave knowledge. I don't know what it was like. Of course the other kids wanted to go outside and play and gaging contests of sport, but not me now. I just wanted to curl up in the corner disk, couldn't just, my mother just couldn't get me enough books. I know. I was obviously, um, it was obviously in a non truth. None of that was true. Uh, what I liked about the fall was I got new clothes for school, you know, which back then was you got your hand me downs from your brother and you got a new pair of sneakers. All right. And uh, they were new until that first time it fucking rained or something happened and then they would just, you know, that was it. And those, we use sneakers for a year. You wore sneakers for a year.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Your mother bought him like a half size or a full size too big dependent. We know she was trying to gauge, you know, when your balls we're going to drop to considering how big your feet we're going to be. Right. Um, it was one of those, you know, one of those things back then there was like nine grades all in one class, not fucking with you. Um, I liked the new sneakers in the new clothes and whatever hand be down shit that I got from my older brother. And then, uh, and then it was football and then also was starting to get cold so I didn't have to deal with any more. Do I look at why you fucking legs are, I didn't have to deal with that with the summer and empty. We'll sunburns. I liked it. It was more of a fucking winter guy.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Um, but other than that, everything else sucked. I fucking arc 180 days of school to go. Can you believe that? Used to think that that was hard and he actually used to fuck up in school. If you're like me, I always look back. It's just like, why don't I just come home? Why not just pay attention, come home and just do my homework. I could've gone to like a really good college. Like, and to me a good college is, it has, it has a sports program that I can follow. It's division one and you know, they battled for fucking at least to win their conference. You know what I mean? I don't fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       I Dunno. I, I don't fucking like these college you should go to where everybody is. I don't know what it is. Like take Vanderbilt in the SEC by the way. Who played a hell of a fucking game this weekend? Right? Scared the shit out of Florida. Um, I always thought that, you know, I always, I always assumed that that school sucked because their football team was no good for so long. Now they're actually halfway decent. But I judge schools by how good their sports program is. And you know, there's a lot of people on real sports are one of those shows that, you know, everybody wears suits and for some reason they have a pen but they're never really writing, you know, those shows that take it really seriously. And then they, what does that silly little Lucille, the educational system that people judge a school by their sports programs?

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Well, no, this you fucking pencil pushing nerd. There would be no campus without sports. Okay. On a thousand fucking fractal drops like me fill a stadium. That money goes right back into the school, doesn't it? God knows it's not paying the players. All right. And that's why when you go to the University of Michigan, it's its own fucking city. It's not because of the science department. Well, the engineers that know how to build the buildings, it's cause the big blue down the fucking street [inaudible] pulling 100 400, 510,000 people a Goddamn game. That's what pays for it. You know? Even if it's not all that money, the level of attention. And that makes people all around the world, you know? No. That song hail to the victors. Valliant hail to the victors. Fucking get on a raft. Get over here and go to that school. Right. Isn't that how it goes? I don't know. MMM. I don't know. What the fuck was I talking about? Why I like the fall? Yeah. I would've fucked in. I study so fucking stupid. I can't believe. I can't imagine if I actually understood calculus, what my, what my world would be like right now by just took the time to fuck. I mean it's not like they just dumped it all on you the first day.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       I forget when I stopped paying attention somewhere around seventh grade I just was like, Eh, I'm just not into this. MMM. Oh my God. I could have studied and then I could do one of those extra curricular things and got like a scholarship, you know, participated in a bunch of other shit than I would have had that all flushed out. I see you're on the debating team. You're on the swimming team and I'll let shit remember those fucking kids. The kid next to you. His locker was like neat, you know? And it wasn't all dented and shit. Fucking always had his homework wear like sweaters, you know, you just be looking at him like kind of fun as fuck does. This person is like my age and they have their shit that together always at a thousand papers falling out of my fucking, it just was a mess. And every year I'd be like, okay, this year I'm going to study, I'm going to fucking am I drawn all over my books. I'm going to pay attention. I'm going to try and get all A's and B's. That's all. That's all I wanted to do and I just, I couldn't do it. I put up a good fight through about, I get to about September 10th

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       then I get like that first fucking c, c, c, c. What's that? What's that a reference to? Speaking of moving, let movie lines. Si. Si, Si. Was it summer rentals for summer school that it was the guy who's been on TV for 40 years but never does interviews, so people kind of Mark Harmon is that his name? Was that guy like chainsaws, some shit. Then of course they made the Latino girl pregnant cause you could still do that back then. Can't do that now you get called out on, they would never do that now. Now they would make the white guy pregnant to show that that progressive, that's how it would work. You know what I mean? There's nothing wrong with having a Latino woman to be pregnant, but when she's the only Latino in the fucking movie, that's when it becomes a problem. Oh. So she's going to summer school and she's knocked up and she's dressed like fucking zebra man and heavy metal parking lot.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Do you know? I'd never seen that. I thought that was an entire fucking movie and ice for years. I was like, I got to get around to watch and heavy metal parking lot. I never fucking saw it. And finally somebody referenced it again. Um, oh, I know why. Dean del Ray from the let there be talk all things, comedy network podcast. He sent me a link and one of Judas Priest's guitarist, uh, who the, those KK downing and Glen [inaudible], Glen Tipton, he bought, I hope I'm saying his name right. He bought a fucking Porsche in 1985 or 86 he went to the factory when he was on tour and that's back when they made them. Hey, there was hand built, none of this robot shit. None of this outsourcing it to fucking whatever the fuck they do it now. Um, they were hand built. Okay. By the same people that brought you audio tape and World War One and World War Two.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       All right. It was fucking, they were hand fucking built. It's right at the same people brought you October fest and the Holocaust, you know what I mean? They're there. They're all over the map over there. That's why Germany is still such a scary country. It's like what's going to happen over here? Are we all going to get drink beers and get shit faced or are you guys going to try and take over the world again? You know, that's what's on their weather channel as a monitor. All the psychos over there. What are the, what is, what does the general population planning right now or possibly a small group of really motivated people within Deutschland.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       So anyways, I had never seen heavy metal parking lot. I thought it was a full movie. So I sit down to watch it right out of the gate. I love it. Cause the concerts at the cap center. And that's where I used to watch the, uh, you know, whenever the Bruins used to play, when they'd go down and play the capitols. And they had rod lang way look like my math teacher back in the day that my math teacher was a dead fucking ringer. Flunked his class two fucking years in a row was two summers. I'll never get back. Actually my senior year I didn't fucking go to summer school was like, well, what's the point? I can't get into a school that has a good foot, you know, football program or basketball program. I don't know, sports here, so fuck it. Um, anyways, what the fuck am I talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       Yeah. So I'm watching this thing. So they had the cap center, which I never really saw what it looked like because they never really showed the outside that I can remember. They just be abroads that I, they would camp center Berry Peterson leading the league with 40 some goals a great year. He had, um, and we traded in my belief. Um, so I go to watch this fucking thing and uh, I've gotta be honest with you. Like the memories that came flying back, first of all, my first concert ever was Judas priest with dock and opening up. Of course it was dark and they fucking open for everybody. Day Open for everybody in Tesla opened for fucking and Cinderella opened for fucking everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       That was my first on the Turbo Lover Tour. Right. And I guess I found out all these years later that that Judas priest Guy Glen Tipton or whatever, but a fucking Porsche that was a turbo and he loved it so much that he's fucking, you know, was inspired to write a song and then a rob Halford took it in whatever direction he wanted to take it in. You know that we remember that song. Huh? Your turbo lava make no sense. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:11:29       You won't see me

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       then. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       Uh, Geo feel me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Oh, like crazy music. Right. Um, I saw them on that tour. So anyway, so I watched that heavy metal, uh, parking lot and um, I was fucking great. That's exactly, I mean, to have a fucking fill now. I know way, way, way past the whole, everybody knows that by now we have a film that thank, thank you so much for filming that. I do. The first time I ever saw anybody do blow, I went to an ACDC concert. I remember I pull up my big stupid red fucking hair. Right. You know, and I can't grow at long. My hair just grew out so I, I was like, I missed it man. I should have come up in the 70s I would have been fine. We'd have been rocking that Bernie from room to 22 but you know, everybody kind of had their shit. You know, I don't know what the fuck it was in the 80s wasn't short, but it wasn't long.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       It was bright before the mullets feathered, everything was feathered. Fairfox it was so hot. Even the guys tried to have their hair let curse. Right. That's what was going on. And me, I was just like, you know, I was a man without a spot, without a fucking country. So I would pull up, you know, not a whisker on my face. I fucking pull up my stupid fucking looking. Like I swear to God looking like a giant opie Taylor and a, and I was totally into the music, but I just look like a fucking freak, you know, I should've grown my, I go actually I couldn't grow my house assessed, should at least go on the Malakai route and just been drunk enough and just got out of the car and screamed Outlander and then everybody will left me own loan. I remember I pulled up to the ACDC thing and this fucking guy was doing blow and he had a Toyota pickup truck rusted out.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       Of course back then everything fucking rusted, especially the Toyota Hunks and hunks of shit. But the engines would never die. Right? You'd be driving down the street. You could literally see the fucking engine still working. So this guy gets out of the car and I'm like looking at him like I know we liked the same kind of music, but we are not the same person. I remember he was fucking, yeah, this blond hair look, cut his own hair. It was like some like a fucked up page boy haircut and like a perm all at the same time. And like he turned around and through the line and then fucking came right up to my window as I pulled up looking like a fucking, like, I don't know, I felt like I was on one of those zoos where the animals aren't in a cage, you know, he just came up and he was like, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       And I was kinda like, hey man. Fortunately I was with somebody else. I think that we were listening to who made, who would a very respectable volume. Um, yeah, that was the, who made, who want in loudness, opened up a Japanese heavy metal band. Um, I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about here. Let's, let's, let's get into the podcast. I'm just sort of meandering here. Um, why don't we talk a little bit of NFL football. We'd like, we've got to talk college first. All right. So when I watched, I watched, uh, I watched Texas tech against, um, Oklahoma state. What a fucking great game that was. And what an atmosphere out there in Lubbock, Texas. I got to go a Texas tech gay man. So I was actually out there. I was looking up theaters to see if they had a little stutter. I could play maybe next year, whatever, during football season, you know, anybody can go to Dallas.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Right. I've already been to Texas A and M and I've been to the Texas longhorns. The next big program is Texas Tech. Right. Of course they'll give you shit at Baylor or Smu. They never recovered from the fucking death penalty. But what else they got out there? I think that's it. So, um, I was rooting for Texas tech cause I know I just, just cause they were the underdog, but it's such a fucking great game. And I was flipping back and forth, you know, my adopted college team, Lsu fucking tigers, you know, we lost again, but you know, we lost to the Trojan. So that's okay. You know, that's how I say it to people. You know, we, we lost this week to the Trojans. I thought USC last two. All they did. I was talking about the Troy Trojans from the very formidable sun belt conference.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       I was embarrassed as a new Lsu fan. I became an Lsu fan about nine years ago and as a, uh, adopted team to see all those fucking people leave the fucking stadium emptied out with eight minutes to go. All right. Granted they needed three scores, but uh, I, I didn't like that at all. I hate seeing that. And then I was at that point just rooting that they came back and one just so all those fucking cunts would have to lie on Monday and see that they were part of the 40 people that still stuck around. But um, I'm trying to think what was worse watching Lsu lose to Troy or the Troy Trojans helmets, you know, you know, everything has to look like fucking, I don't know. You know, that you don't let that Awful Candy at movie theaters that they only sell it at movie theaters, whatever those fucking things are. I don't mean gummy bears don't have a good friend of mine that loves gummy bears, Guy Friend. It just, I dunno, it just, it almost fucks up our friendship, you know, like when, when he's kind of bugging me, whatever, I just kind of think every once in once it gets fucking guy likes gummy bears.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       I'll do what? I love going to movies, you know, I fucking love going to movies. I take my kids, you know, get a box of gummy bears, gummy bears. Um, yeah, the fucking Oregon ducks. All right. Those green and yellow cons, they fucked it up for everybody. They were the first ones to put the disco ball in their head and now everybody's doing it. I'm calling it right now. Those fucking things are going to look, they're going to look fucking ridiculous in years to come. People will be like, what in the Fi's that electric is that thing like plugged in or some shit? Some of them are cool. I guess. I don't know what, but I, I love how the MLB, this year they went back to the, uh, like they went to like this non gloss matte color on the batting helmets say look fucking mean as hell, man. I'm meeting as hell, man. Um, so anyways, that's what the fuck I watched. And um, then I watch pro football today or

Speaker 5:          00:18:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       Jay, Jay ash, the New England patriots with their second loss of the year. Um, pardon me, joys that they lost twice because it keeps all the fucking price. It'd be nice to have a nice fucking anticipation free a season, you know? And when you're two and two, God knows nobody's fucking looking at you now. Uh, how about that defense? Huh? The fuck I'll tell you. I'll tell you right now, if you want to score 30 points, you got to go to new wig. Like,

Speaker 6:          00:18:30       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       I'm trying to, I should look this up like we gave up, I think we gave up 75 points in the first two games and then we added another 30 today. Is that what happened? Let's look at the Patriots here. Let's look at this sad, sad tale and I can't figure out what the fuck is going on. I mean, how many yards have we given up this year on just like blown coverages that fucking fake screen pass. Like the entire defense on that side bites on it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       You know, if we look at our corners and our safety's, it's still butler Chung McCourty. Those guys have been playing together for years. I don't know how long we've had the Gilmore Guy, but I like that guy. That guy hits hardy knock somebody out of the game. He had another good hit, you know, bullshit hands to the face and then a brutal one. But a, we shouldn't have been in that situation to begin with. But, um, our offense is fine me course. I would love if our offensive line could give them a little Brady a little more time. Um, he's definitely taken too many hits, but we're still scoring points. But our defense, Jesus Christ, not really stopping the run, not really getting pressure on the quarterback blown fucking coverages. But, uh, I just feel like the blown coverage, is that something that you know, met Patricia can work on, right. He can get those guys like three of the four of them. It's just like, you guys want to fucking Superbowl last year. I'm not, I don't know all the patriots, so I don't know when Gail Morgan on the fucking team. Um, all right, let's look at Patriot's here. patriots.com I should have gone schedule, right? Is that what I should've done? This is going to take for fucking ever patriots schedule. All right, here we go. Patriots schedule.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       They're going to go download the schedule when, okay, so we let up 42 points the first week. Then we were on the road, only let up 20. Then we let up 33 and we let up 33 again. Those are all at fucking up. No, two of those were home. Three of those weren't home. Jesus fucking Christ. All right. 33 36 42 I think. I Dunno, I just glance at those numbers. Wait, (333) 034-0220 thank God for the 20. All right. 42 and 20 is 62 so that's 31. So we're averaging like fucking, I dunno, 30 I guess. 32 points a fucking game. Yeah. Yeah. Tie, right? No, you're not going to go far in the fucking playoffs. Um, by the way, my fucking football pick came in. I called it the fucking giants get in three against Tampa Bay. Dude, I fucking called it. I told you.

Speaker 6:          00:21:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       granted, the giants didn't fucking win, but they only lost by two. Um, and as a Patriot Fan, I hate that the giants are owned four more so than I hate the fact that we're two and two because I wanted to play the giants again. The Superbowl to fucking beat those bastards one time. Where you what? Why don't we, we got nothing to lose. The giants got everything to lose. They've got shit talking rights right now. You just got to say, hey, you guys fucking owners. Right? By the way, somebody tweeted like to do it. When was the last time you guys even fucking beat us? I went to a home game. Own away game. I'm sorry, giants. We fucking beat you up. Uh, I dunno. The last time we played you in the regular season in your fucking house, you can't,

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       it's fucking guys bragging about preseason games. It's like, dude, you want to super bowls? That's all you give a fuck about. Um, so anyways, uh, so that's my one pick. So now I'm going to make another pick on Thursday. All right, Abby. Every Thursday I'm going to do my NFL pick of the week. Now what is what? You have to thank for your fucking degenerate Gambler, you know good and God damn well, I have just as much chance with the information that I'm using of picking a winner as a housewife who doesn't watch a game. Okay? So this first week, I'm not going to say it was dumb luck. I was going on fucking how many points the giants scored against the eagles. I know they scored him late and then Eli Manny, who's ripped my heart out twice, showed it to me and then very politely aided and didn't get any blood on his doctors, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       I was like, there's no fucking way that these guys, and I thought that they want to come away with a win. I did Buccaneers. Look, Greg, God bless him by the way. Who the fuck is this? Ron Funches guy on the, on the, uh, on, uh, Carolina fucking panthers. Guy was killing us all day long. I was, I don't pray for injuries, but when his leg cramped up, I was like, thank God. Then he came back out again, caught another first down second. We get that fucking Guy Outta here. Um, so anyways, uh, that's what I was basing it on. So I'm going to pick another one on Thursday and then you the degenerate gambler. You gotta be wondering, we'll all freckles. Will he get lucky two weeks in a row? Because now I'm in your head cause I won last week. This is like playing roulette, like going right. The last time was black. Is it going to be another black or is it going to be a red? Do I sit out this week? See if it goes to blacks in a row, then I know it's going to be red. All right. No, it was red this week. I'm a goddamn ginger. All right. Remember that Guy Fucking, he didn't pay his taxes. Always been on black. Always been on red.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       Um, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that might be the Photoshop of this week. That's too fucking easy, right? That's a movie poster right there. Always bet on red. I don't know who's playing next week. So how about those fucking La Ramps, not your same old rams. Fucking winning win and win and beat the Dallas fucking cowboys. Jesus Christ. They're gonna have their fucking heads in a noose out there. Um, all right, well let's get down to it. Oh, Billy. Fucking booze back his back. I fell off the wagon. I couldn't do it. I'm fucking with you. I'm still on the fucking wagon. I went to Vegas and I passed that test. I was at the, uh, the Monte Carlo, not the race. The fucking casino stayed over at the MGM Grand Cause they're doing some, uh, construction, I guess on the Monte Carlo. So they had me across the street and uh, oh my God, what a fucking, that way there's, there's no better people watching.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       Then when you go to Vegas, Holy Shit. I went down to the pool. Yes. I went down to the pool. I was working with partner. He's an Italian guy. He actually has pigments. So he wanted to go down in the polls. I had fucking, I'm not going to stay in the room the whole time. So I go down to the Goddamn pool dude. And it was like right as the sun had already started to go down, was on the other side of the casino. So it really wasn't any sun on the water. So there was maybe five or six young people there and everybody else was my generation or older and Holy Shit, I know this is a hacky topic. I know this is, but thank God I never got a tattoo. Thank fucking Christ. If you saw these fucking people, and they're my age man, 49 years old, no shirt on. All these fucking chicks with their ankles, sorority tattoos, telling kids what to do with tattoos, you know what I mean? And then that good. That's what kills me about the tattoo becoming mainstream was the incredible like lack of research that most people did. Their total lack of respect for the art form and the complete lack of respect for themselves to go out and try to actually find somebody good at it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       I gotta tell you, I must've seen 500 fucking tattoos on about a hundred different people down there at the pool. Everybody just tatted up, shit show man boobs are just peck sag and down. You know, women, you always gotta give a pass because they, they have, they have to bear children. All right, but guys, man, there's no fucking reason. You just keep doing the pushups.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       keep the chest high and tight with the fuck are you doing lay off the pizza and the boots. She fucking guys just walking around this saggy chess and the fucking tribal band, the tramp stamps, those sorority ankle tattoos. Just fucking horrific. I went down there and was just sitting there, just reminded of my own mortality going like, Jesus Christ. I really want to fucking act like I'm above these people, but like, you know, smartest fucking thing I that I, I didn't do was I never got a tattoo. Jesus fucking Christ. Thank Christ. I never did it. You know, I like it used to be back in the, you know, cause look at me. I'm not a tattoo guy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       Tattoo. They, they, they got to go back to bad asses. You know what I mean? Guys in biker gangs or in prison or like chicks who not a shoot pool where the leather pants,

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       Hey, I'm out of my fucking mind. So we went down there and we just looked at that fucking see a humanity and then this guy just comes out just screaming about how he lost 20 grand and he had a big grin on his face. He goes, throw me in the pool. I can't swim. Maybe I'll drown. I just lost 20 grand. I just lost 20 grand in there. And I looked down and was like, that fucking guy doesn't have 20 grand. There's no fucking way. He's got 20 grand. And who fucker walks ease? He's just acting like he's a big shot, right there may be dead. I have no fucking idea. So, um, and we went over, we did the show and after the show we sat out by this giant air conditioning duck behind a wall on a picnic table and smoke cigars. And it was great.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       And I didn't participate at all in the Vegas Shenanigans. I knew enough when I walked through the lobby and I saw the people, all the young people, I was like, this is their time. Don't be the creepy guy hanging around, ruining it, get the fuck outta here. So I went back over to the MGM, walked back and a, I got back probably about 1230 at night and I was at first wave of women that had had enough, you know, two out of three of them are walking barefoot, carrying their horse horseshoes, right? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and they just said dirty feet, just walk into the f with a giant fucking drink. And I was glad that I stayed. I did stay out of that and I didn't booze, although I did smoke a fucking cigar and a Kinda did it on an empty stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       And I got admit I was a little fucking nauseous cause it was this giant Cuban. And the next day we took the helicopter out and back and on the way back, those like a 17 to 30 knot wind, depending on what altitude we were until we really got down low flying over the 15, it got down to like nine knots and we kind of getting pushed around a little bit up there. And that was a couple times I was like, oh my God, feeling a little nauseous up here. You know, that's not what you want to see from your pilot asking for a puke bag. I mean, the most comforting thing he could say at that point, you know, it's all right. It's all right. I, I drank last night, so, um, anyways, but I gotta tell you, man, flying out there, taking the helicopter and going over the mode. Javvi desert.

Speaker 3:          00:30:06       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       Was it was, it was fucking incredible. The desert is so, it's like beautiful, terrifying,

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       boiling, hot and freezing all at the same time. It's just fucking, I swear to God, I don't know why. You know, what's something that people thought we faked the moon landing. That's probably where they went, right? They probably just went out to the desert. You know it's a lot of mountains though. I don't think they faked it, man. I think they going, I think they got up there. I have it gives a fuck. Maybe they didn't. There's so much shit for me to fucking babble about. Do you guys watch the Formula One at all? Huh? Anybody see it than anybody? She ate it all. Uh, what do I have it here? It gets to the fucking standings. I know. What's his face? One from red bull. Red Bull had to fucking cars and I can now, I always want to say I always fuck up that guy's name. The fuck is his name. Who wanted this? Who won the race today? The fuck's his name.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       What is his name? Max For stappen once I think Sebastian Vettel I can't think Verstappen cause that v like my brain can only handle one v word a minute or the same letter I'm telling you I have, I don't know what the fuck my deal is. Um, but this is the first race that I saw with Lewis Hamilton or, or, uh, Valtteri Botox in the Mercedes teams. One of what? Either one of them, if they, if they're in first fucking place going into the turn, the Mercedes cars are just too goddamn good. Maybe a Ferrari can run him down. I've never fucking seen it, but red bull, this was their day. This was their track. They were amazing. Lewis Hamilton got into fucking the first, it was the first person that came out in the lead. I can't even talk this fucking pockets. I apologize. Um, came onto the first turn in the lead and as far as my year and a half of watching this shit, that means you're going to win the race, especially if your number Sadie's and, um, for staff.

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       And actually came right up on him and went right around them like it was nothing. And then opened up like an eight, nine second lead on them. I have, I've never seen that. I'm a Mercedes humbled like that by red bull. So congratulations. Then Daniel Ricardo came in third place and, uh, Lewis Hamilton fucking steady, steady Eddie there, still got second place. He's got 281 fucking point. Sebastian Vettel for whatever fucking reason. Ferrari. I don't know what they're doing. My daughter had her first cold man, so I was kind of watching her. So I missed the beginning. All of the sudden Kimmy raking it at some going on with his turbo and he didn't even fucking drive. And Sebastian Vettel was way in the back, so I'm going to guess, uh, you the fucked up during the time trials and got some sort of penalty or they had to switch out a gearbox.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       There's some shit that puts you at the back of the race. You're only allowed to use so many parts, somebody engines or something like that throughout the season. So he was all the way in the back. He was able to work himself all the way up to fourth place, um, which was really impressive. Uh, but now he is, be as, what does he got? He's 34 fucking points. I mean, I don't think that they'd make it up after that debacle in Singapore, that absolute fucking three stooges fucking debacle. I don't think that they make it up, but it was very exciting as a new fan of Formula One to actually see somebody enforced first place and get past actually see a Mercedes Benz in first place and get past it gave me hope that Formula One can be more like that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       I don't need all that shit. Even if we wanted to feed it, I still wouldn't wear it. I, I've learned, I just, I just go there. I silently rude from my fucking team of Tampa winds. I say congratulations. Who gives a fuck? This is the last NFL team that I need to see a home game of. And then I'll have gone to all the baseball and all the, all the football at a professional level. And uh, in my world of doing horrible in school and going to colleges, uh, numerous colleges during my college career, none of which, oh, I went to NC state for my first, my freshman year, um, sort of was in the off campus program. I literally fucking drove into the library and watch the classes on cassette tape. Like I had some sort of fucking terminal disease. That was my first semester and second semester I had two classes, both of which I flunked because by then I decided I didn't want to be in North Carolina, so I sorta went there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       Um, this is back when NC state wolf pack had like a Chucky Brown and Charles, I think it was Charles Shackleford, I believe they still had grass seats in the end zone. I went to a Carolina a state game there. Then I went to a couple other schools, uh, ended up at Emerson. Um, Emerson, I don't even know what I fucking mascot is. I have no idea what it is. Uh, anyways, it's like a final draft software or some shit. Um, the fuck am I talking about? Yes. I'm going to be in a Saint Petersburg and then I'm going to on, on Saturday we'll go into the Florida gators first. Lsu Mighty Lsu. So I will be silent. He rooting for, I like Florida too, but I'll be rooting fella shoe man. I can't fucking just cause they lost to the sunbelt Trojans the fuck. Um, but I get to go to the legendary swamp and a, I actually love both those teams, but a, I decided to hitch my wagon to Lsu so I can't just like fucking jump.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       I, I, you know, I'm not going to be a con on either one of those. I'm just going to be happy to be at that legendary field, um, the at the swamp and then also to be at the, uh, pirates of the Caribbean stadium stadium that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers planned. Um, all right. Lewis Hamilton on HBO. Hey Bill. Big Fan. Just wanted to let you know that Lewis Hamilton is going to be featured on Hbo Real Sports Tonight. I gotta watch that. Uh, if you miss it, I'm sure you can. Uh, I'm sure you can watch it later on. Demand. Keep doing your thing. Love F is for family and the podcast is a weekly ritual for me. Best wishes to you and your growing family. Oh, thank you very much. I'm going to allow to try to check that out. I saw I follow is Hamilton on Twitter. And I saw that he, uh, had some announcement to make and it looked like was wearing some moto GP suit and he was walking to a, towards a motorcycle.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Now there's no fucking way the Mercedes team is going to let them do that, right? I don't think so. So I don't know what the announcement was. Maybe he'd said he got another diamond stud for his other side. His knows, I have no idea. I don't pretend to live in that man's stratosphere. I live in the troposphere. He lives in the stratosphere. All right. The Buccaneers logo, everybody. A bullet built. Uh, the original Buccaneers logo was taking from the school. I went to Beloit college. They settled in court and Beloit one because the school has been around before the NFL. Uh, the school is big in the liberal arts culture and the conversation of changing the mascot due to the barbaric history of the Buccaneers, uh, the school actually has two mascots in official and unofficial. The unofficial is a turtle and they're trying to see if they can make it the official mascot over the buccaneer.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Good Lord. I could, I could give a fuck about it. But how would you feel if the Patriots were to change to a pussy animal? First of all, I fucking love turtles. If you don't like turtles, man, this, there's something wrong with you. They're awesome. They don't bug anybody. And if you think they're pussies, go out and go get bit by one. Um, I fucking love turtles. I add one as a pet and I went to church and I came home and it drowned. Stain was Ralph and it buried it in the fucking woods. I never got another one. Uh, thanks for bringing it up. Uh, anyways, some pussy animal because they're associated with white nationalists or whatever. Grotesques historical events that is beyond our control. Um, the funny thing about that is all the liberal white people that go along with doing that shit do not want to give up their land or their flat screen TVs.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       I get, you know, so as a, as a a half assed, you know, gesture, they're going to get rid of the mascot. Like obviously I feel the Redskins. I mean it's literally like a racial slur. So I get that one. But, uh, this other shit, I mean, I dunno, liberal people want to get rid of it, but I feel that's kind of a way of, uh, getting away with being conc is you're kind of getting rid of the evidence. You know, if they had the buccaneer err on the side, they'll be like, well, who's that? And be like, Oh yeah, that was a group of white people that came over here and just massacred a bunch of fucking people. Just took a bunch of shit. They were evil. They are evil. And for all I know, uh, you are one of their descendants, but if you just make it all go away and there's just a turtle, I don't know. I think they give human beings too much credit. Like you have to understand that we're kind of out of our fucking minds. Um, some something, some of it has to do with power. I don't know what it is, but, uh, I dunno. We get

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       too much power. You, we behave like those fucking chimpanzees when they go out and hunt the other monkeys. You know what I mean? I'll never fucking get over watching that. I just, it's the human, the way they get excited and the way they torture the other fucking monkey rather then just kill the fucking thing is a, is a level of like sit there. That's why I don't like cats. I don't like that. They just won't kill the mouse. How the fucking things freaking, I just put it out of its fucking misery. They want, still want to have fun with it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       Like if somebody said, we're descendants of cats, I'd be like, yeah, I fucking believe that. Where are we sneaking up on each other? Trying to stab one another, you know? Um, anyways, I respect cats though, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       I respect them all. I'm just saying, you know, just that behaviors is fucking weird. Anyways, he says, love the fuck out of the podcast. Been listening since 2011 and followed your comedy sense. Why do I do this? Uh, thank you for all the labs. Hope your family's doing well and go fuck yourself. Yeah, my baby girl had a little bit of the sniffles do what? A baby as a cold and it's sneezes. That's the funniest shit ever. They don't cover their mouth and just, it's fucking unreal. It's like poltergeist and uh, what's that? What's that? Nickelodeon. Slime. Um, so if you've got a baby, uh, somebody told me this is good advice was just to get like a, a face cloth and have it wet and Dab at it so you don't make their nose all raw and all that stuff. Obviously frequently rinse it out, change it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       I know this is disgusting, but it was kind of what I was doing. Um, I feel like I gave her the cold cause I came back from Toronto and I felt like I had s was fighting off something and I'm not going to not hug and kiss. My daughter does that. My daughter. Right. So I was hanging out with her and, uh, Nia was out with some friends this weekend, so it was kind of a, I got to be the single dad and I gotta tell you, man, I fucking loved it. You know, I don't know what these single parents are complaining about. I did it for about eight hours and I didn't have a problem at all.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       No, it was awesome. We, she watched them, the Formula One race with three and she watched the Patriots game. I got a patriots onesy um, and they get said little but awesome or something like that, has the Patriot logo on it and whenever it's football Sunday. And what's cool is Nia is not into sports and shit. So she didn't want it to have a bunch of sports shit, but I just bought it anyways. And uh, she fought for like two seconds. He's like, all right, if you're into that, fine, she gets it, she gets it. So that's what it is. Football Sunday, I come home, she's got two different patriots onesies. I got to get her a Bruins one for the season coming up and all it's playoff baseball. Joe Bucket, his finest, um, efforts for families. Joe Buck at his finest. I'm looking forward to that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       Crossing my fingers for a Yankees. Red Sox match up another classic series. Who knows who wins this, you know, I don't know how many times we played this year, but we were dead even, you know, if we played 18 times, we went nine and nine. Um, and I got it to be interesting, serious cause I haven't seen price be able to beat the fucking Yankees at least in the second half when I was paying attention. So we'll see. Uh, how many home runs did judge end up with a love of the people that have given him shit. I was so happy that he got fucking 50. These fucking cops. Dude, I'm telling you that they say that the home run Derby fucks up your swing. Oh, is that what they say? So what they say? You're not a football scout. Are you all right Aaron? Judge, all fucking rise court is in session. Have you reached a verdict? We get it. His last name's judge Aaron. Judge stats. Here we go. I know we've got 50. What did he finish with? Hold on. It's 50 fucking toe. Holy Shit. That is fucking amazing. 52 home runs. I let everybody give him shit about his strikeouts. Gives a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       114 Rbis, hundred 27 base on balls. 208 strikeouts. 52 home runs. You had 542 at bats and he had to, he still hit two 84 with two oh 208 strikeouts. He still had to 84. It's fucking amazing. What a season graduations to him. I hope he beat you. I hope you be. If we fucking, you know what I'm, I, you know, I'm not one of those carts that can't recognize greatness. That's fucking amazing. All right, dear Billy button nose. Uh, thought this was interesting. A new French law says that photo's must come with a disclaimer that they're photo shopped. I love the French. I fucking love the French. You know what I mean? You know why? Cause they fucking going around having threesomes and they're sick of being excited about bringing somebody else into their relationship and they don't look like the fucking picture. You know what I mean? I get it. Anyways. It's being done to discourage unhealthy extreme thinness among people trying to emulate unrealistic body shapes that were faked with the computer program. All right, so I was a little off the mark on that. Um, this could really change the landscape from models, right? There's, is sports equivalent in there somewhere. Uh, love you love Nia, keep up the good work. Um, yeah, I mean I think that's probably, that's not for adults. That's for more. Uh, I think that's for kids.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       Um, cause I noticed, you know, when I went to Toronto I couldn't believe how good looking the people went on. And I've just been going around in general just noticing how good looking people are. And I was just like, what the fuck is going on? And what I, I think it is, it's, I think it's an a result of everybody being on social media and you post a picture yourself and you know, all this stuff that you didn't about yourself and then shit that you didn't even recognize that, that evidently people, other people notice in comments, you know, a dude, you fucking nice new profile picture. But I got it. Got to ask, okay, what's up with your right ear? What's up with that shirt? What's up with the blah, blah, blah, you know, and then it's unreal. And then you start getting like a fucking complex.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       Um, social media is other than promoting. Um, but anyways, I just feel like for me, social media, I promote gigs and I go on and I try to make people laugh. That's it. But to actually go on there and look at comments, it's just not a healthy thing. I don't think it's healthy for anybody. Even if you're the most beautiful fucking person in the world. Because you know, at some point you're gonna start to go down the other side and then the comments, hey, you still hot, but you started to look starting to show your age there. Lol. Just kidding. You know, I love you. That's all. Somebody who's gotten nothing, nothing but fucking compliments needs to hear, and then it's just a downward spiral into fucking botox and all of that shit. Um, if I could promote anything, uh, just fucking, just acted goddamn age, that's the best way to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:40       Just as you, as you're in your forties, dress like you're in your forties, keep yourself in good fucking shape. There's a certain number you hit and the best she can be at that point is you look good for your age. And if somebody says that to you, it's a fucking compliment. You got to be young. You weren't cheated. All right, stop trying to fucking hang on by your fingernails. It's fucking over. Let young people be young. Let them have their, whatever the fuck it is they're doing with those Goddamn Djs. I don't get it, but it's their shit. Let them have it. Stop showing up with your botox face asking if anybody has any Molly. Okay. You're creeping people out. All right. It's over. Mike. My public service announcement is over. All right. Apocalypse prep. Hey Bill. Recently my girlfriend got mad that I don't have anything prepared in case of a hurricane or a massive flood.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       I'm not naive, but we live in Kansas City. I told her that while I have a flashlight, extra cases of water and a generator, not bad for a 25 year old homeowner, that's pretty fucking great. Annual on a home, a 25. Congratulations. Um, I don't have a box titled Apocalypse Shit. She said, I never think about the future. Oh boy. I told you know. Well, you know, at least she's not asking for a kid. We made, I don't think about the future. I bought a house. You dizzy broad. Uh, I told her that a gas powered generator is literally a symbol for the future. Uh, you talk about this stuff all the time, but have you actually got anything ready? Thanks. Ps loved the music and the throwbacks. Uh, well Andrew thumbless, he's the one that picks out the music. Um, I, I bought some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       I bought some bucket of fucking food that, you know, would last forever. And like the lid on the bucket, um, also doubled as a toilet seat and you could shit in the bucket, but then I don't know where your food went. I went down the rabbit hole, you know, about 10 years ago, thinking about, you know, uh, going off the grid and fucking buying gold and silver coins and all of this shit. And then I was just, then I just went the other way and I was just like, you know, I don't think I want to survive the apocalypse. I'm fine if I'm laying in the street, you know what I mean? Cause then I would just live this unbelievable quality life. And then once the apocalypse hit and everything sucked, I wouldn't have to fucking live through it. You know, you're like, when I'll fucking player like a,

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       say like doc rivers. Like, you know, he won a championship with the Celtics and then they totally dismantled the team and he's like, dude, I, I'm too fucking old to go through a rebuilding year. That's how I feel with like society. Okay. It's just been great. Every fucking day of my life. Okay. Yeah. Just, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:00:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       My fucking dresser drawer is full of championship rings. I got to live in this country. Look at how I looked. I fucking lucked out. Not going to fucking lie to you. I lucked out. So follow that shit goes away. You know what I mean? And everything just collapses. And then fucking prisoners at car. I'm not going to fucking survive that. So that'll be it. You know what I mean? I'd fucking down a bottle of booze and then just turn the, I guess it's different now that I got a family. I Dunno. Maybe I'll buy a generator. All right. Movie, movie lines. I gave you one this week. See She, she, uh, did Billy Bass drum. Uh, this is the best line from a [inaudible] could we talk bass drums here for a second? Everybody I know has a different fucking way of tuning the Goddamn Bass Drum. What is your, what is the way that you do it? Do you get a good sound out of it? I just had somebody blew my fucking mind when I thought it was you just tuned the batter head. You know, that was the one that I thought you put a little tension too. And then I thought the other side, you just fucking, you know, just

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       You know, tightened it. Pass the wrinkle. Alright. Cause Hey, you want to, you want to move that air, right? You also want to have the, I dunno, fuck the fucking beat or have something to rebound off of. And uh, then I met somebody and he fucking tells me the exact opposite thing. And then I met somebody this weekend and he goes back the other way. I don't know what the fuck to do. All I know is my bass drum tuning sucks. So, um, whatever, I'm going to give it another shot. I'm just gonna. You just have to have the balls to just, just keep on doing it and doing it back again and then just dealing with whatever shit sound you'd come up with an each time. Hopefully getting it a little bit better. But, uh, I'm always open to listen to people. Uh, any ideas you have, please let me know.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       All right, dear Billy Bass drum, this is the best line from a supporting character in a movie is from Wayne's world too. There's nothing vulgar so you can play it on air. Wayne and Garth had brought a roadie back from the UK to help put a concert put on a concert while hanging out. He tells them this crazy story, rock and roll story about Ozzy, Jeff Beck and Keith Richards. Give it a listen. All right, let's hope there's no fucking racial slurs in this like there was last week. Um, or some reason the link isn't working. Oh, well, I want the link work. Where is it? Oh, you know what I need. I have to go over here. Hang on, I'll hit pause. You don't have to torture your way through this. All right, we're back. Here we go. Here it is air. It is. Come on.

Speaker 7:          01:03:32       Go on stage.

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       No one's going to be able to hear this dude. I don't know why. It's super fucking quiet. What's going on here? I got all the volumes up. Oh, I know this thing. And that's when he, in the end he said, uh, you know, he goes into the store to go buy him. You need to buy chocolate m and m's to fill up into Ozzie's brandy glass. And he goes there and the place was closed and they had some dog fights off the dog and then he had the murder, the owners with their own shoes. Right. I think that's what it is. I'm sorry dude. I don't know if anybody can hear this. Can you hear it?

Speaker 7:          01:04:23       Well, instead of this bloody well in the shop phone on his son, different story all together. All right. To beat them to death.

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       There you go. Nasty businesses in it. I never watched it. I know. I never saw Wayne's world. That was right when I started doing standup. So I fucking missed out on it. I was too busy trying to get on stage. Oh, by the way, the ticket link for the all things comedy podcast festival is in Phoenix is up@billboard.com for the first time ever. I am going to do a live Monday morning podcast. Now the first thing is you asking yourself as like, you're going to have a guest? No. Are you going to address the no, I'm going to go out there. I'm going to get a bed and I'm just going to lay down in it. You guys are fucking sit there and watch it. I don't know if it's gonna work, but we'll see. We'll see. It's going to be more like a play.

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       It's going to have headphones on. I'm going to block out people laughing. Um, I'm probably, I have to react to the crowd, but I'm not going to be fucking going out there doing stand up or any of that. I'm going to sit down and I'm just going to fucking do my boy. You're again. You know, if you're just going to be able to watch it. I've got to have some sort of commemorative tee shirt or a poster or some shit, but that is going down in Phoenix, Arizona. He, I've never done the video thing I did at one time and it at the all things comedy podcast, I guess I did at one time, but if you ever wanted to see what the fuck this shit looks like, um, who knows? Maybe it won't work. Like rap, like rap live. Remember when they didn't know I'm I sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Wrapped with a live band member that when they tried to do that unplugged you only guy who ever pulled it off was ll cool j. He pulled it off. Everybody else. It just never, it just didn't fucking work. You got to add the guy on the turntables. Um, I'm probably wrong about that, but I just said it and I'm going to stick by it. All right. Fat phobic. Dear Billy Backbreaker, I'm a 28 year old Hawaii male living in Ohio. I had been single for nearly four years now. Congratulations. I consider myself to be an active guy. Rock climbing, going to the gym. Is this like your Tinder fucking bullshit you're sending me. I like to rock climb, go to the gym, cycling, et Cetera. Anyways, I used to be overweight at 250 pounds and over the course of a year I was able to get down to 172 pounds and maintain that to to the activeness and eating a plant based diet.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       Good for fucking you sir. Making me fall. You're inspiring me. Good for you man. What a great thing you did. My situation is this. I have some ladies that have expressed their interest in me. However, the majority of them are overweight and have no self control when it comes to their diet and exercise. I'm not attracted to bigger women, which puts me in a difficult situation when they very openly flirt and invite me out. Why? You're not attracted to them. That's totally fine and it's totally fine to not be into overweight people. I don't know why. You have to pretend that you're in the people that you're not into, so the person you know eating the fucking Drake's cake can feel good about themselves. What about you? There's still a victim in there. Okay. And considering being on a shape is curable for most people.

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       I'm not saying it's not a disease, but for most people they do what you do, plant based Diet to get active and fucking falls off. Plus considering you are a fatty, this is like an alcoholic, you know who got sober, you're going to go hang out with an alcoholic. I guarantee you will become a fat fuck hanging out with them. Right? And then where are you going to be? You're going to be laying down and she tries to ride you on top. I hope you got enough to fucking still get it in there to belly slapping together. You don't have to be part of that to you. Uh, the ladies can turn down men no problem. But when a man turns down a lady, some of the ladies I work with in their close friends, I've known for you. Some of the ladies I work with in our close friends I've known for years. Well, why the fuck would you date them anyways? They know that I've been single for four years. Honestly, I am picking, I've also learned to be happy after multiple bad relationships. Dude, you are fucking crushing life right now. Don't fuck it up by dating some fatty that you work with because society is telling you that you're not progressive if you don't. Anyways, so when I deny a date requests or don't flirt back with them, they say that I'm fat phobic.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       Is this, what if this has come to, um, what gives some fat fucking mantated Douche came walking up to them pressing his dick up against, I mean that's what the fuck they're doing to you sticking their fucking clam and your face smelling like a Jim Dandy Sunday at friendlies. Right? What the fuck? Fuck off. I'm not fat phobic. I just weighed 172 pounds and I know that I can get a better fucking cut of meat. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go. That means I'm just saying cause that fat phobic pissed me off. All right, you should respect everybody. Just say, listen. Um, I used to be fat like you and I started rock climbing. Why don't you rock climb? Okay. Or at least maybe just stare at a bunch of rocks instead of eating rocky road ice cream every fucking weekend may be girl, throw your bang.

Speaker 1:          01:10:03       Every once in a while is dice clay says, I'll trow you a bang. Yeah, dude, can I tell you something right now, this fucking woman's movement thing is completely out of control. It's completely out of control. They are not all of them, but so many of them are everything that they're fucking preaching that they don't want guys to do to them. Okay? There, you know you have the absolute 100% right to date. Whoever the fuck you want to date, you have the right to be as shallow as you fucking want to be. You could date for looks for 10 fucking years if you want to before you want to settle down and get serious. You know, and if you wait too long, you're going to pay the price, but it's your life. The linen. This is, this is your fucking life, dude. You're going to date some fucking fatty and you don't want to just so what the those constant work, we'll look at you in a better way. I, I wouldn't do that. Just be like, yeah, my dance card is full. All right, this, these are the measurements I like and I'm not ashamed of it. Okay? That's what I find attractive

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       as do you, can I tell you something? All of those women at work, if they could be the size that you find attractive would be, you know what I mean? And they ate their way into that position. It's their job to eat the way out, the same way you did. So you had to get on a bike, you had to climb a bunch of rocks, you had to do all this shit. Now your urine game shape, right? You're fucking and Coby Bryan shape and there's showing up like shack and they want to try to play their way into shape. Remember Colby still, he's give chefs shit for doing that. Yeah. Fuck that. Anyways, he says, I've never pointed out their weight, but when I have openly expressed interest in other women while talking to the other guys at work, the women start to shame me. All right dude. You know what? I was on your side until you said shame. What do, what the fuck happened? What happened to people? They shame you. You just fucking laugh at him saying that. Only like bones and twigs. Um, I get along with everybody so I never strike back. What's your problem with anything in fear that I might be taken to HR for God knows what in days. Also having denied some of the women they've gone as far as to not speak to me

Speaker 1:          01:12:32       as much until other female co coworkers. How horrible of a man I am. Leaving them to have bad attitudes against me just because I won't date them. Uh, do what he looked like Burt Reynolds. What the fuck's going on here? I would, uh, yeah. Listen, this is the deal. Women go to HR guys, just laugh at it. So just laugh at it, dude. You know what I would do? I would be overly friendly to the ones that hate me. You know, morning. So you look lovely today. Kill them with kindness, and then I would bring the most smoking hot fucking chick you can find to the fucking Christmas party. That's what you got to do anyways. He says it's true. I'm not attracted to big a women. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But women sit around all day talking about guys having to be this tall, have this fair, she'll hair, wear these clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       But when a man has any sort of criteria, we get shamed. Do Stop saying that. Okay? Being shamed is totally within your own power at the age that you're at. Okay? If you're a fucking teenager or younger, I get it. All right? But at some point you gotta be comfortable with how you look. Okay? You've got to get comfortable with yourself and then someone can't shame you unless you actually did something shameful. Yeah. If he kicked the puppy across the room, you know what I mean? You don't want to be comfortable enough with yourself that you can handle the criticism and have it not affect. You should feel shame. All right. Anyways, he goes, I'm writing to hopefully get your take on the matter and hear what you would do in this situation. I will never see desiring of fit healthy person who about their body as a bad thing. No, you shouldn't. And that's something that all people should aspire to be fit and in shape, healthier than they were yesterday. As much as you can. I, you know, obviously the aging process, you're getting older every second one step closer to the grave. Right. But you know, in the meantime, yeah. Uh, thanks for all the good laughs. You and Nia are the friends. I wish I had real life. That's so nice. Have a good day. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah, Dude. By the way, that goes for women too. Postal women too. All right. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:14:46       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:46       yeah. Dave, what the fuck you want to date? And if you want to be shallow.

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:51       You know, in dish date hot people than just do that. See what that's like.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       It's up to you. I don't understand. You know what I mean? Like the, you know what you have at work. Do you have a bunch of busy bodies, you know, and as these people out there that want to be the person to say, I introduced this person or that person, um, oh dude, I swear to God, man, I swear to God, you find the hottest fucking chick you can fucking find.

I would say I would find, I would tell some fucking, I would tell some hot chick that whole fucking story and you know, hot chicks loved being hot. Nothing that they would make them feel hotter than to go down there and have a bunch of women look at or just hate her because how fucking hace is. There you go. Find that chick. Maybe she's into sports too. Next thing you know, you guys are running the country, not the country. That company. That's perfect. Ah, it's a fantasy. But maybe you can make it happen, sir.

Speaker 2:          01:16:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:13       Did you get, it's up to you to be happy with your own fucking body. All right. I'm telling you, telling you just fucking have a salad. Have One fucking salad a day.
