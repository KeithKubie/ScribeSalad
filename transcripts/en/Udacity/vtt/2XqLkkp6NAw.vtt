00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.960
One of the most confusing things for a lot of people about the parameter, this

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.960
is how it will get bound within functions when they get passed as call backs.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.580
Consider this example where we pass our function to setTimeout,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.290
which will call the function for us a second later.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.080
As you can see, we aren't providing any values that could be

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.130
passed as arguments to our call back function fn.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.480
So it seems hard to imagine that this code will work as we want it to.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.700
Let's focus on those positional parameters first,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.760
since they seem a bit more intuitive.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.070
What do you expect they're going to be bound to?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.580
Hint.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.880
Remember that you can't tell what value a function's parameter will be bound to,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.090
until you look at the specific indication of that function.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.680
So we'll need to go looking for the indication of the fn function.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.000
