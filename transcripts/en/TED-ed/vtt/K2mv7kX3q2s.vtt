00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:13.112
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:17.179
It's the 1940s, the height 
of World War II, Rochester, New York.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.539
A chemist by the name of Harry Coover
is conducting research for Eastman Kodak.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.799
He and his team are looking 
for a clear plastic

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.820
to produce precision gunsights 
for the military.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.390
They begin working with a family
of chemicals called cyanoacrylates,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450
but find, to their extreme annoyance,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.729
that the chemicals stick 
to everything permanently.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.799
The cyanoacrylates are discarded.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.700
After the war, Coover is working at
Kodak's chemical plant in Tennessee.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.779
This time, he and his team are researching

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.209
heat-resistant polymers
for jet airplane canopies.

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:52.671
They try cyanoacrylates, but find,
to their great frustration,

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.410
that the chemicals stick 
to everything permanently.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.060
Again, the cyanoacrylates are discarded.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.520
Coover, however, in a moment of vision,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.460
realizes that the quality that makes these
chemicals so infuriating to work with

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.940
is exactly what makes them valuable.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.500
He takes out a patent 
and begins marketing a super glue.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.281
Years later during the Vietnam War,

00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.421
field medics find that using super glue
on an open wound

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.761
instantly stops the bleeding,

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:23.102
saving countless lives.

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:26.639
Today, medical grade super glue
is still used in surgery,

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:30.364
but it's also a nearly indispensable
household item.
