ELIZABETH CHOE: So hi,
I'm Elizabeth Choe.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.180
By day, I run the
MIT K-12 videos

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.460
program in the Office of
Digital Learning at MIT.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.890
And I was the lead
instructor/creator 20.219.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.630
JOSHUA GUNN: Hi,
I'm Joshua Gunn,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.200
and I'm the co-founder of
Planet Nutshell a Cambridge,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.720
Massachusetts, based
animation studio.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.480
And my role in the
course was simply

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.070
to do a workshop
on storyboarding,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.450
as well as a little
instruction on animation

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.955
in the context of producing
educational media.

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.580
GEORGE ZAIDAN: My
name is George Zaidan

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.420
I am a freelance science video
host and writer and producer.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.359
And for 20.219 I did a workshop
on writing and hosting.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.650
CHRIS BOEBEL: I'm Chris Boebel.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.990
I'm media development director
for MIT's Office of Digital

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.210
Learning and for the course I
was basically a guest lecturer.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.580
I came in for a day or two to
talk about visual storytelling.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.410
ELIZABETH CHOE: So the way
this class stated, I would say,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.910
is that George
and I were working

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.130
on Science Out Loud, which is
this educational web series

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.210
that's hosted by MIT students.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.120
And it sort of noticed that
there was this big need

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.560
to help students not only know
how to articulate themselves

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.680
on camera-- articulate
well on camera--

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.987
but just understand
digital media in general.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:28.737
And that's a conversation
that Chris and I

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:36.368
have had since I was your
student in undergrad basically.

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:38.264
CHRIS BOEBEL: Not
that many years ago.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.930
ELIZABETH CHOE: So,
actually not really.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.660
Yeah, but with Science Out
Loud we would do these,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.200
like, crash courses on scripting
and writing these short videos,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.830
but at the end of the day like
we would still intervene quite

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.416
a bit to make the videos good.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.040
And at the end of
the day, the priority

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.460
was on making a great
video, and not necessarily

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.540
on the students'
learning experience.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.310
So, I mean, this
was a space for them

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.585
to develop these skills
sort of lower states,

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:13.650
and not have to
worry about creating

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.005
something that was going to
be on a web series at the end.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN: The class was
supposed to be lower stakes.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.401
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:22.400
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Because
we had-- Science Out Loud

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.316
was a lot of pressure.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:24.460
We were shooting long days.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.750
If they felt like they
didn't get to take right,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.817
they were nervous.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.400
ELIZABETH CHOE: Or,
if the script just

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.195
wasn't good by the time we had
to shoot, we would just fix it.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.320
CHRIS BOEBEL: And one of
things you and I've talked

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.340
about a ton over the
last couple of years

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.960
is that tension between creating
a consistently good product

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.150
and teaching.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.190
Because if you're in a
teaching environment,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.680
you're going to fail over
and over and over again,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.672
which does not lead to a
particularly, consistently good

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.130
product, which is
what you're going

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.213
for with Science Out Loud.

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:57.550
So this class is
kind of a way, I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.500
think, to find a space in
between where you can actually

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.130
have a little bit of a chance
to experiment and learn by doing

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.740
and fail, bluntly.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.250
But also not actually
impact your show, which

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.266
needs to be consistently good.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.640
JOSHUA GUNN: Was
there any desire

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.760
to sort to create an
awareness for students

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.510
of other sort of creative
opportunities outside

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.240
of the science and math,
or their current studies?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.830
I mean, I think it's a really
interesting way this course is

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.880
sort of offered to students
who are engaged in stuff that's

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.712
really quite different.

00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:43.670
ELIZABETH CHOE: I mean,
interesting because MIT

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.370
has this communication
requirement,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.090
but it's not really taken
seriously by students,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.160
because it's like, I need to
take a class where I'm required

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.900
to write 20 pages of paper.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.460
And you and I were
talking about one

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.390
at the bioengineering
communication fellows,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.107
and he said something like, I'm
doing this program because I

00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:07.190
don't see a difference
between science and science

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.510
communication.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.542
But I think like that
was inadvertently

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.750
was what this class is about.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.000
Because it's not really about
how to host a science show,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.760
or how to write a
five minute script.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.710
I don't care if they never
make a five minute video again,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.870
but hopefully the skills that
they learned and picked up

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.390
were things that
they need to have,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.950
regardless of what
they end up going to.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.720
Just the ability to articulate
passionately and clearly

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.145
some very technical
topics is not something

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:41.520
you get trained
on enough at MIT.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.150
CHRIS BOEBEL: I think I
think the MIT communication

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.024
requirement is an
interesting situation, too,

00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:53.940
because it is all focused on
writing, and writing papers,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.980
not even just writing
scripts, writing papers.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.870
And, for instance,
the course that I

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.310
teach that you
took, we initially

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.450
had trouble getting it listed
as fulfilling the communication

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.220
requirement, even though
students consistently said,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.990
well this is all this course
is about, communication.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.660
Because the writing requirement
was just a little bit

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.860
shy of the 20 page, or
whatever it is, requirement.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.080
So there's a whole other
kind of communication,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.810
which is, as you say,
clear conceptualization,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.730
visualization,
organization, which

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.570
is related to
writing, and writing

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.430
kind of traditional
papers, but it's in 2015.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.860
It's not just writing
journal papers,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.004
or kind of really more
traditional pieces of text.

00:05:44.004 --> 00:05:46.420
ELIZABETH CHOE: Actually,
before I put the class together,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.130
the first thing I did was just
survey all of the medial making

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.270
classes on campus.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.320
So anything related
to video production

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.530
or like script production.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.670
And there are actually a
lot of classes on campus

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.670
that are about how do you
edit, how do you produce video?

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.180
But there wasn't one on
really hosting, actually.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.320
And being on camera, and
being comfortable talking

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.180
in front of people
was something that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.080
we found to be very
important through Science

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.510
Out Loud and something
that most students were

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.990
the most comfortable
with, would you say?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.540
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah I
mean they didn't even

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.540
know they were
uncomfortable with it.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.460
They'd just be like, oh yeah,
no problem, I'll just talk,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.540
and then they get in front of
a camera and it's like Jack

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.390
Donaghy in that
episode of 30 Rock,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.910
where he can't-- you know.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.100
You don't understand why
your body doesn't quite

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.683
work the way you thought it was,
or your voice is a little too

00:06:37.683 --> 00:06:40.360
high and you get nervous,
and then you screw up,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.810
and then you screw up again.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.940
And then if they
get and then they

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.810
realize how hard it actually is
to stand in front of a camera

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.590
and say things.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.920
So yeah.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.700
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's
not just about standing

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.560
in front of a camera, though.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.070
JOSHUA GUNN: Any
audience, right?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.710
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
feel like I wanted

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.960
them to learn to be
self aware of who they

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.780
were as a presenter, you know.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.850
Like, we weren't trying to
make them become a persona.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.790
Like we called it becoming
the next Bill Nye,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.860
but it really wasn't.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.990
That was like the
first thing I talked

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.480
about was that
we're not actually

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.320
turning you into Bill Nye.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.500
That wherever you go,
whether it's a job interview,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.690
or you're giving a Ted Talk or
formal presentation, I mean,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.220
you need all these
skills and you

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.460
can't assume some sort
of platonic personality

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.240
When you do these things.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.170
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's not acting,
it's just being themselves.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.534
ELIZABETH CHOE: But
just a clear, polished,

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:38.841
version of yourself.

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.090
CHRIS BOEBEL: Kind of close
to what the real thing is,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.465
but maybe not
entirely there yet.

00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:44.680
JOSHUA GUNN: Awareness
of an audience.
