00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.930
&gt;&gt; Well, this has been quite the family adventure, for some more than others.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; It's definitely been a bit exhausting.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.470
&gt;&gt; But I love learning how connected we all are and how many

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.765
cousins I have. I'm going to have to print more holiday cards this year.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:12.765
&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:11.830
[LAUGH]

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.970
Well, I do find it amazing, the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.320
conceptually elegant process of mutation and natural selection

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.230
that drives evolution. Creating all of perfections

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.990
and imperfections that we share through common ancestry.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.390
&gt;&gt; I mean I love what we've learned so far, but where do we go from here?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.680
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's time we turn

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600
to each other and try to apply this knowledge.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.550
In the next and final lesson, we're going to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.980
see how different professions use genetics to actually do

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.810
their jobs. And then we're going to see the societal implications behind it.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.840
&gt;&gt; I'm ready to apply this knowledge. Let's do it.
