Speaker 1:          00:00          Are you ready? Yes. Feeling, feeling. I'm fully, I'm feeling full of value. Well, in that spirit I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today three very different stories that try to put a dollar value move you in. It's okay. One minute. [inaudible] $7 10 test downs, one things that seem priceless. Priceless. Really.

Speaker 2:          00:26          Okay, so start at the top. So for sound, the pressure, so to to to tell her we're going to start the show with a story from our producer Molly Webster. I don't remember any of it. Cool. We might actually want to rename Molly Wong stir because she recently got herself some to some serious numericizing. Actually it didn't start as a wonky thing. It started actually with some medical journals. So that was, that was interesting because it was some of the most poetic writing I've seen out of doctors ever. One Journal article said like what would one more month mean to a 37 year old mother who has four children? Or what would one more month mean if you are a 67 year old who's about to go traveling around the world. People were just kind of like drifting these questions out there where they were. All these questions seem to circle around the seemingly simple story of the pricing of a drug, a cancer drug, and this story, if you really want to tell it from the beginning, it begins with this guy named Leonard Leonard Salts.

Speaker 2:          01:27          I'm a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which is here in New York, and it's one of the largest cancer centers in the country. We have 17 doctors here who treat colon cancer just for colon cancer. Treat a very large number of patients. It's a huge hospital. And one of the things Leonard's been noticing in the last, I dunno, decade, is cancer drug prices have just gone through the roof. I mean, we have drugs out there that are many hundreds of dollars per pill. Really? Yeah. Oh, just wait. Let's see. Where does this start? It starts, it's June in 2012 Leonard Salts is at a conference and at this conference is a pharmaceutical company called Santa Fe. And they give a presentation about a new drug that they have a drug called Zaltrap. And Zaltrap is a drug that without getting into the science, too much targets the blood supply to the tumor.

Speaker 2:          02:19          It cuts off the blood supply, which means the tumor can't grow that. That's the scientific hypothesis. So this new drug has presented and they like present the data and they showed that the survival difference between the people who god Zaltrap and the people who didn't was 1.4 months or 42 days. In other words, if you take this drug, you could get 42 more days of life on average, which means you could get three more days, you could get no days, you could get 42 or you could live another three years to 42 days down to the fine grain. Oh, please. Uh, I could show you some graphs that have been put up at meetings that show, uh, survival curves calculated out to two decimal places in terms of months. So I'm looking at this, it not a 10th of a hundredth of a month, a hundred of a month. That's a little over seven hours. Pretty amusing. Accurate. Why would you, why would you, it's pseudo precision. Pseudo precision. At any rate. Anyways, after the conference, the FDA approved the drug and basically once the FDA approves the drug, public insurance has to take it. And then the private insurance companies just follow suit, which means you get prescribed the drug and people pay for it. And what is the drug cost? That's the thing. It costs, uh, roughly 30,000 for three months. Course. Wow.

Speaker 3:          03:36          Whoa.

Speaker 2:          03:36          So, so Leonard's like, wow, that is expensive. And there was already another drug on the market, did the same thing and it costs half as much. To put that in context, this is just one drug that's $11,000 a month. A normal cancer patient might take dozens of drugs. There are anti, yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Nausea medicines that are sometimes used that are, uh, in the range of 90 to $100 or a tablet. And you take a tablet once a day for three days. One needs growth factors to help support the white blood cell count, which you sometimes need. And Chemo. Those can be $5,000 every two to three weeks. If you need antibiotics to treat infections, those aren't cheap. And then you need a pharmacist to prepare it there. Labor intensive need tubing and equipment and needles to give it, you need trained nurses to administer it. You need doctors to take care of the patients. And don't forget there's a cost for a cat scan or MRI. And, and then of course someone's got to pay for the real estate, the heat and the lights. None of those prices are figured into it.

Speaker 2:          04:32          Oh, okay. I'm just giving you the cost of the drug. So Leonard calls up one of his colleagues.

Speaker 4:          04:40          Uh, my name is Peter Bock. I am a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Peter is the number cruncher of the group. He does the statistical analysis of, I don't know, the cost of care, and Len grabbed him and ran him through all the data

Speaker 4:          04:52          and we walked through the out of pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries, medicare beneficiaries. If they don't have additional insurance, 20 cents of every dollar they pay out of pocket,

Speaker 2:          05:02          and that number is sort of hit him because he realized for Medicare patients, they'd be paying something like $2,000 out of pocket every month for just this drug, 2100 if I remember the number correctly. For a lot of Medicare patients, that's all of their money, nevermind other drugs. That's when I thought we should go public with it. Memorial Sloan Kettering, they decide to boycott this drug.

Speaker 3:          05:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:29          now that is that. I mean I'm just stopping you because when you guys made that decision was that, that feels like a big deal. It did feel like a big deal and it felt like a big enough deal that we decided to write the op Ed piece in the New York Times. They write an op Ed in the Times that basically says, look, this is crazy. $11,000 a month for a drug that maybe gives you 42 more days of life. Is that worth it? And little less than a month after the op Ed piece came out, the company makes sal trap. They went to individual doctor's offices and sent representatives and said, we are offering a 50% discount. They cut the price in half just like that. Yup. Nationwide or like just in this area nationwide. It was sort of incredible

Speaker 5:          06:16          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          06:17          We reached out to Santa Fe to talk about the price of Zaltrap and they declined to comment, but in a statement that they released when this whole Zaltrap thing happened, they said that they incur so many costs for researching and developing and bringing a drug to market that that is what their pricing is based on. Leonard doesn't disagree. We need these companies. They're the ones developing the drugs which aren't easy to develop. I mean, Leonard gave us just one example. If we talk about colon cancer, he says for years there was only one drug on the market called five F-you five a few was patented in August of 1957 it was from 1957 until 1996 that a second drug came along. That's how long it takes to develop a good drug or that interim. There were over 70 drugs that were tried and failed. Like I don't give it enough credit because that just astounded me.

Speaker 2:          07:07          It's very, very hard and that according to Leonard is one of the reasons why prices are just going to keep going up, but sooner or later this system is going to fall apart. And at what point does society say there isn't an infinite number of dollars that we can commit to our healthcare system? It's funny because I had this interesting reaction to the word society because all of a sudden I thought like why is not not like a, you know, crazy death panel way. But I thought why? Why is society involved in my conversation with my doctor about if I want to take this drug that may give me another month and a half of life? Why is society involved? Because you're not paying unless

Speaker 1:          07:55          you have hidden resources. I'm aware of probably couldn't afford 10 to $15,000 a month in drug bills. Someone else has to pay that.

Speaker 2:          08:04          Obviously. He says it's your insurance. I mean, say you're part of a policy that has 1000 members.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Let's say that the premium for that is $100. So we had a hundred dollars thousand people. We got ourselves $100,000. Okay? So when we now have $100,000 to take care of that thousand people for that month, whatever amount of time, if nail one person comes up with a health care costs, let's say it's for a month, that is $100,000 in that month, everybody else's in trouble, there's no money left.

Speaker 2:          08:43          So they write this op ed saying like, prices are too high and the drugs are not that great. And sort of the next like notable wave is, um, there was this, there's this journal called blood, which is really big to anybody that works in a community that has like called blood. Yeah. How did we not know about this and we made the blood show, oh, I knew. Just kept it in here. Anyhow. Um, so yeah, so there's the journal called blood, which is basically like the, the journal for anybody that works in a field that has to do with blood. And what happens is like a hundred doctors get together and they coast sign in editorial, which basically says we totally agree with everything you guys are saying, but we have an even bigger issue. You know with Zaltrap you're talking about an expensive drug that maybe doesn't really do that much. It's kind of easy even though it had never been done before to say we're not going to use this. What all these doctors in the blood editorial are saying, what do you do when you have a really expensive drug? But it's really, really good. It's like a drug you actually want to take. Is that like a like a one day in the future we will face this kind of question. No, that is like a now today question.

Speaker 2:          09:54          The most important new medicine approved this year. Everyone I talked to pointed me to this new drug called Sovaldi. It's known as Savaldi civilizing. Many in the medical community are calling the new medication. Blockbuster. Sovaldi came on the market last December, so that's December, 2013 that's correct. This is Bruce Bruce Moore. I'm the Editor of Commonwealth magazine. He's written about Sovaldi and here's the basic story, right?

Speaker 6:          10:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:20          It is a drug that treats hepatitis C, which is caused by a virus and the disease itself goes to work on your liver. It inflames it. It scars, it can cause liver cancer, cirrhosis. It can be fatal and for the longest time the treatments that they had just really weren't that great or they just had wretched side effects. But along comes Savaldi and it's one pill 12 weeks. You take it with some other antiviral meds. It is a super simple treatment option and the side effects are very minimal like this. It was like kind of like the savior drug and so a lot of doctors start to prescribe it. In the first half of 2014 70,000 people in the country in the United States were treated and it had a 95% rate of cure. In other words, the cow virus was eradicated. That's very big. But in fitting with our story, this truck costs $1,000 a pill. Whoa. For like one, one pill that I take one a day.

Speaker 7:          11:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:30          which as you can imagine, angered on a lot of people with Hep C in total it costs $84,000 and if you think about the fact that in 2014 we know at least 70,000 people got this drug and you're starting to talk about serious money. Wait, I wanna I, I just want to say that I, I, I just timed out 70,000 times 84,000 and I got something with seven Zeros in it. It's five, eight, eight and then there's seven Zeros, which is like a bit $5 billion. Yes. Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:06          the big question is how stage will pay for what could be upwards of, and so we have a situation where states are basically having to ration, yeah. Say in Massachusetts,

Speaker 2:          12:15          most of the insurers currently are requiring some liver damage before you can take the drug.

Speaker 1:          12:22          Similar restrictions are happening in other states, Florida. It's happening in Oregon, Illinois. The doctor says the only option may be to wait until you're even sicker, and then there's Arizona out of the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:33          entire state. Public Insurance only approves 180 people for treatment or it's just 180 just 180 now when I talk to a representative of the company that makes a truck,

Speaker 8:          12:45          Greg Altan, executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs for Giliad Sciences,

Speaker 2:          12:49          he says, you got to keep in mind this is not a chronic care situation. This is a

Speaker 8:          12:53          sure here you're actually curing a person of a disease. We're talking about 12 weeks of therapy period. That's it. And you're done and you've cured some. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:01          so he says, this is a onetime deal. This is like one time, $84,000 and then you're done. Think about all the years you'll live without having an illness. Then you'll see

Speaker 8:          13:11          over a 20 year period the savings that will accrue to the system by having a patient cured of Hepatitis C.

Speaker 2:          13:17          He also said it's important to understand that every hepatitis C suffer is not going to hit the system at the same time. So all of the cost is spread out. Right, which is totally true, but I think there's like this bigger picture here and Bruce points it out to, it's sort of like a precursor of what could come because these companies are developing drugs all the time. What if, if you could get a drug but it was very expensive to treat diabetes and then you're talking tens of millions of people, an enormous segment of the population, even if just a fraction of them want a drug that's $1,000 per day, that's practically our entire US budget. What do you do in that case? A drug comes along like that and throws everything out of whack.

Speaker 3:          14:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:06          this is the part where I really sort of got hooked in where it's like, how do you answer this question? Is it that, you know, at a certain point you just draw a line and you say beyond this point we're not paying. But beyond what point exactly. I mean that's the hard part. Like how good does it treatment have to be for you to say this is worth the price that it's been set at? I don't think we have rejected out of hand, but I don't think I got into this a bit with Leonard. In the case of Zaltrap they said, all right, 42 days, that much money, we're not going to do it. But would it have been different if it was 50 days or a hundred? Uh, is that enough? I'm sure you want to be talking in years, but I guess the question is like what would be, is there a magic line line

Speaker 2:          14:48          for you? Um, um,

Speaker 1:          14:53          if I, this is a, I can't personally determine it for everybody. I wouldn't presume to try, but ultimately as a society we're going to have to reach an understanding of what that cut point is because we can't afford not to. And the question that sort of bubbles out of this conversation is, what is one more year or one more month or one more day of life worth to us? Are we willing to pay $1,000 for an extra day of life? Well, what about a hundred thousand dollars for an extra day of life? You know, people like to say, yeah, so what's the value of a human life? And the answer is, boy, that's a complicated question, but a really important one because nobody thinks it's infinite.

Speaker 2:          15:37          He said that and I was like, okay, it's not zero and it's not infinite. Is there an answer like in the middle? And so I started looking around, I dunno, I guess I was wondering has anyone actually thought about this? And so I started looking around and what I realized was that the World Health Organization, actually, I'm, I mean I guess they almost have a number, but it's a number per country. They have the recommendation that that countries spend, it's going to get gobbly gooky but just bear with me. The country spend one to three times the GDP per capita, which is like the gross domestic product per individual. So take the entire fat ball of money that is in a country and divide it per individual divided by the individuals. And then you spend one to three times that on one more good year of life. And what would that be for us?

Speaker 2:          16:24          So for the u s um, if that's about 50 to 150,000. Interesting. And is that, does that have any, any teeth that recommendation? It legally doesn't have any teeth, but it has teeth in the sense that um, doctors in the u s are actually going to start using this. Who number two, evaluate medical treatments for cardiology. They said they were going to do this in a paper and it was kind of very quiet, very subtle. But in other countries, this conversation, it's very loud actually. It happens at the government level. They're also passing out surveys where they're asking citizens, what is your limit on how much you want to spend on one more good year of life. Have they done that here? As far as I know, no. Why not? Because? Because the last time we tried to talk about cost in medicine, it ended up in the hole death panel, death panels, panels or so called death panels thing and

Speaker 1:          17:25          I dunno, I just wondered into the mess of it. Hey, times square. If I actually tried to go out and ask this question in a very basic way, how would people respond? Excuse me? Can I ask you a question? What is a year of life worth? Wow, what a question. Hey dusty, can I think about, and that's a tough one, but I was really surprised how seriously people took the question, man, what is a year of life worth? That was the first thing I noticed. Then the next thing was no one could answer the question until I had answered like a million questions of theirs. Am I going to die tomorrow? Yes. Where do I get that year? Do I get it at the beginning of the middle or the end? How would I spend that year of life? Good. It would be a good year of life. A good year of life. Depends. It's like a pie in the sky kind of answer. They wanted to know would they be emotionally half alone with friends or family? Where did they get the money? They borrow the money. They have to pay the money back where they dying. Was it an emergency? Other people also trying to get money at the same time because then there'd be like a rush on the money in America. Oh, interesting.

Speaker 2:          18:30          Did you actually ever end up getting numbers? I did get numbers,

Speaker 1:          18:34          but they were at least $10,000 $15,000 $13,000,007 all over the place. Yeah, I would say five bucks. Head million dollars. $44,000 you're saying one woman said 10 million, $10 million for a year. It's irresponsible. Well, you asking me about my personal choice? $10 million. Not about a public policy question. What? Do you have any way of parsing all this? No, I really, I honestly don't like,

Speaker 2:          19:05          I think my biggest takeaway was like no one punched me, which, which makes me feel as if people are ready, not ready but willing to engage in this conversation. But I also realized I kept talking about things and I just wanted to be in the room with patients. Like I just want to patients in the room with me because it was like we were all having this conversation that eventually we'll all be patients I guess. But we were also having this conversation around like a group of people that weren't ever present. Like they're not at conferences or not in research articles. And so that was when I started talking to patients.

Speaker 9:          19:42          Ah, well I guess what is 42 days? What does 42 days mean in the sense of is that something that you'd pay $50,000 for if you were, I mean, of course you would that it's like, no, I almost can't even ask the question, but I don't know. I know, I think it's a good question. I think ethically it would be to the good of patients and doctors to have this conversation. This is Susan Susan Gould, bar rider of the living with cancer blog for the New York Times back in 2008. Susan went to the doctor. She hadn't been feeling well for a while. They thought it was some sort of bowel issue, but then the doctor walked into the room and said she had advanced stage of Varian cancer. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at a late stage and um, it's, it's basically incurable. It can be handled. It can be managed that it can be kept at bay and for longer periods of time. Now we hope, but you're given a diagnosis of three, five years. Wow. That is, you go from having unlimited time in your mind to three to five years in like a doctor's visit. Yeah, it's, it's, it's a big shock. You sort of enter the zone.

Speaker 9:          21:03          Well, you're not quite aware of what you're doing that day. The day she was diagnosed, she was told, pack a bag, get in a car and drive to Indianapolis. You need surgery now. So I went the next day to Indianapolis and the day after that I had the debulking surgery, which takes out the ovaries and the uterus and the Fallopian tubes and the spleen and sometimes the cervix and sometimes the appendix and Holy Shit, the bowel. And Are you serious? Yeah, it's called the mother of all surgeries. And then just like that, she was doing multiple rounds of chemo chemicals

Speaker 10:         21:38          that are used. Uh, they destroy all quick growing cells. So for example, you have no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, that you know, uh, you, you also can, I got terrible sores in my mouth. I have no idea why, but I know this happens to other people. But yeah. The other thing is this extreme fatigue

Speaker 9:          21:59          and Susan who writes for a living couldn't even read.

Speaker 10:         22:01          I would look at the page and think, had I turned the page

Speaker 3:          22:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          22:06          chemotherapy. It really is toxic to the spirit, to the heart, to the mind. Just the normal aspects of life feel polluted.

Speaker 9:          22:20          Have you ever had to think about cost? I was never informed of the cost of any drug or any procedure I was given, which really makes me think about how masked these costs are. Would you want to be thinking about cost while you're going through it or is it better to just say, here are your treatment options, these are statistical outcomes, like pick one and then we'll deal with it on the other side. I think there's an a kind of unspoken agreement among everyone that the insurance company or Medicare is going to pay. And if it's the government, that means that our grandchildren are going to end up paying for all of this money. So yes, I guess to answer your question, I think it would be healthier to know what these things cost. On the other hand, I have to say as a patient, I was so traumatized. I'm not sure I could have taken that information in. Um, I was thinking about your what, what is worth, what's it worth? A title. And I was thinking that, um, the American individualistic optimistic response would be, well, whatever it takes, whatever it takes, life is worth it. Whatever it takes. But whatever it takes will not cure my cancer, so I think this question changes when have incurable cancer, it becomes a different question, which is when is enough enough?

Speaker 2:          23:55          I remembered she said that when is enough enough? I was just, I don't know that we are ready to say there's one magic line thrown back to this conversation that I had with Leonard Salts where he was saying that we have to look at everything in terms of value. If you need to think deeply about the kind of life you want to live, it's not just about how many days, it's about what kind of days. So if you told me that there was something that gave a 72 day survival benefit, but it makes people feel nauseous for most of the time, is that worth it when we're trying to draw this line as a society before we figure out what we're willing to pay, we have to think about what we are paying for. Yeah. I don't think we know what for Susan, you know, six years ago she decided that she was going to get chemotherapy because in part it would be more time with her daughters. Yeah. And suddenly it's worth it. Yeah. But I think what changed by the treatment to, for now, Susan's cancer is basically under control because, uh, she's on this new drug for two and a half,

Speaker 9:          25:02          two years and now a month. And I am counting, um, I've been alive without a recurrence, without the cancer growing, by taking these pills every day. Um, and I take them at home. They're not infused in the hospital through my veins. They are just pills and um, it's made last few years remarkably normal. Like the new normal. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          25:33          but when these drugs stop working and I've been told they will stop working, um, I'm not sure I would want to go back to chemotherapy.

Speaker 3:          25:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          25:45          but I, I suspect, I don't know until I get there.

Speaker 3:          26:06          [inaudible], [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         26:06          producer, Molly Webster, and now for the thank yous for that piece, we we want to thank Steven Hall and one I mentioned Susan Goo buyer's book called memoir of a deep poked woman, and it takes also to doctor a tool Guan Day for all his help and his latest book, which is really, I really thought it was wonderful. It's called being mortal. Yeah. And thanks also to Nikki Hanes and to Glenn Blomqvist. Radiolab will continue on.
