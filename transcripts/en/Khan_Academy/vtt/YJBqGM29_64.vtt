00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.310
In the last video I just
discussed a personal balance

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.500
sheet and what illiquidity
or what insolvency means.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.390
And if you understood that,
I think we're now ready to

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.100
tackle what a balance sheet of
some of these potentially

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.700
troubled banks might
look like.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.780
And I'm not going to go
into the details.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.610
But I'm going to give you the
big picture and I think that's

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.680
essentially what matters.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.350
So essentially, these banks
have a bunch of assets.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.370
And I'm going to talk about
banks very generally right

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.090
now, both commercial and
investment banks.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.990
In a future video I'll tell you
the difference between the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.750
two and what regulation means
and what leverage

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.520
means and all that.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.200
Maybe I'll touch on that
in this video.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.760
But let's just kind of think
about a generic balance sheet

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.320
for a bank.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.570
So its assets.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.170
I'm just going to make
up some things.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:56.490
Let's say that it has $1 billion
in government bonds,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.010
U.S. government bonds.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.170
I'm just throwing that in there
just as filler just to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.660
show you that there could be
a lot of different types of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.920
assets in there.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.600
Let's say that it has another
$10 billion in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.730
AAA corporate bonds.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.700
So you know these are loans
to really solvent or very

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.590
creditworthy companies.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.840
Companies that have really
good cash flows.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.250
There's very little
chance of them

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.360
defaulting on their loans.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.350
And what is a bond?

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.370
A bond is just a loan
to another entity.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.540
If you loan me money, I could
give you an IOU saying that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.860
Sal owes you $10.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.580
And that IOU, you could
call that a Sal bond.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.840
So $1 billion of government
bonds, that's an asset that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020
says the government owes
me a billion dollars.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.280
And in the meantime, it's going
to pay me interest.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.290
Similarly, corporate bonds,
that's saying that these

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.790
corporations, wherever these
bonds are issued by, they owe

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.280
me collectively $10 billion and
in the meantime they're

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.070
going to pay me interest.
So that's all it is.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.450
And all an asset is, is
something that has some future

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.440
economic value.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.400
And that's what these are.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.280
These bonds have some future
economic value.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940
They have the value of the
interest payments.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.460
Plus eventually, they're
going to pay you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.960
the $10 billion back.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.290
Or maybe it's something
less than that.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.120
So the $10 is the interest
payments plus what they're

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.510
going to pay you back, which
might be $9.9 billion.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.690
I'm making up numbers.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.870
But that's not the issue here.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.540
The crux of the issue
is that there's this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.590
stinky asset here.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.250
Actually, let me draw a couple
more assets here just to show

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.140
you this is the stinkiest
of them all.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.640
So let's say I have another
group of assets.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.080
Let's say it's $10 billion
of commercial mortgages.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.410
So this is, essentially, I lend
money to companies to buy

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.360
land or develop land or buy
buildings that they're going

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.610
to go rent out to
other people.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.040
So once again, it's just
a loan to someone else.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.390
And a loan to someone else that
I've given is an asset.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.365
Because they owe me interest and
eventually they're going

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:16.050
to pay the money back to me.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.600
And then finally, and I'm not
being comprehensive here, I'm

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.610
going to throw in the crux
of the issue here.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.400
Let me see, I have 21 right now,
let me just make it an

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.420
even number.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.850
Let's say that I have
$4 billion, so it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.280
all adds up to 25.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.760
I have $4 billion in
residential CDOs,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.190
collateralized debt
obligations.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.680
And I've done a video on CDOs,
but just to kind of have

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.800
review, CDOs are a derivative
instrument.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.190
I know that sounds complicated,
but that just

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.170
means they are derived from
another instrument.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.780
Which probably is a sign that
the stink is starting to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.830
emerge from this part of
the balance sheet.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.170
What does it mean, derivative?

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.300
Well, you take a bunch
of mortgages.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.410
So I'll just draw
it down here.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.660
These are house mortgages.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.430
Maybe you take a million
of them.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.000
You group them all together.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.860
And you end up with a mortgage
backed security.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.430
All a mortgage backed security
is a loan to a big group of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.980
people and you put them all
together so that you can kind

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.380
of be able to statistically
give it properties.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.530
Because if you lend to any one
person, that's hard to trade.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.590
If you lend to a bunch of
people, it starts to become

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.110
something that you could trade
with other people.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.060
Because they can
understand it.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.330
And in aggregate, you could say
8% of people are going to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.040
default and all of that.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.770
But anyway, this isn't the
crux of it either.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.980
I have a whole video on mortgage
backed securities.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.810
CDOs, collateralized debt
obligations, are derived from

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.860
mortgage backed securities.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.140
And that's why they are called
derivative instruments.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.560
What CDOs are, you take these
mortgage backed securities,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.850
they're loans to some people in
some region of the country,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.540
or maybe they're diversified
across regions, then you slice

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.640
and dice them.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.890
So what you do is, you slice
them and into tranches.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.520
And I go into a lot more
detail on this

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.040
in the other videos.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.860
And you say, this group
of the CDOs, they'll

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.360
get the first payments.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.460
So any payments immediately go
to this very senior tranche.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.030
And then the next payments
go to this one.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.570
And then this top tranche, you
could call it the most junior

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.640
tranche, it's sometimes called
the equity tranche.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.890
This tranche, they're going to
get whatever is left over.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.170
So if everyone pays, they get
made whole, but if a lot of

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.050
people default, all
the defaults are

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.310
going to hit this tranche.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.550
And to kind of make up for the
fact that this is the riskiest

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.460
tranche, or essentially these
people are taking on all of

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.310
the risk, or essentially these
tranches are giving all the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.060
risk to this tranche.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.240
And a tranche is just a
layer, just a slice.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.720
I don't want to use
too fancy words.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.395
But in return for taking on all
of the risk, this person

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:05.200
is going to get a
higher yield.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.400
So while this person might be
getting 6%, this person might

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.750
be getting 7% on their money,
maybe this person gets 12% on

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.430
their money.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.080
This is another interesting
thing.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.430
Because this person is the
most secure, the ratings

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.250
agency, which I'll probably
do another whole

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.550
series of videos on.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.180
They might give it
a AAA rating.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.550
And maybe they give this
tranche, and I'm making up

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.170
things, but maybe they
give it a AA rating.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.770
But this equity tranche, it
will get a junkier rating.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.070
And because it's a junkier
rating, no one is going to

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.720
want to buy it.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.970
So the person who constructed
this whole collateralized debt

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.510
obligation and who sold
these tranches

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.695
to the public markets.

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:43.870
And this process by the way is
called securitization, because

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.070
you're creating securities out
of these assets that you sell

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.310
to everyone, maybe the Chinese,
or whoever, sovereign

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.660
wealth funds.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.800
But people only want to
buy these tranches.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.730
So the banks have to figure
out what to do with this

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.950
tranche, which is the stinky
equity tranche.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.580
So most of them just kept it
on their balance sheet.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.920
They said, oh it looks like
housing never goes down, we

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.060
get a really high yield on this,
so we are going to keep

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.600
this tranche for ourselves.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.790
And that's what these
residential CDOs are, that are

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.830
the crux of the issue.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.640
But anyway, that was
just an aside.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.180
And so I wanted to show you this
because these aren't just

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.430
any residential CDOs.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.080
These aren't the AAAs.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.370
They might be, some of them.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.080
But just for the sake of
argument, let's say that these

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.345
are junky ones or smelly.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.230
So anyway, that's my example
bank, the asset side of its

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.900
balance sheet.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.310
Let's think about
its liabilities.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.630
Well let's just say it
has a bunch of loans.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:53.830
So let's say it has loan
A for $10 billion.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.670
Let me actually throw
some cash in here.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.520
Let's say it has a billion
dollars of cash.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.760
A bank always has to
keep some cash.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.280
Just in case someone asks for
their money immediately.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.000
That's in the context of
a commercial back.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.450
But anyway, let's say it has
some cash just for immediate

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.090
liquidity needs.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.250
So the liability side
has loan A.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.540
It owes someone $10 billion.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:21.010
It has loan B, it's another
$10 billion.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.600
And let's say it has loan C.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.800
Loan C is, just to make it
interesting, let's say it's

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.710
for $3 billion.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.409
So in this example right now,
if we assumed that all of

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.200
these asset values are correct
and all of these liability

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.750
values are correct, what
is this bank's equity?

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.840
And in this case, it's a
publicly traded company, what

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.030
is its shareholders' equity?

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.280
Let's figure it out.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:09:03.190
Well, its assets are $21, $25,
$26 billion in assets.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.900
Its liabilities are
$23 billion.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.780
So $26 billion of assets minus
$23 billion of liabilities

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.310
means that we have $3 billion
of equity, of

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.390
shareholders' equity.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.410
And just to make it clear
what this equity is.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.300
Let's say this is a publicly
traded company.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.700
If you own a share of the
company, you own a share of

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.040
this equity.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.390
Actually, let's just
write it out.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.630
Let's call this Yachovia Bank.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.400
Actually, I shouldn't,
that's too close.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.430
Let's call this Bank A.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:46.130
And let's say that Bank A has,
let me make up something,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:55.630
let's say that it has
500 million shares.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.660
If go into Yahoo Finance, you
said how many shares are

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.410
outstanding?

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.490
It has 500 million shares.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.370
So, each share price, or the
book value of each share

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.550
price, essentially should be
this $3 billion of equity

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.490
based on the balance sheet.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.900
And that's why they call
it book equity.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.000
Because the balance sheet
is often called

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.250
the company's books.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.000
So this is this $3 billion
of equity divided by

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.110
the number of shares.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.060
So each share should be worth,
let's see, $3 billion divided

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:33.056
by 500 million, it should be $6
of book equity per share.

00:10:33.056 --> 00:10:34.890
And that's something important
to realize.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.680
Because a lot of people think
that if a stock price goes to

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.290
zero, that means that
you're getting

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.630
the company for nothing.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.590
No, that's not true.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.680
That just means that the
equity is worth zero.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.190
And I just realized that
I'm out of time.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.560
I'm going to continue this
in the next video.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.395
And we'll explore this
a little bit more.

00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:50.930
See you soon.
