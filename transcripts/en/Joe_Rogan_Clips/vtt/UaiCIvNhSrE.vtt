1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.810
The Joe Rogan experience.
Silly.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.700
I have a windows laptop and I have an apple laptop.
Oh you do?
Yeah.
Jeez.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.480
I both really,
yeah.
You know why?

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.020
Cause windows has more options and when you have more options you get better

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.810
configurations.
You get better keyboards.
Right.
Like A,

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.400
I have a Lenovo thinkpad dude.
They're the shit.
Yeah,

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.850
it's way better to write on like the tactile feedback and the travel distance

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.750
and the keys is so much longer.
Right.
You just know where you're typing it.

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:29.400
For me as a writer,

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.710
when I'm writing like I'm writing stand up or something like that,

11
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.130
it requires less thinking cause my fingers just find the keys easier.

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.130
I mean like 10% plus easier.
It's a big deal.

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.100
And I bought an older apple laptop too.

14
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:45.420
I bought a 2015 a refurbished one cause their keyboards were superior.
Yes.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840
The new ones are so low profile type of anything.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.370
The shittiest fucking keyboard of any computer that you could buy today is a new

17
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.900
Mac book pro and they got busted for that because now because their keywords

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.300
associated,
if we take them back now,
they didn't recalls in the keyboard.

19
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:05.280
While they do have a new patent that they put out for a variable height
keyboard,

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.350
where the key travel will vary in the key resistance will.
Very interesting.
Yeah.

21
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.880
This is a new patent that they filed for.

22
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.220
It doesn't necessarily mean they even have the technology for it.

23
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.320
That sounds expensive.
I don't know why.

24
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.140
If it's something that you could press a button that just raises the keys up,

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.530
that would be like a solution.

26
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.510
Because if you think about the flatness of the key,

27
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:27.440
the idea is they want to keep a low profile to this laptop,
right?

28
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.900
Make it thin and sexy,
which is like fucking whatever the,

29
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.420
I don't have the thing pad with me,
but I have the x one carbon.
It's sad.

30
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.550
Those are nice.
This relate to.
Right,
and the battery life is excellent.

31
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.340
Six months,
dude.
It's a fucking great laptop.
Right?
So Apple's just,

32
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.780
they're just only apple.

33
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.160
And the problem with that one company only selling laptops is you just don't

34
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.330
have enough variety.

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.360
There's not enough people that are offering challenges to it.

36
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.310
They don't have any challenges.
In fact,

37
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.430
their biggest challenge is the walkway mate book.

38
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.380
Huawei basically stole their,
their idea and but made it way better.

39
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.890
They made they,
oh,
I see what you guys are doing.
You guys are fucking up.

40
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.720
I'm going to do that same way.
If we're going to make it with better keys,
right?

41
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.530
We're going to have no bezels on the side of the screen and you know everyone's

42
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.610
concerned about security.
Well,

43
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.820
we're just going to have the Webcam pop up as a key.
Have you seen that?
No,

44
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.250
I haven't.
No.
Dope.
That sounds next level shit.
I want to see that while way.

45
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.840
Am I saying that right?
That's it.
Come on Bro.
Oh shoot.
That's dope as fuck.

46
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.150
Look no bezels.
No bezels.
No,

47
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.230
no room for the Webcam and it has great keyboard travel too.

48
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.930
I think it's like 1.5 millimeter key travel,

49
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.270
which is if you're a person who writes all the time,

50
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.650
yeah I need to get my thoughts out.
I'm stupid.
Do you write a lot?
Write a lot.

51
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.850
Stand up.
And I just write things and extract,
stand up from them and right.

52
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.110
But when I write I,
I don't need to be fucking with the keys man.

53
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.630
So why do you use your Mac then?
You,
there's all these pros about the,

54
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:54.120
about the PC.
But why do you cause I like to have both.

55
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.720
I use that when I travel cause I don't write as much when I travel.

56
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:01.510
But I like to watch movies and show that pops up.
Right.
How about that?

57
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.360
That's the f six gears.
It looks right up.
You know,
son,

58
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.590
I'm pretty wild but that's good because of weird because it's profile.

59
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.840
The biggest thing is like when you're,
you,

60
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.400
you probably have like a Skype meetings or whatever,
Google hangouts.
Uh,

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.530
the worst thing in the world is like the camera turning on automatically.

62
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.260
That's a lie right there.
That image is a lie because they can go back up.

63
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.310
That is not what it was.
Yeah,
I know.
That's impossible.
That's impossible.

64
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.790
Even the right viewpoint.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.

65
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.980
No one's that good looking either.
Yeah.
She's pretty hot.
Yeah.

66
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.490
Yeah,
but it does pop up,
man.
That's in state.
So that's,

67
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.650
that's a thing because it was just like a Mac.
Yep.
It looks just like a Mac,

68
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.100
except it is more key travel.
Right.
More comfortable.

69
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.640
And that upper right hand corner,
that power Bi has also fingerprint reader.

70
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.300
Oh fuck it.
I'm going to buy one right now.
[inaudible] the shit I would,

71
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:51.660
I would use one.
But you don't have one?
No.
When did I have?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

72
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.840
It's great to have her do,
I mean this is just,
they're there.

73
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.580
It's all just better options.

74
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.090
The only difference is windows is not as good as macro s but it's not that much

75
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.880
worse.
No,
it's really not.
It's pretty fucking close.

76
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.790
Windows 10 is pretty fucking good.
And see what this round,
what does it run on?

77
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.950
Windows or some two windows.
Windows.
Windows,
windows,
windows 10 yeah,
sure.

78
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.910
It's not android.
No.
That's a good one that day.
Right.

79
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.900
It would have to be one of those Chromebooks.
Right.
I was going to run android,

80
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.600
which apparently is very good.
The Chromebook designs are really nice too.

81
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.330
Very nice.
They're super nice and you can get one super cheap.
Right.

82
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.370
And the battery lasts like three months.
Yes.
Forever.

83
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.700
And if you just putting documents,
you put them in your Google docs in the cloud,

84
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:31.050
you pull it up instantaneous.
I drive.
No,
it's great.
Yeah.
But why ways?

85
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.340
A weird company man.
Like I don't know what I feel about,

86
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.420
I'm buying into all this government propaganda about the Chinese spying on us.

87
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.750
Yeah,
it's definitely spying on you for sure.
Dot.
Huh?
Well Dude,

88
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.670
I've had my credit card stolen,
my number stolen three times this year.
How?
Why?

89
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:46.660
How?
I don't know if it's ever happened to me.
Yeah,

90
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.720
well I think the more money you have,
the more stuff you get stolen.
Maybe.
Yeah,

91
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.950
maybe people find out.
It's annoying though.
Like I got a charge,

92
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.950
but I have an app on my phone that shows me to charge and it was during a

93
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:59.850
podcast while I'm like,
well,
that definitely wasn't me.
Yeah,
no,
definitely.

94
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.740
They get you with like $10 ones,

95
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:06.580
like little $3 $10 to test the waters and just start quad microphones accurately

96
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.400
pick up sound from four meters away with a wall.
Wait,

97
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.500
what is that real spine on your brother?
Yeah,
Dude.
What doing,

98
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.590
what they're not telling you is the microphones are always active.
Always.
Yeah.

99
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.940
Just like your phone.
They're always listening.

100
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.890
The government bro Translate Multiple Epp people.
Oh,
great.
Microsoft translator.

101
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.050
You hear about the new TVs,
you hear about the uh,
the LG,

102
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.100
the LG TVs that was spying on people constantly listening.
Yeah.
Wonderful.

103
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.610
And they told you if you want to have a private confidential conversation,

104
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:35.530
don't have it in front of the TV.
What they were basically saying,

105
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.670
what did you bring your wife in front of the TV?
Hmm.
That's interesting.
Yeah.

106
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.620
Does that have cameras on them?
Yeah.
They have camera.
Yeah.

107
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.250
I think it live streams at t I think it's like a sex mode.
