which was like no joke and all your
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920
which was like no joke and all your
friends got blown up you and then you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
friends got blown up you and then you
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.389
friends got blown up you and then you
were unemployed and then you tried to be

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
were unemployed and then you tried to be
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.889

an artist and that didn't work out even

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
an artist and that didn't work out even
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359
an artist and that didn't work out even
though you were moderately talented and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
though you were moderately talented and
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310
though you were moderately talented and
then maybe the economy fell apart

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
then maybe the economy fell apart
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100
then maybe the economy fell apart
completely on you hyperinflation and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
completely on you hyperinflation and
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719
completely on you hyperinflation and
then maybe there was a communist menace

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
then maybe there was a communist menace
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820
then maybe there was a communist menace
coming in from the east and there

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
coming in from the east and there
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.070
coming in from the east and there
genuinely was and so you're not the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
genuinely was and so you're not the
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.700
genuinely was and so you're not the
world's happy

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
world's happy
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.490
world's happy
is clam at that point and you're talking

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
is clam at that point and you're talking
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.230
is clam at that point and you're talking
to people who aren't that happy either

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
to people who aren't that happy either
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.820
to people who aren't that happy either
because they were all so badly defeated

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
because they were all so badly defeated
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.170
because they were all so badly defeated
in World War one and then they had a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
in World War one and then they had a
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.880
in World War one and then they had a
terrible treaty they had decided they

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
terrible treaty they had decided they
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.790
terrible treaty they had decided they
lost part of their territory and so the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800
lost part of their territory and so the
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.650
lost part of their territory and so the
crowds not happy and neither are you and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
crowds not happy and neither are you and
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.260
crowds not happy and neither are you and
there's reason for it and so you start

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270
there's reason for it and so you start
 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.430
there's reason for it and so you start
talking to them you don't know what

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
talking to them you don't know what
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.380
talking to them you don't know what
you're upset about and neither does the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390
you're upset about and neither does the
 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.570
you're upset about and neither does the
crowd so you start to articulate some

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
crowd so you start to articulate some
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370
crowd so you start to articulate some
things about why you might be upset and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
things about why you might be upset and
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.590
things about why you might be upset and
some of them fall flat but you're paying

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
some of them fall flat but you're paying
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.900
some of them fall flat but you're paying
attention to the crowd so you stop

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
attention to the crowd so you stop
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.690
attention to the crowd so you stop
saying those things and some of the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
saying those things and some of the
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.970
saying those things and some of the
things make the crowd really wake up and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
things make the crowd really wake up and
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.100
things make the crowd really wake up and
listen and so you start saying more of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110
listen and so you start saying more of
 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.380
listen and so you start saying more of
those things right it's a it's it's an

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
those things right it's a it's it's an
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.510
those things right it's a it's it's an
unconscious dialectic between you and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
unconscious dialectic between you and
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.220
unconscious dialectic between you and
the crowd it's mediated by consciousness

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
the crowd it's mediated by consciousness
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750
the crowd it's mediated by consciousness
but it's not like you're sitting there

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
but it's not like you're sitting there
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850
but it's not like you're sitting there
saying although you might be I'm going

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
saying although you might be I'm going
 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.470
saying although you might be I'm going
to tell this crowd more what it wants to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480
to tell this crowd more what it wants to
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.810
to tell this crowd more what it wants to
hear it's more sophisticated than that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
hear it's more sophisticated than that
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.750
hear it's more sophisticated than that
and so you do that thousand times and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
and so you do that thousand times and
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.090
and so you do that thousand times and
you do that to ever-increasing crowds

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
you do that to ever-increasing crowds
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.090
you do that to ever-increasing crowds
and the crowd really starts to go mad

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
and the crowd really starts to go mad
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.340
and the crowd really starts to go mad
and they basically tell you that you're

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
and they basically tell you that you're
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500
and they basically tell you that you're
the savior of the nation it's like at

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
the savior of the nation it's like at
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.080
the savior of the nation it's like at
what how many bloody people have to tell
