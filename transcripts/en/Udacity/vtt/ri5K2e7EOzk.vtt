00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.740
After copying over the assets, updating the launcher icon

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.270
in the Android manifest, and adding the Helper methods

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.760
to the Utility class, we need to modify the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.770
DetailFragment and ForecastAdapter classes. In the DetailFragment class, in the

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.940
onLoadFinished method, we read the weather condition code from

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.670
the cursor, then we pass it into the Utility

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.340
Helper method to get the colored icon for setting

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.610
onto the image view. In the detail fragment on load

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.170
finish method, we read the weather condition code from the cursor.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.299
Then we pass this into the Utility helper method, to get

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.430
the Resource ID for the colored icon, in order to set

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.770
it onto the Image View. The forecast adapter change is a

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.660
little trickier because we want to use the colored icon for the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.420
today layout. And we want to use a grey icon for

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.470
the other days. In order to distinguish between the other two,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.700
we call get item view type given the current cursor position.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.470
If the view type is today, then we get the weather condition

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.670
code from the cursor. Then we get the resource ID for the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
colored image from the helper method. And then we set that onto

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.770
the image view. If the view type is for a future day, then

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.150
we read the whether condition code from the cursor. Then we pass

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
it into the helper method to get the resource ID the gray

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.180
icon and then we send that on to the image view. If

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.830
you previously hard coded an image into the layout, then you should remove

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.860
that value now. Otherwise, on app launch, it will load

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.480
up the placeholder image and then flash to the actual

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.170
icon. Now that the wire frame implementation for the phone

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
UI is pretty much complete, let's look at the tablet UI.
