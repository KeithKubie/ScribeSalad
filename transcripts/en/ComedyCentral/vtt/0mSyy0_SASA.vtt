00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.669
Tomorrow, the House will vote
to repeal Obamacare,

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:03.937
so if you're thinking
about getting

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:05.072
a life threatening illness

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.473
that could bankrupt
you and your family,

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.243
today's the day!

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.978
Republicans need 216 votes

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.913
and only have a margin of error
of 21 votes,

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.349
which is much smaller than the
3 million vote margin of error

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.917
they needed to win the election.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.520
That is why Steve Bannon
sent his assistant,

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.522
thrice-married
Atlantic City casino magnate

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.557
and ex-Pizza Hut spokesman
Donald Trump,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.194
to convince Republicans
to take health insurance away

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.362
from millions of people.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.063
Also to golf
and, time permitting,

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.198
avoid his third wife.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.535
Now, back in Mordor, D.C.,
House Speaker

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:38.205
and sociopath <i>Mickey Mouse Club</i>
member Paul Ryan

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.506
has been leading the effort

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.642
and enticing amendments
to the new health bill

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.943
to attract
more Republican votes,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.678
because the thought
of kicking 14 million people

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.913
off their health insurance

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.916
just isn't doing it
for him anymore, you guys.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.285
So, comedians,
what amendments can they add

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.619
to the American Health Care Act

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:54.555
to make it more attractive
to Republicans?

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.123
-(bell dings)
-Hari.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.758
Health care is free

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.561
to anyone who agrees
to be a slave.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.029
-Okay. All right.
-(laughter)

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.530
I'll give you points for that.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.065
-(bell dings)
-Uh, Eugene.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:08.435
Um, if you are a diagnosed
with an STD,

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.137
Paul Ryan pushes you
out a window.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.405
-All right. Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.573
Points.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.074
-(bell dings)
-Greg Proops.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.877
Uh, some young boys
in an airport restroom?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.977
-All right, points. Points.
-(laughter)
