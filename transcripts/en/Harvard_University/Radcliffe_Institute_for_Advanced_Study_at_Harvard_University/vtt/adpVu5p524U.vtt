00:00:01.326 --> 00:00:05.640
- Schlesinger Library is
the premier collection

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
of documents and artifacts on
the history of American women,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.380
in the United States and
arguably in the world.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.980
- The mission of the library
is to document the history

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.460
of women in America.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.430
But by telling that
story, we're also

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.960
telling the story
of American history.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.910
So our collections transcend
time and geography and class.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.630
We cover all political
issues, sides

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.580
of political and social issues.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.210
The collections we have
help illuminate all aspects

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.027
of our shared history.

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:39.610
- When you think
about that statement,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.930
and you think about
how really recent

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.230
a field women's history is,
it becomes very profound

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.370
to think about this
entire institution,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.450
with a talented staff
and rich collections,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.320
is dedicated to documenting the
experience of a group of people

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.650
who for a long time weren't
written about in history.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.470
This is one of the vaults
that we have on site,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.190
and it is a cold storage
room for archival materials.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.520
And so we have really
tall shelves and aisles

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.091
that are collapsible
for even more space.

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:12.840
When you're in the
reading room and you've

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.730
filled out your
call slip, we will

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.460
come to this vault or
one of our other vaults

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.670
and locate the items, climb
up and down the ladders,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.340
put them on a library cart, and
then bring them back to you.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.400
-We've got about
3,000 collections,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.580
and we focus on special
collections, which

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.330
means we're looking for
things that are more

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.920
or less unique in the world.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.752
An easy way to illustrate that
is letters, letters or diaries

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:39.960
where there's only one of it.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.590
-So we look at issues
of women's sexuality.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
We look at issues of feminism,
women's rights, equality

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.870
of opportunity, and who are
the major players-- what

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.940
individuals, what organizations?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.480
- Finding, identifying scholars,
activists, elected officials--

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.850
the woman on the street
who's making a difference

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
in a community at a time when
it is not obvious that she is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.509
doing something that will have
historical significance down

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.449
the road.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.050
-Obscure print-- there are ways
in which some of our printed

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.390
artifacts are among the
most vulnerable things.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.460
People take good care
of diaries and letters

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.680
and pass them down
for generations,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.700
but the leaflets that
announce student theater

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.550
might get thrown out
or, back in the day,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.010
might have been used to
wrap fish-- so rescuing

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.540
that kind of print ephemera.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.830
- Not just the big names that
we might have familiarity with--

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.700
Betty Friedan, Flo Kennedy,
Julia Child, Pauli Murray--

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.810
but the everyday women who just
kept journals about what it was

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.300
like for them to give birth,
or what was their private

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.260
experience with depression.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.730
So we keep all of that
material, and we keep it safe.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.870
And we will keep it accessible
in perpetuity for scholars,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.230
for people who are curious,
so that people have access

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.810
to the record of women's lives.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.150
I think there's just
this personal connection

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.880
that you have when you're in the
reading room with the documents

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.990
that you don't get through
the computer screen.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.540
And we really want
people in the doors,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.272
in the reading room,
exploring and discovering.

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:24.570
- --making sure that no
undergraduate leaves this

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.390
campus without knowing something
of the astonishing resources

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.070
in special collections
libraries in Cambridge and in

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.720
