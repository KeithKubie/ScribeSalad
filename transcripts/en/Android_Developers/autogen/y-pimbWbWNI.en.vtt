00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.270
world works now and so we've actually
started to highlight major in-game

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
started to highlight major in-game
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.610
started to highlight major in-game
events and these live operations through

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
events and these live operations through
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.110
events and these live operations through
the way we're doing store featuring and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
the way we're doing store featuring and
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.820
the way we're doing store featuring and
they're exploring a lot of ways to use

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830
they're exploring a lot of ways to use
 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.280
they're exploring a lot of ways to use
live ops and this hasn't been a pilot

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
live ops and this hasn't been a pilot
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.930
live ops and this hasn't been a pilot
program for several months and we're

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
program for several months and we're
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.220
program for several months and we're
seeing promising results and so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
seeing promising results and so
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.020
seeing promising results and so
hopefully more of you will get to take

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
hopefully more of you will get to take
 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.340
hopefully more of you will get to take
part of it we've we've one of the things

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350
part of it we've we've one of the things
 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.050
part of it we've we've one of the things
we're also piloting is these updates to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060
we're also piloting is these updates to
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.620
we're also piloting is these updates to
the details pages which is pretty cool

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630
the details pages which is pretty cool
 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.750
the details pages which is pretty cool
so this will actually change depending

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
so this will actually change depending
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.630
so this will actually change depending
on whether or not the user actually has

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640
on whether or not the user actually has
 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460
on whether or not the user actually has
the game installed so you'll actually

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
the game installed so you'll actually
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.930
the game installed so you'll actually
see things that are new and interesting

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
see things that are new and interesting
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.509
see things that are new and interesting
potentially that are more important you

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519
potentially that are more important you
 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.009
potentially that are more important you
already have the game installed and you

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
already have the game installed and you
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.140
already have the game installed and you
may have a run in for a while or if you

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150
may have a run in for a while or if you
 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.969
may have a run in for a while or if you
if you are going to install it and

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979
if you are going to install it and
 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.380
if you are going to install it and
potentially then you'll see things it'll

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
potentially then you'll see things it'll
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.940
potentially then you'll see things it'll
actually be more attractive like videos

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950
actually be more attractive like videos
 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.890
actually be more attractive like videos
and stuff like that so once again it's

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900

have internal test tracks so one of the

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630
have internal test tracks so one of the
 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.060
have internal test tracks so one of the
one of the challenges obviously is you

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070
one of the challenges obviously is you
 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.670

upload it goes to it goes to a process

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
upload it goes to it goes to a process
 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.740
upload it goes to it goes to a process
before it actually goes live with

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750
before it actually goes live with
 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.110
before it actually goes live with
internal test track with a hundred users

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120
internal test track with a hundred users
 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.300
internal test track with a hundred users
you can things go live very very quickly

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310
you can things go live very very quickly
 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.219
you can things go live very very quickly
so you can iterate really really rapidly

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229
so you can iterate really really rapidly
 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.870

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.060
demo loops and
use them for pre-launch report which is

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070
use them for pre-launch report which is
 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.770

then the final thing I wanted to mention

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:39.980
then the final thing I wanted to mention
 

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.070
then the final thing I wanted to mention
we talked about is it is it we've been

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.080
we talked about is it is it we've been
 

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.990
we talked about is it is it we've been
really working on making the Google

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000
really working on making the Google
 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.530
really working on making the Google
cloud work really really fast for people

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:47.540
cloud work really really fast for people
 

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.810
cloud work really really fast for people
that are doing things like real-time PvP

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:49.820
that are doing things like real-time PvP
 

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.310

and so Dragon Ball legends announced

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320
and so Dragon Ball legends announced
 

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.950
and so Dragon Ball legends announced
that they are at that they are using it

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:53.960
that they are at that they are using it
 

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.090
that they are at that they are using it
for that and I thought that was pretty

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100
for that and I thought that was pretty
 

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.370
for that and I thought that was pretty
cool so I thought I'd end with that from

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:57.380
cool so I thought I'd end with that from
 

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.150
cool so I thought I'd end with that from
my component of the slides and we bill

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160
my component of the slides and we bill

my component of the slides and we bill
to come up here and tell us a little bit

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600
to come up here and tell us a little bit
 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.170
to come up here and tell us a little bit
about what he does with developed with

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:05.180
about what he does with developed with
 

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.850
about what he does with developed with
partner developer relations and what

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:06.860
partner developer relations and what
 

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.400
partner developer relations and what
they do so hopefully this will continue

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:09.410
they do so hopefully this will continue
 

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.220
they do so hopefully this will continue
to work for him so thank you everyone
