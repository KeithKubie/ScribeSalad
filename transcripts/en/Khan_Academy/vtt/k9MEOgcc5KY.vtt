00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.033
- [Voiceover] Let's say that you have

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.738
an infinite series, S, which

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:08.738
is equal to the sum from n equals one,

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:11.179
let me write that a little bit neater.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.837
n equals one to infinity

00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:15.590
of a sub n.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.529
This is all a little bit of review.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.190
We would say, well this is the same thing

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.473
as a sub one, plus a sub two,

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:25.690
plus a sub three, and we would just

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.394
keep going on and on and on forever.

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:30.758
Now what I want to introduce to you

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:32.962
is the idea of a partial sum.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.725
This right over here
is an infinite series.

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.071
But we can define a partial sum,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.435
so if we say S sub six,

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:43.572
this notation says, okay,

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:45.291
if S is an infinite series,

00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:50.291
S sub six is the partial
sum of the first six terms.

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:52.871
So in this case, this is going to be

00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:54.450
we're not going to just
keep going on forever,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.493
this is going to be a sub one,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:01:00.012
plus a sub two, plus a sub three,

00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:03.797
plus a sub four, plus a sub five,

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.477
plus a sub six.

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:09.298
And I can make this a little
bit more tangible if you like.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.686
So let's say that S,
the infinite series S,

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:18.260
is equal to the sum from n equals one,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.260
to infinity of one over n squared.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.282
In this case it would
be one over one squared,

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.801
plus one over two squared,

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.902
plus one over three squared,

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:34.304
and we would just keep going
on and on and on forever.

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:37.462
But what would S sub --

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:39.899
I should do that in that same color.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.243
What would S --

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:44.323
I said I would change color, and I didn't.

00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:48.780
What would S sub three be equal to?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.580
The partial sum of the first three terms,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.426
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:55.885
and try to work through it on your own.

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.359
Well, it's just going to be

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.225
the first term one, plus the second term,

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.684
1/4, plus the third term, 1/9,

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.830
is going to be the sum
of the first three terms,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.130
and we can figure that out,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.266
that's to see if you have
a common denominator here,

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.089
it's going to be 36.

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.550
It's going to be 36/36,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.660
plus 9/36, plus 4/36,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.453
so this is going to be 49/36.

00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:28.221
49/36.

00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:29.267
So the whole point of this video,

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:33.621
is just to appreciate this
idea of a partial sum.

00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:34.585
And what we'll see is,

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:37.186
that you can actually
express what a partial sum

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:38.706
might be algebraically.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.367
So for example,

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.178
for example, let's give
ourselves a little bit

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:44.523
more real estate here.

00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:47.623
Let's say, let's go back to just saying

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:49.817
we have an infinite series, S,

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:54.042
that is equal to the sum from n equals one

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.362
to infinity of a sub n.

00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:00.798
And let's say we know the partial sum,

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:04.096
S sub n, so the sum of the first n terms

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:08.078
of this is equal to n squared

00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:12.559
minus three over

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.164
n to the third plus four.

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:17.882
So just as a bit of a reminder

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:18.822
of what this is saying.

00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:20.166
S sub n...

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.964
S sub n is the same thing as a sub one,

00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:26.145
plus a sub two, plus you keep going

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:29.163
all the way to a sub n,

00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:31.160
and that's going to be
equal to this business,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.307
n squared minus three

00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:37.324
over n to the third plus four.

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:39.182
Now, given that, if someone were

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:40.945
to walk up to you on the street and say,

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:42.571
okay now that you know the notation

00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:45.868
for a partial sum, I
have a little question

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.668
to ask of you.

00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:51.510
If S is the infinite series,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.959
and I'm writing it in very
general terms right over here,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.445
so S is the infinite series

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:58.465
from n equals one to infinity of a sub n,

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.426
and the partial sum, S sub n,

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.155
is defined this way,

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:05.104
so someone, they tell
you these two things,

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:09.365
and then they say find what

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:13.533
the sum from n equals one to six

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:15.703
of a sub n is, and I encourage you

00:04:15.703 --> 00:04:19.254
to pause the video and
try to figure it out.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.750
Well, this is just going to be a sub one,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.804
plus a sub two, plus a sub three,

00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:28.648
plus a sub four, and when I say sub

00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:30.227
that just means subscript,

00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:35.227
plus a sub five, plus a sub six,

00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:36.472
well that's just the same thing

00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:39.722
as the partial sum, this
is just the same thing

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:43.903
as the partial sum of the first six terms

00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:45.389
for our infinite series.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.233
It's just going to be the
partial sum S sub six.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.926
And we know how to algebraically evaluate

00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:52.087
what S sub six is.

00:04:52.087 --> 00:04:55.547
We can apply this formula
that we were given.

00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:58.948
S sub six is equal to, well,

00:04:58.948 --> 00:04:59.980
everywhere we see an n,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.606
we replaced with a six,

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:04.787
it's going to be six squared minus three

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:07.967
over six to the third

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:10.081
plus four, so what is this going to be?

00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:13.610
Six squared is 36 minus three,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.780
so that's 33,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.104
and six to the third, let's see,

00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:19.183
36 times six, I always forget,

00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:20.900
my brain wants to say 216,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.130
but let me make sure that
that's actually the case.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.019
Six times 30 is 180,

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:28.946
plus 36, yes, it is 216,

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.422
so I guess I have, inadvertently,

00:05:30.422 --> 00:05:32.314
by seeing six to the third so many times

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:34.914
in my life, I have inadvertently memorized

00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:37.804
six to the third power,
never a horrible thing

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.221
to have that in your brain.

00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.297
So this is going to be 216 plus four,

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:45.502
so 220.

00:05:45.502 --> 00:05:49.843
So, S sub six, or the sum
of the first six terms

00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:52.014
of the series right over here,

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:55.996
is 33/220, and we're done.

00:05:55.996 --> 00:05:57.761
And the whole point of this is just so you

00:05:57.761 --> 00:06:01.258
kind of appreciate, or
really do appreciate

00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:03.917
this partial sum notation,

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:06.950
and understand what it really means.
