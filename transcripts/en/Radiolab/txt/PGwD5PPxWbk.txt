Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. C h. N. P. R. Hello David. Yes. Hello. This is pat. Oh, hi pat. All right, let's begin with this story from our producer Pat Walters. Pat, go ahead. Okay. So I heard this one from this guy named David, Ms. David bus to ss. He's a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. And this particular story, it comes from a book that David wrote. Um, could you just, just tell me, uh, the little story that you begin your book with?

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Okay. Yes. Um, this is one of the things that's, uh, this was one of the things that sparked my interest in the topic of murder. The whole thing happened several years ago. I had a very good friend, another professor at the university, and I used to socialize with him and his wife. And one evening they were throwing a party and invited me over. And so, uh, when I went to the party, a party was already in full swing. And I got there, uh, walked in and asked his wife, uh, where this friend of mine was. And, uh, she got a disgusted look on her face and said that he was up in the bedroom. And so I went up to the bedroom to find them. And he was in a, in a rage, in a rage.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       How, like you walk into the room, what do you find?

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       Well, he started, he started fuming that his wife had, had dissed him. And what did she do? Uh, she expressed disapproval about his, uh, clothing choices. She made fun of his shirt or something, but did it in publicly in front of her friends. So it was a kind of, he felt publicly humiliated.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       And while David's sitting in the bedroom with this friend, the guy looks up at him and he says, I'm going to kill her. How did he say it? Like quietly or like through his teeth,

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       you know, uh, I'm going to kill her.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       David had always known this guy to be pretty mild mannered,

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       but he is a, uh, a large, very strong man, um, with a black belt in karate. I knew what he was capable of. And so I suggested that we go out for a walk and I basically spent the next half hour walking around with him, trying to cool him off.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       And eventually he did.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       He just calmed down.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       And did you go back to the party then and like continue dinner partying for awhile? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       I did too. Yes. And he did too. And then he seemed fine when I said goodbye to him, he seemed calm and I left and went home. And then it was several hours later in the middle of the night that I got the call and it was his friend and he says, can I come over and sleep on your couch if I don't leave my house right now, I'm going to kill her. He was in this, um, a state of fury, he said, and um, and instead of hitting his wife, he smashed his fist into the bathroom mirror and then realized that he had to leave the house or he was gonna do damage to her.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       And, and so he says that in, you're like, okay, yes, come over now.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       Like, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       Meanwhile, later that night and the other side of town,

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       his wife went into hiding, literally disappeared for six months and didn't tell anyone where she was because she was terrified that he was gonna kill her.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       This story made us wonder, is David's friend, is he unusual or just everybody at some point have something dark in them that just tiptoes out just from time to time. Yeah. This is Radiolab and today we're going to get back so to speak. We've done a good show. This is the bad show. So you asked like why do people do bad things? It actually mean to be bad anyways. Like how do you tell the real bad ease from the rest of us that time? Hour. I'm Jad Abumrad I remember coach, this is radio lab, the bad show.

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       back to bed. Okay. Uh, so what happened to David that night with his friend, got him really curious about murder and badness and all these things we're thinking about. But it wasn't until a few years later that he learned something that really put what happened that night into context. The next by this point, David's moved on to a new university and he's teaching an introductory psychology class

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       and I devoted one class session to the topic of homicide and why people kill. And I designed a little, um, questionnaire where I simply asked the students, you know, have you ever thought about killing someone? And they would circle yes or no.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       Then he left some space at the bottom for them to elaborate if they said yes,

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       and, you know, the class ended and I went back to my office and I just sat at my desk and I started reading these and I was just astonished

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       to find page after page of yeses and not just yeses, but these very vivid descriptions about who they would kill, where they do it, when the precise method, how many of them went into that kind of detail?

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Uh, I would say 75 or 80%. Wow. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       were you a little bit like horrified? Like, oh my God, my students are murderers. Alright. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       no, I, a horse horrified as I was. I was pretty stunned. And so I expanded the sample where we asked about 5,000 people all over the world. Singapore Heru the UK. That same question, have you ever thought about killing someone? And 91% of the men said yes. And 84% of the women [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       said, yes, I've thought about killing someone.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       Yes. If any sizable fraction actually acted on their homicidal fantasies, the streets would be running, running red. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       yeah, but that's just it. Those are fantasies. Some of them actually seem like, well, here's one, something more than just fantasies from

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       uh, a woman. Sure. Okay. This is a 20 year old female. Uh, we ask, who did you think about killing? And she said, my ex boyfriend, um, we lived together for a couple months. He was very aggressive. He started calling me a whore and told me he didn't love me anymore. So I broke up with him. Then a few months later he started calling me, trying to get back together, but I didn't want to. He said that if I ever had a relationship with another man, he was going to send the videos of us having sex to all the people in my university. The thing is that I do have a new boyfriend, but my ex boyfriend doesn't know it that yet and I'm terrified that he'll do what he says. Then suddenly the thought occurred to me that would, my life would be much happier without him and existence, and then she said, I actually did this. I invited him for dinner and as he was in the kitchen looking stupid, peeling the carrots to make salad, I came up to him laughingly, gently so that he wouldn't suspect anything. I thought about grabbing a knife quickly and stabbing him in the chest repeatedly until he was dead. I actually did the first thing, but he saw my intentions and ran away. When asked how close she came to killing him, she estimated 60%

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       60 I don't think I've ever had a fantasy that that anatomically specific where I would see the part of the other person that I was going to stab or plan it like that. Well. Have you ever been blackmailed the way this woman was being blackmailed? No. No one has ever sent about a sex tape that I've ever, no. So you don't know. It is a fair question to ask. What are the conditions under which you or me or any of us could do awful things. I think they'd have to be extremely extreme. Well, you know how my died? No. And you know what? This actually brings us to our first top of the hour. So let me just to set it up. Robert, I'm going to give you this piece of paper here. What is this? So these are some word pairs. Read these words that use these words here. Yep. Nice Day. Fat Neck. Yes. Sad face. What is it? Soft hair. Yeah. I don't know what this is. You just wear it, period. I want you to commit them to memory. Commit them to memory. You know, and while you're doing that, just give me your finger. I'm going to ask that first little electro test finger. Let me go hard there and just wait a second. Clear air it. Give me the paper back. W already time's up. So I'm just going to go into this other room over here.

Speaker 4:          00:08:57       Can you hear me? All right. So I'm gonna talk to you over this intercom. Okay? I'm gonna give you a test. I'm not ready for that attention. Right? To the best of your memory, which word was gnashed with knife? Was it nice day. Nice sky. Nice job. Oh, nice chair answer for you. I don't [inaudible] just push the button to correspond to the right way to go.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Okay. I'm choosing job. Wrong. Answer is day hiring map to 185 votes have to give you a little bit. What did you just hear? Drums. Obviously no need to be an alarm. That was not a real shock. We were just enacting an old, very famous experiment that you might've heard about. It is May, 1962 done by this guy. That experiment is being conducted in the elegant interaction laboratory at Yale University. That's Stanley Milgram talking about the experiment in the film in case you've never heard of, this probably happened in case you haven't. Here's what he did. He recruited a bunch of subjects. Subjects are 40 males between the ages of 20 and 50 he's normal everyday dudes. The subjects range in occupation from corporation presidents to good humor, man in plumbers and you ran them through something like what you and I just did. Right. He would have each subject sit down at a table right here in front of this really impressive looking machine machine that had lots of switches on it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Oh, generates electric shocks. When you press one of the switches all the way down, the learner gets a shock and in the other room there was a guy he called the learner who is supposed to have memorized some words and every time that guy got a word wrong like you just did. Yep. Tapping Casa volunteer was instructed to shock that guy with higher and higher voltage. Now the volunteer couldn't see the guy. He was shocking, but he could definitely hear him Milgrom stage. The whole thing, like it was some experiment about memory and punishment, but of course it wasn't about that until you please. It was about how far would these people go, how many times would they shock that sad SAP in the next room just because they were being told Tim guy yelling, of course was an actor and the shocks weren't real, but the questions in the air at the time were very real prosecution. The attorney general, this is a moment when human cruelty was on trial. Quite literally when I stand before you judges of Israel in this court, I used to accuse or don't five from them and any or maybe he did. I do not stand alone.

Speaker 5:          00:11:33       The Milgrim actually begins these experiments the same year that [inaudible] Eichmann goes on trial for Nazi war crimes. That's radio producer Ben Walker. He'll be our guide for the segment and in the trial when the prosecutors essentially ask him how you came to commit genocide, he would say over over again, it was not my Greyson on a fair. I was just following orders. I had to do what I was ordered and it's this defense. This is basically what Stanley Milgrom set out to test 185 volts in a lab at Yale University. With a bunch of regular Americans.

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:12:13       Like is that something that's universal? Yeah. Or just 10 Eichmann thing. Yeah. He figured maybe 1% of these men would keep flicking the switches up to the highest voltage,

Speaker 4:          00:12:22       but yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:12:23       that's not what he found. 65% were willing to shock their fellow citizens over and over again even past when they were screaming in pain.

Speaker 4:          00:12:38       Sounds happened to that man in there.

Speaker 5:          00:12:40       Even when they stopped screaming. Yeah. When they were maybe dead.

Speaker 4:          00:12:43       You better try and get on him. Sir. You want to answer me or nothing? Please continue. Go on please.

Speaker 5:          00:12:49       They continued shocking there

Speaker 4:          00:12:51       corpses.

Speaker 5:          00:12:55       His experiment remains one of the most famous experiments of the 20th century in 1962 Stanley Milgrom shocked the world because his study on obedience is still trotted out to explain everything from hazing to war crimes. What is there in human nature to gang behavior allows an individual to act inhumanely genocide harshly. It's like a downloadable from the Internet. Instant defense for doing wrong, but if you look at Milgram's work closely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like this guy did, oh x, how's Lim professor of psychology at the University of Exeter? Then a different picture will emerge. Really that story has been told 1,000,001 times for the last 50 years. We've just got to get out. Got To get out of here. Now what you need to understand about Alex Haslam is that he hates it when interviewers only want to talk about the baseline study. The one that everybody knows, the so called baseline, the 65% one, the one we just talked about.

Speaker 5:          00:13:55       Yeah. So there's more, there's more to it. Yeah, because actually he studied between 20 and 40 different variants of this same paradigm. Stanley Milgrim took electric shock with very seriously. He did this experiment a bunch of times and a bunch of different ways, had all sorts of different things that you would change where the shocker and the Shaki Sat. Yet women participantcy had an experimental who wasn't a scientist, but it was a member of the general public and every scenario produced a different result. Really? Yup. Let me, I mean, I'm just, uh, I've got in front of me, I've just got the, uh, the data from the Milgram study. Let me just get that out. I mean, so again, the baseline studies is the one where 65% of the volunteers go all the way, highest dose of electricity x, x, x. But in experiment number three, if they put the Shockey in the same room with the shocker, so the shocker could actually see the person that he's shocking obedience tropes to about 40% and in experiment number four, when the teacher has to hold the learner's hand down on the plate, in order for him to feel the shock, it drops to about 30%.

Speaker 5:          00:15:02       Wow. Experiment 14. If the experiments are, he is not a scientist, but is an ordinary man not wearing a white coat, obedience drops to 20%. Well, how low can we go? Okay, here's another one. Experiment 17. There's you and there's two other participants, both actors. If those two participants refuse to go on, like saying, I don't want to kill a guy, boney 10% under those circumstances, go on. And then the final one, experiment 15 of course, normally you just have one experiment who's giving you these instructions. But if you put two experimenters in the room and they start disagreeing with each other and this one you get 0% going all the way. Zero in that condition. You said Zero Nolan and go right to the unknown at one person, not assault. Exactly. 0% well, all right, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about my fellow man. One second. Hey, okay. Where is he? Am I'm in a closet closet cause this room is echoey and you know there's nothing like a closet full of clothes to like help balance that out. That's true. That's true. All right, keep going. So you see, it's just in that one experiment that 65% of people are willing to go all the way. But in all of these other scenarios they don't. And even when they do say yes, even when they go along with the experiment, as you can see in the film, they struggle

Speaker 4:          00:16:25       using the last switch on the board. Please. I'm not getting no answer. Please continue. The next word is white.

Speaker 5:          00:16:30       They have debates with themselves. Please debates with the experimenter.

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       Not once we started the experiment, something's happened. Then man attacked or something on that. The experiment requires that we continue to go on and put the man's, help me in anything, whether the learner likes it or not. We [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:16:49       What's interesting is that how all of these struggles, all of them play out the same way. It's the experimenter prodding the shockers along.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       Yeah. Nothing came together on what? 450 volts every shot now.

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       Correct. For me, it's all about the prods connect words. This is what totally pulled me into this story. Prods Stanley Milgrom had four scripted prods that he wrote out for his experimenters for when the subjects didn't want to continue. Yup. The first one was, please go on and if they didn't go on, if they resisted, he experimented, would break out prod and number two, the experiment requires that you continue.

Speaker 4:          00:17:29       Well, the experiment requires a lot. I mean, I know it does, sir, but I mean he's up to 195 o's

Speaker 5:          00:17:35       and if they still were resisting or struggling, they'd get prod number three.

Speaker 4:          00:17:39       It's absolutely essential that you continue.

Speaker 5:          00:17:41       Absolutely essential. Like you can tell a little bit more direct. It's a bit stronger. It's not an order, but the fourth prod, really the the critical, the critical

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       false prod is an absolute order. The fourth prod is

Speaker 4:          00:17:53       you got to know where the choice teacher, you have no other choice.

Speaker 5:          00:17:57       Choice teacher, you must continue. That is definitely an order. Exactly, but every time the experiment are pulled out, the fourth prod, and this was confirmed when the experiment was redone in 2006 total disobedience, Hodel disobedient. Anytime the experimenter said you must continue, the shocker would say, hell no. I've

Speaker 4:          00:18:21       don't. You have no other choice teacher. I have a choice. I'm not going to go ahead with it. Well, we'll have to discontinue the experiment then. I'm sorry.

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       Here's another one.

Speaker 4:          00:18:35       You have no other choice. You must go to have a choice. How does, if you don't continue, what we're going to have to discontinue the experiment after he says cut it out. After all he knows what he can stand. That's my opinion. That's where I'm going to stand on it.

Speaker 6:          00:18:53       So the subjects seem willing to shock another human being, but as soon as you say it's an order, they don't do it. Now that's important. It's very important because if you ask university undergraduates, what does the Milgram study show? They will invariably say something like they show that people obey orders. Okay. Well actually the one thing that the study really doesn't show is that people are, Bay audit is a pretty big thing. To me. This is a pretty big thing to miss, isn't it? Really? See, wait, if it doesn't show that people are just obeying orders. Yeah, and what does it show? Okay. I think it looks, it's like this. All right, let's go into our instruction. We will begin with this test. The participants are there in the, in the study, I've got a very plausible, very credible high-status scientist and as I say, it's a scientific institution.

Speaker 6:          00:19:41       Yale, who is going to do this powerful piece of science, direct your voice toward that microphone is the room. So they sit down in the chair thinking, wow, this is really important. I'm about to help this quest for knowledge. I really want to do a good job. Now, as we sort of know in life, lots of things that we do if they worthwhile doing and not always easy. And you find yourself in a situation where you've got to do something that's hard, like shocking, an innocent stranger over and over. But if you think that's the right thing, if you think that science is worth pursuing, you say, okay, I'll go along with this. So you're saying they are shocking these people because they thought it was worthwhile. Look, the participants, you know, they're not, it's not. It's not just blind or beaten. So, oh, you tell me. So yes sir. No Sir. Three bags full sir. They're engaged with the task that trying to be good participants. They're trying to do the right thing. They're not doing something because they have to. They're doing it because they think they ought to. And that's all the difference in the world.

Speaker 6:          00:20:47       Suddenly I'm thinking this

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       is actually a darker interpretations. Say original. Absolutely darker. They are doing it. No question about it. They have the agency. Yup. And they think it's right. Although clearly they on some level they know it isn't

Speaker 6:          00:20:58       does this sort of chilling comparison, which is a speech that Himmler gave to the SS cmss leaders when they were about to commit a range of atrocities. And he said, look, this is what you're going to do is of course you don't want to do this. Of course nobody wants to be killing other people and we realize this is hard work. But what you're doing is for the good of Germany and this is necessary in order to advance our noble cause.

Speaker 4:          00:21:24       Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:21:25       So then, hey wait, I'm almost done guys. Give me two more minutes. Two more minutes. So in the mailroom case, [inaudible] with the ideas that people will do bad if they think it's good, like the good Nobel cause. Well what's the noble cause in this case? Science. Science. You can see this in the surveys that the men filled out after the experiments were over. This was exactly what was on my mind. If the experiment, if the experiment had to be successful, it had to be carried on. The questionnaires they filled out are part of the Milgrim archive at Yale. I'm willing to help in a worthwhile experiment. And it's Kinda surprising. A lot of them are really positive even though they've just been told that they were duped. Research in any field is a must, particularly in this day and age. Do you think that more studies of this sort should be carried out? Definitely, yes.

Speaker 6:          00:22:16       We as, as onlookers to this study, we have this kind of Godlike, uh, sort of vision of like, well, of course what they're doing is wrong, but if it looks at it from another perspective, there's a sense in which you could celebrate what they're doing. I mean, I'm not suggesting one should, but I'm just saying there is a sense in which these people are prepared to do something that's very painful to them and to someone else because they want to promote science. Well, you know, you can see that's a good thing. I mean, you know

Speaker 5:          00:22:41       God cause it's like we started with this experiment that we all see as evidence of humans, latent capacity for evil. You tell us actually no, under some circumstances we don't do the bad thing we're told to do because here's another flip. We don't have to be told, in fact, we hate being told, but we will do it on our own if we think it's good. Yeah. Now you're saying actually that you could read that, that very dark fact as being actually evidence of something quite quite noble.

Speaker 6:          00:23:08       Well, if you dressed it up and if you just had some minor variance, the paradigm, you could presumably make, you know, make this out these up. These are people who are incredibly noble. They are, I mean it's the fact of course that they're administering pain to a stranger. That's what's horrifying about it. But imagine they were administering paint themselves. Imagine they were really where I had to administer shocks themselves or something. But if they were prepared to do that, when I suspect a lot of them would, um, then we'd say, these are people who really believe in Saas and isn't this a good thing that we have people in our society who are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good?

Speaker 4:          00:23:38       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:23:40       So in the end, where do you come down? Do you leave this experiment in a light mood or an a dark mood? Uh, I, th I,

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       I overall, I would say in a powerful mood, we're close to some really fundamental truths about human nature. And you know, my views about human nature is that it affords infinite potentials for lightness and dark. There's lots and lots of lessons here, but one is, I think, you know, when you're enjoined to do something for the greater good, maybe ask yourself the question, what is greater and what is good?

Speaker 1:          00:24:07       Oh, that right there. Slap some quotations around that.

Speaker 6:          00:24:09       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:24:19       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       right. Thanks to Ben Walker whose podcast he has a podcast and it's a good one. It's called too much information. Yes, it's awesome. Thank you Ben. And also thank you to Alex Haslam, professor of psychology at the University of Exeter. We'll be right back

Speaker 8:          00:24:33       the start of message. Okay, you guys take one on his Benjamin Walker and here are some radio lab credit.

Speaker 9:          00:25:07       Hello, this is Tom leads from Oaklawn, Illinois radio lab and need your help. Please visit WWE NYC dot podcasting survey.com and tell them a little bit about yourself and the podcast you love in a five minute anonymous survey. I did. You can find the link on the show page for this episode Radio Lab. Really appreciate your help. Knowing more about you helps them make more of the shows that you enjoy. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       Oh, okay. They're going to record it over. I mean, I'm going to record it here too. All three, two, one. Hey, I'm Janna. Boom. Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today evil, although I don't know if that's the right word for this next thing. Yeah. Cause it's sort of more complicate when you call someone evil, then you're kind of done with them. But there's been a fellow, I've been thinking about him from better part of the year as you know, [inaudible] such a puzzle to me. I can't quite please him though. It's very fun to try. And uh, I heard about him from science writers, Sam Keen. Well let's talk about Fritz Haber. So, so first of all, could you just like, uh, when did he live and what did he look like and that kind of stuff?

Speaker 10:         00:26:11       Uh, he was doing his, his great science work right around the turn of the 20th century. So right around 1900 very distinctive looking man bald on top trim, nice mustache. Wore a little, um, uh, peas Nez. Is that how you say? Is that [inaudible] so I'm not sure if, okay. One of those very tiny old fashioned, a pair of glasses that would pinch on your nose. And he was someone who had very big ambitions.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       Just to put that in context, they bring a few other of our storytellers in. He comes from Breslau, Germany, that's Fred Kaufman reporter, which is a fairly small, you know, smaller sort of town. And uh, so does Clara. That's for topper's wife. We're going to meet her later, right? Clara comes from the same town and they're both secularized Jews. But this was a moment in German history. He says when Jews had a decent amount of freedom, and this is the difference between Kaiser Wilhelm and of course Hitler's Germany. Yeah, put it in context. Dan Charles, he's a historian. His was the first generation when a young Jewish boy could truly imagine that he could just be a regular part of that society. He could do anything and he believed it. Fast forward, 10 years for topper is a professor, small university is working with chemicals. It's about 1880. And he throws himself with one of the central issues facing Germany that at that time Germany has a problem, a big problem. It has enough what they used to call then solar energy, you know, energy from the sun to grow crops to feed about 30 million people. However, that leaves behind 20 million Germans. Do you mean they're looking at 20 million people going hungry? That's what we're heading towards. I mean you have to remember it during the, during the Crimean war in the 1850s Europe starves,

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       so around the turn of the century for German scientists like hopper, this was the challenge. He is, he wants to feed, he wants to feed Germany, and actually this wasn't just a German thing. A lot of people were beginning to worry that with about a billion and a half people on the planet at that point that maybe we were maxing out that the earth couldn't support this many people and everyone thought, well, we know the solution. Yeah, we just need a whole lot more of one simple element. Nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen, they needed more nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids and proteins. And when you stick a seed like wheat seed in the ground, one of the reasons that grows is because it's sucking up all the nitrogen in the soil to make it cell walls. Without nitrogen, you don't have life.

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       Now, of course you could find it some nitrogen out in the world. Natural deposits would be like seaweed or manure was one. You know, you could find it in cow manure or [inaudible], which was basically poop and seagull poop, which made that poop valuable. And actually two nations in South America went to war, literally over bet. You could say people were crazy, by the way. That's reporter Latif Nasr you know, this was like oil is today. This is, everybody was desperate for sources, new sources of nitrogen, and to make the problem even more annoying, the most common source of nitrogen is in the air around us.

Speaker 7:          00:29:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       ah, it makes up four out of every five or so molecules that we breathe. So it's very a lot. Yes. 80% of the air is nitrogen atoms. So all the nitrogen you'd ever need, what's right there. You can't like throw that air onto a plant. They couldn't deploy it. They deploy it, meaning they couldn't capture it. That's right. And part of the problem here, and although once again we're getting a little ahead of ourselves, we'll be right back to that. But, but wait, wait, let's just finish. This is that is that nitrogen is try Vaillant try, try Vaillant. In other words, nitrogen has really strong attachments to itself. And what he means is that when nitrogen atoms are just free floating in the air, they will clean to each other. These little nitrogen atoms will fiercely hold together and it's almost impossible to pry them apart. His calculations showed that it couldn't be done, at least not without a tremendous amount of energy, more energy than seem like possible to make. Yeah. Yes. But you know, being ambitious harbor starts thinking, in order to do this, we need to Ah, pressure this. We need to put it under a lot of pressure. So he starts experimenting.

Speaker 11:         00:30:31       He figures out a way to take a lot of air that's filled with these little nitrogen bonds clinging to each other and pump it with big iron pig under extreme extreme pressure at high temperature and then he forces hydrogen into the tech. Get in there and you have a number of chemical reactions and what happens is that you're elbowing the nitrogen apart from excel and then forcing it to on [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         00:31:04       with the hydrogen in a new way. And when hydrogen and nitrogen bond together, the thing you get is ammonia, a liquid that is captured the nitrogen right out of the air. You literally get a drip, drip, drip of ammonia.

Speaker 7:          00:31:25       Oh

Speaker 12:         00:31:29       it is. It is arguably the most significant scientific breakthrough of the mall bred from the air was the phrase cause hopper had figured out a way to take nitrogen from the air, put it into the barren ground and grill. Wait, this has allowed the world to have 7 billion people. This is what's driving the world towards 10 12 by 2050

Speaker 7:          00:32:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         00:32:01       now we're seeing about a hundred million tons of synthetic fertilizer produced industrially each year. And that tonnage is then moves into our food source. Our food source then moves into our bodies and the rough statistics are that half of each of our bodies contains nitrogen. It's from the harbor process. No, really

Speaker 7:          00:32:29       [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         00:32:29       and so in 1918 fritz hopper gets a Nobel prize, but this is my, this is such an interesting guy. Around the same time, officials in the u s government

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       are calling him a war criminal.

Speaker 7:          00:32:47       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       all right. Just to back up for one second, after Hopper's nitrogen discovery, he was promoted. You know, he takes over the leadership of this institute in Berlin and he starts hobnobbing with a whole different level of society that Stan Charles Again, I mean, it's a pretty heady thing for, you know, a Jewish kid from Breslau to be hobnobbing with the emperor and cabinet ministers. He's part of the club and he really, really relished it. And not just because he was vain, which everyone agrees he was, but because he loves his country. He loves the fatherland and he loves Germany. So when World War One begins, he signs up immediately sends a letter volunteering for duty saying, you know the process that I use to make food. Well, I can use that same process to make explosives

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       because the thing that you put into the ground to grow more food is also the thing you can explode to make a bomb. That's correct because it takes such energy and pressure to separate it. This try Vaillant bond is so strong that when it comes back together, that energy that's released, it can be used for life or death. In any case, back to World War One, there's trench warfare. It gets bogged down and harbor has an idea. It goes straight to the German high command and he and he pitches this idea. He says, well, we can drive those enemy soldiers out of trenches with gas. Chlorine gas will basically bring it to the front and when the, when the wind is right, we'll just spray it. But the generals were not all that convinced now. They just didn't like it. A lot of them were like, this is not how you fight a war. It's like playing dirty sort of unsportsmanlike. But he organizes soldiers. He organizes whole gas units and no one even had to ask takes command of them. Partially he travels to the front. And on April 22nd, 1950 and 1915 Hubbard finds himself in a little town in Belgium

Speaker 13:         00:34:45       called e, y. P. R. E. S. Actually the Americans called it Yips, whatever you call it. This was one of the bloodiest arenas on the western front. The Germans were on one side, the fringe, the Canadians and the British on the other. And there behind the German lines is our, our friend, our friend of me, uh, for topic, our friend, he's bald. He has a pot belly. He has these [inaudible] spectacles. He's chomping on a Virginian Cigar. He was always smoking these Virginians cigars and he's wearing a fur coat really? And what is basically like the Baghdad of his time. But nobody had done

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       what he was about to do on the scale that he was about to do it. So basically at 6:00 PM on April 22nd when the wind was just right, he says harbors gas troops on unscrew, they opened the valve

Speaker 13:         00:35:39       on almost 6,000 tanks containing 150 tons of chlorine. That's like an adult blue whale of chlorine. Just trying to imagine that as that like a, like a green cloud does that some people describe it as a cloud and then others describe it as this kind of 15 foot wall kind of hugging the land and it's just sort of approach and it's moving at about one meter per second and according to some accounts as it crept across no man's land, the leaves would just sort of shrivel and the grass was turning to the color of metal. Birds would just fall from the air within minutes the gas reached the allied side and as soon as it did, soldiers began to convulse. They were gagging, they were choking, hundreds of them were falling to the ground. What is the guest doing to them exactly? I think what it's doing is it's a, if you breathe it in, it sort of irritates your lungs to the extent that they sort of fills up with fluid so quickly that you sort of drown in your own flam sitting like actually drowning, literally drowning on land. Wow. Yellow Mucus was frothing out of their mouth. Those who could still breathe would turn blue. This is the description of hell yeah. But harbor solid has a wonderful success and wished, wished that the Germans had been better prepared to exploit it because he felt like they really could have made a terrific advance if they had had more confidence

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       and he is celebrated for it. He gets promoted to the rank of captain and he goes home for a few days a hero. But when he gets there, he has to contend with his wife, Clara Emma Var, Clara also from Breslau office, also from a Jewish family and also a scientist. Huh. Unusually so in those times she was actually a sort of a genius herself. She was one of the first women to earn a phd in her country. And shortly after his return, Clara allegedly confronts him and says, look, you are morally bankrupt. How could you? Um, but Haber just kind of ignored her. And according to legend, he actually threw a dinner party in celebration of the big victory, invited his friends over. Now we don't actually know if he threw a party. Like I consider that apocryphal. Dan doesn't think so. But what's clear is that he saw no reason to question what he had done. And that infuriated Clara especially because she found out he was leaving the next day to direct more gas attacks and they'd probably had an argument. Yeah, undoubtedly. They had an argument that's historian Fritz Stern, who also happens to be fritz Hopper's Godson. They had a quarrel more than that, let's call it a fight. And later that night after the party harbor takes a bunch of sleeping pills and goes to sleep. Um, and she takes a service revolver, if it's pistol walks outside to the garden and

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       pulls the trigger, shoots herself in the chest and is found by her son, by her son. Yes. Age to teen, I think. Uh, and he finds her actually still alive with the life about to run out of her, uh, harbor. It's unknown what happens for the rest of that evening, but it is a well-documented fact that the very next morning on schedule, he goes back to the, to the front, to the eastern front. Leaving. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         00:39:06       His son, uh, alone with his dead mother. That's

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       cold, Huh? Yeah. Heartless ed was a terrible moment. Did he run away? Was it duty? The sign? Eventually after he immigrates to America,

Speaker 7:          00:39:28       [inaudible] kills himself. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       see now around this point, I just don't want to have anything to do with this guy. This is a, I just want to take a shower. Walk away. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:39:49       Yeah, me too.

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       You know, on the other hand, I mean, if you look at the grand calculus people, he's helped or fed versus people he's killed. I mean, he's felt that billions of people. I don't know that you could entirely call him bad. I might even tilt towards saying he's a little good to be honest. You wouldn't though, would you really? Would you really think that this guy's a good guy? Honestly, yeah. Just because of a mathematical summing up. We're talking billions of people. He's standing there on the front pushing the gas into the lungs or other human beings. It's merely, it's a war, but still, then he goes and you know, and celebrates that and then walks away from his child and his wife did in the garden and says more of that please. Well, there's something distasteful about the fact that he was too into it. But like I do think on some level you have to divorce the man from his deeds and you've got to ask, is the world better with him or without him? I think you've got to answer it with him. Right. Well, to keep going with the story. Yeah. Alright. So Sam, what happened to this guy after World War One?

Speaker 10:         00:40:58       He actually was very humiliated that Germany had lost and especially humiliated over the fact that they had to pay enormous war reparations to other countries. So he decided he was going to invent a process to pay for these reparations by himself. And what he decided to do is go into the ocean, into sea water, which contains, um, uh, very small levels of gold. But you know, over the entire ocean there's a lot of gold dissolved into the sea. And he spent five years

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       in a few tile effort to distill gold from the ocean's waters. Sounds insane. On the other hand, if anyone could do it, he was trying to repeat this master stroke. Needless to say, he fails. It was actually a crushing blow for, for him. And then things really take a turn. 1933 comes and Hitler takes over. And one of the first acts that the Nazis do is to basically issue an order that says there shall be no Jews in the civil service. Now harbor was Jewish, but because he'd served in World War One, he technically would be exempt. But 75% of the people who worked for him at the institute, they were Jewish and they would have to be dismissed. So he decides to take a stand and says, this is intolerable. I'm going to resign. He says that he's a, he's always been hiring people based on how smart they are and not who their grandparents were. So he sends a letter to the Ministry of Education, resigning, and he leaves Germany telling a friend. He felt like he'd lost his homeland. And then he starts this a period of roaming. He eventually goes to England. But in a famous incident, one of England's leading scientists refuses to shake his hand. And he is basically homeless at this point. You know, he's a man adrift. Meanwhile, his health is failing. In 1934 he takes a trip to Switzerland, to a sanatorium, but before he can get there, his heart fails and he dies.

Speaker 7:          00:43:06       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       Now there's a footnote to this that is very strange. Um, I got a little, uh, my, I, this is my dorsal hairs stood up when I read the end of this. Right. So during World War One, harbor's institute had developed a formulation of, um, insect killing gas called Zyklon Zyklon a, which was originally just a pesticide. Once again, another nitrogen compound. It was developed in his institute. He knew about it. In fact, his chemist had given this particular pesticide, a smell was, it was a warning smell so that people didn't inadvertently breathe it in and get sick. But after the Nazis take over, this is after he died, they reached back to the shelf and they find this xy clon stuff and they asked for it to be reformulated to take out the warning smell and it becomes Zyklon B, the killing gas of the concentration camps.

Speaker 7:          00:44:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:44:07       did members of Hubbard's family die in the concentration camps? Yeah. Members of his extended family did. Certainly friends of his did is something deeply, deeply wounding, stressing, upsetting at the thought that he had anything to do with sibling B. But he did the use of it. He couldn't have imagined

Speaker 7:          00:44:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:44:55       so how do you feel about him now? Because I don't know. I can't help but feel bad for the guy despite the chlorine gas. Like he didn't intend for that to happen. He could have never imagined that. No, but, but there's part of me that says, you know, here's a guy who just wanted to do everything better than he had ever been done before. Whether it was feeding or killing or any does. He does, but he does it with a kind of amoral athleticism. You know, he, he does it without humility, without, without a lot of doubt. And you know, it's a craft, but it's a craft with consequences and to approach it with kind of crazy joy. I don't know. I would rather have scientists who carry doubt with them as they proceed. Yeah, I agree with that. Maybe it's all about doubt in the end.

Speaker 7:          00:45:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         00:45:55       thanks to all our great storytellers, Dan Charles, Sam keen, lots of Nasser, Fred Kaufman and Fritz Stern. You can find out more information about it.

Speaker 9:          00:46:03       All those guys on our website. radiolab.org

Speaker 15:         00:46:08       hi, my name's Josh and I'm calling from Harlem New York. Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org thanks.

Speaker 9:          00:46:30       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today we're talking about, well, we're trying to think about what goes on in the mind of a bad person. What makes a bad person so bad that he's different from the rest of us and we don't really come to any kind of agreement with the hopper thing. Yeah, I don't think we quite know, but you know, we ended up walking this question around different people want to talk about bad people in Shakespeare. And oddly enough, we came, got a really interesting take on the true nature of badness from this Guy James Shapiro, professor of English at Columbia University and he said to start, you want to know about bad? I'll give you bet in Titus Andronicus, there's a character by the name of Aaron, the Moore, and there's a moment in the play where Aaron gets up on stage, looks at the audience and says, let me just tell you the kinds of things I've been up to recently, said deadly enmity between two friends make poor men's cattle, break their necks, set fire on bonds, and he stacks in the night and bid the owners questions, quenched him with the tears off.

Speaker 9:          00:47:29       Have I digged up dead men from their graves and sit them upright of their dear friends door? Oh, even even with this sorrows almost were forgotten. And on their skins is on the bark of trees have wind my life with my knife carved in Roman letters. Let not your sorrows die though I am dead.

Speaker 9:          00:47:54       So he's bad. Yeah, but see, here's the interesting thing. According to James, he's not the baddest no in Shakespeare or in life because ultimately the play offers up a reason for his nastiness. The reason why he's telling all this stuff is because he has cut a deal. They will spare his son if he fastest up and and tells them what they need to know. So there's a way in which is a touch of spark of humanity, just a little glimmer. And he says that's what people wanted. They wanted someone who was really thrillingly bad but in the end was a redeemed a bit. Yeah. This wasn't just a theater thing. No. Cause if you couldn't afford a ticket for a player, you'd seen all the plays in the 1500 you could always go to a public hanging and you'd go for much the same reasons.

Speaker 9:          00:48:38       And those days if you're a convicted felon, you are, you know, strung up, but you're not allowed to hang until you die. You're cut down before then warning, this next part's a little graphic. Then the executioner cast rates, you cuts you open and takes out your internal organs and then separate your head, which is put on a post. But even with all that Gore and horribleness, there was often a moment that people waited for. And in a way we wait for it still. Even now, we want what Alyssa beef and Scott at the scaffold, which was a confession before the guy is cut to shreds. He's allowed to confess. You know, I, I hardly, you know, regret the fact that I, uh, kill the young Baden or defame the king, whatever it is. The expectation is somebody is made to make his peace with his maker before he dies. That's what you do. And that's what Shakespeare did. And all his plays, he would give all his baddies at least one moment where they could be understood except this one time. So be like a two

Speaker 12:         00:49:45       in tough. He is a soldier. He works for a general, the general's name is a fellow there supposedly chums, but General Othello has no idea that he Jago hates him. So he plans to destroy a fellow and then we don't exactly know why. There are hints of reasons like maybe he thinks a fellow sleeping with his wife, we're not sure. But the weird thing is that he decides not just to take down the fellow, but everybody, no, no, no. What you did, he stirs up hatred between friends, friends

Speaker 9:          00:50:24       between lovers. He even schemes against his wife. This is just somebody who's performing brain surgery without anesthesia on other people. Uh, he's a master planner. And as for why maybe a fellow was sleeping with Amelia.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       But as the play goes on, you begin to think that maybe that's just another lie. Eventually Iago convinces a fellow that his wife has been disloyal, which she hasn't. And then Othello goes and kills his own wife, smothering her with a pillow. This is just at tsunami of Eva passes through the plant. [inaudible] is good. And at the very end of the play, when everyone finds out what y'all goes done, fellow asks him, why, why did you do this?

Speaker 9:          00:51:18       Any Jago he refuses what we fully expect and what everybody on stage at that moment fully expects from him. You know, what does he say? Um, demand mean nothing. What you know, no, from this time forth, I never will speak word. I'm not saying a word. I'm not going to give you what you want. I'm not going to give you, I'm not going to help restore the sense that there is a moral order to the world. And a moral norm.

Speaker 7:          00:52:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:52:05       what you know, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       if this is the singular moment in Shakespeare where he gives you an understandably evil man. No Motors, no reason.

Speaker 7:          00:52:21       Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       Any idea what the hell he was intending?

Speaker 7:          00:52:25       What's she know, you know

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       of it? Meaning, I mean w any idea where he was in his mind? Was he trying to make a commentary? So there was he grappling with something? Do we know? No, you know, dammit

Speaker 9:          00:52:44       the goody Algos make you want to shower the minute you leave the theater cause you are Sally by them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Thank you to James Shapiro who his most recent book is called contested. Will. You know what you, unless you have you there. Yeah. Well you know what I'm left thinking though. He's like, if you could somehow, I mean that was make-believe, but if you could somehow get a real Jago in the room and subject that person to questioning and really get them to sort of fess up as to why they did it, would that make a difference? We should say that this next section of the program has some references which are extremely graphic. Yeah. Not to everybody's taste. So we have kids in the, in the room and maybe this is at a time they tell them to go brush their teeth or something. Yeah, yeah. It comes to us from our reporter parenting. Scott

Speaker 11:         00:53:26       is Jeff Johnson. Nice to meet you. All right, so who is this guy? We're here.

Speaker 16:         00:53:31       This is Jeff Jensen and he's a reporter in La and he wrote this graphic novel that I read about one of the most prolific serial killers in u s history. Gary Leon Ridgway, the green river killer. The first victims of the green river killer were found in the summer of 1982 the green river murders terrorized Seattle in the 1980s in Seattle today, a man called the green river killer. Ridgeway murdered at least 49 women, so called Green River killer. It's suspected that it could be upwards of 75 making him the most prolific serial killer in American history. All the victims were prostitutes. He buried them or left their bodies in these little clumps in the woods. The kind of seemed to a place to bodies as if they were mannequins. And in January of 1984, the green river task force was formed and my father was recruited at the task force.

Speaker 16:         00:54:21       So Jeff wrote this book because his father, Tom Jensen, was one of the lead detectives tracking Gary Way. He ultimately spent 17 years searching for this man. In December of 2001, my father and his colleagues make the arrest DNA testing matched him to the crime they arrest Gary League, Leon Ridgway. And on June 13th, 2003, Gary was secretly taken out of his jail cell and brought to a sort of very nondescript concrete, ugly office building. And um, over the next six months, from June to early December, it was Tom's job to get Gary to open up and give up the few details that they really needed to link him certifiably to all these crimes.

Speaker 11:         00:55:09       Today's date is June 17th, 2003, at the time now is zero eight 36 hours. So every day they would bring them into this conference room is a continuation of an interview with Gary Leon Ridgway and interrogate them. What did you remember since we last talked? You got those all attuned mostly. Um, some that, uh, I remember picking her up and um, it immediately became apparent that there was going to be difficulties as far as I know. I don't know if I did or not. You would deny

Speaker 16:         00:55:45       things. He would obscure, he would dance around things you didn't really want a cop to. Everything that he did.

Speaker 11:         00:55:52       Did I gotta Tell Ya? Uh, I mean, not totally comfortable that you're providing all the information,

Speaker 16:         00:55:58       especially when it came to one particular fact. What my father and his colleagues know is that something was done to these body, many of them after they were murdered. Does he, is he saying what I think he's saying? Necrophilia Gary is dancing around this topic. Gary had denied this to his own lawyers and that we're not going to be shot. So my father and the other interviewer in that room, that morning, detective John Madson, they start using a line of, uh, attacked of, uh, of interviewing him. That was very,

Speaker 11:         00:56:33       it's okay. It's okay if you did. Stunningly, shockingly empathetic, nothing to be ashamed. Thousands of people have done it before. You know, I'm not the first one. You know, you're not the first person that's ever done this, not going to be the last one. You won't be the last. That's one of the things that we really need to know if father's trying to like reach out to him. Okay. I know it was more than marriage. It's okay to admit this. You need to admit this. Okay. It's all right. We've got to note that. That's one of the things that you have to know and that's why it's okay to let him know and he does a yes, I did lie about that. Potential is a, I would bet one time before that I, like I said, I've got to give it out. It can't keep holding and holding it numbers,

Speaker 16:         00:57:30       building up. This was a major breakthrough so he ends up admitting it in graphic detail and it gets even more disturbing for my father as the conversation suddenly pivots to another victim

Speaker 11:         00:57:42       other than one that was real close to me by the name of Carol Christian said Christian. I dated her several times, three times, two times.

Speaker 16:         00:57:52       He brings her up as an example of a of a woman that he actually had strong feelings for

Speaker 11:         00:57:58       like just like just girl lecturers. She was skinny, she was good to me

Speaker 16:         00:58:04       and as it happens my father has very vivid memories of investigating the Carol Christianson murder. Speaking with Carol's mom, Carol's little daughter

Speaker 11:         00:58:13       killed her. She was, I knew she had a daughter.

Speaker 16:         00:58:17       And so your last, Gary's starts going through this narrative of what he did to Carol

Speaker 11:         00:58:23       the last time she was in our hurry. She like was allegedly in a rush and she didn't and like it kind of

Speaker 16:         00:58:32       [inaudible] hurt his feelings

Speaker 11:         00:58:34       wasn't satisfying me with make me mad because she very much hurry. She doesn't melt in her mind, and I killed her killer at shelter with my arm and weight killer cared for because I dated before, but this tape didn't turn out right

Speaker 16:         00:59:00       up until that point. Gary refused to say that from the minute I picked these women up, I wanted to kill them. He claimed they were in the middle of a sex act. He would get distracted, something would happen. He just kind of went crazy. He had snapped and almost like blaming the victims and my father wasn't buying it. Let's hold back up a little bit. The fact

Speaker 11:         00:59:22       that he kept on doing it over and over and over again, it was like, come on. You've been through this a lot of times before and she's already told you she's in a hurry. You knew what was going to happen and you've done this. How many times? 10 Times, 10 1520 times. You know what's going to happen is she pisses you off and you like telling this all, get you go into this knowing full well that it could end up in her dash and Gary just says, yes. That is true. When I picked him up, I was going to kill them. Finally acknowledging. Yeah, that's true. There's a pause and my father just says, why? Why? Why did you do this? You need the killed. And that was a question that had haunted my father for decades. Why isn't that why and that one simple why that he asks Gary, there was a lot of questions. He was asking, why did you inflict all this suffering on them? On us? Why did you take these women off the streets and wanting to destroy them? Why? Why?

Speaker 11:         01:00:37       The answer is unsatisfying. Yes. I did need to kill, kill her because, wait, what? I just needed to kill because of that and then he just trails off. I need to kill because of that. That's it. It just, you know, I just wanted to kill him. I just needed to kill them in that moment. My father, he stands up. Then he says, touch me. You've touched me, Gary, you touched me. You take a break. Okay, we're going off tape now. Is there a nine 24 hours on June 17th year, 2004 he walked out of the way a room and just started weeping.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       They spent the next six months interrogating him. They brought in psychiatrists and forensic psychologists to try to get an answer. Gary says, I needed to kill him. They go, why? And he says, because of the rage and well, why the rage? And because women have stepped on me all my life. Well, why can't you deal with it in a normal way? Each answer just begs another why and even though in the end they got him to confess to these 49 murders, they never really get any closer to an answer than this first one.

Speaker 3:          01:02:09       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:02:09       that afternoon he gets in his car, goes home, he finds my mom on the deck, he sits down next to her

Speaker 3:          01:02:18       [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         01:02:18       she says, what happened today? My Dad said, I don't want to talk about it. And to this day they have not talked about that day and he hasn't talked about it with anyone until I interviewed him for the book. And why is it so important do you think, to understand the why behind such an evil act? Well, the thing that haunts me about the why question is that I'm reminded of like one of the oldest stories in the Bible, which is the story of job. The story of job is that one day God and Satan are having a conversation and they're saying, have you checked out job? You know, I'm really proud of job. He believes in me and he trusts me so much and he has such great faith in me and Satan is like, ah, I bet I can change his mind. And so Satan basically systematically destroys job's life, takes away his wife, his children, all his material possessions. What follows is this ongoing conversation between Jobe and his friends about why does this happen? Why does God allow this to happen? Only then does God speak up and kind of say like, you're going to question me like, you know who are you?

Speaker 16:         01:03:36       My point is sometimes when we ask the why in the face of profound evil, I kind of wonder if what we're doing is that we're daring God to show himself and I think what we want out of the y is meaning meaning to life, to reveal itself in a way that restores order and gives us hope that all of this isn't just meaningless chaos.
