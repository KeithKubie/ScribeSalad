Now that we've discussed some of the models of motivation, let's move on to the

00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:08.408
study of some of the things that motivate us, such as our motivation to eat. We

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:13.881
can think of hunger as a homeostatic need. And we can look at this as having a

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:18.343
feedback and a feed-forward signal. Let's start with a negative feedback

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:23.415
signal. The negative feedback signal tells us when to stop an activity. And in

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.624
regards to food, the signals are generated as the food passes through our

00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:33.230
mouth, stomach, and small intestine. One of the major negative feedback systems

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.756
signals the release of the hormone, cholecystokinin. Or cck for short. From the

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:43.180
stomach and intestine walls. One thing that cck does is reduce the pleasure

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.140
from ingested food so that an animal will stop eating. There are also some

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
specific chemical satiety signals released by eating particular types of food.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.847
However. That we may have a satiety signal for one type of food, it doesn't

00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:02.502
hold for all foods. Therefore, we see that we may be full for one type of food

00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:07.258
but not for another type of food. So, we may be sated for one type of food and

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:12.320
therefore we turn to another type of food. Let's go to Greg for an example
