00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:17.305
One of the grandest scientific tools ever made by mankind

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.051
is called an atom smasher.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.095
And I mean literally grand.

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:22.219
The biggest one ever built,

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.775
the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.851
is a ring with a circumference of about 18 miles.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:30.688
That's more than the entire length of Manhattan.

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:32.356
So what is an atom smasher?

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:35.526
It is a device that collides atomic nuclei together

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:36.841
at extremely high energy.

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.779
The most powerful one scientists have ever built

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.612
can heat matter to the hottest temperatures ever achieved,

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:44.540
temperatures last seen at a trillionth of second

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.293
after the universe began.

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:49.120
Our accelerators are full of engineering superlatives.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.459
The beam-containing region of the LHC is a vacuum,

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.128
with lower pressure than what surrounds

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:55.899
the international space station,

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.301
and is 456 degrees Fahrenheit below zero,

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.677
colder than the temperature of deepest space.

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:05.804
A previous accelerator sitting in the LHC tunnel

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:08.100
holds the world record for velocity,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.087
accelerating an electron to a speed so fast

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:13.188
that if it were to race a photon of light,

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:15.523
it would take about 14 minutes for the photon

00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:17.819
to get a lead of about 10 feet.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:18.865
If that doesn't impress you,

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.830
remember the photon is fastest thing in the universe,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.500
it goes about 186,000 miles per second.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.754
So how do these subatomic particle accelerators work?

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.836
Well, they use electric fields.

00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:34.419
Electric fields make charged particles move in the same way

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.928
that gravity will pull a dropped baseball.

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:38.381
The force from the electric field

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.452
will pull a particle to make it move.

00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:42.309
The speed will continue to increase

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:45.522
until the charged particle is moving incredibly fast.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.710
A simple particle accelerator can be made

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.776
by hooking two parallel metal plates to a battery.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.459
The charge from the battery moves

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:53.794
on to the two metal plates

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:56.564
and makes an electric field that pulls the particle along.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:57.523
And that's it,

00:01:57.523 --> 00:01:59.355
you got a particle accelerator.

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:03.071
The problem is that an accelerator built this way is very weak.

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.825
Building a modern accelerator like the LHC this way

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:09.992
would take over five trillion standard D-cell batteries.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:12.043
So scientists use much stronger batteries

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:13.767
and put them one after another.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.294
An earlier accelerator used this method

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:17.926
and was about a mile long

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:21.052
and was equivalent to 30 billion batteries.

00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:22.673
However, to make an accelerator

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:24.792
that is equivalent to five trillion batteries

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:28.385
would require an accelerator 150 miles long.

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.868
Scientists needed another way.

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:33.556
While electric fields would make a particle go faster,

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:36.529
magnetic fields make them move in a circular path.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.856
If you put an electric field along the circle,

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:41.826
you don't need to use miles of electric fields,

00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:44.815
you can use a single electric field over and over again.

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:46.570
The beams go around the circle,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.656
and each time they gain more energy.

00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:51.617
So very high-energy accelerators consist of

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:54.414
a short region with accelerating electric fields,

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:56.620
combined with long series of magnets

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.418
that guide the particles in a circle.

00:02:58.418 --> 00:02:59.836
The strength of the magnets

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:01.421
and the radius of the circular path

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.612
determines the maximum energy of the beam.

00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:06.449
Once the beam is zooming along,

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.094
then the real fun begins,

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:09.384
the smashing.

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:10.742
The reason physicists want to get

00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:12.357
those particles moving so fast

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:14.433
is so that they can slam them into one another.

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:15.916
These collisions can teach us

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:18.622
about the fundamental rules that govern matter,

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:21.214
but they'd be impossible without the feat of engineering

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:23.776
that is the particle accelerator.
