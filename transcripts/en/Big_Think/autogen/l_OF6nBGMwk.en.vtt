slightly better results but again you

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220
you know as a writer it's a little sad
 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.879
you know as a writer it's a little sad
to say but it kind of comes down to just

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
to say but it kind of comes down to just
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.170

is and I just just blast it out you know

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650
is and I just just blast it out you know
 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.690
is and I just just blast it out you know
and those actually they do worse they do

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700
and those actually they do worse they do
 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.129

and so you get you it's very easy to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090
and so you get you it's very easy to
 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.430
and so you get you it's very easy to
arrive at the results per unit effort is

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440
arrive at the results per unit effort is
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440
arrive at the results per unit effort is

those things go because you know it's
 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.589
those things go because you know it's
it's it's just the online equivalent of
