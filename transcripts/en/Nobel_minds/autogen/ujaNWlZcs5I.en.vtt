hello I'm sahana Peters from Bangalore
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.510
hello I'm sahana Peters from Bangalore
i'm in class 11 and I'm have taken up

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520
i'm in class 11 and I'm have taken up
 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.210
i'm in class 11 and I'm have taken up
computer science my question is to mr.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
computer science my question is to mr.
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.020
computer science my question is to mr.
Albert and it is that what do you see

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
Albert and it is that what do you see
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.900
Albert and it is that what do you see
the future for nanotechnology in four

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
the future for nanotechnology in four
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.710
the future for nanotechnology in four
people in comatose situations and

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
people in comatose situations and
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.420
people in comatose situations and
especially in developing countries where

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
especially in developing countries where
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.710
especially in developing countries where
money is a major criteria so I can say

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
money is a major criteria so I can say
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.140
money is a major criteria so I can say
you cannot separate a nanotechnology

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
you cannot separate a nanotechnology
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509
you cannot separate a nanotechnology
from all the other technology and from

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
from all the other technology and from
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060
from all the other technology and from
science in general what is important for

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
science in general what is important for
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.959
science in general what is important for
developing country is due to to study

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
developing country is due to to study
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.340
developing country is due to to study
for to have students being becoming good

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
for to have students being becoming good
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.680
for to have students being becoming good
in science in general and developing

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
in science in general and developing
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.220
in science in general and developing
then the technological level of their

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
then the technological level of their
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979
then the technological level of their
country nanotechnology is maybe the most

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
country nanotechnology is maybe the most
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.560
country nanotechnology is maybe the most
difficult for developing country because

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
difficult for developing country because
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.910
difficult for developing country because
these needs facilities that very

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
these needs facilities that very
 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
these needs facilities that very
expensive and difficult to buy in poor

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
expensive and difficult to buy in poor
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149
expensive and difficult to buy in poor
countries so but the main thing is to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
countries so but the main thing is to
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.110
countries so but the main thing is to
begin with science in general
