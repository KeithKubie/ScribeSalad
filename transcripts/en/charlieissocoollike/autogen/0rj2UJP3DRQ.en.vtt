not a single blank how horrible oh

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240
not a single blank how horrible oh
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.390
not a single blank how horrible oh
that's disgusting to look at that is my

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
that's disgusting to look at that is my
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.980

okay here are my results which you can't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
okay here are my results which you can't
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.510
okay here are my results which you can't
see because the light is too bright but

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
see because the light is too bright but
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120
see because the light is too bright but
I will now calculate our results and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
I will now calculate our results and
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.690
I will now calculate our results and
make a graph because I'm cool so instead

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
make a graph because I'm cool so instead
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.980
make a graph because I'm cool so instead
of making a graph a little Peter I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
of making a graph a little Peter I
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.120
of making a graph a little Peter I
thought I would make a graph out of the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
thought I would make a graph out of the
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160

wine gums probably won't eat them now
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.380
wine gums probably won't eat them now
but yeah it's interesting to see first

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
but yeah it's interesting to see first
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.190
but yeah it's interesting to see first
we're gonna start off with the bad

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
we're gonna start off with the bad

best tasting wine gums out
they're right any one of these blanks we

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
they're right any one of these blanks we
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.790
they're right any one of these blanks we
have exactly the same number of the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800
have exactly the same number of the
 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.990
have exactly the same number of the
others ingredients which i think is very

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
others ingredients which i think is very
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.610
others ingredients which i think is very
interesting hold on

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
interesting hold on
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620
interesting hold on
there we go that's better obviously this

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
there we go that's better obviously this
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.390
there we go that's better obviously this
is only from ten packs so I can't draw a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
is only from ten packs so I can't draw a
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.310
is only from ten packs so I can't draw a
distinct conclusion but I've decided

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
distinct conclusion but I've decided
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.260
distinct conclusion but I've decided
from this point onwards whenever I buy a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
from this point onwards whenever I buy a
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.300
from this point onwards whenever I buy a
pack of wild herbs I will count how many

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
pack of wild herbs I will count how many
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280

different colors there are in each

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
different colors there are in each
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740
different colors there are in each
packet and add to my results I've made

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750
packet and add to my results I've made
 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.290

and when I was putting them out I
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.570
and when I was putting them out I
noticed there were a number of hairs on

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
noticed there were a number of hairs on
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.820

which is a shame but you know it's all
 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.060
which is a shame but you know it's all
for the good of science right why is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
for the good of science right why is
 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.760
for the good of science right why is
this such an issue here in Britain I
