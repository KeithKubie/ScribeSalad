00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.080
So we're going to define what is context and tell you how

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.030
to get it just right. But first, we're going to hear from

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.860
a user that we visited back in lesson one and he's

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.500
going to tell us how he feels when we get context wrong.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.090
&gt;&gt; An app I really like is ESPN Scorecenter but what,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.580
there's a feature about it that I really don't like. Well,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.650
I do like, but not at all times. It, it will

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.570
send you updates of things that are happening in the sports

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.150
world. I don't care about everything that's happening in the sports

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.001
world. I don't want it to text me at 2 a.m

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:35.400
and wake me up to tell me that you know somebody

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.720
caught the world's biggest fish or whatever. That, that doesn't, I don't

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.710
care about it. So it seems like Clark experienced a UX fail.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.280
&gt;&gt; I know, it's really sad, but it could have

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.860
been avoided. Which one of these sensors would you use

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.000
to make sure that Clark doesn't get woken up in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.840
the middle of the night with information he doesn't want?
