00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.480
AREZOO RIAHI: Women
around the world

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.230
have made remarkable strides,
socially, economically,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.530
academically.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.900
However, there is
still a ways to go.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.260
Cultural barriers hinder
women's presence and advancement

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.560
in the fields of science,
tech, engineering, and math.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.170
And this is happening
here in our own backyard,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.700
in Silicon Valley.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.430
But it's nothing compared to
what is happening in the Middle

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.170
East and North Africa.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220
As director of TechWomen,
I have the privilege

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.320
to work with the very
women who are working

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.164
to solve these challenges.

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:43.580
I think we started
a little early,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.960
I'm going to wait for
my slides to catch up.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.650
The root cause this is
not a lack of education.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.530
In fact, more women
enroll in science and tech

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.270
related degrees than men.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.430
The problem is that women
are simply not getting hired.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.900
Unemployment is high, and
when positions are available,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.010
they're going to the men.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.160
In the Middle East, less
than one third of women

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.240
participate in the
workforce, according

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.580
to the World Bank, which is
the lowest among all regions.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.900
And if women aren't working,
everyone-- their families,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.820
their businesses, and
their communities--

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.800
are missing out
on a contribution

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.922
of a key demographic.

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:30.240
I'm sorry, where are the
slid-- oh, here we go.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.140
OK.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.750
I'm still going to stand here.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.040
This is our first Ignite talk.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.360
Ha, ha.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.240
OK, so I was in Jordan
a few weeks ago,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.470
and the country is facing
serious challenges.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.180
With so many refugees from
neighboring countries,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.270
their infrastructure cannot
accommodate the influx

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.400
of people.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.900
And as you can imagine,
fixing the gender gap

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.540
is just not at the top
of their priority list.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.530
And that's why we go
to places like Jordan.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.820
We meet with girls, and we
inspire them to pursue careers

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.610
in science and tech.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.560
We feel this is a
way for them to build

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.940
a bright future for
themselves, and we

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.710
do everything we can to
support them to be successful.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.960
And the good news is that
despite what I just described,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.740
there's a lot happening in
Jordan's vibrant capital

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.770
of Amman.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.680
Here's a photo of
their business park.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.540
It's become the
hub for innovation,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.110
and it's a place for thought
leaders come together.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.210
As you can see,
Google Developers

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.370
have had an event there,
just a few years back.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.530
And here's where TechWomen
has made an impact.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.490
Meet Hannan.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.490
She is a TechWomen
alumni from 2013

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.420
who works at the
business park, where

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.790
she launched a startup to teach
kids as young as 8 how to code.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.750
This year 30 schools will
implement her curriculum

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.460
for 40,000 students.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.900
And this is Afnan.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.320
She participated in a
program five years ago,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.440
and came home to launch
a program teaching kids

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.380
about hardware and robotics.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.280
And they're just two examples
of alumni going home and making

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.250
a difference.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.080
And it is critical for
that, because in order

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.420
to effect real
change, it needs to be

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.030
done by the people
who are living

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.820
in those very communities.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.730
We need to have women to
serve as positive role models

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.580
and to encourage girls to
pursue careers, and inspire

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.540
them to stay with it.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.600
But the challenge that
they and others face

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.110
is that nobody wants to invest
in the Middle East today.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.317
And I get it.

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:26.900
You know, there's
so much instability,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.430
there's so much risk, and they
don't have a robust ecosystem

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.144
there.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.560
And this seasoned
angels from here

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.530
aren't going to go and
do that, bridge the gap.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.290
And that's where
TechWomen comes in.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.560
We're a network of
more than 700 women

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.310
helping women from
the Middle East,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.310
to Africa, to Central Asia.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.060
And we help each other
overcome barriers

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.490
and we help our alumni make the
impact they feel is most needed

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.170
in their local community.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.140
That's TechWomen.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.950
We bring women from 21
countries to the Bay Area

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.620
for professional mentorship.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.300
Beyond that, we
connect and empower

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.800
them with a network of women
who have the knowledge, skills,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.230
and will to make things happen.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.480
In those four short
weeks, the women

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.440
are exposed to innovative
ideas and technologies.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.460
And even more importantly,
they meet positive role models

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.080
and other women leaders.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.070
Those four weeks are
just the beginning,

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.640
and this is where
the impact begins.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.200
While here, the women
collaborate with their country

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.630
cohorts to devise an
action plan to address

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.460
social and economic issues.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.520
Our Jordanian
fellows, for example,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.450
went back home and
developed a program

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.820
to support female graduates and
increase the number of women

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.340
in the workforce.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.040
They, along with five
other action plan groups,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.090
won a [INAUDIBLE] grant to
make those plans a reality.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.660
These women are
the change agents

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.396
who know what their
community needs firsthand,

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:42.770
and they're taking
the bold steps

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.490
to make a lasting difference.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.210
Well, challenges are global.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.920
So is the power of
mentorship and our network.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.130
We couldn't do it without
the support of companies

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.070
like Google, who take the
time, support, energy,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.730
and inspiration, and
offer it to the mentors.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.190
And it's what makes our
program a success today.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.520
Silicon Valley has
long embraced a culture

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.490
of moving fast and taking leaps.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.850
There's so much movement
toward greater diversity

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.402
and breaking cultural norms.

00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:10.610
And we're shaping a movement.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.620
And not only can
we set precedents,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.330
but we have the impact
to change the globe.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.030
The fact is, when women
are healthy and educated,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.940
their children are
healthy and educated.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.740
When women are empowered,
their families are empowered.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.930
Stronger families means
stronger communities,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.190
and it is our hope
for a better tomorrow.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.300
Minimal amount of
time and effort,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.100
through mentorship,
funding, networking,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.520
and simply spreading the word
can make an invaluable impact

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.860
on one person, like Hannan
and Afnan, who went back

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.470
home and made a change.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.450
Come visit our
booth to learn more.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.410
Thank you very much.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.210
