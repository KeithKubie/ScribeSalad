00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm and audience editor,
and I'm the science fiction

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.420

Please subscribe, democracy
dies if you don't subscribe.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.340
Thank you.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.640
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Do it.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.940
Do it. Keep "The Post" alive.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.240
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: So,
I have some formalities

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.540
that I have to get
through first.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.840
So, "The Washington Post"
is a charter sponsor

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.400
of The National Book Festival.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.170
And we'd like give thanks to
the cochairmen of the festival,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.710
David Rubenstein and the
other generous sponsors

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.620
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.630
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.260
please note the information
in your programs.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.420
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.550
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.570
up to the microphone you will
be included in the videotape

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.920
of this event, which could
be broadcast at a later date.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.040
Make sure your cell
phones are on silent.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.340
The usual.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.880
And so, I'm very honored to be
here today with Leigh Bardugo.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.950
And I am super lucky, and I got

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.670
to interview her
like two years ago.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.290
And in that time, she's
published a bunch of stuff.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.220
You've got "Wonder
Woman: Warbringer."

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.200
You've released a
collection of short stories.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.760
And that's "The Language
of Thorns."

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.210
And she finished her latest
duology, which includes "Six

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.900
of Crows," and "Crooked Kingdom"

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.210
which is probably why you
all are here today, right?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.900
How many of you have
read' finished the series?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.200
[Applause] Yeah?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.870
That's really exciting.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.120
Those of you who did not raise
your hands, you have homework.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.420
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
[Laughter] Get out.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.980
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
Okay, I think this is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.880
as much loitering as I can do.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.800
But, so if "Six of
Crows" is kind

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.220
of like your straight-up
heist, "Crooked Kingdom" is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.730
like a tangle of con jobs.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.490
How do you plot these
elaborate schemes?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.290
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh, wow, well
there's a reason it's a duology.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.260
Because cons and heists are
incredibly challenging to write.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.380
And what I usually start
with is with the twists.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.710
I start with where I know
I want the heist to end up.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.930
And I think it was Ally
Carter who wrote the wonderful

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.930
"Heist Society" books,
who told me,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.300
you're really conning
two people.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.690
There's the mark in the book,
and then there's the audience.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.350
So, I want you guys to have
experience of reading the heist,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.910
thinking you know where
it's going and then pulling

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.450
out the rug from under you.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.170
But, yeah, "Six of
Crows" is one big heist.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.740
It's really structured
like a classic heist film,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.540
or a classic heist story.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.230
And I thought of "Crooked
Kingdom" more as kind

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.920
of a [inaudible] of just
I wanted to get more

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.410
and more claustrophobic
as you moved through it.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.410
As the crew got more
and more trapped.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.440
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And you know,
within your multilayer cons.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.140
You also have six
points of view basically,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.030
that you're constantly
cycling through.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.490
How do you plan and plot
out all those characters

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.090
within your cons?

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.390
&gt;&gt;

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.120
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Well, I don't
want to give a false impression

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.170
that I map everything out.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.470
I map the plot.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.970
I have a basic understanding
of who the characters are

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.950
and the role they
occupy in the plot.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.880
And one thing I wanted
to know going into "Six

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.030
of Crows" was what was the real
fight for them in the heist?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.660
They each have a
task to accomplish,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.990
but which thing they were going
to have to face, which fear

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.780
or danger they were
going to have to face

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.530
for that character arc.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.000
But beyond that, I didn't
know what their backstories

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.300
were really.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.700
I discovered them as
I was writing them.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.430
And some of them spoke loud and
clear at the start of the book.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.960
And some of them, it really
took a while to get to know.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.440
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah,
and actually, you know,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.470
in Crooked Kingdom" a
character that we get to know,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.410
that I really appreciated
was Jesper.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.900
So, we really get to see
that character and see,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.890
and he really holds his
own against the others.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.890
Even though his backstory
is not as tragic.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.190
And so, the other characters.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.490
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I
think it's tragic.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.790
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: It's
tragic, you're right.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.090
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I was
like, I'm disappointed.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.400
I'm like, I thought
it was tragic.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.730
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
No, it's tragic,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.030
but it's not like, I don't know.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.330
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: He suffers.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.630
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
He didn't have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.930
to like ride his
dead brother's corpse

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.320
to freedom, yeah so I think.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.690
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: For example,
hypothetically [laughter].

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.680
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: So, yeah,
but can you tell me a little bit

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.220
about how you know
jesper came to grow

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.230
and really flourish
in "Crooked Kingdom?"

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.530
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Jesper really began

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.600
as a description,
as a sharpshooter.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.760
And then I remember the moment
when I was thinking about,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.240
you know, in part of my
research I went to a gun range

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.560
and you learn to shoot.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.560
And the idea of focusing,
and I wanted him

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.400
to have approached
this particular line

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.700
of work for a reason.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.130
And for him, it's a
kind of self-medication.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.250
Risk is a way for him to
focus his mind and to shut

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.750
down the noise in his head.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.320
And whether that manifests
as something like gambling

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.890
at Mockers Wheel, or
it manifests as getting

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.060
into really dangerous
situations,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.720
this is maybe not
the best way to go

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.810
about dealing with
your problems.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.440
Kids, don't do this.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.470
But this is something that
he's doing and something

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.250
that actually Inej confronts
him about in "Crooked Kingdom"

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.570
about understanding sort of what
your wound is and seeing it.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.150
And healing it.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.090
But I just love writing him.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.660
I loved writing his backstory.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.960
I love writing about
[inaudible].

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.850
And I loved writing
about his dad.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.490
I mean spoiler, if
you haven't read

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.260
"Crooked Kingdom"
his dad shows up.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.500
And one of my favorite
things in YA novels is

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.800
when you have these
kids who are like,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.650
yeah we're running heists
and we're in a gang.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.160
And all this stuff.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.130
And then, your dad shows
up and you're like umm.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.430
Everything's fine here.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.440
You know? So, for
me and I also wanted

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.360
to write a positive
parental figure.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.780
Because most of the parents
I write are kind of horrible.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.590
So, I wanted to write
a good parent, yeah.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.890
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
Well, and it's funny

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.790
because like the point of
most children's capers is

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.510
that they're generally
unsupervised the entire time.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.810
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I mean
that's why there are

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.320
so many orphans in fantasy.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.620
Like really?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.140
Well, if you're going to
go off to save the world,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.150
you probably don't
want to get grounded.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.450
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I'm
at that stage in my life,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.990
where I'm starting to relate
to the parents [laughter].

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.130
I'm like where are
their parents?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.430
What's going on.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.730
It's funny.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.560
But actually, so you
mentioned doing research,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.890
you went to actually shoot a gun

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.440
at a gun range I
didn't think about that.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.740
And one thing that
I was really struck

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.500
by by our conversation a while
back is all the research you put

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.550
into Inej's character and like
getting into her backstory,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.960
you told me that you
interviewed three victims

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.990
of human trafficking
and that kind of thing.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.610
You know, what?

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.910
And that's really great.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.210
Because you have
a younger audience

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.580
who maybe is not reading those
news stories on a daily basis

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.140
and they get to learn
about a different thing

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.440
through your work.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.380
And so, can you tell us a little
bit more about what drove you

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.850
to kind of explore that
theme in your fiction.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.420
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: When I set
out to write "Six of Crows,"

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.640
one of the things that was a
really an additional character

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.330
in the story is Ketterdam
and the county of Kerch.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.370
And I had known early on that
I wanted to write this country

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.680
as almost like an anti-Ravka.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.130
Ravka was the setting for my
first trilogy and is where most

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.100
of "King of Scars"
takes place too.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.460
And Ravka is kind
of cut off from, oh,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.760
I suddenly got very loud.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.770
Hello. She said as she looked

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.920
down at her brassiere
[laughter].

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.770
So, Ravka is this kind
of back world place

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.820
where there's been a
failure to industrialize.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.260
Whereas Ketterdam
is international,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.560
it's cosmopolitan.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.790
It's the hub of all legal and
illegal trade in the world.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.270
And I wanted the culture that
had grown up about it to be kind

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.190
of like an extreme version
of the Protestant work ethic.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.570
This is a place where profit
and prosperity is a sign

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.780
that you were ordained by God.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.060
And where they worship Gazan
and the invisible hand.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.430
Which anybody who's familiar
with Adam Smith will recognize.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.160
So, this is a place
where the market rules.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.640
And if you're doing that, then
you have to ask the question

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.710
if profit is seen as not only
a good goal, but a sacred goal.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.820
What is the human cost of that?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.050
And if you only see
humans as commodities,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.220
I think Inej's story is the
inevitable result of that.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.800
So, I wanted to show the
impact that it had for better

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.930
and for worse, on individual
members of this crew.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.230
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah, and so,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.450
Inej's clearly my actual
favorite character.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.750
Jesper's like second favorite.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.360
But it's Inej.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.140
But one think I like about
her and I like about Nina,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.690
is that they're dealing
with their trauma.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.590
They have these issues
that they're dealing with

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.230
and they also still
manage to keep it together,

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.530
wrangle the boys [laughter].

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.710
Get them to put their shoes
on and go do the heist.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.190
Like, can you tell me more
about how that dynamic worked

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.620
out between your characters
as you started writing.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.920
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: That's
really interesting.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.680
I don't really think of
either of them as being

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.280
like the mom of the group.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.590
Like I'm not sure this
group has a mom, you know?

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.210
Like, maybe.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.590
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: But
they're more insightful.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.830
They'll be like you clearly
have like ADD and you shouldn't.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.130
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Right.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.430
I think they are, but well look.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.740
This is a requirement
though, in order to survive,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.780
both of these women have
had to do certain things.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.550
And if they had let themselves
completely fall apart,

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.890
then they wouldn't be there.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.190
They wouldn't be surviving.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.030
And so, they made certain
choices and certain sacrifices

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.110
that have allowed
them to keep going.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.120
And with Inej, you see that rear
its head in different forms.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.640
There are different
battles she has

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.390
to fight before she can find
her way to really being free.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.760
Not just being free on
the streets of Ketterdam.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.730
And for Nina, it's a
journey that has a lot to do

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.760
with who she is as a
soldier and as a person.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.390
And that continues in "King
of Scars" because a lot

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.650
of people were very angry with
me about some of the things

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.140
that happened in
"Crooked Kingdom"

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.510
and I'm not sorry [laughter].

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.400
I'm just not.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.060
But that for me, was
something that I knew

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.340
that Nina's story didn't end
there, and I knew where I wanted

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.300
to take her, and you know there
were some casualties along

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.600
the way.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.610
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Oh,
I hate, I just got sad.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.910
I was like oh no.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.210
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I'm sorry,
but I'm not [laughter].

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.940
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Well, let's
bring it back to something fun.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.240
Because I am.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.540
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: What?

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.840
That wasn't fun?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.540
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: But I am a
30-year-old woman who reads YA

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.150
for the make-outs if I'm being
entirely honest with you.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.000
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Wow, my
books must suck for you.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.510
Because everybody's
like don't touch me.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.810
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Honestly,
that worked for me [laughter].

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.320
That worked for me.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.240
But you know, did you always
know what these feelings were

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.330
going to be, or did those
also kind of evolve naturally

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.630
with their backstories?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.930
Oh, you knew?

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.230
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Like, I knew.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.530
I love romance.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.830
And I love shipping.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.300
And I think that there's this
real tendency to look at romance

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.870
in stories and somehow try to
say that the story is lesser

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.750
because it focuses on romance.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.080
And it's something that I've
seen from a lot of adults,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.260
SF&amp;F crowds that really
distain YA and its focus

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.680
on emotionality and
relationships.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.470
And I find that hilarious,
because so many people spend

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.610
so much of their lives
looking for someone

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.280
to share that life with.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.840
And I mind Tinder wouldn't exist
if it weren't for this drive.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.440
And I don't think that
it makes a book lesser

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.740
or less interesting.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.530
Or, have less gravitas because
it addresses that emotionality.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.060
For me, the big thing is that I
don't want those relationships

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.150
to all only occupy
romantic space.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.660
Friendship is essential.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.090
The way these friendships
impacts these romantic

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.830
entanglements matter.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.040
And also, the sense of finding
your family is just as essential

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.060
to me as the romantic
elements of the book.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.940
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah, and
I think you know one thing

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.990
that I really like is because
you have two characters

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.290
who like cannot touch
each other really.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.790
Every single possible
like brush,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.530
has the elevation
of like a kiss now.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.830
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I
do love a slow burn.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.240
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah,
you gave me a whole book

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.310
of like almost kisses,
it's just as good.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.610
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Yeah.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.120
I mean that's what FanFick
is for, like go for it.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.350
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Do you have
any pairings that did not exist

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.510
in the book, that you
like quietly thought of.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.810
That you were like,
maybe I'll pair.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.110
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Oh, interesting.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.410
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.710
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: No.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.800
like if I want a ship to
exist, I'll just write it.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.470
You know, that's the magic
of canon, I can be like,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.360
no this will come to pass.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.660
No, I do feel like I had
a million cracked ships

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.370
in "Shadow and Bone."

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.820
Like, I honestly, I'm
one of those people

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.320
who ships everyone
with everything.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.350
I don't know if any of
you have ever watched

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.720
"Avatar The Last Airbender."

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.630
I'm one of those weirdos who
vote ship Kataang the Zutara.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.640
Okay, like I was
like I ship it all.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.180
I ship chair with stage.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.180
I ship lamp with table.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.980
Like, I'm just like, I
really think it's fun

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.690
to think that way.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.900
And when I was writing "Wonder
Woman: Warbringer" I was

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.900
like I want everybody to
be attracted to each other

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.600
at all times [laughter].

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.090
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I think
you've captured the essence

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.390
of youth.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.270
That's just I mean it's
constant attraction.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.480
But you brought up the
Alina Starkov books

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.160
and "Crooked Kingdom" is set in
the same world as those books.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.240
But obviously is a
very different book.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.520
In what ways do you see
the newer series as almost

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.350
like a response to what you've
already explored in Ravka?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.270
You talked a little
bit about the settings.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.710
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Well,
I think that "Shadow

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.840
and Bone" is a very
traditional hero's journey.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.550
It's a chosen one's story.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.880
And I think if you read
"Six of Crows" you can see,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.180
there's even a character

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.110
who addresses the chosen one
explicitly in "Crooked Kingdom."

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.770
And I really wanted to ask
the question, what happens

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.860
in fantasy worlds to the people
who don't have grand destinies

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.720
and who don't have
secret powers,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.570
who weren't secret princesses.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.420
Who are essentially
expendable to the larger plot.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.730
What becomes of them?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.390
And who really have
nothing to rely on

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.690
but their skills and each other.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.080
And so, for me "Six of Crows"
was almost a direct response

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.160
to my experience writing
"Shadow and Bone."

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.460
And I want to say, too.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.060
Like, as much as
I ship everything,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.400
like that's not what all
books have to be about, like,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.120
I am one of those people who
will watch a television show

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.060
and be like, where's
the romance?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.570
Like, great British bacon show,
I'm like okay, but [laughter].

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.870
Will they, won't they?

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.640
But that said, I don't write,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.780
like I've actually gotten
complaints from readers

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.080
who are like where's my smut?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.140
And I'm like I don't write that.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.420
Like, I don't know how to;
I don't know how to do that.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.010
Like, I'm not that
kind of writer.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.010
You know, like again,
praise the FanFick writers,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.310
but I can't do it.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.150
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I mean if
you do want to write a FanFick

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.340
of your own, you have
an audience [laughter].

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:11.740
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I mean, if I
ever go broke, I'm just going

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.490
to be like darkling
after dark [laughter].

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.040
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: But,
you know you [laughter].

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.340
I'm sorry.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.010
You've been really prolificate
these last couple years,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.540
I'm wondering, you know what are
things that you've tried to work

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.160
on and improve from book to
book, if there are things

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.050
that you're like I know I can do
that better in the next one, or?

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.890
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I mean
the glaring thing I think

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.190
is diversity.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.530
It's honestly a little
embarrassing to look back

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.620
at the way that I
cast "Shadow and Bone"

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.870
because it is an overwhelming
white and straight series.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.110
And it becomes less
so as it progresses.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.850
But I think the question I found
myself asking is why did I write

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.150
it that way?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.450
I grew up in Los Angeles,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.040
this is not what my peer
group looks like at all.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.500
And I think I was echoing
a lot of the fantasy

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.970
that I read growing up.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.430
So, I've tried to move
towards a cast of characters

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.870
that looks more like
the people I know.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.940
And that is more representative.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.490
I think also, just I think
I became a better writer.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.780
I think writing short stories
made me a better writer.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.460
I think, are there any
aspiring writers in the?

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:24.360
Wahoo. There's a
storm coming, no.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.340
What I would say is you
know short fiction is

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.640
incredibly challenging.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.570
It forces you to really dig
into your craft in a way

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.850
that I think has
really helped me.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.010
So, the act of writing short
stories as I was writing novels,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.880
I think changed the way that
I engage with language too.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.860
So, I don't know I'm in sort of
a constant state of revision.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.570
I'm a profound believer
in revision.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.380
My drafts tend to be
absolute garbage early on.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.680
and it's very uncomfortable.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.090
Like I say that very lively.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.500
But it's an incredibly
difficult state to live

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.470
in when you know
what good writing is

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.470
and you know what
you're doing is not good.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.170
But I think that discomfort of
the first draft is unavoidable,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.200
and I think it's something
that if we were taught to live

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.500
with that discomfort, people
would understand the process

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.950
of writing much better
and they would get

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.250
through it more easily.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.480
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And,
the other, you know,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.460
sorry you brought up
diversity, and you know,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.900
I'm sure you're all aware that's
an issue that's been coming

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.340
up a lot more, people are
a lot more vocal about it.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.640
You know what kind

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.270
of conversations have you been
having with your peer group

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.190
of writers about how to
talk about the problem,

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.300
how to elevate other writers?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.110
You know, what's that
look like right now

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.850
within like your
cohort of people?

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.480
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: As a white
writer, I think the focus has

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.420
to be on elevating other voices.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.920
So, that if you have the
opportunity to do an event

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.980
with a writer who's maybe not
getting as much attention,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.160
but who has written a
fantastic fantasy that is set

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.550
in a different kind of world
than what we are used to seeing.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.780
If you have the opportunity,
when you do book lists,

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.900
of you know what are your
fav this, or fav that?

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.150
That is your chief obligation.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.830
And also, and this is something

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.410
that I think everybody is
always trying to work on.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.830
To know the difference between
trying to write representatively

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.260
as opposed to taking
somebody else's story.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.120
And I don't think that
there's a perfect answer

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.420
to that, or a balance.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.720
Everybody's always learning.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.150
And the best advice I can give
to people who are attempting

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.800
to do that and the
thing that we talk

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.590
about most is just
listening to each other.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.500
Like, make more friends.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.330
Like, and I know that's hard
because writers are weirdos

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.770
and we like to stay home, and
we don't really need friends,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.200
other than fictional characters.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.910
But having friends who do not
come from your background,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.340
who you grew up with,
or who you encounter

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.290
through critique groups,
or whatever it is,

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.170
like make those friends and
engage those relationships.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.220
Follow those artists on Twitter,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.740
and read their books,
read their blogs.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.380
That is the best way to sort
of fulfill that obligation

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:05.650
and to try to engage with other
people without bothering them.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.050
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And, I wanted
to ask, you know going back

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.450
to the books, what scenes
were your favorites to write,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.420
that you just go
really excited about?

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.560
Without, I mean most of you
have already read the books,

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.860
I guess you can spoiler, but.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.160
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
In "Six of Crows"

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.810
like my favorite scenes, or?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.110
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
Yeah, that series.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.000
Or, "Crooked Kingdom."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.030
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I
think that, oh man.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.330
I don't know.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.080
So, there's a fight, there's
a fish fight between Kaz

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.560
and Jesper in "Crooked Kingdom."

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.510
And I love that scene,
because there's a little,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.980
because the audience knows,

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.380
the reader knows how much
emotion is wrapped up in it.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.050
But it's also just two guys who
really don't know how to talk

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.200
to each other and are like ugh.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.320
And I loved writing that.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.590
And I also loved writing
Colm Fahey just being like,

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.890
you just stop.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.600
You just stop it.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.900
I loved writing that.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.450
I will say that the most
challenging scene to write was,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.100
there's a scene between
Kaz and Inej,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.690
that is where he's
tending to her bandages.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.990
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
That's my favorite scene.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.290
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I'm
glad you liked it.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.460
But there are probably
32 different versions

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.760
of that scene.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.060
It was one of the most
challenging scenes I've

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.360
ever written.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.660
And I'm proud of it.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.390
Like I'm proud of
where it ended up.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.690
But there were moments where
I thought I don't know how

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.990
to get this right.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.620
And you know I didn't
want to not do justice

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.000
to for those characters
in what they've been

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.350
through int hat scene.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.080
With "King of Scars" I
was kind of surprised

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.930
because Zoya's chapters turned
out to be the most fun to write.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.230
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Really?

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.350
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: No, Zoya's
mean and I love writing her.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.280
She's so unapologetic.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.030
And I loved discovering her and
her history, and writing her.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.590
She was really, I love her
journey in "King of Scars."

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.650
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And so,
besides Zoya and I assume also

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.750
who else is going to be?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.150
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Nikolai
has his own POV obviously.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.390
It would be hilarious
if he didn't.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.090
If he was just like, I'm
going to sit this one out.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.010
There are three primary POVs.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.640
You guys know I like to throw

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.000
in an occasional red shirt
who's going to get murdered.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.860
But, there's Zoya,
Nikolai and Nina from "Six

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.660
of Crows" has a POV too.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.900
She is in Fierda, basically
on an undercover mission.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.440
And also, I don't want to spoil
"Crooked Kingdom" for anybody

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.390
who hasn't; but she has another
mission, a personal mission

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.870
to accomplish there as well.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.170
Yeah.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.100
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And
nothing else you can tell us

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.350
about the book [laughter].

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.040
I'm working for you guys.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.340
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I would say

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.270
that it probably has the
most magic on the page

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.570
that I've ever written,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.720
the Grisha magical system is
fairly tightly constrained.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.760
Right? And this is a story where
you really find out the roots

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.130
of Grisha power and where
there's a lot of blurring

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.000
of the line between
myth, and religion,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.300
and science, and superstition.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.940
And it was really
exciting for me to write.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.350
Like all I will ask is if you
guys do read it when it comes

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.720
out and I hope you will, please
don't spoil it for other people.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.020
Because there are some sort

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.940
of ginormous twists
in it, so, yeah.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.240
Fingers crossed.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.540
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.680
And so, you know I'm glad
you're sticking with fantasy.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.060
You know what is it about
fantasy that you enjoy?

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:27.290
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: You know,
it's so rare that I don't seek

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.270
out something with a
fantastical element.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.670
I love genre, I grew up
on genre, it was the thing

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.230
that really saved me from the
absolute mundanity of my world.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.990
I hated school.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.910
No offense to school
but I was miserable.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.360
I was in this weird
all-girls private school.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.030
And they were just like
strange goth girl what are you

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.330
doing here?

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.210
But it was not; it was the
90s it was a terrible time.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.160
But I was utterly
miserable there.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.950
I was having a really
rough time at home.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.370
My mom had just remarried.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.300
Like, that was when
I discovered genre

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.870
and writing fantasy really
was like a survival mechanism.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.120
And I think, I don't know I
think fantasy readers have an

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.420
edge on everyone.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.710
Like, we never stop
believing in weird,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.600
magical, incredible stuff.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.780
You know for us the call box
is always bigger on the inside.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.530
We are always waiting for
the invitation to Hogwarts.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.750
We always think there's
something lurking in the woods.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.350
And it's the best way to live.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.110
And I would not want to
live any way else, you know.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.050
So, yeah, fantasy or die.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.990
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
I know, although.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.290
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Everybody's like yes.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.590
Weirdness [applause].

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.890
Don't encourage me.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.530
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: No, but
it's funny because I feel

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.190
like so much fantasy is
centered around youth,

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.250
and like who's going to write
the magical anime for us?

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:51.300
Like, woman turns 30 had
certain cellulite ratio.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.450
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
I really wanted,

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.520
I pitched a screenplay
at one point.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.630
It was about a chosen one
who was in her thirties.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.950
And like the dark immortal shows

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.140
up to find the chosen
one, and he's like what?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.070
Like [laughter],
because it's so creepy

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.520
that the dark immortal
one is always like, uh,

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.910
teenage girl, excellent.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:15.220
You know, like I just wanted,
I was imagining like Tina Faye

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.440
or like you know just
being like, what?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.310
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I know it's
like teens don't have like jobs

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.610
that they have to go to.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.910
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I mean
it's easier to save the world

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.410
when you don't have to
worry about like benefits,

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.110
or you know, like, but I
will say too, like I do think

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.280
that those stories
retain resonance for us.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.550
And I just don't; I don't think
the idea of the magical journey,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:40.630
or of these secrete spaces
ever lose their excitement

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.380
as we get older.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.680
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah,
and you know one thing

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.510
that I'm very impressive
by you, just in general.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.990
But you've had a lot of
jobs that are not writing.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.600
And you know, you've been a make
up artist, you're in a band.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.920
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I mean
it's not a good band.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.220
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Are
you still in a band?

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.520
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Yeah,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.300
we actually just recorded
two songs, if you follow me

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.600
on the Instagram,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.530
like I actually posted
a couple of clips.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.140
And we'll see how
the songs turn out.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.840
If I actually am
not too embarrassed

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.140
by them, I'll post them.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.690
I think it's a good
idea to keep your toe

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.150
into other creative things.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.610
I think it's good to
rest the writing muscle

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.360
and engage the creative
muscle elsewhere.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.190
I also think you know, I think
it's good to have a lot of jobs.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.350
And to have had to hustle.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.950
Because writing is hard.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.250
It's a hard business.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.300
And I think people sometimes
forget it's a business.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.130
And that can be really difficult
to balance the creative

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.590
and this other side of it.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.170
But yeah, I don't trust people
who have never had a bad job.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.470
I really don't.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.770
I don't trust somebody
who's never had a bad job

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.070
or a bad boss.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.920
I'm like what do you
know about anything,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.600
if you have never had a Sunday
night when you've been like;

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.900
and it's the same as school.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.850
Like I used to feel this
way, I would just be

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.330
like oh, Monday is upon me.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.680
You know, like I
remember that dread.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.930
And I think it's
made me grateful

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.870
for so much that's
happened sense.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.650
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: And so, I
forgot my line of questioning,

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.410
I'm going to turn to my phone.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.710
I'm sorry guys [laughter].

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.010
I don't do this very often.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.470
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: It's
okay, I just overwhelmed you

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.580
with my wisdom [laughter].

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.180
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I know,
you're so much wiser.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.130
So, tell us what
you have beyond.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.070
So, "King of Scars" is
coming out next year in 2019.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.880
And you have an adult fiction
book coming out after that.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.410
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Yeah, my first novel

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.050
for adults I guess is
called "Ninth House"

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.990
and it is also fantasy, but
it is set at Yale University.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.800
It is a cult murder
mystery set among the secret

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.350
societies there.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.970
And it's definitely a bit
different from what I've done.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.630
But I think that people,
especially people who liked "Six

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.580
of Crows" and "Crooked Kingdom"
will find the same elements

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.730
of dark magic and
power operating there.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.460
But that is set for
September of next year.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.250
Yeah, assuming I finish it
so keep your fingers crossed.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.650
And "King of Scars
comes out in January.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.160
"King of Scars" is a duology.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.320
So, those are the two big
things on the horizon for me.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.360
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Okay, and
can you tell us a little bit

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.410
about you know what's
inspiring you these days

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.720
as far as your writing goes.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.200
Like what are you reading,
what are you listening to?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.500
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh gosh.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.430
I mean I have listened to the
same album, music composer

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.880
to draft all of my books in
"Six of Crows" and it was,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.650
his name Luadbi Ganaldi
[assumed spelling]

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.580
and he's an Italian composer.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.870
And I know it's not
like hip or cool,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.230
I don't know what
the youth listens to.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:45.470
but I love his music and
for whatever reason it trips

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.270
something in my brain and really
allows me to go into this kind

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.510
of deep, productive
mode that I love.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.370
Also, you know forever
Stevie Nicks, like I listen

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.820
to Fleetwood Mac on a regular.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.710
And that's to me.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.920
And also, I'll say Janel
Monet's last album was for me,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:07.810
like the most joy bringing, like
angry making, wonderful thing

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.970
to listen to when I need like
to break and like refresh.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.900
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Yeah,
and how am I doing on time?

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.200
And I good?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.500
Okay. Sorry.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.800
So, I kind of want to go back.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.710
I just want to keep talking
about Jesper [laughter].

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.730
I have a crush on him.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.230
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I'm so glad.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.140
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: He has the
same last name as my husband.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.000
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: No
way, you're a Fahey?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.300
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: I
guess, technically yeah.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.600
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh my gosh.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.360
Well, he was named after
my friend Morgan Fahey.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.660
So, there you go.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.520
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: We're all
related actually unbeknownst

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.820
to you.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.280
No, but you know when coming up
with that character, you know,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.580
can you tell me a
little bit more

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.980
about when you were
designing his relationship

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.280
with his father?

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.650
I think it's interesting,
he's biracial.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.420
His father does not
necessarily look like him.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.720
And you kind of intermate
you know,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.020
the way that that
role was made up.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.780
Can you tell me a little bit
about what went into that,

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.710
what kind of research you did?

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.010
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
I mean, I again,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.830
my peer group is largely
made up of biracial couples.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.880
And for me, they're
the first people I come

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.400
to even though they are not
writers per se, if I'm going

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.690
to be addressing the experience
of a character of color.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.070
And, when I was creating
[inaudible] there were a lot

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.760
of questions for me and I
think that there are things

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.980
that I could have done
better, or done differently

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.890
in the construction of
that world, but for me,

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:34.540
I wanted to create a nation
that was people of color

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.860
who had the most
advanced technology,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.510
and who had pushed back any
kind of colonial impulse,

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.790
and that had this
thriving culture.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.700
And where they approach
Grisha power

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.520
as something very
different than Ravka does.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.250
And where Jesper's mother
really would not have wanted him

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.110
to go fight for Ravka,
just because he happened

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.760
to have been born
with this gift.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.400
So, they have a very
different relationship

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.500
to magic, than the Ravkans do.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.900
It's not militarized
in the same way.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.710
And there's actually a character
in "King of Scars," Lani

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:10.190
and that's all I'm going
to say about her right now.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.370
She's from Noviazem
[assumed spelling] and some

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.630
of you may recognize her
from "Crooked Kingdom" too.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.920
She was a minor character in it.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.220
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: All right.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.890
So, I think we're at
the time for questions.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.700
And I'm sure you guys
have lots of them.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.160
So, why don't' you guys
come up to the microphone

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.910
and start lobbing
questions her way.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.210
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Hello.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hi.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.810
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: She's
dressed as Laura Jean

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.160
and she looks amazing.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thank you so much.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.590
So, if you could like drop
another character or a bunch

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.750
of characters from another YA
series into the grishaverse,

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.370
who would you drop in?

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.760
Personally I would suggest Lia
Sara [assumed spelling] meets

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.540
Inej and they just have teeth.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.840
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Wait, who was the?

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Lia and Inej.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.170
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh,
I like that idea a lot.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.870
Oh wow. That's really hard.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.880
I'm always afraid of dropping
characters in my world,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.770
because I'm pretty sure
they'll get murdered [laughter].

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.060
You know, I'm a huge
Laney Taylor fan.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.360
You know what I would do,

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.380
I would grab Brimstone,
and I would save him.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.680
Yeah, I would save him, and
I would put him in a palace

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.140
in Ravka because he's one of my
favorite characters of all time.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.330
Yeah, oh and I'd grab Howl
from "Howl's Moving Castle."

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.960
And I would just have him

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.100
in Ketterdam living the
life, like [laughter].

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thank you.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.490
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Yeah.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hi, I
have a writing question.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.960
So, I was just wondering do
you have any advice for writers

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.380
who are like at the
so close stage.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.120
Like polishing up their
manuscript, about to query,

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.180
editing and all that and
just kind of so close.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.480
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I
mean I assume you have

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.780
critique partners.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
betas, critique partners,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.120
editors, lots of queries.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.760
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Okay, I mean
look, querying is terrible.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.440
It's a horrible,
frightening experience.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.360
Querying is when you write
a letter, or an email,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.780
and you go out to agents hoping
that someone will represent you.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.940
My best advice for querying is

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.160
to treat your query letter
the same way you treat your

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.010
manuscript, your critique
partner should be reading

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.310
that too.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.610
And you should have people

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.590
who have never read your book
read the query to make sure

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.150
that your pitch makes sense.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.450
Keep it short.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.250
Be really careful in your
querying, like really know

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.750
who you're going after and
query in small batches,

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.200
so that if you're not
getting the response you want,

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.080
you can tweak your approach.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.480
Because it may not be that
your book isn't interesting

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.830
or isn't right for the
market, it may just be

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.770
that you're coming
in the wrong way.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.190
My agent, I never let her
forget this, she literally said,

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.920
she's like well the
letter wasn't very good,

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.310
but lucky for you
the pages were.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.430
You know? So, but it's very hard
to get your foot int hat door.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.470
And I would say too if you're
going out on query and then

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.330
if you happen to get represented
and go on submissions,

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.730
if you don't get the
response you want right away,

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.030
do not give up.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.230
Okay? The market is fickle.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.930
Publishing is difficult.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.860
And people get shutdown.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.010
All it means is you may
have to put that book away

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.400
for a little while, be working

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.860
on something else
while you're querying.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.440
Because it is not
the be all, end all.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.760
And if you sell that next book,
the first thing they're going

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.060
to say is what else do you have?

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.670
And you'll be like, oh, hello.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.970
Look what I have for you.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:18.880
But don't let it make you
think it has something to do

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.650
with your talent or the
quality of your work.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.950
It is a market.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.250
It is a business.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Hi.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.150
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Hello.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So,
clearly in your work,

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.440
you've extensively researched
like real history and cultures

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.850
and countries to influence
your world building.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.980
But how do you draw the line
between like real history,

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.370
and how do you decide when
to shift things and when

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.120
to keep things the same
as they are in reality?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.450
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Look, I can't
pretend to be an expert on that.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.340
I've taken a lot of heat
for some of the choices

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.820
that I've made in
terms of language

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.340
and culture and history.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.540
I create historical inspiration
as a point of departure.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.560
The thing I would say is what
makes a fantasy feel real is

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.130
to me, that grounding.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.040
So, if you're going to
write about dictatorships,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.440
you should read about
dictatorships.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.790
If you're going to
write about farming,

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.090
you should read about farming.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.020
I hate nautical research,
I will never write a book

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.240
on a boat again, because "Seize
and Storm" is set on a boat,

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.140
and I was like if I have to read
the word mizzen mast again I am

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.300
going to lose my mind.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.110
But, these are the things we;
and the thing about research is

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.040
that you'd know what
you're going to call,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.620
and so you really have to use
the kind of soft focus view,

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.110
and to really always be seeking
inspiration, and to try to fall

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.270
in love with history as much
as mining it for information.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.790
But, I don't know if that
actually answered your question,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.090
but that's my best shot.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thank you.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi,
so I had a question.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.700
I know you mentioned that
your first drafts are

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.000
normally garbage.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.300
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: They are.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And
I really wanted

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.810
to know how they compare
to the final copy.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:52.080
Because it is hard like to stop
comparing your work to others.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.380
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I know.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.680
I know.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And I
wanted to like really know

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.030
like the details, like.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.330
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
So, let's first,

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.070
so what I write is what
I call the zero draft.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.510
This is a draft that
nobody will ever see.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.350
Not my editor, not
my friends, anyone.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.600
This is where I'm
telling myself this story.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.920
And it's full of placeholders.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.220
And it's quite short.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.700
It's almost like an
elaborate outline.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.960
The first zero draft of "Six

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.660
of Crows" was 30,000
words long, okay.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.010
The final draft of "Six of
Crows" is 130,000 words long.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.710
Okay? So, but I still
have a whole book,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.680
so I can see the beginning,
and middle, and end.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.180
I can see where there
might be pacing problems.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.250
And I know what some of the
questions are when I come

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.190
out of it, before I
get too deeply in it.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.690
Then, the first draft is
still, pretty terrible.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.990
It really is.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:40.000
That's not where I'm; I think it
was my friend Jess Brodie said,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.160
you know you can't decorate
the house before the walls

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.460
are built.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.760
So, that's what you're doing.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.060
You're telling yourself
the story.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.920
And you need to give yourself
permission to be as obvious

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.000
and ridiculous as
you need to be.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.530
And you need to give yourself
permission to have moments

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.720
where you feel like a hack,
or you feel like a fraud

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.270
and you just keep
moving through the story.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.970
I always describe writing a book
as not the process of falling

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.750
in love, but of staying in love.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.010
You fall in love with
idea, but there's a moment

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.310
where you're going
to fall out of love.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.660
And that moment can
last a very long time.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.760
For me, I loved the
idea for "Six of Crows"

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.190
but through drafts
one, and two and three,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.890
I kept thinking wow this
is a great idea for a book,

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.760
and somebody else
should write it.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.060
Somebody smarter.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.520
You know? Like, I thought
I was not up to the task.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.420
And I did not fall back
in love until I was really

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.330
at the last pass before copy
edits, and I thought, okay,

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.950
this is actually working.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.310
So, you're not alone.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:36.660
You just have to keep going.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, thank you.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.260
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Yeah.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All right, hi.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.340
I just want to say, I'm
just a big fan of your work.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.090
I've been reading it
ever since it came out.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.610
And something I thought
was interesting is

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.980
that you are coming out with
an adult fantasy series.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.000
And I think, like
fantasy is becoming more

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.410
and more popular among YA books.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.950
And I kind of want to know
like what's the difference

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.740
between like a YA
fantasy and adult fantasy.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.610
Like, how does that make
it like a different story

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.910
and affect the characters?

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.210
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: You know,
that's a great question.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.910
And I found myself
asking it too.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.100
Because people kept saying,
well what makes this different

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.620
from your other books.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.550
The closest I can get to
telling you is that part

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.590
of it was just a gut thing.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.480
I knew that Alex's story
did not belong in YA.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.140
And I can't give you like a
concrete reasons for that.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.580
But the closest I can get is
to say that YA tends to deal

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.430
with a specific moment in time,
particularly fantasy, right?

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:35.240
You're leading up to a heist,
or a revolution, or a prom,

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.350
or whatever it's going
to be that is kind

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.340
of this one clear moment.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.160
Whereas I think that
in my adult fiction,

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.700
it's really about the long game.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.710
Because this is a
girl who has come

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.490
from tremendous disadvantage and
who really just wants to survive

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.790
in a world full of people

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.390
who have a lot more
privilege than she does.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.920
So, I think that that for me
is maybe the dividing line,

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.530
but it's definitely
a blurry one.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.900
And you can see there's a
tremendous amount of crossover

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.000
and readership between
adults and YA fantasy.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All
right, thank you so much.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.360
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
You're so welcome.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Hi.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.960
So, I'm a huge fan
of "Six of Crows"

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.730
and as a writer I've been
always really impressed

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.280
by like how intricate
the plot was of that

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.850
and "Crooked Kingdom" like
just how many good plot twists

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.150
there are.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:26.060
So, I guess my question is like,
what is your thought process

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.770
when you go about coming up
with Kaz's plans and his heists?

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.600
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: So, again,
there's a reason it's a duology.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.090
Here's the thing about plotting.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.160
I plot, I use the
screenplay method,

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.290
the three-act structure to plot.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.730
And what that helps me do,
is it helps me see things

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.480
like where the midpoint
turnaround is.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.280
Where the end of the first act
is, and it's very useful to me

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.980
in terms of pacing
and understanding

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.330
where I need a big
moment in the story.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.440
When it comes to the complexity
of the plot, what I am trying

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.670
to do is throw up as
many obstacles as I can.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.670
And I don't want them
all to be the same.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.750
I want to really, like
one of my favorite,

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.050
one of the things I learned

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.630
from reading George RR
Martin was kill everyone.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.040
No, [laughter] but
it actually wasn't.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.590
People are always like
who are you going to kill.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.580
And I'm like who I
kill isn't important.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.550
What matters is if
you take a character

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.820
and what is most
important to them,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.470
and what they think defines
them, and then you take it away.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.770
And that's what makes
a plot interesting.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.370
Not how many twists
and turns there are.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.670
Those you will get to.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.020
But in that first draft
when you're figuring it out,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.320
really be thinking

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.960
about character I think
more than anything else.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay, thank you.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Hi.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.680
I really love the world
building in the "Six

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.690
of Crows" books particularly.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.090
So, something I was wondering is
you were talking about research,

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.700
but what is your process like
in terms of how much you know

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.240
about the world as
you're writing.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.990
Like do you feel like you
really know it early on,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.290
or is it something that comes

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.100
through later in
other revisions?

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.930
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I know
some things going in,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.620
but I don't know
everything going in.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.260
I tend to break world
builders into two categories.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.200
There are the Tolkien's
and there are the Martin's.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.590
And that is not to say that
you have to be an old white guy

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.320
to write fantasy, you don't.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.640
But those are you know
these are worlds that a lot

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.940
of people are familiar with.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.530
And Tolkien knew everything
before he sat down to write.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.520
He had built these
languages and these histories.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.190
And Martin didn't.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.580
You know when people ask him,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.270
you know where's the
rest of the Dothraki?

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.140
Before the television
show, it didn't exist.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.010
He wrote what he
needed for the page.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.450
You can be either.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.200
All right, there's no
right way to build a world.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.050
You just have to be careful
of the parallels within them.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.990
I tend to know the
structure of the world

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.770
and the way power operates
in it; magical, political,

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.770
personal when I'm going in.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.480
And sometimes I know
a little bit more

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.200
about why the world
operates in this way.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.140
But it's really not until the
later drafts when the texture

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.180
of a place, the smell
of a place,

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.430
the way its economics work
really come into play.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.590
And I think a story really
only begins to walk and talk

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.650
when those two things,
sense of power and sense

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.950
of place start to work together.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Thank you.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.110
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: You bet.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Hi, I really
absolutely love the characters

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.470
in "Six of Crows" and "Crooked
Kingdom" I love them a lot.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.630
So, who is your favorite
of all of the characters

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:23.350
in that duology and what's
your inspiration for them?

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.310
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: I don't
really, I mean look.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.480
I don't have a favorite.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.850
Like, they have all
been favorites of mine

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.340
at certain moments, and
I've wanted to murder all

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.920
of them at certain times.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.920
It's just the reality of
writing a character's journey.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.370
I think that some characters
were more natural for me

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.180
to write, like Kaz and Nina.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.330
And I think some were
harder to write; well, no.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.400
Nina was tough actually.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.500
Nina was tough until I
really got to know her.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.360
But I think that in
terms of inspiration,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.800
there's no particular
person, or actor,

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.240
or character who inspired them.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.540
They really came to life.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.980
I will say that some
of the fanart I've seen

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.200
of them has actually changed the
way I imagine them in my head.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.340
And I didn't set out to do that.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.890
But you know Kevin Wada tells
you what Jesper looks like,

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.400
and you're like okay [laughter].

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.700
Right?

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.000
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: So, good.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.300
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: So good, yeah.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Thank you.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.900
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: You bet.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Hi, so, obviously
places in "Six of Crows"

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.100
and the grishaverse trilogy,
a lot of them are inspired

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.150
by real life places
and cultures.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.580
So, I was wondering if you had
like a specific maybe place

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.220
or culture in mind that you kind
of wanted to write about next

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.410
or may be incorporate and
give some like recognition to?

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.600
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: That's
really interesting.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.290
I feel like whenever I
travel, and I haven't been able

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.090
to travel a lot in the
last couple of years

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.210
because of issues
related to my disability.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.410
But, I think that when I travel,

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.090
I find myself looking
for influence.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.970
I think you know, I think
there's already a little bit

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.660
of Venice in Ketterdam, but it's
my favorite city in the world,

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.080
and I wouldn't mind writing,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.840
but I feel like Jay
Kristoff already got there,

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.310
but maybe I'll write my own
Venetian inspired fantasy

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.610
some day.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:16.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Thank you.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.210
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: You bet.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Hi.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:20.810
So, maybe you already
answered this.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.720
I know you talked about revision
earlier in the interview.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.020
So, I was just going to ask
any sort of tips you have

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.140
for revision, or maybe what some
of your like, prominent stages

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.290
and steps are in your
revision process.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.980
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo:
Revision for me is, again,

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.740
in the first couple of drafts

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.640
to really let yourself
off the hook.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.310
You are really trying to find
your own way into the story.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.700
Then, as I get deeper I really
rely on the editorial process.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.290
You have to have good readers
who you trust and who are going

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.910
to be able to divorce their
own likes and preferences

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.180
from the way that they
give you critique.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.360
So, find good critique
partners and then listen

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.080
to them with an open mind.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.410
As authors we are asked to
walk a line between delusions

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.230
of grandeur and abject humility.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.700
And that is a hard thing to do.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.130
And you'll find yourself
flopping either way.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.370
There are days, where
you're like, I'm a genius,

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.530
and then there's day where
you're like I am nothing.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.440
So, you have to;
that is the challenge

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.740
of being a creative person.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.870
I think we can do one more
question and I'm sorry.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: Hi.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.540
So, I'm taking a
class this semester

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.460
where we apply legal theory
to sci-fi and fantasy.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.280
So, I'm wondering
how you constructed.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.320
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: We can take
no more questions [laugther].

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.910
Sorry.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: So, I'm wondering
how you constructed the

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.480
legal/political system
in your books.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.780
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh, for me,

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.040
those inspirations really
did come from history.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.780
There's a strong resemblance to
Imperial Russia, particularly

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.280
of the 1800s in Ravka.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.860
The Dutch Republic of the
1700s was a huge influence

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.300
on Ketterdam, particularly
in the way

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.060
that they operated
their shipping.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.280
But there are also elements of
those places that have to do

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.650
with Las Vegas, and early
New York/New Amsterdam.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.470
But I really go to
existing systems

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.960
to guide me in those things.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.970
That was hard.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.270
Hard question.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.760
I need more about like who's
your favorite character

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.700
and what cappuccino
do they drink, no.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: Thank you.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.300
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason:
Well, I think,

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.600
we can take one more, probably.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.900
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Oh.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.200
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Just one
more, can we take one more.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.500
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: All right.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: Hi, Ms. Bardugo.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.100
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: Hi.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: This might seem
like a kind of weird question,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.480
but Kaz like is one of my
favorites and he makes some

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.640
at least questionable
like decisions,

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.830
like during the books,
and like before the books.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.920
And I'm just wondering how
did you make him so likable.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.220
Because like I love
Kaz [laugther].

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.270
And like he just like
murders people like, oh, yeah.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.000
Here. He put this rod into his
eye and pushed him off a boat,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.230
so like how did you do that?

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.530
&gt;&gt; Leigh Bardugo: All right.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.830
All right.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.130
How did I like Kaz likeable?

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.430
Some people don't like Kaz.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.730
And when I wrote [laughter].

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:01.580
Get out. No, so some people
don't like Kaz and you have

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.350
to be comfortable when you
are writing a morally great

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.440
character with not
everybody liking that person.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.980
I think likeability is boring.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.270
I think what's interesting
is competence.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.500
What's interesting is reality
and feeling like you're engaged

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.800
in that person's struggle.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.840
And I like when people
question why they like

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.190
or don't like a character.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:24.030
Well, let's be honest,
YA loves evil white boys.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.330
You all love it.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.890
You give a character
dark hair and an agenda,

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.460
and all of the sudden,
people are like,

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.120
I know he murdered 50 people,

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.060
but love my small
cinnamon roll [laughter].

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.510
Like, you know so
this is the thing.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.420
But I love anti-heroes and I
think I'll always write them

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.240
because I think they bear
a greater resemblance

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.800
to who we really are.
