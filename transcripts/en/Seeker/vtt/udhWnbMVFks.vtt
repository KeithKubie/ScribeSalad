00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.270
Pope Francis is visiting the US and people
are excited, but what if science is your religion?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.480
How should YOU feel about Papa Francis?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.230
In the 1950s, Pope Pius the Twelfth wrote
that he hoped evolution would "prove to be

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.630
a passing fad," BUT that it doesn't contradict
faith as long as "ensouling" of humans was

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.800
left to God.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.119
Pope John Paul the second said in a 1982 book,
that evolution was an "effectively proven

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.119
fact."

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.180
AND More recently, Pope Francis said God isn't
a magician, and creation lasted millions of

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.160
years while the evolutionary processes played
out.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.210
And yet, a 2014 Gallup poll found 42 percent
of the American people believe the world was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.370
magically created in 7 days, and that we hold
dominion to destroy it as we wish…

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420
This kind of makes you wonder what religious
leaders are really teach us about science…

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.260
The Catholic church has long been party to
the scientific community.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.780
In the mid-1700s, Pope Benedict the Fourteenth
formed academies of science, art and religion,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.680
and the Big Bang was originally proposed by
Georges Lemaître - a Belgian Cosmologist

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.340
and Catholic priest!

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.570
Some religious people are definitely science
bros.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.360
More recently, Pope John Paul the Second wrote
in a letter to the Vatican Observatory, a

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.440
Church-run telescope dedicated to astronomical
research, "Science can purify religion from

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.170
error and superstition," that "Molecular biologists
have probed the structure of living material,"

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.360
showing the, "unity of nature."

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.510
And with this in mind, "Simple neutrality
is no longer acceptable," keeping religion

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.920
and science exclusive from one another "fosters
a fragmented vision of the world."

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.420
JPII was all SCIENCE AND RELIGION NEEDTA BE
BROS, and that was back in 1988!

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.020
Religious institutions have spent centuries
trying to learn more about "God's Creation"

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.240
through science.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.080
Even celebrated scientist Galileo Galilei
was offered a place in the Pontifical Academy

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.990
of Science back in 1610!

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
Of course... the Roman Inquisition later imprisoned
him for attempting to reinterpret the Bible,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400
but good times come and go for both science
and religion.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.610
Before joining the Catholic establishment
at 32, Pope Francis was called Jorge Mario

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.700
Bergoglio and he was much like you or me.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.360
He worked as a bouncer in a nightclub, and
went to a technical school in Buenos Aires,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.970
graduating with something akin to an associate's
degree as a chemical technician!

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030
POPE FRANCIS IS DOWN WITH SCIENCE TOO.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.800
Earlier this year, Pope Francis issued a 98-page
plea to all the bishops of the Roman Catholic

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.890
Church to stop climate destruction.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.920
He commented that Christians should care for
the environment and admitted that humans affected

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.910
our changing climate, saying, "most global
warming in recent decades is due to the great

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.140
concentration of greenhouse gases."

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.450
But, that wasn’t the first time he made
a huge splash in the political and scientific

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.450
communities!

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.580
In 2014, Pope Francis said, in a conversation
with the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, “Evolution

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.340
in nature is not inconsistent with the notion
of creation, because evolution requires the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.780
creation of beings that evolve."

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.290
He went on to say there is evidence for evolution
and it is a "reality that we must see and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.790
which enriches our understanding of life."

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.740
He also remarked that the Big Bang is "considered
to be the origin of the world."

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.380
He was clear when he said, these ideas are
NOT contradictory to God or the teachings

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.380
of the Church.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.960
This is the Pope, guys.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.380
When this happened, there were some collective
heads exploding across the spacious skies,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.920
amber waves of grain, and on the purple mountain
majesties… because a select group of Americans

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.150
have long rallied against these exact messages!

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.510
And yet, here's a religious leader, acknowledging
and accepting them.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.770
Perhaps the surprise that a Pope would come
out in favor of science, is exacerbated by

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.620
the fact that only 20 percent of people in
a 2013 Pew study knew nitrogen was the most

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.920
abundant gas in our atmosphere; and only 58
percent knew CO2 causes rising temperatures.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.880
Perhaps it's because americans don't science
good.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.420
Despite his more progressive views on climate
change and evolution, Pope Francis' alignment

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.860
with the Church on contraception, expanding
roles for women, and allowing priests to marry

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.020
hasn't budged.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.860
So, whether Pope Francis the most scientific
Pope is a solid 'maybe.'

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.020
Yes, things have changed in the last century,
but the Church has definitely been SCIENTIFICALLY

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.510
FRIENDLY for a few hundred years.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.290
Instead, I think, as we've become a more polarized
culture; we're simply more surprised to hear

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.160
agreement with scientific facts from such
a powerful religious leader.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.760
His outspoken views on science aren’t the
only things that make Pope Francis stand out.
