00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
This is gallium.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.980
It's a metal but it has
a melting point of 29.76 degrees Celcius.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.680
Which means that it will melt in your hand

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.580
to produce a beautiful silvery liquid like. this

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.560
Unlike mercury, which is toxic,
gallium is completely safe

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.380
which means you can do
some pretty amazing stuff with it.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.240
Like mold it into shapes...

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.760
or just swirl it around for hours in slow motion

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.420
Which we did.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.240
A really cool thing we can
do with gallium involves aluminium

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420
I've got an empty aluminium drinks can,
which we have sanded all the paint off of,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.560
and some liquid gallium here

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760
Now applying a small drop of this to the
aluminium

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.420
is gonna do something really interesting.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.720
Onto the can and then

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.660
because there'll be a layer of aluminium
oxide on the top

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.660
just scratch away a little bit...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.020
Now we just need to leave the
gallium on there for a few hours

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.460
but you can see already that the gallium is
tarnishing

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.140
from a silvery colour to  blackish gray coloor

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.745
So this is our can that we left overnight

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:03.680
and you can see that the gallium
has spread through the aluminium

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.240
and watch what happens
when I put my finger through it

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.340
So it's incredibly weak it's a really weird feeling

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.360
it's it's almost like there's
nothing there at all, it just crumbles to

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.600
something that feels a bit like ash in
between my fingers

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.640
And of course we also wanted to give
this a try with a full can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.260
just to see what would happen...

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.260
[CAN EXPLODES]

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.700
Wow!
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.740
That way really fast right?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.000
So we've just sprayed gallium
all over our faces and the camera

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.960
and exploded this because

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.320
it took way less time than we thought it
was going to.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.579
I thought that might take

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.600
up to an hour the quickest and it took
 seconds there

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.020
and it's just exploded in our faces,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.900
really amazingly torn open the can as well.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.820
Exciting and just a little bit frightening.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.320
So what's going on here to change
aluminium from something

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.460
relatively strong that can be
bent and deformed without breaking

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.000
to something much weaker and brittle even?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
Well contrary to what you might think,
it's not a chemical reaction.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.400
The liquid gallium is actually
physically penetrating through the aluminium.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.092
It's a process called liquid metal embrittlement.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.630
This is how it works.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.990
As a solid aluminium has a crystal structure.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.740
Its atoms are arranged in a rigid lattice like this,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.020
it's very ordered and the bonds
between the atoms are very strong.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.900
As in all metals, the outer electrons
of the aluminium atoms

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.200
aren't bound to one atom, but instead can
move freely within the lattice

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.540
It's the attraction between the positive
aluminium ions

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.620
and the free moving negative electrons

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.191
that bonds the crystal together.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.220
But the solid aluminium isn't
just one huge crystal.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.820
We can represent the structure in two dimensions.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.400
It's actually made up of many
tiny crystals in different orientations

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.820
called grains, between the grains we have
grain boundaries

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.000
there's still some bonding between the grains

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.600
but it's not as strong as
within the grains themselves

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.980
When we introduced just a
small amount of gallium

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.940
onto the surface of the can,
because the gallium is a liquid

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.580
it can penetrate very rapidly
into the aluminium grain boundaries

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.160
and once it's there it gets in the way
of the bonding between those grains

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.520
This makes it much easier
to break the grains apart,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.200
because now instead of pulling on
strong aluminium bonds

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.640
you're pulling on the weak bonds
between the liquid gallium atoms

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.780
So it doesn't take much
for the aluminium to crumble apart

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.529
That's it for this video, thanks for
watching

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.980
One last thing a bit of a mystery that we had actually,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.780
we showed you one of the cans exploding
as we applied some gallium to it earlier

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.600
but to be truthful that was the only time
we got a can to explode

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.380
every other time we tried
we just got a weak little stream

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.780
of drink squeezing out of the can

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.400
Ah what?

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.980
That was not it again. That was it again!

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.300
So if you've got any ideas what was happening

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.280
that was different that one
time the can exploded please let us know

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.460
down in the comments
