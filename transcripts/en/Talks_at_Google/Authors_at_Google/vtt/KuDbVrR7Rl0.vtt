JOSH TETRICK: Thanks, Jessica,
for hanging out and eating

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.050
all that egg-less mayo.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.180
It's good to be here with
you, and hi to everyone

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.530
watching on the live stream.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.720
I'm especially proud to
be here with this man

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.800
because I have been doing
this for only five years,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.500
and decades ago, when I
was playing football trying

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.550
to figure my life out, Wayne
was fighting for animals,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.130
figuring out a
different approach

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.850
to do all the good that
we'll be talking about.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.630
And we're at Google, this is the
land of the information economy

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.610
here.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.730
And we know about as
the information economy.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330
And we know that the
wealth that it's created.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.780
We know the freedom
that it's created.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.640
But you talk about
a different kind

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.260
of economy, the humane economy.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.362
So I think we should
start-- what is that?

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.570
And then we'll get into a
good conversation together.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.403
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah.

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:58.830
No, that's great hey
everybody here and online.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.950
And it's a great
pleasure to be with Josh,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.879
who is really one of the
pioneers of the humane economy.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.520
And you know, I think of
the history of our country

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.140
and you think of all of the
changes that have been wrought

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.720
in so many different
domains-- social issues,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.100
I mean we're a country
that has dealt with so many

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.170
pressing social justice issues.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.950
I mean, for the first
80 years in our history

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.630
we had chattel slavery,
for the first 140 years

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.690
we denied women
the right to vote,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.370
as recently as the 1950s we
had violence breaking out

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.070
in the South and other parts
of the country on race issues,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.060
we've had an incredible
kind of interest

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.400
and also enormous
movement on LGBT

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.610
issues in the last few years.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.070
And one of the
issues that I think

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.400
is one of the most emerging
issues which, of course, is

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.970
the subject of the book, and the
reason why I chose the title,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.520
is "The Humane Economy"
and animal issues.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.350
But these changes are seen
not just in social issues,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.590
but in technology.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.700
I mean the world changes
so fast, faster than ever.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.600
If you think about all the
different domains in which we

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.250
look at how we
conduct our lives,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.692
how we get around, how
we process information--

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:15.150
it's crazy to think
of the changes.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.920
It was wild as a notion to think
humans would engage in flight.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.160
The transition from
the horse and the horse

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.440
and buggy to the internal
combustion engine

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.650
was obviously a huge change.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.400
All the changes in
information technology,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.050
in photography-- I mean, we
could go through every one.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.260
And obviously the whole idea
of search and information

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.080
gathering is a big part of
the changes that are just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.800
running through society.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.580
So in this book I'm
talking about the changes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.080
that are happening in our human
relationship with animals.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.460
Some are very intentional,
where we are designing new ways

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.760
to live our lives
and conduct business

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.920
that reflects a greater
consciousness about animals.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.980
And you, I think,
are a great example

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.520
of that because you
have a sensibility

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.930
and a concern for animals.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.500
But there are other
changes that are

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.700
being wrought just
because people are

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.670
seeking greater efficiencies.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.510
The famous statement within
the animal protection movement

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.160
and its history is
that Henry Ford, not

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.170
Henry Burke, who was the
founder of the ASPCA,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.280
really was the one who liberated
the horse in so many ways

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.390
in the 19th century.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.210
And I think through
intentional innovation

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.120
and just innovation-- I mean
morally intentional innovation,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.880
versus just innovation that
comes through efficiency,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.520
we're seeing incredible changes.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.100
So this book is
kind of a chronicle.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.080
It's also a little bit
of a political science

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.100
treatment of how these changes
are occurring in our society.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.600
JOSH TETRICK: It's interesting
in thinking about "The Humane

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.180
Economy" and following
Wayne's work,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.070
we're in a day where-- earlier
today Wayne I was discussing

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.910
earlier John Boehner in
referring to Ted Cruz--

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.691
called him, "Lucifer
in the flesh."

00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.190
We got Democrats fighting with
each other, Republicans fight

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.160
with each other, and a lot
of partisanship out there.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.770
And that the energy I get from
this book in your work, Wayne,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.839
it feels different in tone.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.510
And I wonder if
you could describe

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.870
that a little bit, because
we-- everyone, whether you love

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.880
your dog, you love your cat,
or you just think that animals

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.910
generally should
be treated better,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.290
can come to a common
agreement that,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.360
best not to do a lot of harm.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.910
But there's a tone
to it, and I wonder

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.220
if you could touch
a little bit on that

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.030
in the context of this
book in your work.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.240
WAYNE PACELLE: Well you
referenced my involvement

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.480
in this issue for many years
and I've been at it a long time.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.740
I was a sophomore in
college in the mid-80s

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.090
and I started in
animal advocacy group.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.650
At the time I think it was
really almost a protest

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.220
movement.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.250
I mean these ideas were
not top of mind for people.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.190
The whole term animal rights
was kind of an unusual one,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.510
it was a very provocative one.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.870
And to even talk about
things like agriculture

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.860
and think about eating
more plant-based foods,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.120
talk about being a
vegetarian, those

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.910
were a bit heretical
at that time.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.370
And I think over
these last 30 years,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.870
we've seen these ideas move from
the margins to the mainstream,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.890
and that the notion
of protecting animals

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.820
has become normalized.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.920
And the idea that cruelty
to animals is wrong

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.260
is a universal value.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.740
Every single state has
an anti-cruelty statute

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.140
that forbids malicious
treatment of individual animals.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.140
And now, thanks to South
Dakota passing a law in 2014,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.930
all 50 states have
felony level penalties

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.100
for these malicious
acts of cruelty.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.580
So I think, and to
your point, Josh,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.820
the basic issue that animal
cruelty is wrong is settled.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.230
The difficulty comes in
applying anti-cruelty principles

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.820
in a world where
animals are embedded

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.420
in so many different
industries in our society.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.350
They're embedded in
food and agriculture.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.580
A lot of people
don't think about it.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.600
We get our food
from a cafeteria.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.550
And obviously you guys
actually do fabulous food here,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.560
Bon Appetite management
does your food service here

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.130
and they're an absolutely
leader in humane and sustainable

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.800
eating issues.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.770
So it's great to have
the marriage of these two

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.250
fabulous companies.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:32.740
But these notions of treating
animals well in the food system

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.520
may not be intuitive to people
because we're so far removed

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.620
from the food system.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.120
We get our stuff in the
cafeteria, as I was saying,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.540
or from a restaurant
or from a supermarket,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.190
and we don't know the back
story unless we actively

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.650
search it out or if we've
had some opportunity to now

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.570
see a documentary
or to read about it.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.300
And what you're
doing, Josh, I think

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.810
is an incredible business
venture because you

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.880
are giving people choices.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.940
We were hostage before because
the standard American diet--

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.140
we were told when
I was growing up,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.110
the US department
of agriculture had

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.360
a construct for the ideal diet
called the basic four food

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.960
groups.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.460
And you were basically
told you were

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.220
going to be unhealthy--
kids, especially boys,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.300
who want to grow
fast and they want

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.630
to have muscles and
be strong-- they

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.740
were told that you have to eat
from each of these four food

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.750
groups liberally.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.970
So you've got meat
in one category,

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.314
and then dairy and eggs
in a second category,

00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:35.730
then all the fruits
and vegetables

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.690
were bunched into one
even though there are so

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.390
many different fruits
and vegetables,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.440
and then you have
grains in the other.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.050
And this was how industry
worked through the government

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.250
to project what we
were supposed to eat.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.610
And we've been told through
all these government programs

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.770
that meat makes you strong,
you need the protein.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.260
If you eat plant-based foods
you're going to be deficient.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.530
And what you've
done-- and I'm sure

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.930
most people here know
what Hampton Creek is,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.700
and Jessica gave us
that introduction--

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.940
but you're producing
a plant-based egg,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.280
that-- people have
no idea that eggs

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.350
are hidden in so many products.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.212
They're in muffins, and they're
in cakes, and they're in pasta,

00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:25.240
and they're ingredients
and so many other foods

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.500
and we don't even see it.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.170
So you're creating an
opportunity for people

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.780
to have all the good things
that eggs do for us in terms

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.150
of protein and other
nutritional properties--

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.110
having the binding
qualities of the product

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.230
because it's an ingredient
that keeps things together--

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.890
but with none of
the animal cruelty.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.150
And that's why I was so happy to
profile Josh and his colleague

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.990
and my colleague, Josh Balk, in
the book, because I think you

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.600
guys are incredible
innovators and I

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.550
guess I just wanted to ask
you as someone who I think

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.930
is providing choices
to people, what's

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.810
the balance between
like your innovation

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.930
and your moral purpose here?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.220
How do you navigate that?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.769
JOSH TETRICK: When we
started five years ago--

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:17.060
if I don't know if I would
have said this publicly five

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.860
years ago, but if we were
having a private conversation

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.120
together-- and you asked
me about the biggest food

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.580
companies in the world and the
biggest retailers in the world,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.137
I would said they mostly
don't get it at all.

00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:28.720
I would have said
that they're made up

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.229
of people who--
they're fine, but they

00:09:32.229 --> 00:09:33.520
don't have a lot of compassion.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.590
They don't have a lot
of goodness in them.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.520
And one thing we've learned
in the last five years

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.070
is that's actually
wrong, and it leads

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.750
to how we think about
things and balancing that.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.880
We have found out that when
you approach food, this thing,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.000
this system that is
so personal, that

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.810
is so connected to our
identity, in a way that is not

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.840
about clashing with
folks, in a way that

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.032
is built on our identity,
in a way where--

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:03.490
just like everyone agrees that
animals shouldn't be treated

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.504
cruelly-- everyone also agrees,
all things being equal-- food--

00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:08.170
there's a little bit
better for the body

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.836
and a little bit
better for the planet--

00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:11.440
should taste better
and be affordable.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.344
There's not a lot
of disagreement.

00:10:13.344 --> 00:10:15.760
Whether you go to a Donald
Trump rally or a Bernie Sanders

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.780
support, you probably
agree with that.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.670
And we believe that as long
as we can figure out a way

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.090
to make that good thing taste
better and be more affordable,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.010
change is instigated by that.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.970
So in some ways we don't feel
like we're sacrificing profits.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.010
That is connected to how
we think about things now,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.890
we do things.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.490
And I know then in thinking
about the humane economy,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.797
we establish this baseline.

00:10:40.797 --> 00:10:42.380
Everyone-- doesn't
matter who you are,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.049
there's some baseline care
that's been recognized legally,

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:46.590
it's been recognized
culturally, it's

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.210
been recognized
morally for animals.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.910
And you got
entrepreneurship trying

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.610
to do something about it.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.910
But one thing you've done
in your organization,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.110
HSUS has done, is
to say that what

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.390
your General Mills or Nestle or
Walmart, or you're Burger King

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:09.000
or you're McDonald's, there are
good people in these companies,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.870
that if approached in the
right way, agree with this.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.630
WAYNE PACELLE: Because most
people want to do good.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.890
This whole notion that
somehow that everybody's

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.720
bad-- populating these
enormous companies is false.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.410
And we've seen that in
terms of our campaigns

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.770
in getting companies to
just procure their eggs

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.540
from cage-free operations.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.430
So many of the companies
now are sourcing

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.270
some of your Hampton
Creek products,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.610
which is an amazing thing.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.660
How many stores are you in now?

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.070
JOSH TETRICK: Today we're
about 21,000 locations,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.150
you can find us in 2,300 public
schools, 472 universities,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.270
every single solitary Walmart.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.030
We're in fancy restaurants like
Beefsteak in Washington, DC.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.020
We're also in places
like the Dollar Tree

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.680
that you might not
expect us to be in.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.420
WAYNE PACELLE: Because
you're competitive on price?

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.360
JOSH TETRICK: Because
we figure out a way

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.500
to be competitive in price.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.590
And every once and again
you find these individuals

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.410
at these companies who figure
out a way to really align

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.740
the profit and the purpose.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.562
And you mentioned Bon
Appetite, who runs food here,

00:12:16.562 --> 00:12:17.770
I think they're a part of it.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.670
I think the wider Compass group,
a big food service company,

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.740
is a part of it.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.630
executives at Walmart, you
know, Wayne, are a part of it.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.670
And I think that bodes well
in the intro to your book

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.680
in talking about suffering
and talking about torture

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.900
and talking about devastation
of animals you said hope

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.990
and you talked about that.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.820
And what are-- in doing all
this research spending, all

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.900
this time while you're running
in this big organization-- what

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.322
are one or two bright spots
of just scintillating hope

00:12:51.322 --> 00:12:52.280
that you see out there?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.600
You're just like, you look
at it for the folks in here

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.380
who love animals, and you
say quit the pessimism.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.620
Something's going on here.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.203
WAYNE PACELLE: Well,
we're at a moment

00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:04.110
of great change in our society.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.310
We do recognize that
animal cruelty is wrong.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.540
We now do see the
power of the human mind

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.410
to figure out ways
to do things better.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.602
So if you've got a moral purpose
and you have a moral problem,

00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:17.810
how do we solve that problem?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.880
Let's figure out a way to
meet our basic needs, let's

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.230
figure out a way to
generate jobs and wealth

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.660
but not leave a trail of
animal victims in the process.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.520
And I think one of the
big conclusions in my book

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.100
is that if you look at different
sectors of the economy,

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.670
you would get food and ag,
wildlife management, fashion,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.850
use of animals in
cosmetic testing,

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.390
chemicals, drug testing,
other domains, we're

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.500
seeing incredible gains across
the board in all these areas.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.360
If you saw one area
that was popping up

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.390
because you had a visionary
entrepreneur like you,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.700
or you had a terrible
incident that

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.940
came to light and that
raised consciousness

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.670
and then people
responded to that,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.540
you say OK, well that
was just that set

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.120
of facts and circumstances
that drove that outcome.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.405
But when you see last
month that SeaWorld

00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:10.120
said it's going to end
its breeding of orcas

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.860
just three years
after the release

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.482
of "Blackfish" the movie,
that was serially run on CNN,

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.440
and the year before that
Ringling Brothers said

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.050
it was going to end its use
of elephants in circus acts,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.680
I mean those are two big brands
in the world of live animal

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.930
entertainment, in fact,
with elephants and orcas

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.305
right at the center
of the brand.

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:31.320
For those companies to change
is symbolically significant.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.830
I mean, it may not affect the
lives of that many animals,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.020
certainly not relative
to agriculture,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.410
but it's a big deal.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.500
When Cecil the lion
was killed last July

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.780
and this Minnesota trophy
hunter, the bow and arrow

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.060
had his face splash
all over social media

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.770
and traditional media, I mean
the world responded to that.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.130
And within three weeks, 45 of
the biggest global airlines,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.640
including all the
big US carriers--

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.340
Delta, American,
and United-- said,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.530
we're not going to ship
trophies in our cargo

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.960
hold of African lions
or elephants or rhinos

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.060
or Cape Buffalo or leopards.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.780
So the world is changing.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.980
Cosmetic companies-- it used
to be just the regular process

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.950
for all these cosmetic
makers to test

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.580
on animals with a
lethal dose 50 test,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.760
or the Draize eye
irritancy test.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.775
And now you have hundreds
of these companies

00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:28.830
that have said we
are not going to test

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.830
our products on animals.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.580
They're using safe
ingredients and they're

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.070
using alternative methods.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.600
And then this revolution in
food with, in the last seven

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.970
months, 140 of the biggest
brand names in food,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.576
from McDonald's, to Walmart
to Burger King, to Sodexho,

00:15:45.576 --> 00:15:47.650
to Norwegian Cruise
Lines-- I mean,

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.680
every name you could
think of, they've

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.660
all committed to source their
eggs from cage-free operations.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.050
So you see that in all
these different arenas

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.400
something's happening.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.570
Now it's a dizzyingly
complex world

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.730
in terms of our human
relationship to animals

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.930
and there are still so
many enormous problems.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.180
But for me, it does
give me hope because it

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.870
shows that our focus in
trying to drive change

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.700
can yield results.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.250
If we are good enough and
strong enough as organizations

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.770
to drive this, we're
going to find great people

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.560
within these
companies, we're going

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.410
to reach consumers who are
increasingly concerned.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.490
Young people have now had
access because of Google

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.240
and other information
aggregators

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.220
to find out what's happening
to animals on factory farms

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.670
or to find out what's
happening in cosmetic testing

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.810
laboratories or to expose Walter
Palmer for shooting that lion.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.600
This information is closing
the distance between our world

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.960
and what happens to animals.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.690
And I think the other part of
this, which I kick back to you,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.280
is people have to have options.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.290
If you're living in some small
rural part of the United States

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.010
and you get a
little airport, you

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.160
may be lucky if there's
one commercial carrier who

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.830
is offering service
to you if you

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.594
need to travel long distance.

00:17:05.594 --> 00:17:07.260
So you're a hostage
to that one company.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.359
You got to get your flight when
then leave and at the price

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.599
you want because you
don't have a choice.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.450
You can't drive 1,000 miles.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.535
So that's the way
it was with eggs,

00:17:18.535 --> 00:17:20.410
that's the way it was
with a lot of products.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.849
We didn't have choices.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.640
And now you with your
company are giving people

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.210
choices that enable people
then to act on their beliefs.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.760
And if you're concerned about
the mistreatment of animals

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.860
in the food supply,
here's one way

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.200
to just kind of keep
things perfectly clean

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.270
and eat the products
that you're providing

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:45.580
that are equivalent or superior
on nutrition and price,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.610
and way superior on
the moral side of it.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.546
And I imagine that's why you
think you're seeing success

00:17:51.546 --> 00:17:52.170
in all of this.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.586
JOSH TETRICK: I
mean we the way we

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:58.330
think about it is whether
we're making a cookie or Mayo

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.980
or dressings or pasta--
whatever the heck it is we're

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.620
making as a company-- that we
got 310 million Americans, 7.1

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.170
billion people on the planet.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.970
A tiny fraction of
those folks, let's

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.840
call them just not good at all.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.400
Like flat out evil,
tiny fraction of them.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.780
We want the evil folks
out there to eat our stuff

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.530
because it is more delicious
than anything else out there

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.240
and is more affordable than
anything else out there.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.300
You got a lot of people in
this world that are poor.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.870
They're just poor
and they simply

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.115
don't have a lot of options.

00:18:29.115 --> 00:18:30.490
And all things
being equal they'd

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.651
feed their kids good
things, but unfortunately,

00:18:32.651 --> 00:18:35.150
just like my mom, growing up,
she didn't have a lot of money

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.720
to do the right thing.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.190
We want the poor
people out there

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.730
to end up choose in the
thing that is more connected

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.014
to who they are,
connected to their values

00:18:43.014 --> 00:18:45.430
because it's more affordable
and because it tastes better.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.920
Right?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.340
WAYNE PACELLE: Yep.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.465
JOSH TETRICK: And there
are a lot of people, Wayne,

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:50.840
as we all know, I mean
especially the people who

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.140
work at one of the most
extraordinary companies

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.930
in the world that we're talking
to now, who were just too damn

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.950
busy.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.340
Just too busy-- you have
a thousand things going on

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.010
in your life and you can't
contemplate ethical choices

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.810
every single moment.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.760
We all should, of course,
but it makes it difficult.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.977
Our system has made
that difficult.

00:19:10.977 --> 00:19:13.560
So if you can make it easy for
the busiest people in the world

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.537
to do the right thing by just
having it delicious, having it

00:19:16.537 --> 00:19:18.370
available everywhere,
you don't have to take

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.159
20 little steps or
big steps to get it,

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:23.200
then you end up hopefully
doing something better.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.400
WAYNE PACELLE: It goes from
a niche sort of concern.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.790
I say that people who are
really concerned about animals

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:28.860
will sacrifice.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.190
When I was eating in
the dining hall in 1984,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.330
we didn't have a Bon
Appetite management

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.850
that our university
was sourcing from,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.830
and I had to go in the back with
the cooks and make my own food.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.970
And I was like not
a very good cook.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.760
I was giving them
advice and showing them

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.490
how to use tofu and
these other things.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.870
I was willing to go in
the back and to deal

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.680
with that and the
inconvenience of it,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.330
and then walking
out in the dining

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.730
hall with this different thing
that everyone is mocking me

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.330
for it, talking about.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.376
And now that has a
low ceiling in terms

00:20:04.376 --> 00:20:06.000
of the number of
people do that, but we

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.830
want to reach 95%, not 5%.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.850
JOSH TETRICK: That's it.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.300
Think about it, to use another
analog outside the world

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.960
of food, this food system.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.420
And I know that the
folks at this company

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.050
think in terms of systems.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.120
And think about energy.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.770
Think how many times in your
life you've walked into a room

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.272
and you've flipped
a light switch.

00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:27.480
And that light switch has
set off a chain of reaction

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.938
that has gone to
a coal-fired power

00:20:28.938 --> 00:20:31.910
plant within 65 square miles.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.710
I guarantee you that 99%
of the folks who work here

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.550
believe in the science
of climate change.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.970
You believe we
should do something

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.220
to mitigate
extinction, you believe

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.470
in protecting the environment.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.540
Every time you flip
that switch you're

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.990
doing something that's
misaligned with your values.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.190
Not because you're a bad
person, but because it's easy,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.290
it's accessible, and it works.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.430
WAYNE PACELLE: You're a hostage.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.510
JOSH TETRICK: It's
bound in the system.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.570
And I think figuring out
a way through the laws--

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.530
and I'd love you to
touch on that too, Wayne,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.488
through laws, through
commerce, through working

00:21:04.488 --> 00:21:07.470
with the biggest companies, is
unraveling the system to create

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.940
something a little bit better.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.200
And on that, we talk
about entrepreneurship.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.600
You talk about some of
these biggest companies who

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.217
have figured out a way to
say we don't need to confine,

00:21:18.217 --> 00:21:19.800
we can have a little
bit more freedom.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.930
We don't need to cram,
we can have a little bit

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.400
more openness.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.910
But the Humane Society
has done really

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.640
trailblazing work
at understanding

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.750
how to unpack the legalities,
of the laws-- state,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.054
national around all this.

00:21:36.054 --> 00:21:37.470
Maybe you could
touch a little bit

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.190
on that, how that opens up
this human economy, too.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.500
WAYNE PACELLE: Well I
wrote a piece not long ago

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.900
for "Foreign Affairs"
magazine about the interplay

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.810
of strategy.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.140
So congressional strategies,
state legislative strategies,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.290
ballot measures, as well
as corporate campaigns,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.250
the courts.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.310
You think of the
gay rights cause.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.350
We were doing ballot measures
in states for the last 25 years.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.360
And we were outlawing
cockfighting

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.070
of the use of steel jaw leg hold
traps or confinement systems

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.410
for animals on factory farms.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.740
And on the same ballot with
us were often anti-gay rights

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.690
ballot measures.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.900
In fact, when we did
prop 2 here seven,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.700
eight years ago
to ban confinement

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.030
of animals on
factory farms, prop 8

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.440
was on the was on the ballot,
which was a anti-gay marriage

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.360
measure.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.320
And that measure passed
while prop 2 also passed.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.730
So it was an incredible
run of losses

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.580
that the gay rights
community had

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.500
on those sets of those
gay marriage questions.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.090
Like 32 straight or
something that they lost.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.830
But they kept at it
and their big arena

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.340
of success or pathway of
success was through the courts.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.020
Once more people came
out of the closet

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.240
and started talking about
their sexual orientation,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.780
it just became part of society.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.290
And the whole fear of
it was demystified.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.580
And the numbers in terms of
acceptance of these ideas

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.700
flipped in society where it was
fewer than 50% of the people

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.710
were tolerant of
that lifestyle, then

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.570
it became a majority sentiment.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.750
Then the courts
invalidated those

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.150
states statutes, invalidated
federal laws that

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.510
discriminated.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.810
And one of the things
that I've seen in our work

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.250
is that we're working all
these different channels.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.710
Sometimes we're
working the courts,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.270
and then we're
working the Congress,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.656
and we're doing ballot
measures and we're

00:23:40.656 --> 00:23:41.930
working these corporations.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.090
We had a case where the
egg industry actually

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:50.500
agreed to set a minimum standard
and service of space allocation

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.050
and enrichment standards for
the hands in agriculture.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.610
And the other sectors of
the farm lobby, the beef

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.520
and the pork industry
and the Farm Bureau

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.460
blocked it in Congress.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.010
But it didn't stop us, because
then we just went around.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.300
And my colleague Josh
Balk and Paul Shapiro

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.565
started talking to the big food
sellers in the United States

00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:13.440
and said, hey, we've
got a majority of people

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.330
who care about these issues.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.410
Look at these polls.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.810
85% of people don't want to see
animals in extreme confinement.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.980
Look at what California did when
this issue was on the ballot.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.504
Look at the health
issues, look at the brand

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:25.670
that you're trying to build.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.961
You don't want to be associated
with the sort of animal

00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:28.530
cruelty.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.560
And so many of these
companies have changed.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.950
So what an incredible thing to
see how these reinforcements--

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.720
when we do a ballot
measure it sets up

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.862
the corporate campaigns.

00:24:38.862 --> 00:24:40.320
When we do a
corporate campaign, it

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.140
sets up success for
a ballot measure,

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.290
it sets up success
in the courts.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.740
And one of the things that
I'm most excited about

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.770
is that people like you
are now making it easier.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.080
We just came from Veggie
Grill, a new company.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.110
It's like a fast food
type plant-based company.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.500
I couldn't have stopped
there years ago.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.780
It didn't exist.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.810
And so many companies
are now working

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.700
to give us more options.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.920
And I guess had a
question for you.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.580
Might be a tough
question, but you

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.080
see that HSUS has negotiated
all these agreements

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.250
with these big food
companies on cage-free eggs,

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.260
and here you are with a
plant-based egg substitute.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.260
Are you concerned?

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.230
Are we undermining
you with this idea

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.920
of a more cage-free as the
minimum standard in society?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.720
Because that's what's going to
happen to me over the next six

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.180
or seven years,
all the cages are

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.060
going to be pulled out of
these enormous factory farms.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.000
You're still going to
have intensive raising

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.140
of laying hens.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.040
They're going to be big
buildings in a lot of cases,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.180
but does that concern you
from a business perspective?

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.220
JOSH TETRICK: No,
I thind-- I heard

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.750
someone say-- I
wish I remembered

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.840
who said this because it
has always impacted me.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.020
Compassion is like a muscle.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.640
The more you work, it
the stronger it gets.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240
And these executives of
the biggest companies

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.310
in the world, executives
that are, in a lot of ways,

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.670
they're influencing these
billions of dollars of food

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.220
flows.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.040
Is it bad?

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.830
Is it good?

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.940
Is it easy to eat well?

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.900
Is it hard to eat well?

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:21.800
When Humane Society, in a
thoughtful, intellectual,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.370
rational way describes the
market, describes the options,

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.170
you begin to open up the mind
and the heart to these things.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.170
When we go in and we
have conversations,

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.700
there's an openness, there's an
awareness of what's happening.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.980
And the reality,
Wayne, is we didn't

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.440
start Hampton Creek
to do anything

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.470
but try to use the force of
capitalism to have an impact.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:50.400
We want it to happen
all over the place

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.040
and we want more companies
to read your book

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.270
to try to compete with us.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.050
That's how change
really happens.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.660
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah,
you know I have

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.070
a chapter in this
book that really

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:08.150
is about the innovators in
the food and agriculture area.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.020
And the preceding
chapter is really

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.110
about the cage-free and
create-free movement,

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.490
and kind of running the
table on that issue.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.110
And we will see the end
of extreme confinement

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.850
in the United States in
just the next few years.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.700
But what you're doing
at Hampton Creek,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.350
and what Beyond Meet is
doing and Impossible Foods,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.760
and also what Modern Meadow is
doing in terms of cell culture

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.490
meat, I talk about this
chapter where I feature you

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.360
and Josh Balk and others.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.710
And the title of this chapter is
called "The chicken or the egg,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.940
or neither?"

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.900
And I start off with this quote
from Winston Churchill, 1931,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.990
in an essay titled
"50 Years Hence."

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.550
Now Winston Churchill
is a visionary guy,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.660
but I never knew this
dimension of him.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.060
He said we shall escape
the absurdity of growing

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.630
a whole chicken in
order to eat the breast

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.310
or wing by growing
these parts separately

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.190
under a suitable medium.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.250
Synthetic food will,
from the outset,

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.910
be practically indistinguishable
from natural products.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.580
And think about this guy nearly
a century ago saying that.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.140
I mean, it is kind of
crazy at some level.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.790
I mean, these animals, putting
them by the tens of thousands

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.940
in the case of laying
hens in a single building?

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.070
I went to one farm
in Iowa that had

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:30.170
150,000 hens jammed in the cages
that were stacked eight high.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.570
The cages were side to side
for a football field length.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.820
And they were 93 houses,
there were 10 million birds

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.210
at this complex.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.250
There are three million
people in all of Iowa.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.870
Our media chases these
people around Iowa

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.150
for months in advance of the
Iowa caucuses every four years.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.210
There are 99 counties
in that state.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.820
Think of it, one farm
had 10 million birds.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.340
And you think, as my
friend Matthew Scully said,

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.310
factory farming is a case
of human ingenuity detached

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.840
from conscience.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.420
What if we could have
agriculture and human ingenuity

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.350
attached to conscience?

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.170
That's really what
you're trying to do.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.650
You're creating an
efficient company

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:23.110
that can produce affordable,
nutritious, complete food,

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.350
but without any of
the moral problems

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.880
that we typically associate
with these industrialized

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.220
agriculture notions.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.454
I guess is why I feel
hopeful, because I

00:29:31.454 --> 00:29:32.870
look at the history
of our country

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.610
and I see all the changes.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.430
And if we're determined to
solve these problems-- I mean,

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.510
we can entertain people
without having elephants

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.970
standing on their head.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.800
We can feed ourselves
without cramming

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.760
buildings full of animals
on a factory farm.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.320
We can entertain
ourselves in the wild

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.010
without having a bow and arrow,
and we can take a camera out

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.740
and watch the wildlife.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.277
These are not super hard
problems, it seems to me.

00:30:00.277 --> 00:30:02.360
For our society we've got
a lot of tough problems,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.620
but these don't seem
to be among them.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.400
JOSH TETRICK: And when you were
sneaking back in the dining

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.820
hall trying to teach those
chefs how to make something

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.971
or cooking it yourself,
you called it--

00:30:11.971 --> 00:30:13.720
WAYNE PACELLE: I didn't
go into that field

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.330
because I had a low ceiling
in terms of my ability.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.880
JOSH TETRICK: Yeah,
join the club.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.060
But you called it,
back in the day,

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.370
kind of a protest movement.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.655
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:25.280
JOSH TETRICK: One of
the-- getting back

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.620
to things I'd been surprised
about in the last five years

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.200
is billionaires
across the world,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.040
influential legislatures--
locally, globally,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.670
nationally-- executives
at the biggest companies

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.810
in the world, celebrities.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.670
It feels like the last 5 to 10
years, these influential people

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.260
who determine what we
watch, what we buy,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.000
where capital goes into
have almost collectively,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.600
at the same time, said
what are we doing?

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.090
Maybe there's a better path.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.870
And I want to talk a little
bit about that because you

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.580
can have a deep
grassroots movement,

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.700
but the reality of the
world that we live in,

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.640
whether we want to
accept it or not,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.170
is influential folks
hold a lot of power

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.189
in politics and finance.

00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:18.230
What do you see in there?

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.896
What's going on?

00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:21.430
WAYNE PACELLE: Well leadership
matters in the world.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.060
I don't see social
change as just these kind

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.100
of winds that are blowing
that carry us along.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.600
People do influence history.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.130
And 25 years ago, when
David Duffield, who started

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.979
PeopleSoft became the
first big philanthropist

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:39.270
in the world of animal welfare.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.728
He said I'm going
to put $2 billion

00:31:40.728 --> 00:31:44.860
into eliminating euthanasia of
dogs and cats in this country.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.830
The Wall Street Journal and
other publications mocked him.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.140
Why would you do that?

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.950
Now we're seeing major
philanthropists and investors

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.990
really saying, hey, we need
to make our society better.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.260
So you've got billionaires
investing in your company

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.930
because they see that it's
good for the whole society.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.950
When your company
grows, your values

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.350
are embedded in the products
that you're selling,

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.270
and that's going to turn
out to be a better society.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.560
And we're seeing philanthropists
putting more money

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.660
into these causes, and that
is transformational for us.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.210
Because you need that
kind of leadership.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.460
You need people to step up
and imagine a better world.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.730
If we just wait for these
things to happen, it won't.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:34.860
It always has taken human
agency to drive big change.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.810
And what's more fundamental than
changing our human relationship

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.360
to nature and animals?

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.900
Animals are all around us,
nature is all around us.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.140
One of the most iconic images
in contemporary American history

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:53.670
was when in the late 1960s
when astronauts went into space

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.920
with our government funding,
so much of that research

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.200
and development and
then that space travel,

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.580
astronaut looked back and took
a picture in the vast openness

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.340
of our solar system and saw this
little blue-green marble amidst

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.250
all the darkness of
our solar system, which

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.750
is a small portion
of our galaxy, which

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.910
is one galaxy among
countless galaxies.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.210
And we saw how
fragile this earth is.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:26.040
70% of it is covered by water
of the terrestrial landscape.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.860
So much of that is covered
by desert and rock and ice.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.330
The habitable
portion is limited.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.470
It is madness that we have
77 billion animals being

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.440
raised for food on
this planet every year.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.930
77 billion.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.740
It's one person to 11 animals.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.750
The average person in this
world is eating 11 animals.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.250
In the United States, we're
eating 30 animals a year,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.770
per person.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.000
We cannot afford this.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.580
When I was in conversation the
other night with Mark Bittman,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.320
he said if the rest of the
world adopts the American diet

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.380
in terms of our animal
product consumption,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.510
we're going to need four earths.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.270
We cannot afford this.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.880
It's terrible from an
animal welfare outcome,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.469
it's horrible from an
environmental perspective

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:15.929
in terms of groundwater, the
atmosphere, use of grains,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.870
use of water.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.690
I mean, these are fundamentals.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:23.690
And that's why we need people
like you and others figuring

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.070
out a new way to feed
ourselves in a way that's

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.730
good and affordable,
but that doesn't

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.170
create this enormous
set of casualties.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.170
JOSH TETRICK: I want to
make sure-- we're really

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.886
lucky to be here, in particular,
a company I admire a lot.

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:38.760
And I'd love to take a
few questions from you

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.070
all, and we'll continue
the conversation

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.810
whether questions specifically
about Wayne's book,

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:49.110
his career, this crazy world of
food that we find ourselves in

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.929
and the optimism that I think is
around this more than we often

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.170
realize.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.599
You can just step up to--
the mic's over there.

00:34:57.599 --> 00:34:58.390
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.534
Thank you for the
wonderful presentation.

00:35:00.534 --> 00:35:02.850
Always inspiring to
hear both of you.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.625
And my question for you, Wayne,
is you touched on legislation,

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:08.442
and can you talk
about the type of work

00:35:08.442 --> 00:35:10.275
that the Humane Society
of the United States

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:13.050
is doing on legislation,
both on softening bills that

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.040
could be harmful for
animals, and also

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.430
propelling bills forward
that could be helpful.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.190
WAYNE PACELLE:
Sure, we want to use

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.000
all these different
channels to drive reform.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.630
And there's such an
asymmetry in power

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.370
between humans and animals.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.120
We hold all the cards, we
can wipe out entire species,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.930
we can have factory
farms, we can

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.080
stage fights between animals.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.670
So the law has to speak for
animals because the animals are

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.250
so vulnerable.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.810
And we're working to pass basic
anti-cruelty laws, and then

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.640
laws and all these different
arenas in which we're working,

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.060
whether that's cracking
down on puppy mills

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.850
or banning trophy hunting
of wolves or grizzly bears,

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.950
or it's ending cosmetic
testing on animals

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:58.740
or ending confinement or
tail docking of dairy cows.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.740
But we also do find ourselves
trying to block bad bills,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.420
and the agriculture
industry has really

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.250
been responsible for
some doozies out there.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.710
One category of laws
or bills that they've

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.965
been trying to pass are
what we have referred--

00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:17.440
and Mark Bittman, a food
writer for The New York Times

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:24.090
said, our ag gag laws, to
forbid citizens or staff

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.770
from groups like the Humane
Society of the US or the Humane

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:30.670
League or Mercy for Animals
from taking pictures or video

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.670
of animals on factory farms.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:37.070
Now this is the food that
people in society are eating.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.840
Kids are eating,
grandparents are eating.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.950
And we're not allowed to see it
if it's an unauthorized image

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:44.670
from these farms?

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.070
So you see whenever you
have any social progress,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.730
there's a backlash from the
people who are very invested

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.700
in maintaining the status quo.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.840
So now they have
right to farm laws.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.300
There were bills introduced
in Oklahoma and Missouri

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.860
this year to prevent
Oklahomans and Missourians

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.120
from contributing to animal
protection organizations that

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.110
do national programs.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.650
It was a transparent
attempt to try

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.780
to dry up our fund raising
at the Humane Society

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.060
because the Farm
Bureau and the others

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.561
don't want us doing this work.

00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:21.810
AUDIENCE: Hey Wayne, can you
tell us a little bit more

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.600
about your career
path to becoming

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.530
the CEO for the Humane Society?

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.090
Prior to this talk I hadn't
realized that was a role.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.792
And then for both of you,
I want to learn more about

00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:34.250
what are the biggest challenges
that your organizations are

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:39.230
facing, and particularly
what can Googlers do to help.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:44.050
WAYNE PACELLE: I had a
lifelong love of animals.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:48.020
It wasn't just that I liked
having dogs or other animals

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.832
around me, I had a real
empathy for all animals.

00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:52.290
I mean, I didn't
want animals to be

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.600
harmed if they were
whales in the ocean

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.360
or wolves in a national park.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.250
And I wrote a book five
years ago called "The Bond",

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.120
where I argue that we humans
have an instinctive connection

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.550
to other creatures.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.930
That's built into us.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.220
If you look at our human
history, 99% of our history

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.970
was that tribal societies
and hunters and gatherers

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.960
and we were immersed in nature.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.150
And today we live in these
urban and suburban environments

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.230
where we're disconnected,
at some level,

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.220
from some aspects of nature.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.780
But we bring it into our world
in the form of pet keeping,

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.550
and we also go and
enjoy it in terms

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.630
of visiting parks and
other places where

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.590
we can experience nature.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.840
So animals were always
part of my outlook

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.460
and I always wanted
to do right by them.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.750
When I was a kid growing up I
had no idea about the many ways

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.670
that we exploit
animals, especially

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.750
on a large scale,
institutionalized scales.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.860
And I decided when I was a
college student that I didn't

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.227
want to be a bystander anymore.

00:38:53.227 --> 00:38:55.560
I saw what was happening with
factory farming and trophy

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.935
hunting and these
other problems,

00:38:56.935 --> 00:38:58.940
and I said I got to
do something about it.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.530
So I started as a grassroots
advocate and I just

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.130
volunteered, and one
thing led to another,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.910
and I started
writing in the field.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.370
And then I've been
just kind of moving up,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.110
and it's been a real
privilege to serve at HSUS.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:19.390
I've been CEO for 11 years,
and it's a life passion for me.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.470
And there was no-- I'm
not a nonprofit management

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.590
executive that's moving
in different sectors.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.870
I'm wanting to stop animal
cruelty in the world,

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.390
basically.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.790
JOSH TETRICK: Joanna, you
asked a question about how

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.750
Google could help, right?

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.267
I'll throw out something,
and there's always

00:39:39.267 --> 00:39:41.850
an opportunity here when you're
in front of intelligent people

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.490
to hopefully do a
little bit more good.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.120
I can think of a couple ways.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.540
One is we're lucky to have
Jessica as an advisor investor

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.300
to the company.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.760
And Jessica here at Google
has her own particular set

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.410
of skills and communications
and strategic communications

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:03.480
and marketing and
branding and leadership.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.390
And she helps us.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.622
What are yours?

00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:11.010
You particular skills,
whether it's in data science,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.080
whether it's in
hardcore analytics,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.850
whether it's in graphic
design, whether it's in food.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.860
You and your skills can help
entrepreneurs understand

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.280
where they're going,
whether as a volunteer,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.670
whether as an advisor.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.150
You and your skills can
help nonprofit organizations

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.760
that we can talk more about even
outside of the Humane Society

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.380
open up the humane
economy even more.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.810
Your money can be used if you
believe in the human economy.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.240
You believe in
these common values

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.220
that we share can be used
to instigate legislation

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.950
that is supportive of animals.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.380
So those are a few
ways I think now

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.480
that when you think
about very concrete ways,

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.130
if you believe this,
and it's hard not to,

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.550
you can bring your
energy to bear

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.070
and hopefully do a
little bit more good.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.250
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah, don't
leave it up to us, right?

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.810
We all have a role
to play in society.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.750
And you said it
beautifully, Josh.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.090
Tap into your special talents,
tap into your passions.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:13.330
We want to find a place for
you at HSUS to work with us,

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:17.480
whether it's one hour a
month or 10 hours a week--

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.440
whatever it is.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.170
But I think you also
hit on it, that we

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.860
are voting for and
against animal cruelty,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.840
for and against sustainability
with our dollars

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.950
in the marketplace
every single day.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.880
We've got to be
conscious consumers.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.400
The reason that so many
companies and cosmetics

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.750
and food are changing
is because they're now

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.150
registering that sentiment
that exists in the marketplace,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.560
saying, hey, we've got
to change because people

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.220
are figuring this out.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:49.110
So the more we can add people
to that mass consumer movement,

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.810
the stronger we're going
to be, the easier our job

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.340
is going to be.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.240
JOSH TETRICK: We got we
got two minutes left.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.870
I'm going to give you
a curve ball here.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.270
Not to ask you a question
about the humane economy,

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:08.380
necessarily, but I think
the depth of where it comes.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.930
From you mentioned
a book that you've

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.140
written about five
years ago, "The Bond."

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.600
And if you haven't read it,
you should check it out.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.940
It talks about,
in many ways also,

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.870
the science of our
connections with animals, too.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.870
There is a passage
about mirror neurons.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.680
I remember the book, this young
boy was playing with his puppy.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.860
And you were talking about
how the synapses were

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.770
dancing with each other.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.040
And this idea that there's
this common bond that we

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.030
have to animals, not just a
dog, not just a cat, but even

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.950
chickens that we
can't see, I think

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:49.700
it feels to me like this
undergirdness, this foundation,

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.327
upon which the humane
economy was born.

00:42:52.327 --> 00:42:53.160
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.785
JOSH TETRICK: Maybe
you can just end it

00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:57.610
with a little bit--
what is that about,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:02.520
and how central is that
fundamental principle?

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.680
WAYNE PACELLE: I think that our
concern and interest in animals

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.230
is not just a social construct,
it's something that's part

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.110
of us, that we;re drawn to
animals like a moth is drawn

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.270
to a flame.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.160
And I think the
importance of this, Josh,

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.350
is that we don't need to invent
a social concern for animals.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:23.720
This instinctive impulse that
we have gives us a head start.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.230
It's not the final word, though.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.220
I mean we've got to figure out
this crazy society that we live

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.020
in, and all of these
problems that intersect

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.570
with our daily lives and kind
of disentangle it, and then

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.680
individually do
what we can and then

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.530
support groups
and companies that

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:41.950
are trying to solve these
problems on a macro level.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:49.020
So I think that an informed
group of people in society who

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.880
are really alert to
the problems of animals

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.340
are the ones who are
going to drive the change.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.120
It's always been a
more limited number

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:00.320
of people who have this idea
of a better civil society

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.960
that have carried the
rest of the people long.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.606
And eventually people
say, oh my god,

00:44:04.606 --> 00:44:05.730
of course that makes sense.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.630
And you look back
and you wonder how

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.830
people didn't get it to start.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:15.090
So just weaving from that
to the human economy,

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.590
the central notion
is that we've got

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.070
to marry our business and
our commerce with our values.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.480
When you disassociate them
you get really bad outcomes.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.940
Business is the
bulwark of our society.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.570
It creates jobs and
wealth and gives us

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:34.850
opportunities for recreation
and pleasure and joy.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.550
But in the conduct
of that work it

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.390
should reflect the things that
we care about in our society.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.440
It's not this separate sphere
where we generate profits.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.810
It's the place we generate
profits and create

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.010
opportunities for people
and live by the principles

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.690
that all of us care about.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.532
So thank you very much
for participating.

00:44:53.532 --> 00:44:54.740
JOSH TETRICK: You bet, Wayne.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.315
WAYNE PACELLE: Thanks for
your incredible leadership.

00:44:56.315 --> 00:44:57.890
JOSH TETRICK: I'm
honored to be here.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:02.530
And I'll end it with the
humane economy isn't just

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.190
living in Wayne's book.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.100
It's actually in the
food that you eat.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.720
In some of the folks
in the audience.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.340
Thanks to Jessica for lending
her talents to Hampton Creek.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.650
It's in the leaders like Joshua
[? Bock ?] who has really

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.120
spearheaded a lot of
corporate welfare change

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.860
with Humane Society
of the United States.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.360
It's with folks who work
at my company who've

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.690
helped put this together.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.020
It with Bon Appetite,
the food service company

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.140
that helps to provide your food.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.150
It is becoming systemic, and
I think that is exciting.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.950
And that gives me hope
and it's in you, man.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.742
And always proud to be
standing next to you

00:45:37.742 --> 00:45:40.325
and always excited to see what
you're going to do next, Wayne.

00:45:40.325 --> 00:45:42.060
And thank you to
everyone on Livestream.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:42.550
WAYNE PACELLE: Yeah,
thank you everybody.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:43.360
JOSH TETRICK: Thank
you for hanging out.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.251
And get yourself a signed copy
of his book before you leave,

00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:46.750
too.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:47.370
Thanks, my friend.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.970
