00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.090
All right, Sam, we've got the beginnings of a festival app.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.170
&gt;&gt; And so far, we're keeping track of the festivals.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.800
&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; the attendees, and the stages.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; Stages.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is good.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.665
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:11.306
&gt;&gt; But I want more.

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:11.580
[LAUGH]

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.150
What do we do next?

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's add some complexity into the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.660
app by going into SalesForce but, I mean, as we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.460
adding in more objects and relationships, it might become

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.360
a little bit hazy as to how they're actually related.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.850
&gt;&gt; And so let's use this new tool called Schema Builder,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.180
which is an easy way for you to not only build

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.170
your data model, but also visual see it, and how everything's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.940
related together. kind of similar to what we saw earlier on the tablet

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.100
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.530
Just click on the Setup link, and then go on

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.660
the left-hand side, down the Setup Tree to find Schema Builder.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; 'Kay, well, there's a lot going on. What are

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.020
these, like Content, Activity, what are all these other objects?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.080
&gt;&gt; All of these are, all of the objects

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.960
that you have within your Schema. And so these

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.800
are the standard objects that we're not even using

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.120
in addition to the Festival stuff we've already built.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.430
&gt;&gt; You can see on the left-hand

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.500
side, under the Objects, that you can individually

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.750
select which objects you want to see. And the reason you'd want to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.330
see them is you can view all of the different fields, the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.180
relationships between these tables, everything that you might want to see around

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.660
your schema, this is kind of like the blueprint of your account.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I just hit Clear All, and all I

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.150
really care about is attendee, like stage and festival for now. Right?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.600
&gt;&gt; That's the stuff we've built, and let me zoom in. So, now that this is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.610
a little less of a disaster, and I just have these

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.410
three things selected. This is pretty awesome. So, we have festival

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.090
here and I can move it around if I want. and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.910
then these little, little line

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.610
things that are apparently Master-Detail relationships.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you can see that festivals

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
are related to attendees and stages. And looking

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.010
at that little fork you can see that

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.144
a festival can have many attendees for many stages

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:49.293
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:50.293
&gt;&gt;

00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:49.550
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.970
Being this little like three, these three things on the side here?

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that little triangle thing at the end.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.060
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay, so this has, this is great.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.030
This is a visual way to understand my schema.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And, as you data model get's more

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.790
complicated, it will allow you to visualize it really easily.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.310
But, in addition to that, you can add fields

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.500
in yourself or create more relationships straight from Schema builder.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I can just, like I could add a band object

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.070
right now?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.120
&gt;&gt; You could. You know, why don't you try that out; see if you can do it.
