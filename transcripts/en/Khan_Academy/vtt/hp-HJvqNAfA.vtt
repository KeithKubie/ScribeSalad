00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:04.076
- [Voiceover] You have two
fractions, 1/4 and 5/6,

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.213
and you want to rewrite
them so they have the same

00:00:06.213 --> 00:00:10.671
denominator, and have
whole number numerators.

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:13.863
What numbers could you
use for the denominator?

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:17.116
So here's our fractions, 1/4 and 5/6,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.559
and we want to rewrite these fractions

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.642
to have new denominators.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.236
So we currently have a four
and a six as our denominator,

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:27.796
and can we just put any new thing,

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:29.330
like maybe five, could we say,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.201
"Let's change them both to
have five as the denominator."

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:33.852
The answer is no.

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:37.950
We have to pick a multiple
of four and six, a multiple,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.033
some number that we can multiply four

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.230
and get this number as an answer.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.397
So, for example, for four,

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:53.708
so multiples of four would
be four times one is four,

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:58.185
four times two is eight,
four times three is twelve,

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:01.352
and so on, those are multiples of four

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:03.782
and let's just pause here

00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:08.152
and look at why we have to pick
a multiple of four and six,

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:09.825
why we can't just pick any number,

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:14.744
but we have to pick a
multiple of our denominators.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.761
So the fraction we were
just talking about was 1/4.

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:20.442
We could look at either
one, but let's look at 1/4.

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:24.609
Here we have a picture showing
fourths, and to show 1/4,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.640
we shade one of these
four equal size pieces.

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:32.951
Well, maybe I want to change this

00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:36.949
and I want to say I want two,
I want two as my numerator.

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:39.449
So to have a numerator of two,

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:45.220
I'm gonna need to split this
fourth up here into two pieces.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.338
Now I have two shaded pieces.

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:51.096
So can I say this is two, one, two, out of

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:54.083
one, two, three, four, five pieces?

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.065
It's not 2/5 because these
are not equal size pieces.

00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:00.858
So if I split this fourth
right here in half,

00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:03.020
I need to split all of them in half,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.187
and what I'm doing is
doubling the amount of pieces.

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:14.326
So now this is two pieces,
this is two, and this is two

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:17.035
because we need equal size pieces.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.503
So now, this is one, two pieces

00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:23.450
out of one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.943
equal size pieces, so 2/8

00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:30.315
and you can see, eight
is a multiple of four

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.512
because we multiplied by
two and that's what we did,

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:36.493
we multiplied each of our pieces by two

00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:38.711
and we also multiplied
our numerator by two

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:40.517
because that was also doubled.

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:42.627
The amount of shaded pieces doubled

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:45.605
when the entire amount of pieces doubled

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:47.323
and we don't have to
do this just with two,

00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:48.958
we could do any multiple of four.

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.041
For example, we can do one more here.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.094
If we, again, let's shade 1/4,

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:01.433
one of the four pieces

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.593
and maybe this time we
want to split it into

00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:06.593
three equal size pieces.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.479
So to have a new numerator of three,

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.330
and these should be equal sized,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.663
here's a numerator of three,

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:20.626
but it's, we can't do our denominator yet

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:23.239
because we don't have equal size pieces,

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.352
so to get equal size pieces,

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:29.519
we'll need to split each of
these fourths into three.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.313
So we are tripling the amount of pieces.

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:39.226
So now we have three shaded pieces

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:42.752
out of a total of one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:46.252
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, out of 12,

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.030
and I could have figured that
out without even counting

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.447
because I knew that we tripled this time,

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:58.633
we multiplied our original
denominator times three,

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.636
we tripled, and we also multiplied
our numerator times three

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.638
so these are the multiples,
eight, 12, and so on

00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:10.931
and so those are the
denominators we can pick.

00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.522
Something that we can
multiply our denominator by

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:19.355
so we can multiply the
entire amount of pieces

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:22.458
and again, so this is super clear,

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:27.405
1/4 and 2/8 and 3/12, they
all represent the same amount,

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:31.258
whether we had 1/4, the
original, here's 2/8, 3/12,

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:34.801
they're all equivalent, they
all represent the same amount,

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:39.320
they're just different ways
of writing the same number.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.961
Back to our original question,

00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:45.128
what denominators can we use
for fourths and for sixths?

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.498
Well, we know we need to use multiples,

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:50.312
so let's look at the multiples.

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:53.651
For four, we've already
gone through some of these.

00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:57.582
The first multiple of four is
four times one which is four,

00:04:57.582 --> 00:05:00.938
second multiple of four is
eight, four times two is eight,

00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:04.815
so we could split our fourths
into, in half and get eighths

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:08.716
or we could say four
times three is twelve,

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:11.003
which we showed again
where we split our fourths,

00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:13.870
each fourth into three equal pieces

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.310
or we could do four
times four which is 16,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.477
four times five is 20, four
times six is 24, and so on.

00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:25.995
The reason I'm stopping at 24

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:28.452
is I've looked at my answer choices

00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:31.512
and I can see the largest
possible answer is 24

00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:34.070
so I don't need to write
any larger multiples.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.457
There are many, many, many
more multiples of four,

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:38.726
but we don't need to list them all

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:39.779
because the largest number

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.331
we're gonna have to consider is 24.

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.578
Let's do the same for six.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:48.699
We could leave our six
alone, six times one,

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.856
and keep six pieces, or
we could double our six,

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:53.543
six times two would be 12,

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:56.610
if we doubled the pieces
we would have 12 pieces.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.790
We could say six times three, which is 18,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.277
or six times four, we could divide

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.907
each of our sixths into four pieces

00:06:03.907 --> 00:06:06.931
and we'd have six times four which is 24,

00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:09.869
or twenty-fourths and so on.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.086
Again, I'll stop at 24 since it's the

00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:15.784
largest number we need to consider.

00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:17.833
So down to our answer choices,

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:20.054
what numbers could we
use for the denominator?

00:06:20.054 --> 00:06:21.810
Could we use eight?

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.620
Let's look at these lists.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.314
Eight is a multiple of four,

00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:29.414
so we could definitely
split fourths into eighths,

00:06:29.414 --> 00:06:31.989
but eight is not a multiple of six,

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:34.789
so we cannot split sixths into eighths,

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.956
so eight will not work as a
denominator for both fractions.

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:43.754
How about 12?

00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:47.035
12, we can see, is a multiple of four,

00:06:47.035 --> 00:06:49.242
and we showed that, we drew that already,

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.943
and 12 is a multiple of six,

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:53.416
we could split our sixths
into two equal pieces each

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:55.391
and we would have twelfths.

00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:59.216
So 12 does work, 12 is a denominator,

00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:03.638
a common denominator
for fourths and sixths.

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.805
18, 18 is here on the sixths,
we could split sixths into 18

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.584
because 18 is a multiple of six,

00:07:10.584 --> 00:07:15.383
but it is not a multiple of
four, so we can rule out 18.

00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:20.172
18 is not a common denominator
and 24, you may remember,

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.703
was the last number we
wrote on both of them

00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:26.870
so yes, 24 could be a denominator
for fourths and sixths.

00:07:28.693 --> 00:07:31.405
So we could use either 12 or 24

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:33.527
and there's a lot more
numbers we could use, too,

00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:36.217
as common denominators
but from these choices,

00:07:36.217 --> 00:07:38.751
we could use 12 or 24

00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:43.031
as a common denominator
for fourths and sixths

00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:44.685
and just a note, lots of times

00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:46.602
people like to use the smallest one,

00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:50.650
the least common denominator,
which in this case is 12,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.688
and it makes a lot of sense

00:07:51.688 --> 00:07:54.712
because it's easier to do
computation with smaller numbers

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:58.300
but you don't absolutely
have to use the smallest one.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.794
You could use twelfths
or twenty-fourths or,

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:03.278
or lots of other options, but, again,

00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:06.329
twelfths is probably the
simplest one to work with

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:07.896
just because generally it's easier

00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:10.014
to work with smaller numbers

00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:13.196
but for this question, the
common denominators we can use

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:17.363
from these choices for fourths
and sixths are 12 and 24.
