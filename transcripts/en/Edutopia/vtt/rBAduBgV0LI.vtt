00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:12.876
&gt;&gt;In 2002 we started off first
with nine middle schools, sort of--

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:14.456
we call them "Exploration Schools".

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:18.986
The fall of 2002 we went statewide,
every single seventh grader

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:23.546
in Maine had a laptop, every single
seventh grade classroom was a

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:29.576
wireless network, north, south,
east, west, rural, urban, statewide.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.866
The next year, seventh and eighth.

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:36.056
The original design of the project
was to phase in a year each year

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:41.446
and go all the way to high school,
then budgets collapsed in 2003, 2004,

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:44.236
so the project essentially
stopped at middle school.

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:49.806
But the good news is it's still
going strong, it was renewed--

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:54.216
it was a four-year lease purchase,
the first project starting in '02,

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.536
so in '06 it was renewed by the
governor and the legislature

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:00.436
without my having to be
there to hound them about it,

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:03.256
they did it because it's worked.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:10.556
And now I think about 20 of our 150
high schools have gone one to one

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:14.396
on their own, and then there's the
middle school project that's still

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:16.116
going on, seventh and eighth grade.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:23.746
It's about 40,000 computers,
36,000 students, 4,000 teachers,

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:31.486
every classroom, and it's turned
out to be better than I thought.

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.686
We thought it was a good idea
back in 2002, in retrospect,

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:38.296
my thinking has gone
through sort of an evolution.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.876
Good idea, then I realized
about the second year

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:46.416
in that it was really a radical idea
because of the changes in pedagogy

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.756
and the approach to
changes in education.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:52.506
It was-- it's a different
kind of teaching and learning.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:56.556
Now, as I'm looking around the
world and seeing what's happening

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.706
with globalization and
the kind of hollowing

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:02.216
out of the American economy,
I think it's a necessary idea.

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:07.956
It has empowered and created a lot
of the things that everybody's been

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.846
after in education for so long.

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.656
You can involve the parents,

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:17.216
if you do the technology
right, you engage the students.

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:22.456
If you ask teachers in Maine for
one word to describe the project,

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:24.166
it's generally "Engagement".

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:28.176
And any teacher will tell you
that if your students are engaged,

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.186
you can teach them anything.

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:32.816
If they're not engaged, you can be
Socrates and not teach them anything.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.136
So engagement has been very powerful,

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.036
involving the students,
individualized learning.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.786
I mean, this is a list of, you know,
what everybody's chasing in education

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:45.066
and have been for 100 years.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.866
It really seems to be happening.

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:51.306
The laptops allow a
level of connection

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.666
and engagement in real stuff.

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:57.346
Searching out-- for example,
there's a program in Maine

00:02:57.346 --> 00:03:03.406
where they use the laptops to analyze
water data or invasive species and,

00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:05.336
you know, they're acting
like scientists.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:10.916
And that's real and it has a
kind of intrinsic interest that--

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:15.426
particularly for kids that
aren't, you know, all that linear,

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.086
and I mean, if you think about it,

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:19.636
our education system is really
designed for certain kids.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:23.726
And there are kids who
are very bright, but who--

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:27.696
that's just not the system
that they're gonna be--

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:29.806
they're not going to
shine in that system.

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:33.446
And the laptops are enabling kids
to do all kinds of different ways

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:38.526
to present what they're doing,
and that's one of the strengths.

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:43.246
It allows a kind of individualization
that is impossible if it's "Okay,

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.976
everybody write five paragraphs."

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:47.286
One of the things I've learned

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:50.376
from this is execution is
as important as vision.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:55.346
You can have a great idea that makes
sense, and everybody says "Aha!"

00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:00.076
But if it's not executed right,
if the network doesn't work,

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:05.396
if the computers crash
or if the teachers--

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:08.876
the biggest learning is if the
teachers aren't properly prepared

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:12.616
in a lot of professional development,
it just isn't going to work.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.776
We're now trying to build
on what we've learned

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:18.816
and really take the professional
development to the next level,

00:04:19.156 --> 00:04:20.696
that's the biggest part of it.

00:04:21.106 --> 00:04:24.876
If you hand out the laptops and don't
do the professional development,

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:27.246
it's going to fail,
there's just no question.

00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:29.986
It's not as expensive
as people think.

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:34.186
In Maine our project-- we can
put real, hard numbers on it,

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:38.336
it's nine million dollars a year
for every seventh and eighth grader

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.276
in the state, plus professional
development, tech support

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.276
and network, that's
the whole package.

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:46.946
And that represents about
four-tenths of one percent

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:48.916
of our annual school
budget in the state.

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:52.286
So we're talking about
one-half of one percent,

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.976
it's not a massive program, nine
million out of over two billion.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:05:01.296
And when you look at it that
way, in terms of its impact

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:05.336
and potential impact, how long
do you have to think about that?

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:08.436
I mean, if I came to you at the
school board and said "I'm going

00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:09.396
to give you something that's going

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:11.896
to significantly improve
writing scores",

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:14.646
which everybody's interested in, we
can talk about that in a few minutes,

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:17.686
but it's also going to
decrease discipline problems,

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:22.346
increase attendance and
provide your students

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:26.616
with true 21st century skills and
it's going to cost about the same

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:31.376
as your snowplowing budget, it seems
to me it's pretty hard to say "No".

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:35.416
&gt;&gt;What I tell people is don't
promise standardized test scores

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:39.346
because the tests don't
test what the laptops teach.

00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:45.626
We're doing 1980s testing when
we want 21st century skills.

00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:50.096
Solving problems, collaboration
and use of information,

00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:55.906
that's what the laptops teach, but
the testing, the standardized testing

00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.056
that we're doing is
testing, you know,

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.356
"When did Columbus discover
America" and, you know,

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:00.936
"What's eight times seventeen"?

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:06.376
And so there's a mismatch here,
and that's why I think maybe

00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:09.136
at some point we'll be able to
design tests that really test,

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:11.456
you know, 21st century skills.

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.926
So that's why I tell people don't
promise standardized test scores

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:17.426
and you've just gotta
calm the politicians down,

00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:21.116
because all they want is test
scores, and there's a heck

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.016
of a lot more than that at stake.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.336
