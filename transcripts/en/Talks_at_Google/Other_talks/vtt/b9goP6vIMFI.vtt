00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Join me in welcoming
to Google, Jane Espenson.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.180
[applause]

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.180
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Thank you.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
This is fun.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.039
I like being here at Google.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.759
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: OK, I'm gonna take you
back.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.759
Back.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:16.759
[laughter]

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:17.759
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Doodoodoodoo.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:18.759
It's all blurry.

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:19.759
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Pre 1992.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.759
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh no, OK.

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:21.759
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So what were you doing
then?

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.759
You were in linguistics.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:23.759
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I was in grad school.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:24.759
I was in college from '82 to '92.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.759
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Right.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.759
[laughs]

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.510
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: You've hit the archaeological
level that is my college years.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.900
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And what were you working
on there?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.830
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I was working on cognitive
science.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.500
So, I started in computer science added linguistics
as a double major as an undergrad and then

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.750
realized, "Hey, linguistics plus computer
science equals cognitive science," which you

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.579
can tell isn't a science because it has the
word science in it.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.579
[laughter]

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.899
And spent five years doing that in grad school
with George Lakoff.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.229
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: OK.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.480
So, you went to reality and became a writer.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.889
So, is there anything about your past like,
'82 to '92 about conceptualization of causation

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.290
and metaphors that has informed your work?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.560
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I ask myself about that.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.060
For one thing, I needed those years to grow
up.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.750
So, my pseudo-maturity is a result of those
years.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.690
But certainly, the stuff that I like to write
has a metaphorical layer in it.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.690
I don't--.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.810
I'm not particularly interested in writing
household drama.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.880
I like writing sci-fi.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.340
When I write household drama, I like it to
be something like the show "Dinosaurs" that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.770
I worked on, where it's like it's a normal
American household but they're dinosaurs.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.540
[laughter]

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.940
I find it allows you to speak more honestly
about what's going on in the world.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.250
So, the events on "Battlestar Galactica" could
have taken place on an ordinary aircraft carrier

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.190
on water, but it's much more exciting that
it's an aircraft carrier out in space, in

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.190
space.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.190
[laughter]

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.560
You can speak about both those shows, Dinosaurs
and "Battlestar Galactica" took on middle

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.600
eastern wars as a topic in a way that a show
wouldn't be allowed to if it was like we're

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.910
going to do a show about U.S. soldiers.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.730
So we could switch around who was being the
bad guy in any particular episode.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.410
We could move the morality around a bit or
remove it entirely without there being real

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.910
world implications we could expose the real
world.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.870
And so, the fact that I like that metaphorical
layer, it's probably not so much that grad

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.220
school supplied me with that interest, but
that they were both caused by the same initial

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220
interest in it.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.970
I like the idea of how do we really understand
things.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.840
How do we filter things so that we can grapple
with them?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.340
And that led me both to grad school and to
my interest in sci-fi.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.810
Certainly, my interest in sci-fi predated
grad school.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.580
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So now, I'm skipping
a question because you're bringing up the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580
moral cheat sheet.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.580
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yes.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.580
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And I love that expression.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.110
Not having it in other words.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.410
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.209
This is an idea I had when I went in to speak--.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.280
When you get hired on show they don't just
look at your writing samples and say, "OK.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280
Show up Monday."

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.820
You also have to come in and meet with the
show runner and sometimes that meeting is

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.320
very perfunctory.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.690
They know they like your writing.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.370
They know they're inclined to hire you.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.270
They just want to make sure that you're someone
they can stand being in a room with--that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.270
you're not crazy.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.150
So, I call this the "wear pants" meeting.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.150
[laughter]

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.950
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: If you show up wearing pants
then you're probably OK because they already

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.950
like you.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.450
But sometimes you wanna--.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.530
If you really want the job, you wanna go in
armed with some insight about their show.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.020
So, what I came in with at "Battlestar" was
that I admired that it had no moral cheat

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
sheet.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.090
And Ron, the show runner, leans so far out
in his chair in excitement, I thought he was

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.090
going to fall on the floor.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.780
I was like "OK good, I hit something."

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.591
Yeah, because that's exactly what he had been
going for.

00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.070
For so many shows you know that your hero's
not going to make a bad choice, not going

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.560
to make an immoral choice.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.849
On "Star Trek", for example, this was always
the way.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.480
So, if Picard was advocating this, unless
he'd been body switched you knew that it was

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.709
the right thing to do.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.770
So you could as a viewer sit back and go,
"OK good.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.770
He's doing the right thing."

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.950
You didn't have to think about the choice.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.150
Ron came out of the "Star Trek" world and
then created "Battlestar."

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.820
And I think it was very much a reaction in
his mind that he wanted to tell stories with

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.230
shades of gray that weren't so clear-cut.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.480
And he really loved that I picked up on the
fact that even though we love and respect

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.290
President Roslin, we love and respect Admiral
Adama, doesn't mean they're always right.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.480
You don't have a moral cheat sheet to go,
"Oh, who's making the argument?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
Adama?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480
OK.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
That's the right thing to do."

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
He did--.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.000
Made wrong decisions, immoral decisions all
the time.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Sometimes, they were right and immoral.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.270
Sometimes, they were wrong and immoral.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.650
But you had no way of knowing which one it
was going into the argument.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.680
And often, both sides had their merits and
you just had to go, "Which would I do?"

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680
And it was--.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.440
It makes for a much more involving and participatory
show.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.300
And I've thought a lot about what makes a
cult hit, what makes a show with a fandom

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.270
where, where the fans are so passionate about
a show that they consider themselves a community.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.630
A lot of that has to do with the degree that
they are engaged with the show.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.370
The amount where it feels participatory for
them.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.311
In an argument in which they are not, being
told passively which side to be on but they

00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:35.250
have to actively engage and think about what
side they'd be on.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.020
That's one of the ingredients in the recipe
for cult stardom and "Battlestar's" certainly

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.020
achieved that.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.140
I think that's a big part of why.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.880
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: OK.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.840
So, you prefer writing for TV as opposed to--.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh, yes.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.840
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: OK.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840
Why?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh my god.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840
Movies are awful.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.010
[laughter]
They--.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.990
In TV, we're the boss.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.610
In movies, directors are the boss.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.770
Now that Joss Whedon has gone to movies, what's
he doing?

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.980
He's writing and directing.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.500
Because otherwise you are not even on the
set.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.850
Your script is the launching point for visionaries
to come in and imagine a world and the writers

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.190
work is done on most movies.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.190
I don't care for that.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.160
On TV, we're the bosses, we create the world,
we make the decisions.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.259
A director is hired week by week, they come
in, sometimes they're fantastic sometimes

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.419
they are very visionary.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.080
Sometimes they come back a lot and they become
part of the fabric of the show.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.640
But a lot of times, it's just a guy that comes
in for a week and he has to do what we say.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.990
And if we don't think he's doing it right,
we can fire him.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.990
We have the power.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.000
We sit there on the set.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.259
Technically, if I want to give a note to an
actor, I'm supposed to tell the director and

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.480
the director gives that note.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.280
But usually we're sitting in a chair just
like this and I look over and there's an actor

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.979
right here saying, "How should I say this?

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.050
What did you mean by this or can I do this?"

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.919
And I'm just giving them direct instructions.

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.370
You'd never have that on a feature set.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.070
Also, features never have to get made.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.360
There's no machine demanding that, "Well,
we've got a time slot.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.910
You said September third; we gotta put it
on the air.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.170
We gotta send it out."

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.750
Then stuff gets shoved it gets moved, they
make new decisions.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.020
A new head of studio comes in all those things
are sidelined.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.650
Cabin in the Woods has been done for years.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.301
You know, Joss's amazing new movie.

00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:28.550
And it's coming out now.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.050
Luckily it is still fresh as a freshly cut
thing.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.330
[laughter]

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.330
Because it's amazing.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.539
It doesn't show the delay but delays happen.

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.979
TV is a monster that eats every week, you
need to get stuff on the air.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.720
So I have had six episodes in the last year.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.979
I had six episodes of "Once Upon A Time".

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:51.979
Eleven episodes of "Husbands."

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:57.470
My "Game of Thrones", I guess, was in this
last year.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.470
Just--.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.229
And some other stuff I wrote that hasn't aired
yet for secret projects.

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:08.250
Or you could end up with something ten episodes
eleven, whatever, a year.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.120
Whereas a feature writer can go four years
working on a project and nothing hits the

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.620
screen and maybe never will.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.319
Nonsense.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.330
Come to TV.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.330
[laughter]

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.770
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So you mention "Game of
Thrones."

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.770
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.090
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And the scene to me that
is the most horrific is that golden crown.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.840
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oooo [laughs]

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840
[laughter]

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.900
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And you mentioned in one
of the interviews I watched-- I watched many

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.690
this weekend-- that you don't write in sequence
necessarily.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.270
Can you talk about that?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.270
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:43.159
I find that I wanna write the scenes that
I can most strongly visualize first.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.890
And these are usually two person emotional
scenes in which people are sitting down and

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:48.890
talking.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.110
And every script's got some of those.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.399
And they usually are the scenes that make
you cry, that make you feel, and they are

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.399
delicate little scenes.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:01.680
But they are also often the ones you have
most clearly in your head when you sit down

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.050
to work.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.050
And you're not--.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:10.220
You don't have a lot of considerations in
your mind other than pulling the emotion out.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.330
You're not worried about the geography and
who spoke last.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.370
"Is that person been standing silent in the
corner for two pages?"

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.370
Like they're--.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.270
I tend to go to those first.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.130
And those tend to give you a pretty good place
to aim at.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.860
Like, you've gotta get the characters to the
emotional states such that they can have that

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.350
heart to heart talk.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:38.040
The last scenes I tend to write are action
and great big group scenes where you've got

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.170
seven people in the scene.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.740
Just because there are so many moving parts.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.550
There is so much architecture to figure out.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.010
Like--.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.430
And they're often procedurally scenes.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.920
All you need to know about the fight is who
won because that's what drives you into the

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920
next scene.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.110
So, you can kind of skip that for now.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.899
"Oh, there's a fight and Buffy will win it."

00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:58.899
[laughter]

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:02.320
I'll go back later and figure out what she
stabs him with.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.320
[laughs]

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320
[laughter]

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.330
But I'm not going to waste brainpower on that
right now when I've still got the big emotional

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.330
moment to write.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.820
So, I tend to write out of order.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.070
A lot of authors don't.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.440
A lot of TV writers just go front to back.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.140
On "Game of Thrones", that was totally weird
because it was pre-existing material.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.060
It was an adaptation.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.310
So, I was literally told, the scene, your
episode will go from this page number to that

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.310
page number.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.920
So, the first thing I did was go to the book,
look at the scenes, transcribe George R.R

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.180
Martin's dialogue and start messing with it
from there.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.500
Because you know the amount of scene that's,
the amount of dialogue that's in one of his

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:46.140
scenes could fill ten pages and it needs to
fill two and a half for the scene.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.130
So, you've gotta pick and choose.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.240
So, there's a lot of work to be done but the--.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.180
All those pivot points, all those big things
are there.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.580
In a certain sense, everything is equal importance
when someone has already done the heavy lifting

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.280
and working out the heartbreak.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.120
So that, I think, I really wrote that one
less out of order than anything I've ever

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.650
written because the plowing of the field had
been done.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.570
I was just going along planting in the furrows.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.570
[laughter]

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.690
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Remember that one.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.690
[laughter]

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.380
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I just thought of that.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.610
That's pretty good.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.610
[laughter]

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.300
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Well, Spike was one of
my favorite characters.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.690
Buffy and I like Rumpelstiltskin now, too
a lot.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.720
Do you have characters?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.709
Someone you like writing for?

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.370
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.470
Rumple has been amazing because can't go too
far.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:39.550
I've never dealt with a character who is so
gloriously over the top.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.750
Spike was amazing to write for.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.750
The--.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:49.400
Even though I don't in real life like bad
boys, they're fun to write for.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.959
Anya I loved writing for because she's so
blunt.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:57.800
And in a way, she was super easy 'cause you
just had to write what she was thinking, or

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.940
to say what she was thinking.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.079
But in another way, it was like finding the
funny thing that she's thinking was more of

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.160
a challenge.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.779
I love that.

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.589
Willow and all those "Buffy" characters had
such distinct voices.

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:10.589
They were all fun to write for.

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:12.890
I liked writing Giles.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.089
Learned an interesting lesson writing Giles.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:16.220
We were all--.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220
We were--.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.870
Season Three, there was a whole new crop of
writers and we were all getting used to writing

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.230
these characters that already existed.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.510
I was new.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.649
The show had been around for two years.

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:30.600
And another writer and I were talking about
coming up with British-isms for Giles, making

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.430
sure he sounded British.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.220
And Joss pointed out, [coughs] "He sounds
British 'cause he's British."

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.010
"You don't have-- it's not a novel, you have
to use the language to convey to the audience

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.010
that he's British.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.640
He's going to be British no matter what you
write."

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640
[laughter]

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.579
"So, you don't have to work so hard to make
sure he's saying biscuit in every scene."

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:55.010
[laughter]

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.230
"Just let him talk and he'll bring the Brit
with him."

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.579
And that was a huge lesson.

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:05.070
You forget the difference between writing
for a short story and writing for a screenplay

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.519
sometimes, even if you've been doing it a
long time.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.980
But I loved writing--.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.980
"Torchwood" was great.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.250
I got to write--speaking of British stuff--
I got to write all the linguistic confusion

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.170
of these Brits in the United States dealing
with, "What do you mean by vest?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.170
"What do you mean by pants?

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.620
Why are there so many kinds of milk in the
grocery store?"

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.200
There were just great little cultural things
that were really fun to put in.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.600
And writing for Captain Jack and for Gwen
were great.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.240
I've just been really lucky that I've written
for about 15 characters that I could point

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240
at and say Starbuck.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.680
Oh, my God.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:47.590
And getting to write for Starbuck, amazing.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:52.370
Oh, and seriously Lannister, Peter Dinklage,
Tyrion.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.850
Oh, my God.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:59.470
Could there be a clearer more charming and
amoral but moral?

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.269
I don't know.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:02.350
Great, great voices.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.920
I've been very lucky.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.770
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: That's quite a list.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.770
[laughter]

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.770
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I know, yeah, you try to
pick one.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.770
[laughs] Who do you think?

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.770
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: You've got me thinking.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.770
I like all of them.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.621
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah, if you could write
all of those, which one would you want to

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:14.621
write?

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:15.621
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Goodness.

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:16.621
Can I come back to that?

00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:17.621
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah, OK.

00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:18.621
[laughter]

00:14:18.621 --> 00:14:19.621
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: I want to turn to "Husbands"
now.

00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:20.621
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.621
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So, that's quite brave
of you.

00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:22.621
You did that--

00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:23.621
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I was terrified.

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:24.621
&gt;&gt;Female Espenson: and you paid for that,
too.

00:14:24.621 --> 00:14:26.170
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah that--.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.200
Season One was entirely out of pocket.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.050
Season Two, the fans have put in 50K.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.370
I'm gonna match that 50K.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.600
And we're hoping that there may even be some
sponsor money or something coming in because

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.300
we wanna do it that much better.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:51.720
We wanna upgrade the cameras, get the red
cameras and get better sound, better locations.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.180
We were shooting in a friend's house for Season
One and we had to often choose the take that

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.000
didn't have the cat noises in it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[laughter]

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.760
Because there were two pissed off cats locked
in the bathroom of that house while we were

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760
shooting.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.760
[laughter]

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.430
And so, there's a lot of takes that just have
this Mrooowwww.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.430
[laughter]

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:16.700
We said we want to rent a house where we can
go and have a genuine production at place.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.980
It turns out, renting a house that these two
guys would have in L.A. is a substantial amount

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980
of money.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.600
We wanna get guest stars and real--.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.089
You wouldn't believe where the money goes--
production insurance, stuff you don't even

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:33.220
think about.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.670
It's like, "Oh, that's how many thousand?"

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.079
So, it was very brave.

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:41.520
Thank you for noticing.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.600
Yeah, I was scared to death Season One.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.339
Now Season Two, I'm going in like, "I know
the product turned out well for Season One.

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:52.110
We did not fall on our face."

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:57.000
We did not end up with things that I was,
I was terrified that we'd get a call like,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.980
"Oh we had a glitch; the digital files are
gone.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.930
We didn't get day two of shooting."

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:02.959
That would have killed us.

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:04.660
We wouldn't have been able to do anything.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.899
We didn't have the location anymore.

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.660
We couldn't have gone back and re-shot.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.130
We just would have been lost.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.420
So, I just was just trembling with fear every
day.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.490
Now, going in knowing , "OK, I've seen it
work once," we can do this.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.570
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Shall we show people?

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.570
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.380
You guys wanna see a little of Season One
of "Husbands?"

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.940
I'm very, very proud of it.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940
[laughter]

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.940
[applause]

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.470
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: These are scenes picked
for Googlers.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.639
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: So, they're very, very short,
little mini episodes.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:30.769
I'm gonna show you two episodes.

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.029
Episode 2 and Episode 11.

00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:37.490
The basic storyline is, these two guys haven't
been dating very long, they go to Las Vegas,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.550
they wake up drunk, married.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.970
And they're high enough profile that they've
gotta deal with, what are the implications

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.180
of getting a divorce?

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.190
So, this is Episode 2.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.290
This is, they have just woken up in the Las
Vegas bathroom and they have noticed they

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.570
are wearing wedding rings.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.449
So, this is their--.

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:54.449

No we're too famous for something this fucked
up to happen.

Nah, It's too long for a headline.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.110
See this is why I am an actor not a writer.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.110
&gt;&gt; Brady Kelly: Jesus.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.110
We're going to look bad.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.239
And we're going to make the cause look bad.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:27.029
And we're gonna look bad.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:29.979
&gt;&gt; Cheeks: People already kinda expect this
sort of nonsense from me.

00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:32.059
&gt;&gt; Brad Kelly: We can't be married.

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:36.039
They're novelty rings in exchange in the spirit
of high camp such as we gays are known for.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:38.620
&gt;&gt; Cheeks: Satirical performance pop art.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.169
&gt;&gt; Brad Kelly: Yes.

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:43.539
We celebrated marriage equality by getting
fake married Vegas style.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:46.729
Which is hilarious because we've only dated
six weeks.

00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:49.769
&gt;&gt; Cheeks: And for two of those I couldn't
stand you.

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:50.769
&gt;&gt; Brad Kelly: What?

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:54.879
And we know it's fake because if we got real
married we need a license, and I don't see

00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:56.289

It's notarized.

to know what you're doing.

00:22:18.739 --> 00:22:22.340
&gt;&gt; male#1: In general how does writing for
a TV series work?

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.809
For example, between the credited screenwriter
for that episode, and the more permanent creative

00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:28.239
team running the show?

00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:31.759
Who's responsible for which decisions, and
how do they work together?

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:36.110
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Great, great question.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.950
You work in a room.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:44.369
Every day I go to work and I go to a room
and it's full of funny people, and we sit

00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:46.720
there and we break an episode.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.559
So, we know what episode's coming up next.

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:52.929
We know the story, general story usually that
we wanna tell in it.

00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:53.929
And it becomes--.

00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:56.799
It comes down to the show runner guiding a
discussion.

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:59.880
In my current show, "Once Upon a Time" we
have twin show runners.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.059
Not really, they're partners and they run
the show together.

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:07.730
And so they will say, "Ok we wanna do a Cinderella
story this week.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.429
And we sort of figure it's probably about
this."

00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:13.450
First thing we talk about is, what's the theme
of it?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.049
What are we trying to say with this episode?

00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:18.099
That's really important.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:23.919
Shows that don't start out there often sort
of fail to get one of the important ingredients

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.009
in making a cult hit.

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:29.230
Which is, that people have to feel that there's
a reason to watch it.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.830
That there's a reason to tell the stories.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:37.000
So, start with theme, and it could be as simple
as love conquers all.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.700
Doesn't have to be deep, but it has to be
real.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.899
Has to be something you really believe.

00:23:41.899 --> 00:23:45.279
And then, you start figuring out "Ok well
what's going to happen to her?

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:49.470
We think she's gonna come up against this
bad guy, and we think at the end she'll be

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.549
in this place."

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:53.570
And you start working it out by act breaks.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.789
Act breaks are the moments that go into each
commercial.

00:23:55.789 --> 00:24:00.399
There always used to be four acts in a TV
show.

00:24:00.399 --> 00:24:02.520
Now we're up to six.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.200
There's been some act inflation 'cause then
they get more commercial breaks.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.489
So, you've gotta figure out a story that can
turn that many times.

00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:17.330
So, stories have actually gotten perhaps a
little shallower in the last few years because

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.330
you have to--.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.369
You're just getting your feet under you in
an act and you've gotta turn the story.

00:24:21.369 --> 00:24:24.340
You've gotta come up with that big dramatic
"Hey this isn't what we thought.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.179
You have to do it more often."

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:30.519
If you work on a show, like "Game of Thrones"
you don't have to do that because you don't

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:33.659
have commercial breaks so it's very different.

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:34.659
But--.

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:38.210
So, the show runner's responsibility is guiding
that discussion.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:44.519
At a certain point, you've filled up a white
board with all the details of all the scenes

00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:46.129
that are going to go in this episode.

00:24:46.129 --> 00:24:48.840
In which order and which ones are right before
act breaks.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.309
And at a certain point, you declare it broken.

00:24:52.309 --> 00:24:54.090
Which means it's fixed.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.350
[laughter]

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.350
And someone--.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.099
One of the writers is sent home to write it.

00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:04.609
That's when that writer, that writer's had
a responsibility of participating in the room,

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:11.590
pitching ideas, pitching lines, like saying
things as little as " I think he should put

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.849
cinnamon in his coffee."

00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:17.210
It was a big discussion early on, of whether
characters should bond over something they

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.889
don't like in the coffee shop or something
they do like in the coffee shop.

00:25:20.889 --> 00:25:22.899
It's a tiny, tiny point.

00:25:22.899 --> 00:25:25.419
But that you know your contribution could
be that small.

00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:29.820
Or, you could have said, "Actually I don't
think this is the week to do Cinderella because

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.349
I just had an idea that is a whole different
idea."

00:25:33.349 --> 00:25:39.549
So, you participated in the room, but your
work to me really starts when you're sent

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:45.179
home and you've got this beat sheet, this
list of the scenes and what's going to happen

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:46.179
in each of them.

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:52.019
And you have to turn that around and come
back with a 52-page document with every decision

00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:55.659
filled in, every line of dialogue written.

00:25:55.659 --> 00:25:57.609
That's your main duty as a writer.

00:25:57.609 --> 00:26:06.019
Now on most shows, writers, particularly higher-level
writers, are also producers, so you theoretically

00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:07.580
you go to the set.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.499
You go to show and tell with the prop guy
and you say, "No, not that cigarette lighter,

00:26:11.499 --> 00:26:12.499
that one."

00:26:12.499 --> 00:26:17.519
And you go to costumes and you say, "I do
not like that hat," or whatever it is that

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:21.539
you're saying, and then you sit on set and
you sit with the director and you say things

00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:24.149
like, "I don't think we got it.

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.599
That performance wasn't quite right."

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:27.849
Whatever.

00:26:27.849 --> 00:26:29.639
But it's very cold.

00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:31.409
The set's a tedious place to be.

00:26:31.409 --> 00:26:36.019
And on our particular show, our set is up
in Vancouver and we don't go up.

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:40.960
So, our job pretty much ends when you turn
in that draft of the script.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.590
So, the prod--.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.169
The executive producers, though, have to be
worried about everything.

00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:48.789
They have to fly up to Vancouver and look
at the hats.

00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:53.029
They have to deal with the manager of the
actor that's calling.

00:26:53.029 --> 00:27:01.149
They have to talk with ABC marketing about
the posters and what gift they are going to

00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:02.659
give at Comicon.

00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:10.019
And whether they should be inviting the press
in to talk to them about the mid-season episode.

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:16.200
They're deciding lots and lots of stuff that
has nothing to do with the, what's the next

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.710
line or dialogue in the script.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.940
This is the reason I really like being a writer.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.029
I don't know, does that answer your questions
about the different responsibilities?

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:27.349
'Cause there's a lot of different other ways--.

00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:31.940
Oh I can also talk about younger writers versus
more experiences writers.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.779
When you're hired, you're hired as a staff
writer.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:38.499
Built into your contract is a series of promotions.

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:43.740
Your next season you will be a story editor
even though you're not editing anything.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.679
You're doing the exact same thing you did
as a staff writer.

00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:50.330
The next year you're executive story editor,
then you're co-producer.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.489
And you may think, "Ahh, that's the jump to
producer."

00:27:53.489 --> 00:27:54.820
No, co means not--.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820
[laughter]

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.999
Co-producer not a producer.

00:27:58.999 --> 00:28:01.460
Step after that is producer.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.730
Then you're a producer.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.049
Then supervising producer.

00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:07.619
We lost some light.

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:12.729
[laughs] And so, you move up through these
links of these insane titles all of which

00:28:12.729 --> 00:28:14.110
are just different kinds of writers.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:20.049
And you're producing duties may or may not
expand as your title goes up.

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:22.450
&gt;&gt; Male#2: So, where did you want to go with
"Caprica?"

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.099
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Where did I want to go with
"Caprica?"

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:32.070
"Caprica" was handed to me, I was not involved
in the conception of it.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.220
I really knew nothing about it.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.970
I hadn't seen the pilot.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.460
The casting was all done, the hiring of the
staff was essentially done, and I was brought

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:46.669
in to write it with --. Or not write it, to
run it with Ron Moore.

00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:52.320
So, we had an initial sit down with Ron Moore
where he sort of laid out where it would go.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.709
And I did my best to stick to where he wanted
it to go.

00:28:56.709 --> 00:29:02.820
&gt;&gt; Male#2: So, you didn't have your own ambition
before Kevin Murphy came in or anything?

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.009
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I had my thoughts about
what characters I felt were working with story-lines

00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:09.749
I felt were working.

00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:12.019
I was working within a big team.

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:16.609
David Eick was there also as executive producer.

00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:20.490
SyFy has a lot of authority over their shows.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:32.619
So, I was part of a group that was steering
it in directions.

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:37.759
I think the show turned out remarkably well
for having so many cooks.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:41.609
[laughs] Yeah, it was.

00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:44.460
It was a little hard to know exactly where
it was going.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:51.029
I think it was, as most Season One shows do,
even though it was continuation sort of a

00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:52.100
"Battlestar" universe.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.899
It was also Season One of a show with a very
different feel to it.

00:29:55.899 --> 00:30:00.720
We were a domestic drama with robots.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.879
[laughter]

00:30:01.879 --> 00:30:08.039
And so, I think there wasn't huge anonymity
of decision about exactly where it should

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.039
go.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:11.369
And then to a certain extent, I think it was
kept open on purpose.

00:30:11.369 --> 00:30:14.100
Let's see what's working, let's see what's
not working.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.730
So, if you are implying that there may be
a feeling of a lack of a unified vision, I

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.179
think that's probably true.

00:30:21.179 --> 00:30:22.970
&gt;&gt; Male#2: And a second quick question.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.999
How is it in the "Husbands" comedy that the
one man didn't know his husbands real name

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:32.009
when he had a Google+ account?

00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:36.200
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Cheeks, Cheeks signed up

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.289
for the Google+ account with the name Cheeks.

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:41.509
He also looks at his own marriage license
and didn't see his real name.

00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:44.899
We had that marriage license printed up so
it just says Cheeks.

00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:46.769
[laughs] So, I think it's like Cher.

00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:49.419
I think Cheeks has had his name legally changed.

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:50.419
[laughter]

00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:54.039
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So, there's a question
right here.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:58.799
&gt;&gt; Female#1: So, I wanted to tell you how
much I love your work.

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:00.000
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Thank you.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.320
&gt;&gt; Female#1: Noticing your name in the credits
was sort of a starting point for me in realizing

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.919
that there were writers were making these
characters say these things.

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:11.889
Which is odd because I had, at one point,
thought I would pursue writing as a career.

00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:15.979
And I realized that over time I kept seeing
these characters who were making me feel things

00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:17.929
and your name kept popping into the credits.

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:18.929
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Aww.

00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:22.619
&gt;&gt; Female#1: And I would watch the DVD content
and realized I would listen to the things

00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:23.619
you were saying about the characters.

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:27.899
I realized this wasn't an accident, that there
are really writers who really shape and inform

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:29.669
how we experience TV.

00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:32.109
And with the internet right now, that's really
changing.

00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:35.979
I see what you are doing with "Kickstarter"
and I'm excited about this project.

00:31:35.979 --> 00:31:40.799
And I can directly connect to you and inspire
this project to happen because of a writer

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:42.139
I believe in.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.719
So, I'd really like to hear from you about
where new media is taking things in terms

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:47.719
of the current action.

00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:50.209
It's not just the actor anymore who's the
visible presence.

00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:52.499
So, I'd love to hear from you.

00:31:52.499 --> 00:31:55.519
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: So many fizzy, fizzy thoughts
coming after that.

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:59.820
Number one of which is, the experience you
described I had pre social media.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.149
Which is I read an interview with April Kelly
who was a "MASH" writer.

00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:08.220
And seeing the woman's name talking about
writing for "MASH" is what made me go, "that's

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.499
a thing I can do."

00:32:09.499 --> 00:32:15.289
So, I'm glad I could do that 'cause that was
done for me.

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:19.299
And I'm so thrilled that that's your view
of the "Kickstarter" because I was actually

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:25.309
very reluctant to do it 'cause I knew I could
put in money.

00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:27.869
I didn't want to take money from people who
have less money than me.

00:32:27.869 --> 00:32:32.469
I was putting in all I could afford, but I
know that people might be scraping around

00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:35.269
for their ten dollar bill to give, and I didn't
want that.

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.409
That would hurt my soul.

00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:42.139
And so, when we realized that we could give
incentives, that would make it worthwhile

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:45.179
for people so they would get something of
value.

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:53.009
And we also realized that giving them a Season
Two, a high quality Season Two, was something

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:55.629
that would make it worth it.

00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:58.529
And beyond that, the sense that they're involved
in it.

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:04.049
That's what really surprised me and made me
thrilled, was that people were enjoying giving

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.990
because they felt like they got to be part
of the team.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.440
And they got to support a project they believed
in, they got to support marriage equality,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.320
they get to support good comedy, they get
to support online content.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.679
There's a whole bunch of stuff you get to
support.

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:18.019
And the "Kickstarter" is still sittin' up
there.

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:22.389
Go to "Kickstarter" look for "Husbands" we're
there.

00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:26.359
Every dollar we get will help us make it more
and better and bigger.

00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:31.690
But yeah that's-- and yeah that future of
social media, that fact that crowd funding

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:39.469
now makes it possible to do for even, for
anyone with a dream and good big idea to get

00:33:39.469 --> 00:33:43.139
out there, raise some money, make something
on your own.

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:49.969
But I gotta think that online is where the
future of the new wave of content is going

00:33:49.969 --> 00:33:51.149
to come from.

00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:56.700
And because you don't have to be a broadcaster,
you don't have to appeal to everyone in every

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.330
demographic, you can take risks.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:04.190
You can do a show like ours with this young,
sexy married couple.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:09.169
TV will put gay marrieds on TV but they generally
won't make them sexual.

00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:11.860
They do everything to desexualize them.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.879
They cast a straight actor as one of the guys,
or they give them babies or something.

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:19.099
As much as I love "Modern Family", I love
"Modern Family."

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:24.440
But there is a certain trend to make you not
think that these guys are having hot sex.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.629
And our show is all about, these are newlyweds,
of course they are.

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:32.330
But they are still making every mistake that
every other newlywed couple does.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.129
All newlyweds do.

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:40.289
So, we wanted, we wanted to do content that
was a little spicy, a little intriguing.

00:34:40.289 --> 00:34:42.849
Something you can't get everywhere else.

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:47.679
And online is totally the place to do it and
I just have a feeling even though right now

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.960
this is a mechanism for us to feed money into
a system.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:59.619
I gotta think ultimately online will become
a place where it isn't just a one way thing

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:05.250
where someone's gonna crack the code for figuring
out how to make this a legitimate two way

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.289
conversation between us and the audience.

00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:13.390
&gt;&gt;Male#3: One of the things on the flyer there,
in fact the headline, introducing you there

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.950
is that you are a "Hugo Award" winning author
for your work on "Buffy."

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:16.950
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:21.160
&gt;&gt;Male #3: You're probably not aware that
it was actually controversy when they created

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.950
a category for the "Hugo Awards"--

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.950
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Ohhhh.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.380
&gt;&gt; Male#3: that was primarily aimed at television
shows.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.319
There used to only be just one that covered
movies and TV, and it mostly went to movies.

00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:30.319
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Right.

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:33.829
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Some of the criticisms of it were
actually, "Oh there's no reason just to create

00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:35.130
a category just for "Buffy."

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.130
Because at the time--

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.269
[laughter]

00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:38.269
Now as it happens--

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.269
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Nice.
[laughter]

00:35:39.269 --> 00:35:41.460
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Now there's no need for a category
just for "Doctor Who."

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Right, right.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.820
&gt;&gt;Male #3: But had you been familiar --. Had
you heard of the award even before you received

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.820
it?

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.820
And was--?

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.820
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh, "Hugo?"

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820
Yeah.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.820
&gt;&gt; Male #3: was it worth--?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.380
One of the major criticisms from within the
"World Science Fiction Society" is, "well,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.410
nobody in movie and television ever pays attention
to that.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.510
They don't really give a darn about that."

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.510
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.829
&gt;&gt; Male#3: Was that worthwhile did you think?

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:01.829
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:03.700
Oh my "Hugo," that's all I really have.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.530
I have half a "Hugo" and two "Streamies,"
and that's all I have because sci-fi stuff

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.460
is generally not recognized in Hollywood.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.750
And so, to have the "Hugos" recognize it is
like our only way to get legitimacy.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:20.970
The "Battlestar Galactica" won-- what was
that?

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.600
What's the really fancy one?

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600
&gt;&gt; Male#3: "Saturnite"

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.890
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: No "Saturn" is not fancy.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:26.890
[laughter]

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.080
&gt;&gt; Male#3: I've never seen one.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.280
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: "Saturn" is adorable and
I would love one 'cause I don't have one.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.800
But the one like a--.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800
It was like--.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.800
It wasn't a "Bradbury."

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800
Anyway it was a--.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800
&gt;&gt; Male#4: [inaudible]

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: No, no.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800
It wasn't even a science fiction award.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.660
It was like an award for being genius media
in a mainstream kind of world.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.109
We'll figure it out, someone will look it
up.

00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:50.109
But--.

00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:51.410
&gt;&gt; Male#5: [inaudible]

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.680
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I know.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680
[laughter]

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Somebody pull your phone
out.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680
What did "Battlestar Galactica--?"

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.990
But they won it the year before I was there
so, I don't have it.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:03.630
But yes, those awards carry big clout in Hollywood
because those, the showbiz awards, everybody

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.119
knows them; everybody has them.

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:11.000
The non-showbiz awards are like, " Oh you're
legit; you've broke-- the real people, the

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.490
smart people gave you the award."

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.490
[laughter]

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.089
"Hugo Award" is huge.

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:17.349
"Hugo Award" is bigger than any of them.

00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:18.920
I am so pleased with it.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.000
&gt;&gt; Male#3: I'll bring that up anytime someone
criticizes it.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.170
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah, no, don't criticize
it.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.170
And I was--.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.480
&gt;&gt; Male#3: Suggested was the "Peabody" that
you--.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.809
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: "Peabody" thank you.

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:31.240
&gt;&gt; Male#3: By the way, I was sympathetic to
your talking about with "Husbands," the worries

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.650
about filming in a house and so on.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.859
When I was in college, we did--.

00:37:33.859 --> 00:37:40.410
Our science fiction club filmed two one- hour
long "Doctor Who" fan movies and it was the

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.410
same thing.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.040
In a house, we're about to lose the light,
that kind of thing.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.040
I know.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh, it's so hard.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.040
Stuff that you don't--.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:55.440
I learned so much doing web content as opposed
to big TV, about things that you don't think

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.779
about on the set, like feeding the crew.

00:37:58.779 --> 00:37:59.779
[laughter]

00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:01.740
That sort of happens automatically.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.880
But on the web series I'm stopping at Taco
Bell and ordering 20 burritos at the drive-thru

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.380
before I go to set 'cause somebody's gotta
feed 'em.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:17.269
And just, "Oh, wait, nobody remembered to
bring the champagne glass.

00:38:17.269 --> 00:38:19.319
Well, we have an enormous margarita glass.

00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:23.289
That's funnier anyway."

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:25.279
[laughter]

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:28.900
Great happenstance, but also great panic if
we don't have.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.289
There are two scenes in this in which Shawn
forgot, who plays Brady, forgot his shoes.

00:38:35.289 --> 00:38:39.869
So, he's shoeless in a couple scenes and you
just don't pan down enough to see it.

00:38:39.869 --> 00:38:46.990
But yeah, just things happen and I also learned
a big thing about being in the editing room,

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:52.320
which is on all previous projects I thought
if a line had to be cut or something had to

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.280
be changed in the editing room I felt like,
" yeah that's was a problem with the script

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.369
I should have caught it at the script stage."

00:38:59.369 --> 00:39:04.390
Now I go "No, there was no problem with the
script; this is how it had to be.

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.819
Having the script a certain way got a certain
performance, now we cut it out in the editing

00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:09.589
room.

00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:13.309
That is the best way to have made this moment
happen."

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:17.230
You don't-- it, really is the next pass.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.529
I had heard that, I'd never believed it.

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:23.549
So, it's something a lot of people learn in
film school, I'm just learning now.

00:39:23.549 --> 00:39:27.569
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: OK, I think we have a
yellow question.

00:39:27.569 --> 00:39:28.569
Yes.

00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:29.569
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yes.

00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:30.569
&gt;&gt; Female#2: Hi, my name is Tricia.

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:31.589
One thing I've always liked about your shows,
they tend to pass the Bechdel Test with flying

00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:32.589
colors.

00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:33.589
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:35.119
&gt;&gt; Female#2: And I was wondering if this was
a coincidence.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:37.519
And if it's not, is it something you have
to fight for?

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:42.880
And have you ever encountered resistance to
having multiple female protagonists in a scene,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.380
in an episode, or even in a show premise?

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.019
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: You do what you can in the
writers room.

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:49.309
Depending on the room that you're in.

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:53.190
you may reach some resistance if there's a
scene with two girls and they're talking about

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:58.369
a guy you can say, "Have you guys heard of
the Bechdel Test?"

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:02.200
That's often how I do it 'cause then they
feel like it's not just me and an agenda.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.420
It's like, fans are gonna notice and then
sometimes that pays it that, that will help.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.289
But I haven't actually faced that in a long
time.

00:40:10.289 --> 00:40:16.039
If you look at "Once Upon A Time," we just
have so many lead females with Regina, Mary

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:20.369
Margaret, and Snow, I mean, no I doubled one
up.

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:23.910
Snow is Mary Margaret, and Emma.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.690
It's impossible for them to be giggling about
boys in every scene.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:33.279
So, there's just tons and tons and tons of
Bechdel falling left and right.

00:40:33.279 --> 00:40:40.769
We had one who worried me a little bit when
we had Snow and Red Riding Hood talking about

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:42.119
their men.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:45.289
And it was Snow going "I think you like this
guy, what are you gonna do?

00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:46.690
You gonna run away with him?"

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.339
That scene turns into "let's go kill a wolf."

00:40:49.339 --> 00:40:50.339
[laughter]

00:40:50.339 --> 00:40:55.940
So, after a while I calmed down and I was
like, you know what?

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.210
This one passes.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.099
[laughs] And you don't want to be so crazy
to it that nobody can ever talk about relationships

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:06.650
because relationships are at the heart of
a lot of people's lives.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:11.980
So I try to always keep it in mind that sometimes
you get it in and sometimes you don't.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.980
Yeah.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.450
&gt;&gt; Female#2: Something that makes it unique
is that it's not that the relationships are

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.020
the only reason the woman's in the show.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.020
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Right.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.200
&gt;&gt; Female#2: "Buffy" was ultimately a show
about a woman who had a job fighting demons.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.730
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Absolutely.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:28.329
And there were other important decisions beyond
Bechdel in how Buffy was treated.

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:32.819
Joss made really sure that nobody ever challenged
her ability to lead on the basis that she

00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:34.670
was a woman or a girl.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.819
Whatever she was.

00:41:36.819 --> 00:41:37.819
It was--.

00:41:37.819 --> 00:41:41.100
They might challenge her on other reasons
like you're exhausted, you're crazy, you're

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.329
infected with a demon spawn, or whatever.

00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:45.329
[laughter]

00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:47.090
But it was never "you're a woman."

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.650
And similarly, on "Battlestar Galactica,"
President Roslin was never challenged on that

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:53.650
basis.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.309
And I love that Ron set up a world in which
there was not a history of gender discrimination.

00:41:59.309 --> 00:42:06.130
And in fact, when I got to write the "Face
of the Enemy" web series, I co-wrote those,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.329
in which we learn that Lieutenant Gaeta is
gay.

00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:13.759
Although I hate to even use that word gay
in the "Battlestar Galactica" universe because

00:42:13.759 --> 00:42:15.099
they don't seem to have a word.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.750
Because it's just that.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.750
Some people love here and some people love
there.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.579
They've never thought of separating them out
and giving them a different name.

00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:27.980
But we learn that in that episode and I tried
really hard to write that so that this-- nobody

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.289
was shocked by that.

00:42:30.289 --> 00:42:35.609
There's actually a shot in it of Colonel Tigh
giving, looking askance.

00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:39.040
That wasn't intended to be a "you've got a
boyfriend?"

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.180
That was intended to be like "how come I didn't
know you had a relationship with another crew

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.520
member?"

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.450
So, I hope people read that in the way it
was intended.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:55.799
That writing a show, that what a great freedom
it is and that it's another way to apply metaphor.

00:42:55.799 --> 00:43:01.059
It's kinda like, here's our world as seen
if this had, if we didn't have this in our

00:43:01.059 --> 00:43:02.059
history.

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:04.640
Look what's the same, look what corresponds,
look what's different.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640
I love that.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
&gt;&gt; Male#6: All right.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.299
This one is from Tricia Weir.

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:14.079
If you could choose any show you've ever worked
on and retcon it out of cancellation with

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.359
a new season,

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.359
[laughter]

00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:17.960
which show would it be?

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:24.349
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I-- it's interesting 'cause
sometimes that doesn't mean it's the show

00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:25.349
you love best.

00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:30.600
I don't think, I think "Buffy" ended well
and has been continued in the comic book.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.450
So that would be a weird one to go back and
continue.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.029
Where do you continue it from?

00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:37.920
The end of the current comic book season?

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.530
"Torchwood" ended too soon.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.539
I mean, we don't know if there's going to
be more "Torchwood."

00:43:41.539 --> 00:43:43.720
Russell's dealing with stuff.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.920
But I would love to see more "Torchwood."

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:55.910
Obviously there would-- "Once Upon a Time"
I'm certain will continue.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.750
So that one's good.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.400
I'm getting to make more "Husbands."

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400
"Firefly."

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.520
"Firefly" deserved more.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.210
"Firefly" ended too soon, had stories left
to tell, Joss was excited about the--.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.299
That's why he made "Serenity" it's like there
was more to do.

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:17.890
I would love, love, love to write another
season of "Firefly."

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:23.140
&gt;&gt; Male#6: Why in God's name, this is my question,
was "Firefly" canceled so soon?

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.970
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I--.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.800
Yeah I actually don't know.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.910
I don't think I could if I did know.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:38.670
But I think it just was probably a mismatch
between what FOX was finding profitable on

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.809
their airwaves.

00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:46.630
That was still a time when ratings triumphed
over DVD sales.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.950
The studio makes the DVD money.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.810
The network sells the advertising.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.690
So they, the network cares about the ratings.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:59.510
You can be huge in DVD sales and the network
may not even know about it or care about it.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:05.130
So, I think studios in which the studio and
the network are all one entity, this sort

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:12.789
of happens at SyFy more, I think they're more
likely to keep a DVD hit show around.

00:45:12.789 --> 00:45:18.059
Then FOX was, 'cause I don't know that they
cared about the cult following.

00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:22.890
They were just looking at the weekly numbers
and I am sure they were probably, in their

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.250
spreadsheets, they were probably right.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.630
The numbers didn't justify it.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.549
I think there were more numbers they weren't
seeing.

00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:28.710
But I'm guessing.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:32.040
&gt;&gt; Male#6: So, you're telling me short term
thinking killed "Firefly?"

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.410
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Short-term thinking killed
a lot.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.410
Yeah.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.599
&gt;&gt; Male#6: All right, and I have one more
question for you off the Dory for you.

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:46.289
This is from some dude named Dan Block, and
the question is, "your website says you wear

00:45:46.289 --> 00:45:47.289
very bright colors.

00:45:47.289 --> 00:45:49.019
Are you sure about that?"

00:45:49.019 --> 00:45:50.019
[laughter]

00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:53.010
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: [laughs] I generally do.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:56.359
When I come to an appearance like this, I
try to class it up.

00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:57.359
So--.

00:45:57.359 --> 00:46:01.559
But I don't know that I've ever even worn
this black blouse before.

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:05.500
Normally I'm in very, very bright colors.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.579
But it--.

00:46:06.579 --> 00:46:08.670
I like to think it's reflected in my writing.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.070
I always try to put humor in anything I write,
even a dark show.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.420
But today I'm giving you dark Jane.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.650
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male#7: Just a question on the business

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.650
of writing.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:24.140
You've given some perspective on what really
happens when a show runner kinda goes forward

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.140
with everything.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:30.940
When you look at a show that becomes a big
success and writers kinda disperse to other

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.930
shows, it seems that, that unified vision
you spoke of earlier seems to deviate.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.680
And I think a good example is something like
maybe "Lost," where--

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Mmmhmm.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.640
&gt;&gt; Male #7: they clearly had a vision that
over time, they really deviated from that

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.789
just because from my perspective, it just
seems like a lot of the writers kinda jump

00:46:44.789 --> 00:46:46.160
ship and kinda did their own thing.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.160
But is that how it normally happens in Hollywood?

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.000
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: I thought you were going
to ask different question so my mind's still

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.260
there.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.520
Shows sometimes weaken over age and sometimes
because people leave.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.950
Sometimes they get stronger over age because
someone comes in with a great strong vision

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.680
and reinvigorates it or vigorates it.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.190
So I think it really matters show to show.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.980
Trying to think of a show.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.980
I worked on "Ellen."

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.140
And "Ellen," the first season of "Ellen" was
called "These Friends of Mine."

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.769
And then they fired all the writers and they
got rid of a bunch of cast members, and it

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:24.150
came back as "Ellen" and then it sort of stumbled
along with an eleven rating for a while.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.809
And then they were like, "Oh, she wants to
come out let's incorporate it in that show."

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:28.869
Oh, my god.

00:47:28.869 --> 00:47:30.880
A season of huge, huge, huge ratings.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.880
The show found itself.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.839
The show was about something.

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:34.839
Then my--.

00:47:34.839 --> 00:47:35.839
Then they were all fired.

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.650
New staff came in.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:38.869
[laughter]

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:42.390
I don't know where they went actually, they
may have just all, I don't know what happened.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.809
But I came in for the season after she came
out.

00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:46.640
We were telling great stories.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.300
The show had a reason to exist, which it never
had before.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.300
It never had a hook.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:55.259
It was just a girl in a coffee shop, and then
suddenly the bookstore.

00:47:55.259 --> 00:47:56.741
So we had a reason to tell--.

00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.000
We were telling exciting stories.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.890
Stories that had never been told before.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.710
But eventually the numbers went back down
to the eleven.

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:08.269
The show went back to its rating of the people
who really loved it and loved her.

00:48:08.269 --> 00:48:09.269
So it went away.

00:48:09.269 --> 00:48:15.359
But I felt like that was a show that got stronger
because somehow you found a thing for the

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.900
show to be about.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:21.559
So, I think lots of different things can happen.

00:48:21.559 --> 00:48:23.790
Shows have a lifespan.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:27.510
A lot of shows have about five seasons in
them, and then they go away.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.609
I mean, British TV takes us to an extreme.

00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:33.609
Well there's about six episodes in this show,
let's do that.

00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:37.290
So sometimes, it's about shows outliving their
natural lifespan.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:40.220
The story's done, let's make more story.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:49.690
But what I thought you were gonna talk about
it the way a show can have an academy in it

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:55.119
that's so strong, the writers can learn so
much, that they then-- when they go to other

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:58.319
shows, they take that philosophy with them.

00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:00.040
Which is what happened to "Buffy."

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.329
Because almost all the "Buffy" writers are
now running shows or doing other big things

00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:05.529
in other shows.

00:49:05.529 --> 00:49:12.070
And they all brought with them the core of
the Joss beliefs about, make me feel, make

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:13.720
this about something.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.220
What does this mean to the main character?

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.369
Go deeper.

00:49:17.369 --> 00:49:19.499
Make your genres.

00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:23.180
Make funny in your sadness, put sadness in
your funny.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:28.130
Walk away with those things and any show you
go to you're gonna bring those to.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:34.490
And so, the "Buffy" explosion sent "Buffy"
stardust out into the universe.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.490
[laughter]

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:38.259
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: I think we have time
for one last question.

00:49:38.259 --> 00:49:39.640
&gt;&gt; Male#7: Yeah.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.859
What are some of your favorite shows that
you didn't write or perhaps wish you could

00:49:44.859 --> 00:49:46.180
partake in writing?

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.930
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Oh.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:48.930
"MASH."

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.930
[laughter]

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.440
Where have you gone?

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:57.299
"Lou Grant," "Mary Tyler Moore," "Bob Newhart,"
"The Odd Couple."

00:49:57.299 --> 00:50:01.200
A lot of the shows from my childhood that
I grew up watching and imagining, including

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.400
the stupid shows.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.230
"Welcome Back, Kotter."

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.070
"The Love Boat."

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.070
[laughter]

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.070
"What's Happening?"

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.070
[laughter]

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.780
I had stories in my head for those shows and
never got to write them.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:18.790
I would have loved to have written an episode
of "The Wire."

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:26.249
I would love to have written, so many good
shows that I would love to get my teeth in.

00:50:26.249 --> 00:50:30.869
Sometimes a really dark show, maybe like "Breaking
Bad" or something where it's like I would

00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:33.029
love to see how much humor I could get in
there.

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.349
How much can it bear?

00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:38.190
That was my favorite thing to do on "Battlestar,"
was to take a really dark scene and see if

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.780
I could put a joke in it.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:46.089
Because that joke is gonna play twisted, sick,
and even darker than if I hadn't made a joke.

00:50:46.089 --> 00:50:47.089
[laughter]

00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:51.210
And so, I loved that there was a scene where
everyone is talking about how everyone is

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.619
so starving on the ship that they're eating
paper.

00:50:54.619 --> 00:50:57.410
And then eventually they stop eating paper.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.410
Why is that?

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.410
Paper shortage.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:00.410
[laughter]

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.690
That kills me 'cause it's just so sad.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.690
[laughs]

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:04.690
[laughter]

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:10.069
And yet it's got the structure of a joke.

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:11.069
I love that.

00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:16.380
So I'd love to pick something really dark
but right now, I'd love to write a "Community"

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.329
or something but I don't have the chops.

00:51:18.329 --> 00:51:19.329
I feel like--.

00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:20.329
I come out of comedy.

00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:22.249
I spent a lot of years writing comedy.

00:51:22.249 --> 00:51:23.249
That show's so good.

00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:24.809
I can't touch that.

00:51:24.809 --> 00:51:28.140
I would be writing, I feel, a lesser species.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.880
Give me a dramatic show and let me put some
fun in it.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.529
So what's the darkest thing out there right
now?

00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.529
Point me at it.

00:51:35.529 --> 00:51:36.529
I'll do it.

00:51:36.529 --> 00:51:39.760
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Well, thank you very
much for coming to Google today.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760
&gt;&gt; Jane Espenson: Thank you.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:40.761
[applause]
