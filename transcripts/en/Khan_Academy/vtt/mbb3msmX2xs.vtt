00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.280
What I want to do is start with
an expression like 4x plus 18

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.020
and see if we can rewrite
this as the product of two

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.560
expressions.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.110
Essentially, we're going
to try to factor this.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.030
And the key here
is to figure out

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.420
are there any common
factors to both 4x and 18?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.100
And we can factor that
common factor out.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.890
We're essentially
going to be reversing

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.690
the distributive property.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.159
So for example, what
is the largest number

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.700
that is-- or I could really say
the largest expression-- that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.299
is divisible into
both 4x and 18?

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.970
Well, 4x is divisible
by 2, because we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.000
know that 4 is divisible by 2.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.280
And 18 is also
divisible by 2, so we

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:51.430
can rewrite 4x as
being 2 times 2x.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.070
If you multiply that side,
it's obviously going to be 4x.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.660
And then, we can write 18 as
the same thing as 2 times 9.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.450
And now it might
be clear that when

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.957
you apply the
distributive property,

00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:06.540
you'll usually end
up with a step that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.290
looks something like this.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.400
Now we're just going to
undistribute the two right over

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.900
here.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.849
We're going to
factor the two out.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.140
Let me actually just draw that.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.660
So we're going to
factor the two out,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.090
and so this is going to
be 2 times 2x plus 9.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.010
And if you were to-- wanted
to multiply this out,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.102
it would be 2 times
2x plus 2 times 9.

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:32.560
It would be exactly
this, which you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.800
would simplify as
this, right up here.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.765
So there we have it.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.730
We have written
this as the product

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.880
of two expressions,
2 times 2x plus 9.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.350
Let's do this again.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.930
So let's say that I
have 12 plus-- let

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.140
me think of something
interesting-- 32x.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.260
Actually since we-- just to get
a little bit of variety here,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.340
let's put a y here, 12 plus 32y.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.180
Well, what's the
largest number that's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.949
divisible into both 12 and 32?

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.040
2 is clearly divisible
into both, but so is 4.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.680
And let's see.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.000
It doesn't look like
anything larger than 4

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.290
is divisible into
both 12 and 32.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.810
The greatest common
factor of 12 and 32 is 4,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.802
and y is only divisible
into the second term,

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:27.510
not into this first
term right over here.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.110
So it looks like 4 is the
greatest common factor.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.379
So we could rewrite each
of these as a product of 4

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.170
and something else.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:43.090
So for example, 12, we
can rewrite as 4 times 3.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.970
And 32, we can
rewrite-- since it's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.953
going to be plus-- 4 times.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.470
Well if you divide 32y by
4, it's going to be 8y.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.200
And now once again, we
can factor out the 4.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.465
So this is going to
be 4 times 3 plus 8y.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.710
And once you do more and
more examples of this,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.380
you're going to find
that you can just

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.690
do this stuff all at once.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.200
You can say hey, what's
the largest number that's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.640
divisible into both of these?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.400
Well, it's 4, so let
me factor a 4 out.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.586
12 divided by 4 is 3.

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:26.992
32y divided by 4 is 8y.
