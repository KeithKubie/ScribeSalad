00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.990
Petroleum-based plastics may soon be a thing
of the past thanks to shrimp.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.689
You heard that right.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:15.160
Hey Everyone, I'm Dr. Carin Bondar 'Biologist
with a Twist'.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.430
I'm a guest on DNews today, visiting from
my usual haunts at the Science Channel and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.430
Scientific American.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.940
and I'm rather tickled to be here!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.109
Today we are talking about an amazing new
bioplastic that comes from a rather unlikely

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.109
source.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.109
Shrimp.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.119
They are beloved by humans world-wide.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.119
Shrimp kabobs, shrimp rings, shrimp creole,
lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, shrimp gumbo...you

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.119
get the picture.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.300
All of this gluttonous shrimp consumption
leaves us with whole lot of discarded shrimp

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.770
shells - and researchers at Harvard's Wyss
Institute have discovered a way to put them

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.770
to great use.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.070
The shells, or exoskeletons of the shrimp
are largely composed of a material called

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.780
chitin - the second most abundant organic
material on the planet (next to cellulose).

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.680
This is because all arthropods, including
marine crustaceans like shrimp and crabs,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.470
but also insects, beetles and butterflies
have exoskeletons that contain chitin.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.920
Keep in mind that arthropods are the MOST
abundant animals on the planet, they account

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.710
for over 80% of all known animal species.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.470
So as far as the availability of chitin as
a source material for bioplastic - we would

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.960
never run out.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.610
Chitosan is a material derived from chitin
and is the basis for this new bio-plastic.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.000
The technology is a significant improvement
on previous bio-plastics that are made with

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510
cellulose, a plant-based polysaccharide.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.720
These cellulose versions are greener because
they aren't created from petroleum.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.700
But their uses are limited and they require
very specific environmental conditions to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
degrade.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.080
So why is chitosan better?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.820
Although researchers have known about the
potential applications of chitin for several

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.060
decades, they were held back by the processing
techniques, none of which could produce chitin

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.820
objects that were strong enough for everyday
use.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.980
However, cutting edge techniques have now
been developed to change all that.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.420
Newly formed chitosan is proving to be tough
enough to be mass-manufactured into complex

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.640
3-D shapes using traditional casting or injection
molding techniques.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.420
Chitosan products will be as durable as traditional
plastic toys, dishes and other everyday items.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.880
It can also be used in the manufacture of
garbage bags, packaging materials and even

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.940
diapers!

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.100
Once discarded, the chitosan-based material
breaks down in just a few weeks.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.440
And if that wasn't good news enough - as it
degrades it also releases rich nutrients that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960
support plant growth.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.331
It's like the cherry on the sundae of a huge
environmental win.

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:30.331
When we consider that americans generate over
34 million tons of plastic waste every year,

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.331
and that less than 7% of that waste is recovered
for recycling - the need for a sustainable

00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:32.331
bioplastic is extremely huge.

00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:33.331
Consider the 100 million tons of plastic debris
that is currently floating in the Pacific

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.331
Ocean, strangling, suffocating and starving
wildlife on massive scales.

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.331
Chitosan bioplastic has the potential to change
the way we interact with our planet and the

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:36.331
animals we share it with.

00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.331
It's development could really change the world.

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.331
So which manufacturing industries do you think
would be a great fit for chitosan?

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.331
What do you think would be better made with
bioplastic?

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:40.950
Leave your ideas in the comments below.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.100
and Hey! what do shrimp have in common with
goblin sharks?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.400
well, not much actually, except that a shrimp
trawler in Florida recently brought up some

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.720
seriously ghoulish bycatch.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.670
