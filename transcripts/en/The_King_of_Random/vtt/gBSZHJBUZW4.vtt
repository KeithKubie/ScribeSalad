00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.969
Wooow

00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.139
That actually have worked. What's up guys welcome back to the shop. for another pyro project.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.980
For this video I went down to the dollar store

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.300
And I clean them out of these little tiny smoke balls they come out around this time of year

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.859
And I actually counted all these we have 75 pack of 6 balls each. That's a total of 450

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.470
 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.490
mini Smoke bombs that we can consoladate into 4  giant smoke bombs and thats the purpose of this project today

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.349
Here's the basic idea. I went and picked up four different cups here because we have four different colors

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.689
We've got yellow white blue and purple

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.599
Now if you take one of these little smoke bombs and look inside

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.219
We're going to find is there's a layer of paper on the top once you pull that apart you can see there's a seam line

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
That connects two halves of a cardboard sphere if you give it a little pop with your thumb

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.628
You can split the whole thing open and find a little smoke pellet. That's inside

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.209
So our job at this point is to simply crack all

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.599
450 smoke bombs open pull the pellets out and group them by their respective colors all right cool. Let's get cracking

00:00:54.599 --> 00:01:15.000
Instrumental Music

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.509
There we go. There's the last package. They're all out it would be fun almost to light this off

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.879
We've got a mountain of smoke bomb and that by itself could be a pretty epic time but in the interest of saving space

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.810
We're in the cracking things down to extract all those pellets and organize them into their respective colors

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:53.900
Instrumental Music

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.609
All right here. We are guys we have shelled

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.119
450 smoke bombs and put them into the different containers one thing that I notice is they're really really heavy on the white

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.429
Next up is blue then we have yellow then we have purple. What was really interesting about this patch

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.068
I don't know where these came from we ended up with two green totally random. So now that we've got these things full

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.798
I'm really tempted just to go outside and light them off the one question

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.599
I have is should we wrap them up in aluminum

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.969
Foil to make them jet out one hole or should we just let the whole thing burned and see how that reacts

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.590
Now these are paper cups so I think at least what I'm going to do is put a couple of wraps of aluminum foil around

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.750
The side help reinforce them then let's go outside

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.339
Let's light the yellow one off first and depending on how it reacts we can make a few adjustments in there

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:46.600
Instrumental Music

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.369
All right, we've got the aluminum Foil on our cup so it's time to head outside and try two different experiments the first one

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
We're going to light off one of these smoke bombs as is and see how it performs

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.669
Then we're going to light up one of our souped-up versions and see how they compare

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.709
So we got four of the regular dollar-store smoke bombs. We're going to light them up and see how they react here we go

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.390
Here we go

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.900
Instrumental Music

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.010
Yeah, so that was kind of pathetic

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.239
Yeah, that's kind of anticlimactic, but pretty much what you expect from Dollar store smoke bombs

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.739
They only burn for about five seconds

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.739
And they're so light and flimsy they roll around the wind

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.679
So let's see how they compare to our homemade version where we've got a hundred of them in a cup

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.759
Now the question really is when we light one of these off is it going to ignite the whole batch?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.760
Or is it just going to go out by itself and fizzle down and die

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.420
I guess there's really only one way to find out so we're going ahead and light up now all right

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420
Let's play it up moment of truth

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.140
Whoa, that's hot thank it's hot in a hurry

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.590
new doggy

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900
Wow, wow wow?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.560
okay, so

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.209
Look down here. You can see all the charred remnants of what should have been smoked

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.060
And it does totally charred went off all at once now 300 - the cup lit on fire - good thing

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.839
We put the aluminum foil around and that helped give it some integrity well, the one thing I noticed there was no

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.920
Yellow smoke it just went up in this huge cloud big puff of like

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.530
I don't even know what a lot of flames, and then just drifted away

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:27.500
Instrumental Music

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.509
Lighting up remember that's a lot of fire. What surprised me about that reaction

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.419
Is there really wasn't much smoke at all it just kind of went up in flames

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.829
So where did all the coloring go I see traces of it on the brick and on the road itself?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.099
But there was a lot of coloring in there, and now it's completely gone. It's very odd

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.849
My guess is the reaction was too hot and everything just burned up

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.059
So there was no chance to the smoke to just gently walked away

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm not very confident these other ones are going to work for we're going to light them off

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.599
But just to be sure I think the next one we're going to dump out in a pile there spread a little more evenly

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.289
Next up, we got the purple all right here. We go if this works any better

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.579
I'm going to start at the side to see if we get a slower burn and keep that makes a difference

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:08.800
Instrumental Music

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960
Wow that gets hot in a hurry

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.090
interesting interesting

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.990
This is interesting okay. Let's talk about this, so that's our second batch

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.039
We lit it off and ignite so quickly the only smoke that I see is like a grayish smoke that evaporates

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.989
I don't see any color whatsoever and all the dye is just left over here is like charred remnants

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.460
That's really pretty see that's what we were expecting something of that nature so what I'm noticing here guys

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.680
I'm seeing a pattern here that if this burns, too hot

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.049
And I think collectively all of these are too hot then instead of releasing the dye it scorches it

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.590
And it doesn't release any color at all so we pretty much know what to expect at this point

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.630
But just for fun to wrap this whole thing in aluminum

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.289
Foil at the risk of it exploding just to see how it reacts in the confined environment

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.220
All right here. We go big one

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.960
is Lit

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.789
whoa

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.169
We did

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.990
Look up there. We got a cloud of smoke trailing away

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.109
I thought I saw a little bit of color out of there not very much though

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.709
That was interesting so it actually blew a hole through the top of the aluminum foil here

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.999
There's still little bits of random pieces going up there and a lot of fire. I don't actually

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.939
Know what that is. That's the cup on the inside. That's burning

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.150
But that just exploded out the top it through

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.229
if you look at this loma on that you can actually see the fuses you can see like bits of

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.279
Smoke bomb flying out the top everywhere is a very dramatic reaction

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.699
It's kind of hard to tell if this worked or not because these were actually the white smoke bombs

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.619
They did definitely see a big cloud of white go off. I can't really tell if this worked or not so just for fun

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.530
We're going to wrap up the last one. This is a full cup of blue and see what it does

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.280
There's probably about 125 blue smoke bombs in here however. I'm not very optimistic. It's going to work

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.069
I think it's just going to explode and is going to release black and white smoke

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.509
However, you never know if you try. So here we go. Let's do it once it's lit. There's no turning back

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.378
Oh, nice. I got a little bit of blue there, whoa. Oh

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:39.800
that

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.319
That actually half worked

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.438
I mean for about a foot and a half off of that thing I can actually see

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.489
Thick blue smoke it actually went very very quickly like four or five seconds

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.349
it was completely gone and it spit out all this blue dye all over the road and then it kind of went up into a

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.449
Whitish smoke which is actually insane

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.319
Very dramatic reaction it spit a blue dye everywhere

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:03.789
It's all over the sidewalk all over the road it's going to be a little bit of a mess to clean up, but that was pretty cool

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:07.299
Don't know if it's worth spending the money to make a giant smoke bomb

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.590
But that was a pretty cool reaction so thinking back on the experiments that we just tried here today

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.330
We really tried five different experiment

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.370
We took smoke bombs from the dollar store and lit them off and found they burn between three to six seconds with a very wimpy

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.189
plume of smoke

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:24.338
So we shelled those smoke bombs suck all the yellow ones in the container and list them off all at once what we found was

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:25.460
a little bit unexpected

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.839
Rather than a giant cloud of yellow smoke there was absolutely no colored smoke at all at least assuming that white smoke doesn't really count

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.989
What I think happened instead was so much heat was released that it charged the dye and prevent any colored smoke from being released at

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.789
All so for our second experiment

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.948
we spread all the purple smoke bombs out on a couple of bricks to see if by increasing the surface area would help slow the

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.919
Burn and the Idea might have worked but they were still in such close proximity

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:52.629
That the whole thing went up in a ball of fire with no visible color for the third experiment

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.390
We tried wrapping a cup full of white smoke bomb in aluminum

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.779
Foil a few times to see how they would burn confined and when we lit them off

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:03.759
We did actually see a big cloud of white smoke take off now since it was white smoke bombs

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.419
We couldn't tell whether or not it had anything to do with the process so for our fourth experiment

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.670
We wrapped the blue ones up in a similar manner there still was an enormous amount of pressure that built up and exploded

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.349
But what surprised me was we actually saw an explosion of color as well at least for the first foot to foot and a half

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.560
Above the container

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.750
So there you have it guys if you ever had a burning desire to know what would happen if you took hundreds of smoke bombs

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.649
And burn them all together now you know thanks for joining us for this experiment

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.649
I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you them

00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:35.919
Yeah, these aren't insulated gloves. These are wrong gloves for the job. Yeah, I play with fire. You expect to get burned Random happen

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.380
Hey guys, there is an event called CVx live that. I'm going to be at august 3rd through 5th stage presentations meet and greets

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.140
There's even a special superfan experience where we can hang out one-on-one

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.890
So click the link in the description and I'll be looking for you at the PDF live
