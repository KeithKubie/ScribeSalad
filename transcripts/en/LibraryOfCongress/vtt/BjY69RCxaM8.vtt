Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.640
Good morning!

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.040
And welcome to a very, very
special day at the Library

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.690
of Congress, I'm Carla Hayden

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.450
and I can't tell you
how excited we are

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.900
because today we are celebrating
literacy and learning

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.400
and reading and we couldn't
ask for a better person

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.570
and organization to
collaborate with today.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.710
Today our special guest is an
advocate for books and the power

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.210
of the written word
for children.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.920
We are honored to have

Dolly Parton.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.580
I think it's time to clap!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.850
I want to and I would be remiss

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:16.010
if I didn't introduce some
special guests in the audience,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.280
the wonderful staff
and the leadership

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.010
of the Dollywood foundation,
led by Mr. David Dodson,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:32.070
they have been wonderful
to work with!

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.370
There is Mr. Dodson.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.670
We are delighted to have
members of Congress,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.350
members of the Washington city
council, our various partners

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.190
in literacy and collaborators
and our generous donors who make

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.950
so much possible because today
we're all here as cheerleaders

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.250
for books and learning.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.700
Now, I have to tell
you, when I started

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.680
as a children's librarian
I remember being inspired

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.120
by a young woman who was on
the south side of Chicago

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.140
and her name was Judy Zucher
and when I first walked

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.650
into that branch library she was
on the floor having story time

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.950
with children with ought simple.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.420
simple. She was telling
stories and it's wonderful

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.540
where imagination and
reading can take you.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.800
And today we have young
people who will join us

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.540
to have fun with books!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.940
Ms. Dolly Parton has been
recognized many times

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.620
for her dedication to the
power of learning and for more

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.720
than two decades her imagination
library has helped hundreds

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.700
of thousands of children
worldwide,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.490
giving them high-quality
books to own.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.850
own. No matter what
their family's income

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.610
and in 2014 she was awarded
the Best Practices Award

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.080
from the Library of
Congress Literacy Foundation

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.400
so today we are pleased we
will be part of a milestone.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.290
The Imagination Library is

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.240
about to give away their
100 millionth book,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:20.020
that's so many I could barely --

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.930
100 millionth book
and we are humbled --

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.420
plagues applause that that
book will join with millions

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.210
of others at the
Library of Congress.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.460
That book will be
given to us today.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.610
So when the foundation
started 23 years ago,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.980
the first books were distributed
to the Tennessee County

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.980
where Dolly grew up and now
it is a worldwide phenomenon.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.890
So without further ado I would
like to share with you a video

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.510
about the Imagination Library.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:08:20.730
[Video Plays]

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.600
(Applause.)

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.370
&gt;&gt; Now, please welcome,
multi award winning singer,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.480
song writer and philanthropist,
Ms. Dolly Parton!

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.780
&gt;&gt; Hello!

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.080
(Applause.)

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:51.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, hi there!

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.660
Wow, hi up there!

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.100
Well, it's nice to be here just
in this wonderful place, D.C. ,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.460
and certainly here
in the Library

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.600
of Congress what a beautiful
building you have here?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.010
&gt;&gt; It's been called the
most beautiful building

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.310
in Washington, D.C.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.480
&gt;&gt; I think they're
probably right.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.370
It's a beautiful day for us
and I'm so happy and excited

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.040
to be here and I was
watching the film back there

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.140
on the phone they had and
I was watching all that

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.220
and seeing how these
things have happened

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.220
through the years
I'm proud and honored

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.860
to be here today with you.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.980
&gt;&gt; We're honored that you're
here because as you know

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.510
&gt;&gt; Did you want to sit?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.620
&gt;&gt; Would you like to sit?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.040
&gt;&gt; Why not?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.690
&gt;&gt; They've seen us and they
know, because I'm interested

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.810
and I know a lot of our
guests are interested

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.330
in just how all of
this got started!

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.830
What inspired you
to create this?

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.400
This is such a great program.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.020
&gt;&gt; Well actually, the whole
idea, the Imagination Library?

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.800
I guess everybody has their
story and a lot of you may

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.580
or may not know about
me personally,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.710
but I grew up in the smoky
mountains of east Tennessee,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.430
and I grew up in a very large
family, there were 12 of us kids

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.760
and my dad was a very
hard-working man,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.620
he group up in a
family of 14 or 15 kids

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.280
and my dad never had a
chance to go to school.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.490
And daddy not couldn't
read or write

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.750
but he was the smartest
person that I've every known.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.530
He thought he couldn't learn
to read after he was grown,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.760
it was just one of those
things and I had the idea

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.720
to do something special for
him, you know, in the Bible

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.760
where it talks about honor
your father and your mother,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.490
I don't think that necessarily
means just to obey them,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.300
I think it means to bring
honor to their name if you can.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.290
So I got my daddy involved
with this little program.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.750
I wanted him to feel like he
was part of something special.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.770
So we started the
Imagination Library,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.240
where we were giving books to
the children in our home county,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.240
in Sevier County, where
we were born and raised.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.350
We hoped it would do good there.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.700
And it became such a popular
program that the governor

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.390
of Tennessee at that
time thought the idea was

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.080
so great they took it
all over Tennessee.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.270
Later it went on into Canada
and now we're all over the world

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.570
in different parts of the world.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.140
So my dad got to live
long enough to see a lot

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.640
of it come into being.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.730
He took such pride in the fact

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.080
that the little kids
call me the "book lady."

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.590
He was prouder of
that than anything.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.330
So it started from a true
place in my heart and it's done

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.460
so much good for so many
people through the years.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.010
&gt;&gt; How does it feel to be
called the "book lady"?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.360
You do so much, you sing
and write and everything

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.240
but you're known so
much as the "book lady.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.510
Did you ever think you
would be the "book lady"?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.840
&gt;&gt; No. That never crossed
my mind when I was growing

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.230
up because I personally
didn't like school!

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.950
I do more homework now at night
working on all these programs

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.230
than I every did all the
years that I was in school.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.410
I never thought about being the
book lady, the painted lady,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.380
yes, the over-exagerrated,
overdressed lady,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.590
yes but that just goes to show
you, you can't judge a book

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.890
by looking at the cover!

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.770
Right? Or even the 100 Millionth
book by looking at the cover.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.680
&gt;&gt; That's right, you can't tell.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.300
You love books and reading,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.680
so were there books
that shaped you?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.390
You had favorite books?

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.930
&gt;&gt; Well, we didn't have books
in our home because there were

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.360
so many of us kids, and daddy
told us not to bring books home

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.280
because kids just chew
on them, pee on 'em,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.810
and do whatever kids do,
so he said I can't afford

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.540
to you know pay for books.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.400
So we didn't get to bring
books home but one book

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.830
in our home was the Bible and
my mother used to always read

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.520
from the Bible and
tell us Bible stories

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.850
so that was actually the first
book that we had in our home.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.500
And the one that meant the most.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.560
It has followed me more
than any other book

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.200
through my life, actually.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.560
&gt;&gt; And you keep reading it?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.940
&gt;&gt; I do. In fact
I love to read --

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.700
excuse me, I have
tissues, everywhere!

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.830
I need one right now!

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.510
But anyway I loved to read

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.810
and I do whatever it takes you
know...but I actually loved

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.020
anytime I was in school I
loved all the fairy tales,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.390
I wanted to read all the books
about the Kings and the Queens

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.750
and all the traveling so books
have always been a really

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.030
special thing for me.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.280
&gt;&gt; But with your busy schedule
how did you make time to read

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.060
because you were
still performing

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.840
and doing so many things?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.020
&gt;&gt; I always take time to read.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.700
I think for anybody
that does love

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.660
to read you will find
the time to read.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.200
I do some of my best
thinking when I'm readin',

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.910
if you know what I mean.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.720
I read probably at
least 52 books a year.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.020
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.880
&gt;&gt; A book a week I try to read.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.810
So I've just always been a
reader, but there is a part

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.360
of my brain that kinda can think

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.070
of other things while
I am actually reading

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.700
but it does relax my body and
I have always loved to read

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.350
because I think in books,
I think with kids, too,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.980
with the books that they read
it inspires you to dream,

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.430
and if you can dream,
that leads you

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.990
to success and to other things.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.850
That's why I think it's so
important to get the books

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.410
in the hands of all
these special little kids

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.040
so they can start early
and go late with 'em!

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.340
&gt;&gt; And they love it.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.110
So you make time for reading.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:42.270
Does any of the reading help you
with some of your song writing

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.980
and some of the things
that you read about?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.990
&gt;&gt; These are good
questions and yes, it does,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.440
because I'm really inspired
by just people in general.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.790
Just like the little
kids, a lot of things

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:58.560
that I write I have a children's
CD out called "I believe in you"

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.830
and a lot of the songs from
that were inspired by the books

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.860
that are in the Imagination
Library and the Little Engine

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.070
that Could is the
first book that we give

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.460
out in the Imagination Library
and I think it talks about how

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.160
to build confidence and
to know that you can

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.030
if you think you can
so I really am inspired

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.380
by just looking at
these faces today.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.700
I will feel something
or think something

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.660
and who knows what idea it
might trigger in me later

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.190
on to write a song about.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.510
When you write you go by
feelings and what touches you

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.950
and how it touches you
and you find a clever way

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.310
to put it into a song.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.220
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that sometimes
the books can inspire feelings

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.400
and things in children
and I know

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.960
that you started the
library because you believed

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.260
in what books mean and
could mean to children.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.110
I know I've seen it happen
and I've felt it as a child.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.380
&gt;&gt; You of all people would know

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.860
because you've been doing
this for how many years?

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.480
You said long before you got
to this beautiful building!

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.780
&gt;&gt; Too long!

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.450
I remember the books that
inspired me when I was young

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.170
and you believe that, too?

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.810
I really think that --
we're inspired by everything

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.730
and children themselves inspire
me and I'm sure they do you,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.890
that's why you wanted
to work with children.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.400
Because there is such a
world in every little child.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.910
There is a whole world and
they're going to see it

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.190
and make things come true
in their little world

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.740
and they're going to add to the
world as they see fit according

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.610
to their talents and their
little personalities,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.210
that's why it's so important
that they learn to love books

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.090
and learn to read and
be inspired by that.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.880
Because just like with my
dad, My dad couldn't read

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.390
but he really was smart.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.070
He picked up on things
and he was very intuitive.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.100
It's my belief if you can read,
even if you don't have the money

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.340
to go to school, you can
especially anymore --

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.900
you can find a book, if you can
read, on anything that you want

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.670
to know, you can self-educate
yourself and go to college,

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.050
even, you can pick up
those kinds of books even

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.940
if you can't get outside your
house you can find a book

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.760
on any subject and you
can educate yourself

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.830
to where you can
know about things

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.550
and actually just increase
your intelligence and your --

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.910
just the whole world around

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.080
and you inspire other
people with that.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.550
&gt;&gt; And what about owning a book
and saying this is my book!

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.260
It's got my name in it!

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.550
&gt;&gt; That's what I love about
the Imagination Library

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.020
because that was one of
the things we thought was

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.670
so important when
we first started it.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.110
And so we wanted the little
children to have that book.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.300
They get a book for those of you
that don't know the whole thing,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.000
I guess they talked about some
of it, but children get a book

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.140
from the time they're born
they get a book a month

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.990
until they start kindergarten,
they're 5 years old,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.840
so we send a book in the
mail with their name on it,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.600
it's not in care of mom and dad
it's got their little name on it

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.690
and they love to
think this is mine!

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.910
They wait at the mailbox,
get their little book,

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.820
and to them it's personal.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.510
So they're going to
take that in the house

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.320
and make somebody read it to 'em

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.750
because this is my
stuff, my stuff, my stuff!

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.050
(Laughter.)

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.490
&gt;&gt; So I think that has
been a real important thing

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.790
because they also share
it with other kids.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.980
We're so happy we're
such a part of that

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.730
and of all the things
I have done in my life

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.340
and it's been a lot, because
I've been around a long time

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.310
but this is one of the
most precious things

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.130
and the proudest I
am of any program

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.700
that I've ever been involved

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.950
in in my life is working
with the little kids.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:46.240
&gt;&gt; And you should be, because
after getting a book a month

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.680
they're going to have
their own little library.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.910
&gt;&gt; In their houses, this will
be their library and their books

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.270
and they can pull 'em out.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.570
&gt;&gt; And they love that.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.110
They love sharing
that with kids.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:03.980
&gt;&gt; You mentioned, though,
that sometimes you get letters

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.000
that talk about what happens

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.910
after they're not
in the program.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually we get a lot
of letters when the kids are

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.940
in the program, we get letters
all the time from parents

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.910
and kids, but some of the
sweetest letters we get --

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.370
in fact I'll never forget
the first one I got was

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.510
from a little boy
that had graduated

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.650
from the Imagination
Library, he was 6 years old

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.650
and he was bummed out about it!

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.380
He was really mad
because he just wanted me

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.350
to continue to send him books!

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.830
He thought this is just not
fair, this is just not right

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.610
that I can't continue
to get my books!

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.840
That's how important
it is to them.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.820
I wrote him back a sweet letter
and explained how we do it

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.390
and that's why -- he
was being prepared

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.430
because he was using his
mind to think about all that!

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.070
We get a lot of sweet letters

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.680
and we treasure every
one of them.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.960
&gt;&gt; And then he can
get a library card.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah! (Chuckles.)

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.040
&gt;&gt; Did you ever think
you would get

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.390
to 100 million books
when you started.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.930
I mean that's phenomenal!

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.230
&gt;&gt; Not when we started.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.280
Like I said, it was a very
personal thing when we started

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.210
and I just hoped it would
do good in in our county,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.820
and then as I mentioned it
just grew and grew but at

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.310
that time it was something
I was doing for my dad

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.560
and the kids in our home county.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.010
But thank the Lord, he was good!

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.590
And now we've got David
Dodson who is the President

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.890
of the Imagination Library,

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.680
stand up there for
a second, David!

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.980
(Applause.)

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.370
He works so hard and he makes me
look really good, I take a lot

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.140
of credit for a lot
of work that David

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.230
and all these wonderful folks at
the Imagination Library they do.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.380
He travels all over
the world making sure

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.050
that all these wonderful
things happen,

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.800
making sure that all the things
that we brag about can happen.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.670
I just get out and talk about it
and do my part but it's always

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.130
like that with anything
that you're proud of!

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.990
It takes a whole bunch of
people to make things happen

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.310
and we owe the real thing to the
communities and all the people

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.390
that participate,
all the organizations

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.940
that really get involved
and they're really the ones

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.810
that are making my
dreams come true.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.110
It's just one of those things

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.870
that everybody takes
a lot of pride in.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.170
Because if you're
doing something

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.370
with children how can you
not feel good about that!

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.970
Look at 'em?

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.290
Hi there! Hello!

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.360
So, anyway, it's a good
feeling all around,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.080
it's a win-win as they say.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.530
&gt;&gt; As I said, at the
beginning, we are so honored

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.370
that the 100 millionth book
will be given to the Library

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.040
of Congress for our youngsters.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.340
&gt;&gt; We have an unveiling --

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:58.900
&gt;&gt; I want to say how
honored I am before we pull

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.010
that little thing up that
you have taken this to heart

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.310
and that you have taken this in

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.330
and that we will
now have this book

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.910
that I can actually
have here forever

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.540
for all the little children
all over the world certainly

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.850
in the United States
of America here

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.330
in D.C. It's a wonderful
place to have this.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.400
Hopefully through the years we
have 100 million books so far

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.820
and maybe we will be back
for our billionth book,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:32.200
wouldn't that be nice!

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:39.150
You want to see what's
under there?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:46.740
&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful story,
there it is, 100 millionth book!

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.720
&gt;&gt; This is the coat
of many colors

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.450
which is a little story
-- this lady right here,

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.910
let me mention her name, this
is -- what's your name again?

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.210
(Laughter.)

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.510
&gt;&gt; This is the person who drew

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she illustrated
this book

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.110
and we appreciate your
name is Brook Hughes

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.410
and she illustrated
this and I hope you had

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.550
as much fun drawing this
as I did writing it.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.540
&gt;&gt; I did, it was an honor
to be part of the project

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.940
and I loved getting to
illustrate your beautiful song.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.580
&gt;&gt; Everybody loves it, this
song is important to me

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.290
because my mother -- I
was talking about my dad,

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:23.610
my dad was so very important
but my mother to have 12 kids

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.870
and make 'em all feel
special with no money,

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.900
she had all the love
in the world and it's

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.640
about the little story about --

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.900
she told me the story
about Joseph and the coat

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.010
of many colors when she was
making me a little raggedy coat

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.880
that I really needed because
it was getting wintertime

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.180
and I needed it.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.450
So made that and she
just had the foresight

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.800
to give me some pride in it.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.720
To tell me the story about
the coat of many colors

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.640
so this book is more than a
story and it's more than a song,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.060
it's about love,
it's about attitude,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.550
and actually it's turned out
to be an antibullying book.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.110
They use this in some classrooms
to talk about antibullying,

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.230
and I want kids to
know it is okay for you

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.350
to be how you are
and who you are.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.650
It's good to be different.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.370
We can't all be the
same but we have we have

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.070
to love the differences

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.900
and accept the differences
in each other too.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.300
So that's kind of what
this little book is about.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.080
It's just about love
and understanding.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.620
Thank you.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.920
&gt;&gt; And thank you.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.270
I see you have the coat here.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.080
&gt;&gt; This little coat is a
replica of the little coat

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.780
that my mom made for me
because momma used to -

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.850
people used to send us big boxes
of scraps because momma used

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.680
to make all our clothes
and the quilts for our bed

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.700
and the curtains
for our windows,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.160
and she usually made
them out of scraps

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.180
that people would send to us.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.620
This little coat, she just
didn't have enough of one fabric

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.680
to make me a coat so that's
why she used the pieces

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.030
and that inspired her to tell
me the story from the bible.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.540
So that's what this
coat -- we actually --

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.610
this coat, that little song and
the story has lived forever,

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.130
we even had a couple of movies
on TV about the little coat

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.290
and it got good ratings, so
it really shows people are

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.690
about family and they are about
love and it's good to feel

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:13.060
that warmth and that love
about parents because this day

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.470
and time we don't have
enough family stuff,

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.070
there is so much stuff going on
out there that little kids --

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.140
I love being able to touch
the kids and tell them stories

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.790
and for them to feel what
it was like back then

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.420
but it's really how it should
be now as far as the love

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.560
and acceptance and understanding
of not only just others

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.140
but your parents as well.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:40.230
&gt;&gt; Well, we have also
a special announcement.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.580

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.820

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.110
Hello! Hello!

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.410
Hello kiddies!

You want me to read

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.180
You do? Well I'm gonna!

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:59.160
I gotta get my book lady
glasses on though so I can see!

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.170
How's that?

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.260
Do I look like the
book lady now?

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.160
Hi. This is called --
it says Dolly Parton,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.900
that's my name and
what's your name?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.980
Nice to see you, Sammy.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.240
This says "coat of many colors"

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.970
and it's got the little
girl that's supposed to me

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.680
when I little wearing
her coat of many colors.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.950
Let me find my real page here.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.210
So it starts with all these
pretty pictures of my mom

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:35.360
and my dad and my pretty
pictures of my mom and my dad

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.130
and brothers and So it starts
with all these my brothers

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.430
and sisters in here so this says

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:43.110
"Back through the years I
go wanderin' once again back

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.060
to the seasons of my youth.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.040
I recall a box of rags
that someone gave us

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.210
and how my momma put
those rags to use.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.910
There were rags of many colors
but every piece was small.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.450
I didn't have a coat and it
was way down in the fall.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.900
So momma sewed the rags
together, she sewed every piece

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.320
with love and made my
coat of many colors

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.210
that I was so proud of.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:18.060
As momma sewed she told a story
from the Bible she had read

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.420
about a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.630
I hope this coat will bring
you good luck and happiness.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.020
And I couldn't wait to wear it,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.460
and momma blessed
it with a kiss.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:37.140
So with patches on my britches
and holes in both my shoes,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.130
in my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:46.040
Just to find the others laughing
and making fun of me in my coat

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.630
of many colors that
momma made for me.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:55.200
In my coat of many colors
that my momma made for me,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.610
made only from rags but
I wore it so proudly!

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:06.210
Although we had no money,
I was rich as I could be,

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:12.100
in my coat of many
colors momma made for me.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:17.230
So with patches my britches
and holes in both my shoes,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.260
in my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.680
Just to find the others
laughing and making fun of me,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:30.030
in my coat of many colors
that momma made for me.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.770
And I couldn't understand that,
because I felt I was rich!

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.450
I told 'em of the love
momma sewed in every stitch.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.950
I even told 'em all that story
momma told me while she sewed

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.830
and why my coat of many
colors was worth more

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.240
than all their clothes.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:54.150
But they didn't understand it
and I tried to make them see

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.580
that one is only poor
only if they choose to be.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.420
It's true we had no money,
but I was rich as I could be

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:11.050
in my coat of many
colors momma made for me.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:26.130
'Cuz momma made it just for me.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.430
The end. Ta da.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.730
(Applause) Did you like that?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.590
O.K. so there's your
coat of many colors.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.890
