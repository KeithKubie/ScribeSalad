00:00:00.431 --> 00:00:02.430
Now that we know the power
rule, and we saw that

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.670
in the last video, that
the derivative with respect

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.190
to x, of x to the n, is going to
be equal to n times x to the n

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.590
minus 1 for n not equal 0.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.347
I thought I would expose you
to a few more rules or concepts

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:20.680
or properties of derivatives
that essentially will allow

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.860
us to take the derivative
of any polynomial.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.214
So this is powerful
stuff going on.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:26.880
So the first thing I
want to think about

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.420
is, why this little special
case for n not equaling 0?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.750
What happens if n equals 0?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's just think
of the situation.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.880
Let's try to take the
derivative with respect

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.860
to x of x to the 0 power.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.690
Well, what is x to the
0 power going to be?

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.430
And we can assume that x for
this case right over here

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.640
is not equal to 0.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.800
0 to the 0, weird things
happen at that point.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.600
But if x does not
equal 0, what is

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.512
x to the 0 power going to be?

00:00:57.512 --> 00:00:59.970
Well, this is the same thing
as the derivative with respect

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.350
to x of 1.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.069
x to the 0 power is
just going to be 1.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.050
And so what is the derivative
with respect to x of 1?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.020
And to answer that question,
I'll just graph it.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.030
I'll just graph f of
x equals 1 to make

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.170
it a little bit clearer.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.540
So that's my y-axis.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.480
This is my x-axis.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520
And let me graph y equals
1, or f of x equals 1.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.230
So that's 1 right
over there. f of x

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.350
equals 1 is just
a horizontal line.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.120
So that right over
there is the graph,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.870
y is equal to f of x,
which is equal to 1.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.260
Now, remember the derivative,
one way to conceptualize

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.810
is just the slope of the
tangent line at any point.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.040
So what is the slope of the
tangent line at this point?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.370
And actually, what's the
slope at every point?

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.710
Well, this is a line, so
the slope doesn't change.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.710
It has a constant slope.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.293
And it's a completely
horizontal line.

00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:57.500
It has a slope of 0.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.570
So the slope at every
point over here,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.760
slope is going to be equal to 0.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.420
So the slope of this
line at any point

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.470
is just going to be equal to 0.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.800
And that's actually going
to be true for any constant.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.720
The derivative, if I had a
function, let's say that f of x

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.150
is equal to 3.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.580
Let's say that's
y is equal to 3.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.720
What's the derivative
of y with respect

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.080
to x going to be equal to?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.210
And I'm intentionally showing
you all the different ways

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.440
of the notation for derivatives.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.620
So what's the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.730
It can also be
written as y prime.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.610
What's that going
to be equal to?

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.290
Well, it's the slope
at any given point.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.660
And you see that no matter
what x you're looking at,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.580
the slope here is going to be 0.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.140
So it's going to be 0.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.570
So it's not just x to the 0.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.400
If you take the derivative
of any constant,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.095
you're going to get 0.

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:50.970
So let me write that.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.600
Derivative with respect
to x of any constant--

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.790
so let's say of a where this
is just a constant, that's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.720
going to be equal to 0.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.010
So pretty straightforward idea.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.040
Now let's explore a
few more properties.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.370
Let's say I want to take
the derivative with respect

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.380
to x of-- let's use
the same A. Let's say

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.465
I have some constant
times some function.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.090
Well, derivatives
work out quite well.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.070
You can actually take this
little scalar multiplier,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.500
this little constant, and
take it out of the derivative.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.590
This is going to be
equal to A. I didn't

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.230
want to do that magenta color.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.790
It's going to be equal to A
times the derivative of f of x.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.470
Let me do that blue color.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.860
And the other way to denote
the derivative of f of x

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.110
is to just say that
this is the same thing.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.270
This is equal to A times
this thing right over here

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.020
is the exact same
thing as f prime of x.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.890
Now this might all look
like really fancy notation,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.390
but I think if I
gave you an example

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.950
it might make some sense.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.380
So what about if I were to ask
you the derivative with respect

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:28.210
to x of 2 times x
to the fifth power?

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.420
Well, this property
that I just articulated

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.560
says, well, this is going
to be the same thing as 2

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.010
times the derivative of x to the
fifth, 2 times the derivative

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.330
with respect to x
of x to the fifth.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.740
Essentially, I could just
take this scalar multiplier

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.160
and put it in front
of the derivative.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.060
So this right here,
this is the derivative

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.180
with respect to x
of x to the fifth.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.390
And we know how to do
that using the power rule.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.350
This is going to be equal to
2 times-- let me write that.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.600
I want to keep it
consistent with the colors.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.540
This is going to be 2 times the
derivative of x to the fifth.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.400
Well, the power rule
tells us, n is 5.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.990
It's going to be 5x
to the 5 minus 1 or 5x

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.620
to the fourth power.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.130
So it's going to be 5x to
the fourth power, which

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.230
is going to be equal to 2
times 5 is 10, x to the fourth.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.980
So 2x to the fifth,
you can literally just

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.771
say, OK, the power rule
tells me derivative

00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.160
of that is 5x to the fourth.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.180
5 times 2 is 10.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.710
So that simplifies
our life a good bit.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.126
We can now, using the power
rule and this one property,

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.500
take the derivative
anything that

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.910
takes the form Ax
to the n power.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.900
Now let's think about
another very useful

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.770
derivative property.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.644
And these don't just
apply to the power rule,

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.940
they apply to any derivative.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.610
But they are especially
useful for the power rule

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.130
because it allows us to
construct polynomials and take

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.570
the derivatives of them.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.070
But if I were to
take the derivative

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.120
of the sum of two functions--
so the derivative of,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.870
let's say one function
is f of x and then

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.620
the other function is g of x.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.700
It's lucky for us
that this ends up

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.630
being the same thing
as the derivative of f

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.220
of x plus the
derivative of g of x.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.130
So this is the same
thing as f-- actually,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.980
let me use that derivative
operator just to make it clear.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.890
It's the same thing as the
derivative with respect

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.760
to x of f of x plus the
derivative with respect

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.250
to x of g of x.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.340
So we'll put f of
x right over here

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.270
and put g of x right over there.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.870
And so with the
other notation, we

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.260
can say this is going
to be the same thing.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.440
Derivative with respect to x
of f of x, we can write as f

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.790
prime of x.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.810
And the derivative with
respect to x of g of x,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.650
we can write as g prime of x.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.641
Now, once again, this might
look like kind of fancy notation

00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.140
to you.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.740
But when you see an example,
it'll make it pretty clear.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.470
If I want to take the
derivative with respect

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.180
to x of let's say x
to the third power

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.600
plus x to the negative
4 power, this just

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.330
tells us that the
derivative of the sum

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.960
is just the sum of
the derivatives.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.200
So we can take the derivative of
this term using the power rule.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.660
So it's going to be 3x squared.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.140
And to that, we can add the
derivative of this thing right

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.460
over here.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.580
So it's going to
be plus-- that's

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.830
a different shade of blue--
and over here is negative 4.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.720
So it's plus negative 4 times
x to the negative 4 minus 1,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.010
or x to the negative 5 power.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.490
So we have-- and I could
just simplify a little bit.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.020
This is going to be
equal to 3x squared

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.060
minus 4x to the negative 5.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.050
And so now we have all the
tools we need in our toolkit

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.290
to essentially take the
derivative of any polynomial.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.730
So let's give ourselves
a little practice there.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.820
So let's say that I have--
and I'll do it in white.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.400
Let's say that f
of x is equal to 2x

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:25.970
to the third power minus 7x
squared plus 3x minus 100.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.810
What is f prime of x?

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.017
What is the derivative of f
with respect to x going to be?

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.100
Well, we can use the
properties that we just said.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.599
The derivative of
this is just going

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.209
to be 2 times the derivative
of x to the third.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:40.500
Derivative of x to the third
is going to be 3x squared,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.840
so it's just going to
be 2 times 3x squared.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.950
What's the derivative
of negative 7x

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.940
squared going to be?

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.430
Well, it's just going
to be negative 7 times

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.080
the derivative of x
squared, which is 2x.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.837
What is the derivative
of 3x going to be?

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:00.170
Well, it's just going to be
3 times the derivative of x,

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.710
or 3 times the derivative
of x to the first.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.720
The derivative of x to
the first is just 1.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.890
So this is just going
to be plus 3 times--

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.000
we could say 1x to the
0-- but that's just 1.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.500
And then finally, what's
the derivative of a constant

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.240
going to be?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.890
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.402
What's the derivative of
a constant going to be?

00:09:20.402 --> 00:09:22.610
Well, we covered that at
the beginning of this video.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.390
The derivative of
any constant is just

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.990
going to be 0, so plus 0.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.960
And so now we are
ready to simplify.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.610
The derivative of
f is going to be

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.920
2 times 3x squared
is just 6x squared.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.900
Negative 7 times 2x is
negative 14x plus 3.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.720
And we don't have to
write the 0 there.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.630
And we're done.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.404
We now have all the
properties in our tool belt

00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:49.070
to find the derivative
of any polynomial

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.490
and actually things that
even go beyond polynomials.
