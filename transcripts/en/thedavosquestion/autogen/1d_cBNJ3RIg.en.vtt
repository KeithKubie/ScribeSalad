&gt;&gt; 
Does India have the appetite and possibility

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.610
to become a superpower?
The answer is absolutely yes.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.520
But we have a long challenges before even
we could consider ourself on

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.840
the path to becoming a superpower.
We need to address some very critical issue

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.640
in infrastructure, health
care, and education.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.400
And unless these issues are addressed, I do
not think the opportunity

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960
to become a superpower.
But once, if these issues are addressed, that

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.379
would create a domino
effect for a lot of people in India and that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.021
would give us the ability
to compete on a global stage on many issues,

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:50.590
and thus enabling India to
become a new superpower.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.039
Thanks.
