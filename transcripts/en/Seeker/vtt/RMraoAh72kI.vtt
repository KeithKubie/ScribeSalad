00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.060
In comic books and superhero movies changes
to genetic material lead to some prettttty

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.150
strange capabilities!

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.710
But in reality, could altering our genetics
help us rapidly evolve?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.900
Unfortunately for those of us who live in
the real-world, expression of large mutations

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.869
requires evolution: generations of iterative
selection of a specific change.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.760
So, sorry, no single exposure to radioactive
sludge is gonna turn you into a mutant turtle

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.570
with martial arts skills.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.240
We rarely get to see the results of the mutations
that build up in our DNA over a lifetime.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.560
But, if you let yourself start to think about
the fact that the complexity of life we all

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.829
take for granted started out as a collection
of single celled organisms -- we all kinda

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.059
look like superheroes.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.899
So how does a simple cell get to be a complex
creature like you and me?

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.239
Well, one individual cell can’t, but generations
of its descendants, over millions of years,

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.090
making mistakes in replication and reproduction,
of begging, borrowing and stealing similar

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.120
evolutionary solutions, suffering a harrying
gauntlet of selection pressures and environmental

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.469
changes … apparently did.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.220
Early on, like, 1.4 billion years ago early
on, a jump in evolutionary complexity may

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.110
have occurred when a simple single cell engulfed
another simple single cell.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.970
These two cells likely had some genetic variability
between them and so a more complex cell was

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.970
born.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.740
The process of one cell absorbing another
in its entirety is called phagocytosis.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.981
When that happened, the ingested cell didn't
get chewed up and digested -- instead, it

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:30.380
formed a beneficial relationship, with its
devourer.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.450
Endosymbiotic theory suggests that post phagocytosis,
the resultant symbiotic relationship was so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.861
successful (over generations) that the engulfed
cell eventually relied on the host cell to

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:45.660
provide the resources it needed to survive,
and the host cell likely gained the benefit

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.310
of any superpowers its prey may have evolved,
like the ability to generate energy or photosynthesize.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.350
The mitochondria in our own cells and the
chloroplasts required for photosynthesis in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.110
plants may have started out as bacteria with
extraordinary abilities that were engulfed

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.180
by other cells.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.920
These compartments still have minimal circular
genomes that look like bacterial genomes,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.310
evidence for the hypothesis that they were
once independent.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.230
I wish I could say that this approach to symbiosis
worked in complex systems but sadly it is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.969
limited to simple, single celled organisms.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.459
So if you were wondering, eating a spider,
even a radioactive one, will not give you

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.180
the ability to swing around skyscrapers and
climb walls on your fingertips.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.409
There is evidence, however, that more complex
genomes can benefit from contact with foreign

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.409
genes.

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.489
One example of this is a protein called Arc.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.450
Arc works very similarly to the viral coat
proteins of retroviruses like HIV.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.150
It assembles together to create an envelope
that carries RNA between cells.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.590
This is how retroviruses infect their hosts.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.940
In mice and possibly in humans, the behavior
is essential for memory formation.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.930
It’s likely that our version of Arc came
from a virus that infected a cell long ago

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.109
-- and now we can’t form memories without
it!

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.109
Why?

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.400
Scientists aren’t yet sure -- but our neurons
need the ability to shuttle RNA back and forth

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.680
like viruses.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.530
The capability is evidence of horizontal gene
transfer -- vertical gene transfer is direct

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.930
inheritance, horizontal is when weird stuff
like this happens.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.840
There is an obvious evolutionary benefit to
creating diversity through random genetic

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.040
events and nature has many mechanisms through
which to ensure that it beta tests a wide

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.260
variety of genetic variations.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.810
The lucky ones will persist in the population
and likely confer some survival and/or reproductive

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.659
advantage to it’s carriers, and we may never
know they’re there.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.340
It is unlikely that a random event will lead
to the development of superpowers overnight,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.180
and we’re still waiting for modern gene
therapy to go mainstream.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.950
But, right now, it is highly likely that you
are already a mutant experiment of nature

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.969
who will pass down the primitive building
blocks of some superpower to future generations

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.480
of your offspring.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.409

And Fun Fact: human male mtDNA self destructs
upon fertilization so we inherit 100% of our

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.299
mitochondrial DNA from our mothers The powerhouse
of the cell, ladies.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.779
Thanks for watching Seeker.
