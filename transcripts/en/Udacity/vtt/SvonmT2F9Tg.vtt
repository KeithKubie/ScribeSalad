00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.570
Ticket type. Are they buying VIP or general admission?

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.620
&gt;&gt; Yep. Maybe number of tickets purchased, or I guess

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.390
you can infer that based off of ticket type. Yeah

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.580
&gt;&gt; Let's not make them do that.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.370
&gt;&gt; Maybe the purchase source, cause they

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.740
care where most of their stuff's coming from?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
&gt;&gt; Sure. Sure.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;&gt; But yeah, you can keep modifying this, like, Save As, do a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.780
couple different reports showing different data if

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.040
you had a lot of different fields.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, so should I save this now?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt; So yeah, let's save it for now. but we want to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.730
keep going.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.170
&gt;&gt; So what we're doing here basically we're, our goal is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.170
to make this, this you know gauge this little odometer looking thing.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.310
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. But, as long as we're making this report, we're just, kind

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.470
of, figuring out all of the information that might be relevant to convey.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.000
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.
