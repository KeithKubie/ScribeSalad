00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.655
 We have a blank space plus 1/16 

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:06.451
 equal to 3/2. 

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.658
 I recommend that you stop the video and understand yourself 

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:09.841
 what's in the empty place. 

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.033
 How many plus 1/16 is equal to 3/2? 

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:15.300
 All right. 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.844
 Let's solve it together. 

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.864
 Something that maybe will simplify things, 

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:21.882
 is to express 1/16 

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.958
 and 3/2 with a common denominator. 

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.746
 When we think of a common denominator, 

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.302
 we are looking for a number that is multiple 

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:29.788
 of the denominators here. 

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.340
 To our luck 16 is divided into 2. 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.707
 At 16, so this is the common multiple, 

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:39.330
 or at least a total of multiple of 16 and 2. 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.304
 There are other numbers that are generally multiples, but the least 

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:45.124
 of them is 16 by 1, which is divided into 2. 

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.504
 Let's try both 

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:48.455
 fractions. 

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.138
 Let's write this equation so that these fractions 

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:52.983
 have a denominator 16. 

00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:54.503
 This is obviously recorded like this. 

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:56.060
 Let's save this. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.218
 We'll get 

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:02.152
 empty space plus 1/16, 

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:05.210
 1/16, 

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:08.815
 equal to, to see, 

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:12.297
 to write 3/2 as something on 16. 

00:01:12.297 --> 00:01:15.037
 To get a denominator 16 of 2, 

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:18.310
 we have to multiply by 8. 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.073
 Then we have to multiply the numerator by 8. 

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:25.135
 3 by 8 equals 24. 

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.551
 At this point you can do it in your mind. 

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:31.370
 Blank space plus 1/16 is equal to 24/16. 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.261
 We can say, well, this can ... 

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.828
 We can count this as a sixteenth number. 

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.789
 How many sixteen plus 1/16 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.110
 will be equal to 24/16? 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.931
 Well 23/16. 

00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:47.565
 That's 23/16, I add 1/16 

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.153
 and I get 24/16. 

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:52.034
 Another way to think about it 

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:52.869
 is when ... 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:53.973
 In fact, we have already done so 

00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:56.005
 in the first step, you can say, 

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:59.731
 that if something plus 1/16 is equal to 3/2, 

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.775
 you can say that this empty place 

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:06.355
 will be equal to 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.133
 3/2 

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:14.370
 minus 1/16. 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.006
 This is another way to solve the problem. 

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.466
 If something plus 1/16 is equal to 3/2, 

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:21.928
 then this thing will be equal to 3/2 

00:02:21.928 --> 00:02:24.250
 minus 1/16. 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.487
 And we know it will be equal to ... 

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:30.031
 3/2, we already know that 

00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.691
 is equal to 24/16. 

00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:36.573
 So 24/16 minus 1/16, 

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:41.002
 which we have already seen, 

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.931
 that is 23/16, which is equal to ... 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.099
 I will write it again, 23 on 16. 

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.421
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.189
 Here is a little different. 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.712
 I have an empty space minus 3/4 equal to 2/3. 

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:00.725
 There are several ways to think about it. 

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:04.058
 If an empty space minus 3/4 is equal to 2/3, 

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:06.263
 one way to think about this is to say, 

00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:11.162
 that the empty space will be equal to 

00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:14.146
 2/3 plus 3/4. 

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.541
 2/3 plus 3/4. 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.755
 Plus 3/4. 

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:26.262
 How will this be equal? 

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.404
 Again, I can write down the two fractions 

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:30.309
 with a common denominator. 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.593
 Which is the smallest total of 3 and 4? 

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:36.774
 I can check the multiples at 4 and continue 

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:38.829
 to increase them until I find a number, 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.651
 which is divided into 3 without residue. 

00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:42.544
 4 is not divisible by 3. 

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:44.308
 8 is not divisible by 3. 

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.074
 12 is divided into 3. 

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.453
 In fact, 12 is 3 in 4. 

00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:51.192
 Then I can write the two fractions as something on 12. 

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:53.474
 This will be equal to ... 

00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:56.625
 To get 12 out of 3, we multiply by 4. 

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.587
 We must multiply by 4 and the numerator. 

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:00.712
 2 in 4 is 8. 

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:03.464
 2/3 equals 8/12. 

00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:07.225
 This will be equal to 8/12 plus, 

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:09.569
 and 3/4 will be equal to 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.566
 how much on 12? 

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:14.410
 To get 12 out of 4, we need to multiply by 3, 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.349
 so we have to multiply by 3 and the numerator. 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.671
 3 in 3 is 9. 

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.760
 How will this be equal? 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.582
 Equals to what is equal to 

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:26.565
 8/12 plus 9/12, which will be 

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.562
 8 plus 9 - 17. 

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.744
 17/12. 

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:34.459
 You get 17/12 minus 3/4 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.688
 is equal to 2/3. 

00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:38.325
 Another way you can do this, 

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:39.985
 is to keep it as it was, 

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.760
 and say, well, let me write 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.848
 this, but I will write it down, 

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:48.448
 by putting together a common denominator of fractions. 

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:50.247
 We have already said that the common denominator, 

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.141
 which we will use is 12, the smallest. 

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:55.564
 We can use 24 or something bigger. 

00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:57.283
 But this is the smallest common multiple, 

00:04:57.283 --> 00:04:59.140
 which will make things a little simpler. 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.765
 And 3/4, we'll write them down 

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.309
 such as 9/12. 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.878
 9 on 12 is equal to ... 

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.558
 A 2/3 we can record as 8 on 12. 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.315
 You can assume it will be 

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:14.998
 some number twelve. 

00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:20.402
 Blank space on 12 minus 9/12 is equal to 8/12. 

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.076
 If I have an empty space from something minus 9 of this thing 

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:26.328
 and I'm left 8 of this thing, 

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:29.428
 it will mean that at the beginning I have 17 of this thing. 

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.352
 17/12 minus 9/12 equals 8/12. 

00:05:33.352 --> 00:05:37.584
 In both cases you get 17/12.
