I think as you move to the upper ranks

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690
I think as you move to the upper ranks
 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.240
I think as you move to the upper ranks
of science ranks being positions of

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250
of science ranks being positions of
 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.669
of science ranks being positions of
influence and access you see fewer

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679
influence and access you see fewer
 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.390
influence and access you see fewer
female faces and I think the basic

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400
female faces and I think the basic
 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.700
female faces and I think the basic
reason is the same reason that you don't

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710
reason is the same reason that you don't
 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.630
reason is the same reason that you don't
see a lot of female faces in Congress or

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640
see a lot of female faces in Congress or
 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.390
see a lot of female faces in Congress or
on the Supreme Court or on the directing

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.579

think there are fundamental power

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589
think there are fundamental power

imbalances between the sexes that play

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350
imbalances between the sexes that play
 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.689
imbalances between the sexes that play
themselves out in society and I think

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699
themselves out in society and I think
 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.770
themselves out in society and I think
science is just not immune to that which

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780
science is just not immune to that which
 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.750
science is just not immune to that which
actually isn't a very controversial

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760
actually isn't a very controversial
 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.569
actually isn't a very controversial
stance if you think about it

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579
stance if you think about it
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.119
stance if you think about it
science is performed by people and it's

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129
science is performed by people and it's
 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.540
science is performed by people and it's
subject to all the various foibles that

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550
subject to all the various foibles that
 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.100
subject to all the various foibles that
plague the rest of our social dynamics

you know believe it or not I don't have

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700
you know believe it or not I don't have
 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.540
you know believe it or not I don't have
very controversial views on the subject

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550
very controversial views on the subject
 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.710
very controversial views on the subject
I always go back to basic questions we

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720
I always go back to basic questions we
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.900
I always go back to basic questions we
asked about women's labor because

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910
asked about women's labor because
 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.210
asked about women's labor because
working in science is performing labor

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220
working in science is performing labor
 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.390
working in science is performing labor
and performing it as a woman is women's

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400
and performing it as a woman is women's
 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.130
and performing it as a woman is women's
labor and one of the very first

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140
labor and one of the very first
 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.710
labor and one of the very first
questions we always ask about women's

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720
questions we always ask about women's
 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.860
questions we always ask about women's
labor is is it safe and so I've spoken

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870
labor is is it safe and so I've spoken
 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.520
labor is is it safe and so I've spoken
about how women laboring in the science

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530
about how women laboring in the science
 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.010
about how women laboring in the science
are not working in safe spaces all of

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020
are not working in safe spaces all of
 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.140
are not working in safe spaces all of
the time

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150
the time
 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.380
the time
that's just question number one you know

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390
that's just question number one you know
 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.240
that's just question number one you know
are we safe while we're trying to learn

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250
are we safe while we're trying to learn
 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.630
are we safe while we're trying to learn
are we safe while we're trying to work

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
are we safe while we're trying to work
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.630
are we safe while we're trying to work
there are a few things about science

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
there are a few things about science
 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.890
there are a few things about science
that are special women live in a world

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900
that are special women live in a world
 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.010
that are special women live in a world
where we are forced to consider our

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
where we are forced to consider our
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.470
where we are forced to consider our
safety at every turn

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480
safety at every turn
 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.340
safety at every turn
you know we minimize risk while we

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
you know we minimize risk while we
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.069
you know we minimize risk while we
maximize activity it's this constant

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079
maximize activity it's this constant
 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.720
maximize activity it's this constant
balancing act that we do

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
balancing act that we do
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.820
balancing act that we do
now in science we go we also go to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
now in science we go we also go to
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.100
now in science we go we also go to
unfamiliar places and we do things that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
unfamiliar places and we do things that
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750
unfamiliar places and we do things that
haven't been done before and we work

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
haven't been done before and we work
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.509
haven't been done before and we work
alone in buildings late at night and we

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
alone in buildings late at night and we
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.360
alone in buildings late at night and we
move through groups of people that are

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
move through groups of people that are
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.449
move through groups of people that are
largely dominated by men and all of

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
largely dominated by men and all of
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.309
largely dominated by men and all of
those things present special

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319
those things present special
 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.869
those things present special
consideration for the safety of women's

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879
consideration for the safety of women's
 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.000
consideration for the safety of women's
spaces so I think there are some

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
spaces so I think there are some
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.430
spaces so I think there are some
specific things in science that come

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
specific things in science that come
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.240
specific things in science that come
into play

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
into play
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.559
into play
I think step number two after we asked

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569
I think step number two after we asked
 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.569
I think step number two after we asked
whether women are safe is what are the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579
whether women are safe is what are the
 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.080
whether women are safe is what are the
legal protections that are in place what

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
legal protections that are in place what
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.569
legal protections that are in place what
are the institutional and civil

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579
are the institutional and civil
 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.420
are the institutional and civil
protections in place to defend women's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
protections in place to defend women's
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.699
protections in place to defend women's
safety within their workspaces

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
safety within their workspaces
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.180
safety within their workspaces
I think young women often don't know

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
I think young women often don't know
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.580
I think young women often don't know
what the sexual harassment policy is at

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
what the sexual harassment policy is at
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.559
what the sexual harassment policy is at
their University or is at their place of

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
their University or is at their place of
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.190
their University or is at their place of
work they may not know the details of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
work they may not know the details of
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.069
work they may not know the details of
title 9 how title 9 protects their

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079
title 9 how title 9 protects their
 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.819
title 9 how title 9 protects their
educational experience I would say that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
educational experience I would say that
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.970
educational experience I would say that
learning those details and considering

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
learning those details and considering
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.750
learning those details and considering
what recourse might be is a useful

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
what recourse might be is a useful
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.470
what recourse might be is a useful
exercise it's probably more useful than

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480
exercise it's probably more useful than
 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.839
exercise it's probably more useful than
some kind of seminar that advises you on

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849
some kind of seminar that advises you on
 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.330
some kind of seminar that advises you on
how to modify your behavior so that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
how to modify your behavior so that
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.360
how to modify your behavior so that
you're less likely to provoke harassing

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
you're less likely to provoke harassing
 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.150
you're less likely to provoke harassing
behavior or something like that you know

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160
behavior or something like that you know
 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.409
behavior or something like that you know
learn what the regulations and laws are

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419
learn what the regulations and laws are
 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:52.120
learn what the regulations and laws are
that protect you so that if you have to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130
that protect you so that if you have to
 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.069
that protect you so that if you have to
you can make difficult choices with

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079
you can make difficult choices with
 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.119
you can make difficult choices with
awareness I think that's the responsible

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129
awareness I think that's the responsible
 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.369
awareness I think that's the responsible
advice to give women as they start to

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379
advice to give women as they start to
 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.319
advice to give women as they start to
labor within these spaces

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329
labor within these spaces
 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.520
labor within these spaces
I really do we are more open about

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530
I really do we are more open about
 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.020
I really do we are more open about
sexual harassment and sexual assault

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030
sexual harassment and sexual assault
 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.629
sexual harassment and sexual assault
than we used to be and I think that can

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639
than we used to be and I think that can
 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.300
than we used to be and I think that can
be regarded as a victory in its own

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310
be regarded as a victory in its own
 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.960
be regarded as a victory in its own
right

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
right
 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.950
right
I think combating isolation around

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
I think combating isolation around
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.350
I think combating isolation around
these issues is important and I think

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360
these issues is important and I think
 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.719
these issues is important and I think
the internet for example has connected

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
the internet for example has connected
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.339
the internet for example has connected
women in ways which they weren't

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349
women in ways which they weren't
 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.409
women in ways which they weren't
connected before and so it's become a

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
connected before and so it's become a
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.129
connected before and so it's become a
critical tool in allowing for the

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139
critical tool in allowing for the
 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.809
critical tool in allowing for the
informal communication that facilitates

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819
informal communication that facilitates
 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.870
informal communication that facilitates
behavior that's not formalized because

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880
behavior that's not formalized because
 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.629
behavior that's not formalized because
it's officially in theory wrong or

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639
it's officially in theory wrong or
 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.270
it's officially in theory wrong or
condemned etc but I think we have to be

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280
condemned etc but I think we have to be
 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.820
condemned etc but I think we have to be
very explicit that that's what we're

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
very explicit that that's what we're
 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.749
very explicit that that's what we're
doing and that combating isolation is

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759
doing and that combating isolation is
