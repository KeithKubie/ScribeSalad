00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.040
We are on problem number 12.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.890
Problem 12.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.615
OK, what is the greatest of five
consecutive integers if

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:10.750
the sum of these integers
is 185?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.630
So what is the greatest?

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.160
Let's assume x is the greatest.
And they're

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.220
consecutive integers, so what's
the second greatest?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580
Well, that would be x minus 1.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.462
The third greatest would
be x minus 2.

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:24.960
x minus 3.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.050
x minus 4, right?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.590
These are five consecutive
integers where x is the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.350
largest, right?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.460
If x was 150, x minus 4 would
be-- these numbers would be

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.820
150, 149, 148, 147, 146
like that, right?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.140
So these are consecutive
integers, x is the largest.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.100
And they're telling us
that the sum is 185.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.720
So the sum is equal to 185.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.850
So what is this sum?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220
How do sum these up?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.100
So we have five x's, right?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.210
So get 5x.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.180
And then what's minus 1, minus
2, minus 3, minus 4?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.700
So 1 plus 2 is 3, 3 plus 3 is--
this is where I always

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.730
mess up-- 3 plus 3 6, 6
plus 4 is 10, right?

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.060
So you get 5x minus 10
is equal to 185.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.770
Add 10 to both sides.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.160
5x is equal to 195.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.390
And you could eyeball this, you
could say well, how many

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.230
times does 5 go into 200, and
it's going to be 1 less than

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.480
that, right?

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.740
Five goes into 200, what, if
it goes into it 40 times,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.470
it'll be 39 or you can divide.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.090
If you didn't want to do it that
way, you could say 5 goes

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.680
into 195, 3 times 5 is 15.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.600
45, 39.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.140
So that's our answer, x is 39.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.690
It's the largest of the
consecutive numbers.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.510
So those numbers are
39, 38, 37, 36, 35.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.370
Those are our five consecutive
numbers.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.620
Next problem.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.590
Problem 13.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.770
A salesman's monthly gross pay
consists of $1,200 plus 20

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.230
percent of the dollar
amount of the sales.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.070
So plus 20 percent
of the sales, s

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.460
I'll say is for sales.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.430
If his gross pay for one month
was $2,500, what was the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.230
dollar amount of the sales
for that month?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.670
Well when I read it, I
essentially set up this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.420
equation, right?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.570
His compensation is $1,200 plus
20 percent of the sales.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.765
And we know that that equals
$2,500 in this month.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.250
So let's subtract $1,200
from both sides.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.890
So you get 0.2s is equal
to $1,300, right?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.410
And so s is equal to $1,300
divided by 0.2.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.620
And the way I like to think
about this, 0.2, instead of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.110
having to do this decimal, which
you could do, is I could

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.310
have rewritten this.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.740
20 percent is the same
thing as 1/5, right?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.800
So it's also 1/5 s is
equal to $1,300.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.790
And now this is easy.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.450
Multiply both sides by 5, you
get s is equal to $1,300 times

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.630
5, which equals what?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.660
Thirteen times 5 is 65,
and add the two 0's.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.430
So s is equal to $6,500.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.730
So that's the monthly
sales that month.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.260
I was a little redundant with
the word "monthly" just now.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.510
Next problem.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.790
Problem 14.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.520
OK, so they've drawn a circle.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:56.050
And then, let's see, they've
told us that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.850
this is, let's see.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:11.800
They tell us that this
is 40 degrees.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.880
Let's see, Naomi makes
silver jewelry.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.690
For one style of earring, she
cuts wedges from a silver

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.860
disk, which I guess is depicted
here, as shown in the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.410
figure above.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.990
Each wedge makes a 40-degree
angle at the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.380
center of the disk.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.910
If the weight of each uncut
disk is a uniformly

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.070
distributed 2.5 grams-- that's
how much this whole silver

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.950
disk-- I should've done it in
grey instead of magenta

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.940
because it's silver, but
anyway-- how many grams does

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.220
each wedge weigh?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220
So we essentially just have to
figure out what fraction of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.510
the entire circle
is each wedge?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.860
Well, each wedge
is 40 degrees.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.500
How many degrees are in
the entire circle?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.880
Hopefully it's second nature to
you right now, but there's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.160
360 degrees in an entire
circle, right?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.070
So the wedge is what fraction
of the entire circle?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.960
Each wedge is 40 over 360
of the entire circle.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.120
And that's what?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.460
That's equal to 1/9.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.600
Divide the top and the
bottom by 40, right?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.150
Four goes into 36,
right, 9 times.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.640
So each wedge is 1/9 of the
entire circle, and I just did

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.780
that based on the fact
that it's 40

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.890
degrees over 360 degrees.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.170
So if each wedge is 1/9 of the
entire silver piece and the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.536
silver piece weights 2.5 grams,
then each wedge will

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:43.470
weigh 1/9 times 2.5
grams, right?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.120
And if we want to write 2.5 as a
fraction, how do we do that?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.740
That might be convenient
right now.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.190
Well, I'll tell you, that's
the same thing.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.580
And you could multiply it out,
and that's all fine, but you

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.410
could also recognize that 2.5
can also be written as 9/4.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.860
Oh no, no it can't, sorry.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.410
2.5 can be written as 5/4.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.660
No.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.220
I'm pathetic.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.940
2.5 can be written
as 10/4, right?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.990
Because four goes into
10 two times.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.140
Why am I even writing 10/4?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.260
See, my brain is
malfunctioning.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.950
2.5 can be written as
5/2, which is 10/4.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.560
I was somehow thinking of the
number 9, and I'm not going to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.530
make excuses for my deficits.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.950
Anyway.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.990
So what's 1/9 times 5/2?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.440
It's 5/18.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.500
So each wedge is going to
weight 5/18 of a gram.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.930
The other option is you could
have divided 2.5 by 9 and you

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.940
would have gotten another
answer with decimals.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.260
Either one would have
worked because these

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.770
are free answer questions.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.870
Next problem.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.075
Can you actually use
a calculator on

00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:00.240
the SAT these days?

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.250
If you can, that would've
been an option as well.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.940
Problem 15.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.280
If x squared minus y squared is
equal to 10 and x plus y is

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.610
equal to 5, what is x minus y?

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.700
Before I even read the rest of
the question, when I saw this,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.540
it should be like your knee-jerk
reaction when you

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.080
take the SAT.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.500
When you see x squared minus y
squared equals 10, well that's

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.590
the same thing as x plus
y times x minus

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.100
y is equal to 10.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.850
You just factor this difference
of squares

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.700
immediately.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.860
You almost can do that
before you read

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.450
the rest of the question.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.430
And they tell us what's
x plus y?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.210
x plus y is 5.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.950
So 5 times x minus
y is equal to 10.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:49.320
Divide both sides by 5, you get
x minus y is equal to 2.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.860
That's it.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.110
Next problem.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.400
So they draw us--
let me color.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.150
So they draw us a rectangle.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.840
And then within that rectangle
there is another rectangle.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.030
It looks like this.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.180
Another square, really.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.340
And what I've drawn doesn't look
that much like a square,

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.770
but it's close enough,
I think.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.000
You get the idea.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.050
And this is, I see, a right
angle, right angle, right

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.380
angle, right angle.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.790
They tell us that this
distance is 2,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.110
this distance is 3.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:38.090
In the figure above, what is the
area of the shaded square?

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.159
So this is a bit of a trick.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.350
And actually, let me do it in
the next video so I can kind

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.610
of delve deeper into
the trick.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.490
I'll see you in the
next video.
