PAUL SAXMAN: Hello, and welcome
to this week's episode

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.970
of Google Maps Developers
Live.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.990
I'm Paul Saxman, and this week
I'm going to talk about

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.270
Mapping With Style, or
more commonly known

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.882
as Google Maps Styles.

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.590
And talk about ways that you
can actually take your Map,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.510
your Google Map, and your
website, style it to make it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.490
kind of fit your data, or your
website's look and feel.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.750
I've taken actually a few of the
styles that I put together

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.310
recently for--

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.360
you might have seen in the last
couple of weeks-- for the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.700
ship visualizations.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.890
Kind of show you those and how
to put those together.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.000
Talk a little bit about why
I picked certain styling

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.060
constraints.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.360
And show you this tool that
I've been working on for

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.170
evaluating these styles--

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.240
and hopefully a tool that we
can make publicly available

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060
before too long.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.970
Before I get into that,
however, one quick

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.590
announcement is that the Google
Places API Developer

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.630
Challenge has two weeks
remaining for submissions.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.690
So if you're working on an
application for the challenge,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.170
now's your chance to-- or now's
the time to get in.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.060
There's two weeks for
submission, I think it's the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.900
last day of November.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.170
And yeah, we've seen a lot of
great submissions so far, but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.350
we're definitely looking forward
to seeing any more.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.370
So please, submit away.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.660
And so with that, let me get
into the visualizations a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.410
little bit.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.810
If we can take a look
at my screen here.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.300
So if you've been tuning into
the show, or use Google Maps,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.420
this will probably
look familiar, at

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
least the map itself.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.400
This is a unstyled Google Map.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.320
So it's basically just a basic
interface that you get with--

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.820
you can embed it in a website
with a few lines of code.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.390
Stuff around the periphery
are little

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.420
controls that I've added.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.760
I'll talk about these, and how I
added these in a little bit.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.200
But one thing that I did here,
I got two little things in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.180
this interface.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.870
One is this little
styles pull up.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.890
These are five of my
favorite styles.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.730
And you can tell that I'm not
quite a designer, because none

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.990
of these styles have any
real color to them.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.660
I'm kind of a monochrome
designer.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.060
But I've actually played around
with a couple of these

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.910
with different color palates,
and I'll talk about how you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.410
can swap out black
for other colors.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.120
The other thing that I have in
this interface here is, I put

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.250
this-- this is a ACE Editor.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.930
So as I switch these styles we
can actually look at the code

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.020
real time--

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.060
actually, the map style.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.100
So I'm just taking whatever map
style and applying to the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.230
map, and dropping it in this
little code box here.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.010
And these little buttons
over on the top

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.620
left, these are for--

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.700
I'm just testing different
things in my visualization.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.500
So this whole side I put
together in probably

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.990
about a days time.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.130
And like I said, hopefully
we can--

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.790
if you guys think it looks
useful or interesting--

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.530
productize it.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.170
But the other thing I did more
recently is, I put in this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.735
little interface here, so we
can look for different--

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:25.050
this uses the Google Places
API AutoComplete, you just

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.370
search for a place, and
it will actually

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.060
take you right there.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.680
So with that, let's take a look
at some of these styles.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.690
And so the first style that I
put together, I don't know

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.430
what I'm calling any of these
styles necessarily.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.060
But you get rid of
the style bar--

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.370
so this is what I call the,
well, I'm just calling it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.740
pale, or the no-color style.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.120
So basically what I've done
is I've built this style

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.500
particularly for urban
visualization.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.970
So if you want to do something
like show a heat map for

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.770
density, let's say traffic
density or population density,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.820
I think this is actually really
a nice map to use

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.340
because your data actually
really sits out on kind of the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.900
desaturated map background.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.610
And also, the important thing
about this is, specifically

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.530
for urban visualization, all the
other information such as

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.140
the roads, and the
neighborhoods, and place

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.860
names, they're all
still in the map.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.270
So this actually has all the
same information as this map,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.090
except it's desaturated and some
of the colors are kind of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.140
tweaked a little bit.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.510
So all the information is there,
it's just desaturated.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.100
So you can do things like
render heat map.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.330
One thing I did in this
tool is, I just put a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.150
little heat map thing.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.610
So I can click on the--

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.470
let's draw something.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.070
Actually I'm kind
of way off now.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.920
So we can actually see what
a heat map looks on this

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.450
visualization.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.920
The heat map's not a
default heat map.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.830
I've actually done things like
blown up the radius a little

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.790
bit so you can actually
see it.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.050
Otherwise the points are a
little bit small on the map.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.850
And that's also, if I hit this
a couple times, I have a few

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.890
different heat map styles
that I kind of like.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.250
And actually this one, I call
this the kind of rainbow

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.640
pastel heat map.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.860
I've just basically taken all
the primary colors, and kind

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.830
of bumped up the other color so
it fits a nice pastel, and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.850
rank that from blue up to red.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.610
This is another one.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.040
So this is the heat map gradient
that I used for the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.120
ship's visualization.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.650
This is just kind of
a fierier hot.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.700
And this is actually
one I kind of like.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.150
It's kind of muted, but I
haven't gotten confirmation

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.340
that anybody else likes it.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.180
But it's just a red
to beige gradient.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.650
It's a little bit muted, so a
little less intense as the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.900
other ones.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.780
So if we go back to even the
default heat map, we toggle

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.690
between style.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.950
Obviously since there's a lot of
color in heat map, you can

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.010
see that it really sticks out on
the desaturated background.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.070
Another thing that's really
interesting about this one--

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.560
I'll move off centered
a little bit--

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.520
is that default map markers
actually stick out

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.700
quite a bit as well.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.770
So you can see the red marker
with the kind of grey shadow

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.560
fits really well with the
desaturated background.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.670
With the other red information
in the map less sticks out a

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.150
little less with the
standard map style.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.020
The code for the-- let's
go back to the style--

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.730
this was actually relatively
straightforward to build.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.580
What I did is actually just take
saturation for the entire

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.150
map down 100%.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.710
So that's just getting
rid of all the color.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.040
I actually made the water
a little darker.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.950
When you desaturate everything,
things start to

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.580
blend in a little bit so.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.910
So then you actually have to
start tweaking lightness to

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.150
actually build up contrast
between the different pieces

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.450
of information in your map.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.000
So the water lightness I dropped
down about 30 points.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The water labels, I actually
brought those up a little bit.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.360
None on this map, but you
can trust me they're--

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.650
make it a little more visible.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.500
The roads, and the parks,
the points of interest--

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.130
so the roads I actually brought
up the lightness to

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.460
make them a little less visible,
because the roads are

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.720
actually in kind of a
white background.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.760
Or the map, when you desaturate
it, has kind of a

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.840
whitish gray background.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.100
So bringing up the lightness is
going to make them a little

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.580
less apparent.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.000
Same thing with the parks,
I actually brought the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.450
brightness up quite a bit.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.160
So you can see maybe around
some of these

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.700
parks in the town.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.000
The one thing I'd probably, if
I were going to actually use

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.090
this in production code
though, or this map in

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.770
production, I'd probably want to
actually tweak the road or

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.260
the park lightness
a little bit.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.480
Because if we do zoom out,
especially where there's a lot

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.850
of roads, you can kind of see
it gets a little bit blurry.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.960
Not super useful.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.270
As you zoom in though, I think
it does a really nice job of

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.450
showing the various roads.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.320
And that's actually another
trick you can actually do with

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.280
these visualizations,
with these maps.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.180
If you pick a particular style,
and you like it at a

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.450
certain level, and the other
levels they don't look as

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.325
good, what you can do is you can
actually constrain the min

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:23.970
and max view of the map.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.240
So you can say that you don't
want the map to zoom out into

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.440
one of the zoom levels, it
doesn't look really good.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.580
And like I said, this style
was designed for urban

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.900
visualizations, or urban maps.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.330
So I might just want to
constrain it to a lower zoom

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.310
level, and not let users zoom
all the way out to the

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.650
regional level.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.600
The last thing that I put in
here-- actually I turned the

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.420
terrain off.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.060
And so you've been following--

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.900
we added terrain to the default
maps not too long ago.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.150
And let's see if we get a
good picture of that.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.435
Heat map's a little
bit distracting.

00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:04.290
I'm going to turn that guy
off, and the marker.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.878
And so terrain, if we go back
to the default style--

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:13.180
not too much around Paris.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.320
But if we--

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.160
let's just go back to San
Francisco, because I know

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.835
there's a lot of terrain
around San Francisco.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.800
So yeah, the terrain up here in
the Golden Gate Recreation

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.690
Area, the Muir Woods area--

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.580
so with this first style
that I had actually,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.560
we turn that off.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.520
On to the next style.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.740
So let's bring our pull up
here, and go to this one.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.480
So this one actually, the
purpose for this one was to

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.495
show roads and transit a
little more prominent.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.495
Just looking at the map, you
can see I've desaturated--

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:59.510
or actually brought the
lightness up on the

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.710
background, or the base of the
map, and actually brought the

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.495
roads a little bit forward, and
also obviously got rid of

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:07.020
all the labels.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.260
So you see with the-- this
is the default style.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.620
When we switch over to this
new style, roads actually

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.740
really stick out quite
a bit more.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.380
And the reason I did this is
actually I wanted to look at

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.820
transit information.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.830
So here I have the transit
layer on top of the map.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.545
This one actually looks really
good in Paris as well, so go

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.670
back to Paris.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.410
Also Japan looks great,
because they

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.090
have really nice transit.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.060
But you can see the transit
lines stick out really nicely.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.270
So if you're building a
visualization around roads or

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.030
transit, a simple
thing to do--

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.290
just, if we go to this--

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.650
this is a pretty short style.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.710
So I've simplified everything
in the map.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.170
I mean, that does
things like--

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:52.030
simplify generally gets rid of
the strokes around a lot of

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.210
the features on the map.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.180
I turned all the labels off, so
that's getting rid of all

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.870
the text on the map.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.220
The landscape geometry, I
brought up the lightness.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.140
And that's actually making it
a little less apparent, or

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.490
faded-looking.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.915
I guess I could also use
saturation as another way I

00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:10.400
could approach that.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.140
The terrain, I turned the
terrain off like I did with

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.650
the other map.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.320
Road geometry, so that's
actually the roads themselves,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.510
I actually made sure those
were on, and not in a

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.430
simplified mode, and then
brought their lightness up.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.550
A couple other things--
oh, local roads.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.150
So you see, if I zoom in here
and switch back to here, you

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.360
can see the local roads that
are in white on the default

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.690
map, those are all gone.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.360
Because for this visualization,
if we're just

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.640
looking at transit, or inner
city transit, or pan-city

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.770
transit, the local roads don't
really matter as much.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.950
And park geometry, again I
brought the lightness up to

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.010
make it a little
less apparent.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.910
Because I think by default,
the parks are a little bit

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.060
dark for doing visualizations.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.870
So on to number three.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.550
So these last three, I just kind
of had fun with styling

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.610
with these.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.335
Actually let's turn
transit off.

00:12:04.335 --> 00:12:06.585
And let's skip the code--

00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:07.360
shrink this guy.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.310
So this one, when you're looking
at it, just looks like

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.050
a lot of text and rivers,
or text and lines.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.830
So basically the land geometry
is black, and

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.860
the rivers are white.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.950
So I've actually inversed
the contrast here.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.150
And the text I actually left
in, just for demonstration.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.360
But in general, this map, I like
to view it without text.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.830
The interesting thing about
this, because I picked this

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:38.700
inverse contrast between the
water and the land, is this

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.950
one is actually really good
for looking at things like

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.790
lakes, or inland bodies
of water.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.170
So when you look at this map
here, so this is in the

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.210
Ukraine, you can actually see
a lot of these inland lakes.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.500
Whereas if we hit the style
button and go back to default

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.760
style, you don't necessarily
see them very much.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.780
And that's primarily because
there's not as much contrast

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.520
between the default color for
the land geometry and the

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.960
water, as you get with
the style on.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.346
Zoom out.

00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:12.470
You can actually
see some really

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.270
interesting things with this.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:19.800
I've discovered things like,
well, obviously like Canada

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.100
has actually quite
a few lakes.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.880
You can see these interesting
kind of circular feature here,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.000
circular lake in--

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.990
I believe that's Quebec.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:34.460
So you really get a sense of the
presence of inland water

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.690
using this really
stark contrast,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.560
inverted stark contrast.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.230
So this map is really about

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.420
understanding local water bodies.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.790
I put in the labels, just to
give the user a sense of where

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.180
they're at on the map.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.710
Another thing that I--

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.580
just kind of browsing around
this map-- is you can really

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.650
see these--

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.160
I think a lot of these
are irrigation

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.080
channels, or aqueducts.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.850
So kind of interesting to see
these in the map as well.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.680
Again, if we go back to the
standard styling, you really

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.620
don't quite a sense of how
many, or how much of the

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.480
inland water there is.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.150
And not a great map I
think, this black

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.960
background for heat maps.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.740
Well, we'll try that
out a little bit.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.910
But in some cases, like where
we're talking about land

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.870
masses, it doesn't make a lot
of sense for heat maps.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.580
This is actually the heat map
I used for the ship voyage.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.600
So my point here--

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.270
well, we can go back
real quick.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.440
Take a quick look at the
code for this one.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.360
Pretty simple.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.610
So what I talked about in
previous shows is for doing

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.010
visualizations, it usually helps
to turn everything off,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.680
and then selectively
add stuff back in.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.110
Which I did with this map, and
actually the next few ones.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.500
So actually this first directive
here is turning

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.610
everything off in the map.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.570
So we don't have any features.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.050
And if you do that,
you actually get--

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.810
your map is transparent, which
is a really interesting trick

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.060
that I will take advantage
of in a little bit.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.650
So water, making it this
grayish color.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.520
Landscape, making it black.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.970
The roads-- actually I turned
the roads back on and made

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.210
them black so that you can
actually see the--

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.190
whoops, I have some heat
map points in here.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.120
The heat map was
on, that's why.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.400
So you can actually see
the bridge here.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.870
This is the Golden
Gate Bridge.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.560
If I did not turn the roads back
on, you'd just see the

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.755
land masses and the water,
without the roads overlaid or

00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:38.790
the bridges overlaid.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.590
Which is actually kind of a
decent effect, but looking at

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.210
this map gave me a little
more sense of location.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:52.820
And just basically tweaking the
properties for the labels

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.880
on the water and on the land.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.130
I think at one point I had just

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.000
used the inverse lightness.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.290
You can use that to-- actually,
if it's a white fill

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.070
with a black stroke for
the text, it'll

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.080
actually invert that.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.750
I didn't use it in here, just
because I guess I didn't

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.700
really like the colors that
the inverse lightness is.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.280
A little easier, a little
nicer presentation, to

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.710
actually just set the
colors myself.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.440
Moving on, this was the
ship visualization.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.940
So my goal with this was I
wanted to plot a lot of data,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.780
actually a whole lot of
data, in the water.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.080
And the land masses are actually
just about showing

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.290
that, well, the ship went from
point A to point B-- from the

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.920
city to the city.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.630
But the really important
information was actually in

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.750
the water, and that was the
voyages of the ships.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.640
So here I actually picked black
for the background, for

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.180
the water, which let me use some
really sharp colors, or

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.480
bright colors, or pastel
colors for the voyage.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.990
And unfortunately with this tool
that I put together, I

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.580
didn't make any way
to add polylines.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.589
But we can turn the
heat map back on.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.990
Let's get to this
more pastel one.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.270
But you can see, as we add
these points to the black

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.470
background here, it actually
pops out really nicely.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.564
Primarily because there's not
a lot of text here that it's

00:17:21.564 --> 00:17:22.119
overlaying.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.839
If we go back over here, over
to the land, the heat map

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.400
points that I plotted earlier
are a little bit more washed

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.200
out on the slightly more
gray background.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.670
You could definitely tweak
this a little bit.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.510
And I've definitely seen some
really nice visualizations

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.230
that did like white water with
some kind of pastel, or even

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.300
maybe some pastel polylines,
which looks really nice.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.870
But if you want to really turn
up the amount of contrast,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.080
this is a good way
to go about it.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.710
I think we covered the code
for this little while ago.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.040
I think it's a lot like the
other map, where like I said

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.780
before, I turn off the
visibility on everything.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.810
And then selectively turn on
things like the water, the

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.290
text, et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.330
This one, actually, I purposely
turned on the labels

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.270
for the country and
localities.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:13.370
This is because I wanted to
show what cities the ships

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.150
were coming from and going to.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.160
So I had a polyline going, for
example, from London across to

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.120
New York for example.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.480
And you can actually see what
cities the ships were coming

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.770
from and going to.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.380
If I didn't turn these labels
back on, because previously in

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.150
the style I actually turned
visibility off for everything,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.380
you wouldn't be able to
see these labels.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.720
And so that's about
it for that one.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.156
Actually really tweaking the--

00:18:41.156 --> 00:18:44.750
let me see what I'm
doing here.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.950
Oh, this is actually just
setting up the countries, or

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.690
the land masses, which
fills in nicely.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.240
So the very last one, this
is not necessarily a

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.460
visualization that
I'd want to use.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.840
And actually you can see
at this level it

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.101
doesn't really do much.

00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:02.420
I just want to turn
the heat map off.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.550
So this style is something
I put together recently.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.790
I think this is a
lot of fun for--

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.620
actually let me find some
place that has roads.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.040
Paris is always a good one.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.600
So for actually just looking at
the density of roads in a

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.650
particular area, or
a particular city.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.430
What I did is I basically turned
everything off of the

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.690
map, made it black.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.160
And then took the roads and just
made them white, a nice

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.730
stark color.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.860
I played around with inverse.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.450
I mean, it looked actually
really nicely to do a white

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.280
background with black lines,
or even like a

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.620
dark blue or red lines.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.820
But you get the most contrast,
obviously, with

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.700
the black to white.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.300
The really nice thing
about this--

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.380
hopefully it comes through on
YouTube-- is that we can

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.120
actually see the primary.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.560
The freeways or the highways,
and also the secondary roads

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.470
being mapped in here in kind of
a different contrast level.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.460
That's just how they're mapped
by default, or how they're

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.840
plotted by default.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.950
I don't know if we have
that level of

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.080
detail for all countries.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.506
Like, for example,
I was in Tokyo.

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:09.280
I'm going to go Edogawa,
Tokyo, Japan.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.920
You see here at this level, we
don't see the secondary roads.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.610
They actually fill in
in the same color.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.740
Zoom in here, the secondary
roads actually fill in at the

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.390
same kind of contrast level
as the other roads.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.960
You can tweak that
using the style.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.500
But what we saw with Paris,
on the other hand,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.560
looks really nice.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.120
So I'm actually thinking about
doing like a weekly posting

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:40.790
one of these maps up on the
Google Maps Developers Google+

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.020
channel, so you can even figure
out where this is.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.350
And I put a nice little
flag in here.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.620
I can actually convert these
styled maps into static maps.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.310
So this is actually pretty much
just a snapshot of where

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:59.162
the map is positioned right
now, as a JPEG file.

00:20:59.162 --> 00:21:00.570
Or I think it's PNG file.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.360
But yeah, so like I said, that's
pretty much it for this

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.140
tool, pretty much it
for the styles.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.220
I have a few more styles that
I've been working on for other

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.050
visualization.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.790
But I'll spare you guys those
for the time being, until I

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.380
can actually tweak them
a little bit more.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.810
The other thing I was going
to do real quick is,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:22.720
I was really inspired.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.670
We were down at Sydney last
week, and we went to an

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:30.040
observatory that was dedicated
to us celestial

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.200
navigation in Sydney.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.250
And they had some really nice
historical maps, ship log or

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.100
ship maps, very similar to what
we were trying to show

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.120
with the Google Maps API with
the ship visualization.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.740
Although these maps obvious
were quite a bit simpler.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.390
They just had outlines for
countries, labels for the

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.330
countries, and then the voyage
was actually marked in a

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.340
different color, like
a nice red color.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.590
Obviously on kind of aged paper,
because these were

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.930
actually real historic maps.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.700
So I wanted to actually see if
I could reproduce that in the

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.080
Google Maps API.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.900
And it surprisingly wasn't too
hard, with a few caveats.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.540
I can't actually share the code
for this one right yet,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.940
because I want to actually tweak
it a little bit more and

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.490
make it a little more usable.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.450
But the idea behind this is,
and this is actually using

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:27.380
Styled Maps, plus a few other
Google Maps techniques.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.490
The first thing I did is
actually I turned visibility

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.250
off for everything
on this map.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.400
And like I mentioned before,
that actually makes the map

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.390
background transparent.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.720
So doing that, you get a
transparent background.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.290
And then I can just use a
tile-able image for the

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.440
background of the map canvas.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.180
Then what I did is I actually
just turned on the labels for

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:49.920
the countries.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.820
And actually I did the
countries and--

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.940
let's zoom in a little bit--

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.270
countries and localities.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.760
So we have cities as well, and
you can see these pop in at a

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.200
particular zoom level.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.510
Then I was left with a little
bit of a problem, because if

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.970
we turn on the geometry for
administrative, like the

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.130
countries, it only shows the
boundaries between countries.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.040
It doesn't show the
boundaries around

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.420
the edge of the country.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.060
So the next trick I did was
actually find a KML file that

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.250
actually had the full
country boundaries.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.550
And you can see, they're
not super detailed.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.200
Just for performance reasons,
you can see they're a little

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.030
bit, how do we say,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.020
coarse-grained around the borders.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.930
But I think it does a pretty
good job, especially when

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.290
you're at a higher zoom level.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.980
My next step with this map would
be to actually plot a

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.130
voyage in here to see what it
looks like in this archaic

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.870
map, or historical map format.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.820
This one I hope to share
out at some point.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.480
I just want to make sure I get
all the attribution right for

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.920
the polylines, or for the KML,
and also for this kind of

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.370
parchment-style background
that I used.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.490
But yeah, stay tuned, and we'll
hopefully get that out

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.140
sometime this week.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.910
And with that, I think
that's everything.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.310
Do I have any other bags?

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.620
LEWIS: We do have some
questions, Paul.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.520
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, we have
some questions.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.240
Ok, we have the man behind
the curtain.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.270
LEWIS: So Andre had a
couple questions.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.596
And he wanted to know if there's
any examples that you

00:24:19.596 --> 00:24:22.590
have using Closure or
Closure Script.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.140
PAUL SAXMAN: --for using
Google Maps API.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.040
That's a really--

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.480
so in my code I am
using closures,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.510
like JavaScript closure.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.520
Let me see if I can actually
bring up some of the--

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.700
actually probably
not this code.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.530
So I'm not using clojure.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.650
So I'm just using JavaScript
closure, making sure that all

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.370
my event handlers are attached
to the appropriate object at

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.520
creation time.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.590
We can definitely see if we can
bring up some examples for

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.405
that, because I think it's a
common question that we get.

00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:52.920
LEWIS: And you said you weren't
releasing everything,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.850
but is there a chance
that they could

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.990
download your examples?

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.760
Like, where can you
point people?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.560
PAUL SAXMAN: Yes.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.740
So I haven't publicized
it yet, but the ship

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.770
visualizations that we put
together last week, I just put

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.660
them online actually
very recently.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.570
And I'll follow up with that
today or tomorrow.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.490
So ship visualizations
will be out there.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.410
The paper map, like I said, I
have to get it vetted before I

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.200
can launch it.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.720
Just to make sure that I get the
attribution right for the

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.730
other content that
I pulled in.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:26.380
And this tool that I put
together, this tool here, if

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.830
there's interest in it, then
we can probably look at

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.750
productizing it.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.725
This was something that, like
I said, I put together in

00:25:31.725 --> 00:25:34.880
about a day just to kind of
help me tweak my styles.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.440
But it might make a nice tool,
especially if developers could

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.810
load their own styles.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.270
So either way, we can put this
code someplace for you to

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.700
download, or make it like a
tool that you can use for

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.900
doing your own map styling.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.350
So stay tuned on the code.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.440
Today or tomorrow we can
see the ship data.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.170
And then maybe early next week
some of this data that we

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.420
presented today.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.950
And producer Lewis says we're
OK on the questions.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.320
So with that, next week we're
maybe going to do another data

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.290
visualization show, but
not 100% sure yet.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.750
But we'll definitely get that
posted as soon as we know.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.150
And if you guys have any other
questions, or any other ideas

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.650
for shows, please share.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.910
We want to make sure
that we're getting

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.150
information to you guys.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.450
I think this closure idea,
actually clojure, is

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.670
maybe a good idea.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.890
AngularJS is another
big one that people

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.660
like to see as well.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.410
So stay tuned, we'll definitely
consider those.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.190
And any other ideas, and any
other comments or questions,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.460
please let us know.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.910
With that, have a
great weekend.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.160
And see you guys next week.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:27:26.733
