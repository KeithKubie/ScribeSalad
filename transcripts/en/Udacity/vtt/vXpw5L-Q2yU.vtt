00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.904
Here's our last motion problem for this lesson. Olivia can ride her bike 4 mph

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:09.915
faster than Terrance. If Olivia can go 30 miles in the same time that Terrance

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.912
can go 15 miles, what are their speeds? Again I think its best to use a table

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:19.225
for a problem like this. So let's organize our information. We'll have Olivia

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:23.554
and her distance, rate and time. And then we'll have Terrance and his distance,

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:27.788
his rate and his time. So let's see if you can fill in all the missing parts to

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:33.670
our table. Put in the correct number or the correct expression in each part.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.718
Also be sure that you use x for your variable. Think carefully about which item

00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:40.700
should be the variable here. And good luck!
