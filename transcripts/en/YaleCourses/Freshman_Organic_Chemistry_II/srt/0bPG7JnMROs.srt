1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,200
I'd like to see if I can describe to you
how you could measure the bond energies

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,370
of complex molecules. And to
start out, let me just say that,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,680
let me remind you what
we're talking about.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,860
Let me talk about somebody like methane.
I'm going to need a larger stick.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,760
If you have methane and, uh, your, uh,

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,620
want to measure the bond energy,

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,980
I literally want to reach in and measure
the energy it would take to grab that

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,110
hydrogen and literally
just rip it out of there.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,710
And when you can see it does that the
molecule is going to have a change from a

10
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,830
tetrahedral geometry to a flat geometry.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,420
And there's a potential curve that I've
written as a more sauce later and, uh,

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,900
there's a zero point energy and you're
going to have to measure the energy to go

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,340
from the ground state up to
the, um, uh, dissociation limit.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,460
Uh, so, uh,

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,720
I thought I'd try to tell
you just in a simple way,

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,490
if you took a molecule and you'd like
to try to see if you could measure the

17
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,210
different bonds in a molecule,
how could I, how could I,

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,550
this specific bond
energies being measured?

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,660
And let me consider
something like methanol. Uh,

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,480
I'd like to take methanol and I'd like
to show you how you measure the bond

21
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,760
energy to break the Oah bond,

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,850
then how you'd break the ch bond
or how you'd break the Co Bong.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,650
And I don't want to calculate this. I
actually want to measure, all right. So

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,150
one way you can do this is to
use a gas phase is acidity,

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,230
uh,
electronic electronegativity cycle.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,150
And this is a negative vine
cycle that you'll take it,

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,580
uh, this molecule, same ethanol.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
And if you treat this
with a base such as flu,

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,810
it's fluoride on fluoride ion is
actually going to attack them ethanol.

30
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,520
And what it does is it's going to pull
a proton off. And if it does that,

31
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,150
you'll form methoxy line. Um, um,

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,700
you'll never, the fluoride ion
will never pull the proton off the,

33
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,470
the, uh, the off the carbon because the
negative ion that you get has the electron

34
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,650
sitting on the carbon and electric and
the oxygen is more electronegative.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,810
So you'll always get the top line.
And uh, so if you could do that,

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,840
what you'd like to, um, um,

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,730
think about is how could I measure it?

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,390
An equilibrium between
these two species. And, uh,

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,760
if I have the equilibrium, I can get the
anthropy and if I can get the anthropy,

40
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,500
I can get the acidity
of this. Uh, so this is,

41
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:45,480
um, uh, uh, an experiment that
a bunch of us do in boulder.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,050
Uh,

43
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,550
the world's expert in these gas phase
acidity measurements is my colleague,

44
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,010
uh, Ronnie Bierbaum, uh,

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,470
professor Doctor Veronica
Murray Bierbaum. Uh, and uh,

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,030
she's very good at this.
Uh,

47
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,250
they have a flow tube and
what they do is, uh, you,

48
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,790
this is the experiment you want to do.
So you would like to measure the, the,

49
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,870
the reaction of fluoride on pulling a
proton off methanol to get the methoxy

50
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,610
Diane. So what you do
is, is you have to, here,

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,960
you can't get a lecture bottle of
fluoride on cause it because they're,

52
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,020
they're charged.
So what you got to do is take a,

53
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,050
a gas and you make a plasma,

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,150
you boil electrons off a filament in the,
as electrons interact with the,

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,400
with the HF, the electrons get
captured into a sigma star,

56
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,401
orbital in the molecule detonates and
gives you f minus and hydrogen atoms.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,290
So the hydrogen atoms are injected
or the fluoride ions are a, are,

58
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,720
are injected into this flow tube
and there's some ethanol in here.

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,620
And what happens is, uh,
as the reaction proceeds,

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
the methanol has a proton removed from it.
And you have,

61
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,510
you're literally watching the end of the
flow tube with a quarter pole mass spec.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,730
The quadrupole mass spec monitors the
negative vines that have emo Rizzy 31 and

63
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,540
you'll watch them growing in.
So as you watch the,

64
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,740
the mythos oxide on growing in,

65
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,010
you can measure the rate constant
k one that goes this way.

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,560
So if you do that,

67
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,040
what you're after is the
equilibrium constants.

68
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,620
So you've got to get to get
the equilibrium constant.

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,320
One way to do this is that you
would measure the reverse rate. Uh,

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
so if you did that to,
to,

71
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,170
to measure such a reaction, now
you did turn the reacts. You,

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,800
you do the reverse of this,
you now have to make a, uh,

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,660
a vapor of methoxy water and ions.
Uh,

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,410
an easy way to do this is to have
electrons interact with methyl nitrite.

75
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,060
The methyl nitrite then disintegrates
and informs methodic side and on,

76
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,440
and nitric oxide, you know, in the
methoxy line, then goes down the flow to,

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,650
and there's a methoxy side
on interacts with the HF.

78
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,370
Now what you'll see as f minus
growing in that's, and you know,

79
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:07,030
it's f minus because Jesus only made
a finite number of irons that have emo

80
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,580
Rizzy 19 in floor high does it?
There's no other,

81
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,900
so it turns out when you do that,
you're able to, to monitor this.

82
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,210
So if you've measured k one and
you've measured k minus one,

83
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,830
uh, that is going to give you
the equilibrium constant. Uh,

84
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,240
and this is the difference in
acidity between methanol and HF.

85
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,510
With the acidity of a,
of Hf is well known.

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,710
It's a 303 70 cake, a 0.4, two,

87
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,330
four k cal per mall with this uncertainty.
And so it turns out that that,

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,370
uh, your, uh,

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,300
these two numbers gives you
the equilibrium constant
and this is going to give

90
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,940
you the, uh, the, the,
uh, the gas phase acidity.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,260
So by measuring the,
the equilibrium constant,

92
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,250
professor Bierbaum has the measure
of the acidity of this species.

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,170
Um,
the way to think about this now,

94
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,220
to use the acidity, here's what
the gas phase acidity is. Remember,

95
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,510
she's really has this number in the
gas phase. You know, in the gas phase,

96
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,610
these molecules are never
going to do this, dissociate
into ions because the, the,

97
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,530
the you guys,
you got to deal with cool ohms law.

98
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,190
So you're talking about maybe a 300,
400 k cal per mall.

99
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,870
So it's a whopping amount of energy.
So the way to think about this is,

100
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,400
is to get that iron, you
have to, you have to, uh,

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,900
you have to break the Ooh bond. Then
you have to, uh, and then to get a,

102
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,690
then you have to somehow measure the
electron affinity that gives you the, the,

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
the energy of,
of the negative in here.

104
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,880
And the ionization energy of a
hydrogen atom is the, the is,

105
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,860
is how you get the Proton. And, and here,

106
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:52,910
this is the easiest way I think
about this. That's this acidity.

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
You want to get those ions,

108
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,250
the first thing you got to do is reach
in with a pair of scissors and cut this

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,150
bond with you.
So you've got to pay that energy.

110
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,330
You also got to give me the
ionization energy of hydrogen atom.

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,330
You got to pay me that. Uh,
and because that gives you,

112
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,050
that gives you the Proton and then you
take the electron and put her back on,

113
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,400
on the, um, uh, [inaudible],
uh, uh, Coxy radical.

114
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,660
And that's the electron affinity.
So it turns out I'm

115
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,490
here, this is what we're after.
We want this bond energy. And,

116
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,870
and this will be the energy
for that bond only. Uh, and uh,

117
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,910
so the electron affinity for hydrogen
atom is known to some pornographic the

118
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,550
tail. You couldn't imagine what's
been done to this poor Adam.

119
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,270
This is known to like 80 digits.
So it turns out,

120
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,740
so the only thing you got to do is now
you now have to measure the electron

121
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:50,000
affinity of the radical. Alright,
so how are you going to do that?

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,150
So, um, this is an experiment
that's done in, uh, uh,

123
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,710
actually here by Mark Johnson,

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,970
it professor Mark Johnson
at the Yale University,

125
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,680
and it's done a bit by people in Boulder,
Colorado. Uh, here's what you do.

126
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,620
You literally take a vapor
of these negative vines,

127
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,390
and if you take a vapor of the negative
vines, you make a fast beam. Uh,

128
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,460
you crosses with the laser.
I know the,

129
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,580
I know the energy of the laser precisely.

130
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,680
So what you do is when the laser
interacts with the negative ions, uh,

131
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,760
you'll eject electrons and you catch
them in a, in a hemispherical analyzer,

132
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,420
and you literally measure the kinetic
energy. So this is a kinetic energy.

133
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,650
So here, this is easy. If the,

134
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,810
you know what the energy
going in is and you know,

135
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,670
at the energy coming out is
you've measured those two things,

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,870
then the differences of binding
energy. So here's the, the, the,

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,280
the negative vine. Uh, when the,
the electromagnetic wave comes,

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,590
comes a blazing in and strikes it,

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,530
what happens is that
here's the laser energy.

140
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,740
So the molecule literally interacts with
the laser and an electrons knocked off,

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,040
and that what you're going to do is
you're going to measure the red arrow.

142
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,780
This is the kinetic energy
of the photo electron.

143
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,220
So if you've measured what comes out,
then the difference is the binding energy.

144
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,380
So, uh, it turns out that,
uh, um, this is this,

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,820
the essential experiments you have to
do. Um, there's a bunch of details.

146
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,570
You got to pay attention
to you. If the, if the,

147
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,210
the product radical is vibrating
than the fuddle electron,

148
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:30,330
kinetic energy will be
smaller than the measured. Uh,

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,630
binding energy in this
are just a bunch of words.

150
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:37,300
Let me just show you what
you do. This is it. Uh, uh,

151
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,610
you make them hear what this is.
Jesus, we did this like 30 years ago.

152
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,620
Christ, I'm an old guy. Uh,
uh, if, when, when you do this,

153
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:51,270
what you do is you take a,
a, the, uh, the, the uh, uh,

154
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,463
right here.

155
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,440
So what you're gonna do is you're going
to measure the kinetic energy of the

156
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,470
electrons coming down. So we're
making a plot of the photo electron,

157
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,000
kinetic energy here,

158
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:04,380
let me just show the laser is at a is 488.

159
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,100
It's a beautiful Robin's egg
blue, extremely bright, uh,

160
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,900
laser and a four 88 nanometers
is 2.54 electron volts.

161
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,950
So here, think about this. This is a photo
on kinetic energy. Electrons coming out.

162
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,220
No electrons can come out with more than
2.5 for e v because that's all that's

163
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,300
all I got to put in. So, so the
first time you see electron counts,

164
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,740
this electron council is, uh,
had, uh, at about one eve.

165
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,420
When you actually measured,
it's measured to be a 0.96 80 v.

166
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,440
Uh,

167
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,440
and so the way you get the electron
affinity is if you put 2.5 fours evn and,

168
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,470
and you measure a 0.968 coming out,

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
then the difference is 1.572 a plus
and minus 4 million electron volts.

170
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,290
And that's how you do it. Um, this is,

171
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,610
this is the attachment to the ground
state of the, of, of the methoxy. Dot.

172
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,780
This is one vibration. Hinton
methoxy doc, this is two vibrations.

173
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,660
This is three vibrations.
Can you see how coolest is?

174
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,880
You can actually take
a vibrational spectrum.

175
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,170
You're looking at the vibrations that
are radical. Well, that's not hard.

176
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,870
That's not easy to do because you
don't have a lecture bottle of radical.

177
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:16,704
So this is,
uh,

178
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,130
this is a very powerful experiments on
the one day of the month when it works,

179
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,970
I'll not kid you, uh, these experiments
or professor at Bierbaum, uh,

180
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,040
you spend most of your time with
the hardware, uh, trying to make,

181
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,620
certainly electronics is stable and
whatnot. And then when you're running a,

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,510
these people basically are dancing
around the machine nude with tambourines,

183
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,080
just trying to keep the machine
stable along enough to get a spectrum.

184
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,450
But when it works, uh, it's,

185
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,960
you're going to get a number of very
clean and you see how precise this is.

186
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,170
I mean, this is a very, this
is a very nice measurement.

187
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,960
So now you can now do the,

188
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,170
we can now do what gonna do if Bierbaum
ms has the acidity and you know,

189
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:03,100
the electron affinity and you know,
they, I on Istation as you hydrogen atom.

190
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,320
So here are these numbers. Uh, uh,
uh, when you put these things in,

191
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,710
you gotta have to, the bond energy
is about 105 k cal per mole.

192
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,540
And this is the bond energy of methanol
in intergalactic space with nobody else

193
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,920
around.
Um,

194
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,480
and all of these people who liked to
think they can calculate everything's by

195
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,400
using all these quantum
mechanical programs.

196
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,450
Now this is the number they have to
get there. There's no place to hide.

197
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,070
This is a cleanly measured,
uh, value. Uh, um,

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,640
no experimental system is
perfect. Uh, so for example, uh,

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,770
so problems you could have, um, I just
showed you how to measure the Oah Blonde.

200
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,000
Suppose you wanted to mention at the
ch bond, well, this will never work.

201
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,250
Uh, because for the negative
line cycle will never work. Why?

202
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:58,210
Because when you take, uh, any
base that you apply to this,

203
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,110
the base is always going to take
off the most acidic protons will.

204
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,900
The most acidic Proton is one of the Doh
because you get the negative line with,

205
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:09,400
uh, with the electron on
the oxygen. That's good. Uh,

206
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,420
if you have a base that you try
to pull a proton off the carbon,

207
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,831
you're now going to put,

208
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:18,460
the electron is going to be on the
carbon atom and that's bad music.

209
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,320
Oxygen is more electronegative, it'll
hold it much tighter. So it turns out,

210
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,260
uh,
this is the negative lines is our,

211
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,370
are not going to be a useful way
to do this. Uh, and of course,

212
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,350
if you were going to apply
the negative ions cycle,

213
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,220
then you have to measure the acidity
of the negative of this proton.

214
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,190
Then we'd have to measure the
electron affinity. Of this radical,

215
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,840
does everybody see that?
This radical,

216
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,930
this is hydroxy methyl radical
is different than methoxy
because the dot sits on

217
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,610
the carbon, not on the oxygen.
So it's a different radical.

218
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,350
So if you can't make the iron,

219
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,330
then we can't do our measurements
and we're dead not to worry. Um,

220
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,160
there's other techniques you can
do. Uh, um, my friend David Goodman,

221
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,360
uh, he does, uh,

222
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,710
does radical kinetics. And uh, so,
uh, thing you can do is you can take,

223
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,920
make chlorine atoms. And when you make
chlorine atoms and in a flow tube, uh,

224
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,220
he can, uh, you, he uses
photo organization Mass Spec
to monitor the products.

225
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:22,810
And so he can measure k one and he can
measure k minus one. So he gets equal.

226
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,140
A flow tube is a beautiful device.
Uh,

227
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,980
that's a meter long. Uh, it's, uh,

228
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,850
uh,

229
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,850
my fist 10 centimeters in diameter and a
beer Bierbaum has flowing through this,

230
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,550
a tremendous flow of helium gas. And, uh,

231
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,320
so when you make ions,

232
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,090
the ions are made up here in the discharge
and then there are little pressure.

233
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,660
The pressure will be about a tour.
And, uh, so it turns out that that,

234
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,190
uh, it's mostly helium and you have a few
milli torr of the reagents that you've

235
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,690
got. Do you have a quadrupole Mass Spec?
Uh, the quadrupole mass back of course,

236
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,760
can't operate in a milliliter.
So there's some clever, um, um,

237
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,130
um, uh, pumping that you
have to sample the, uh,

238
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,550
the output of the float tube.

239
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,280
And so the quadrupole mass
spec only looks at the ions.

240
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,470
So if you have a reaction
that occurs in here,

241
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,220
a one iron would go away and another
and another one would come up.

242
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,620
And you can monitor this with
a quadrupole mass spec. Uh,

243
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,610
remember the way the ions get downstream
as they were carried along by the

244
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,790
helium. So that, and, and
what's two and a flow tube is,

245
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,110
is the distance equals rate times the
time. So if you have a shorter distance,

246
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,630
you have a shorter reaction time.
If you have a longer distance,

247
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,480
you have a longer reaction time.
And if you measure that variation,

248
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,640
you can get a rate concert
though. Uh, it turns out that,

249
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:50,130
uh, you can change the
distance by, uh, uh,

250
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,990
a admitting your reagent
through a tiny little tube.

251
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,710
And this tube is the cutest little
thing you ever saw in your life.

252
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,540
It slides on a little wire and
they literally like a gorilla.

253
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,670
Uh, they'll, they'll
set the flow tube. Uh,

254
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,880
they'll set the injection,
uh, um, a tube, uh,

255
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,130
at a certain, uh, a space.

256
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,310
And then what they'll do is they'll
systematically vary this by just pulling

257
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,760
both, by simply pulling this back. Then
they'll measure the ratios of these rates.

258
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,440
We talked earlier about Robert
Hook make you go back. You know,

259
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,670
you have somebody down now.

260
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,430
Now it turns out that,
sure. Okay. So the, uh, uh,

261
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,830
uh, professor Bierbaum uses
a set of pumps, which are,

262
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,060
are as tall, as big as I
am, their roots floors. Uh,

263
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:48,530
these pumps can, we'll pump just
a staggering quantity of gas, uh,

264
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,540
like 500 liters a second at
this pressure. Uh, so, uh,

265
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,530
these pumps, he could, I'm
just telling you words. Uh,

266
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,060
one of the uses of these pumps are to
pump grain and grain elevators in Kansas.

267
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,020
You ever been to some dreadful place
like Kansas? I mean there's, there's,

268
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,340
there's 10,000 of these silos and uh,

269
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,700
and so, uh, these, the grain is pumped
around in these with these huge pumps.

270
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,800
So she has two of these in the
basement. Uh, uh, uh, so it's, uh, it,

271
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,570
it's a very hard experiment to do.

272
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,170
So you can also do radicals in this.

273
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:27,770
And let me just tell you
Goodmans experiment. Uh, uh, uh,

274
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,580
he's gonna measure k Eqi and so he's
going to measure the reaction from the,

275
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,000
from an equilibrium constant for the
temperature variation of the equilibrium

276
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:39,540
constant. He's going to get the,
the, the uh, uh, enter the, the, the,

277
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,370
the reaction energy of this and their
reaction energy of this radical reaction

278
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,970
is you're going to have to pay the
bond energy, this ch bond energy,

279
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,600
and you're going to get the bond energy
of hcl. I now have to tell you something.

280
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,640
The bond energy for ACL is
known to be 103 k cal per mole.

281
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,020
Remember I told you the bond energy
for methanol is 104. So meth.

282
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,830
So the chloride Adams. If they hit the
hydrogen h on the end, on the ois group,

283
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,610
if they hit it,

284
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,460
they'll just bounce off because they
don't have enough energy to do this.

285
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,320
So they're only going to pull a bond.
And, uh, the, the carbon off the,

286
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,480
the hydrogens off the, off the methyl
group. So when you do that a way,

287
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,340
if you do the analysis, you
can get that. The ch bond, um,

288
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,630
on methanol is, uh, is 96K cal per mole.

289
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,590
And, uh, on the days when it works,
you can get this very precisely.

290
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,120
So those are two of the bond energies
that you could, you can get from ethanol.

291
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,580
Uh, so you might wonder what's
the CEO bond and methanol.

292
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,870
In other words, uh, you're literally
going to take, take a methadone molecule,

293
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,160
you'll karate chocolate in this, in the
center, and you just want to cut it into.

294
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,940
So that means I've got
to measure that the, uh,

295
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,170
that the energy of the methyl
radicals and hydroxyl radicals. Uh,

296
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,400
so it turns out this is a straight
forward thing to do. Uh, uh,

297
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,780
turns out that, that, uh,
if you want to look at this,

298
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,710
that this bond energy is the, uh, uh, uh,

299
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,960
to get the heater from here,
I need to get methyl radical.

300
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,210
So of get methyl radical,

301
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,660
you actually have to measure the bond
energy of methane cause that's the bond

302
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:19,450
energy of methanes. That is the, is the
heat of formation of methyl radicals,

303
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,810
heat information,
hydrogen minus that of methane.

304
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,230
So Fun quantization Mass Spec or can our
reaction kinetics both measure the bond

305
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:32,691
energy of methane to be 104.99 k cal
from all the bond energy of hydrogen,

306
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,900
h and m comes from the
dissociation energy of h two.

307
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,850
So there's classical tables. This, these
guys, uh, Mr Pedley in his friends,

308
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,990
there's 3000 of these bond energies that
these guys ain't really have connect,

309
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,700
have put in this book. So
it turns out that that, uh,

310
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,050
if you have these guys,
uh, you now use the,

311
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:56,610
the heat of formation of methyl radical.
Uh,

312
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,200
I also tell you that you
need to tell you that,

313
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:02,610
that the bond energy of water gives you
the heat of formation of methyl radical,

314
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,200
of, of hydroxyl radical. So it turns
out, if I know hydroxyl radical,

315
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:10,920
and I know methyl radical than Pedley at
Al will give you the heat of formation

316
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:14,490
of, of methanol, so that this is
the other thing I'm going to need.

317
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,890
So it turns out that that, uh, the bond,

318
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,470
this bond energy is equal to heat of
formation of methyl radical plus Oah

319
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,790
radical minus that of methanol.

320
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,570
And so this comes from water that
comes to mind, energy of methane,

321
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,050
dissociation and thing.
And this is mister pedley.

322
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,200
And so that's actually the
weakest bond in the molecule,

323
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,040
the weakest bond in the molecules,
the CEO bond. So you can actually,

324
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,840
you can work all three of these,
of these bonds out, uh, by, uh,

325
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,930
um, by going through our procedure. Uh,

326
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,990
me and a whole bunch of other really
smart people have measured a large number

327
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,300
of these molecules. And, uh,
these are the, the bond energies.

328
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,980
There's all sorts of, of,
uh, complicated. Um, uh, uh,

329
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,610
uh, uh, heats of formation
that you can use. Uh, uh,

330
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,390
let me just talk here at the end.
Uh,

331
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,370
for the last part of this about, uh,
trying to compare these things. Uh,

332
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,360
as one of professor McBride's typically
going on like a broken record, he,

333
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,560
we always start, tries to say, how
do you know what you've done? So,

334
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,240
so which means to say,
here, I'm not kidding you.

335
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,710
It is very easy to make a mistake.

336
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:30,100
If you get any of these calibrations
wrong or any of these little cycles are,

337
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,670
are done in an incorrect manner,
it's very easy for you to, to, uh,

338
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,010
uh, uh, to have an uninstall it.
Indeed. Let me go back and make,

339
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,900
I need to make one point. I wasn't, I
didn't, I wasn't smart enough to do, uh,

340
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,150
where I had this acidity here.

341
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,500
The, yes, this bond energy that
we're going to measure. Okay,

342
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,700
we're going to get this through a cycle
and to get through the cycle, we have to,

343
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:59,860
to,
we have to do two difficult experiments.

344
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,730
Bierbaum has to measure the acidity.
That's a very large number.

345
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,380
That's 380 k cal per mole. And the
electron affinity is known, but then,

346
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,050
uh, the organization as
you've hydrogen atoms down.

347
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,950
But you have to measure the electron
affinity for, uh, for this radical.

348
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,900
So this number,

349
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,030
it comes from a cycle where you're
adding and subtracting large numbers and

350
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,770
you're smart guys,
you know this,

351
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,290
if you have a number that
you're after and it's it,

352
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,640
there's a cycle that you go through
and you're taking differences of large

353
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,800
numbers.
Any fault,

354
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,150
any mistake that's made here
is going to be in that era,

355
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,050
has got to be in this bond energy or any
air that comes in this measurement. Uh,

356
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,770
there's a famous chemist in who's English,
whose name is Colson.

357
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,220
And the Colson used to say this is
procedure is like weighing a captain on a

358
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:54,790
ship by weighing the ship with
and without the captain here.

359
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,330
So you have an aircraft carrier, okay,
you're a smart guy, you get open,

360
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,130
you get a pair of scales
and now you've got,

361
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,070
you have to measure this aircraft carrier
very the way to this very precisely.

362
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:06,190
And then you put a little guy on top and
then the white is going to change just

363
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:09,610
a titch and you have to,
ear measurements have to be so precise.

364
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:14,500
You can pick this up. So on the
days when it works, uh, you can,

365
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,230
uh, really get these bond
energies, but, but it's, it,

366
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,060
these are not easy experiments
to do. Um, let me, um, uh,

367
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,320
talk here about these bond energies. Uh,

368
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,370
here we've done several of these things.

369
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,320
You might guess a that
if you have, um, um,

370
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,220
um, an alcoholic, this is, I did methanol,

371
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,140
this is the [inaudible] bond and methanol,

372
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,410
you might hope that the Oah bond and
ethanol would be the same and it's exactly

373
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,680
the same within our, with the
NRN certainty. If you go to, uh,

374
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,520
this is ISO propyl alcohol or this is tp,
it'll alcohol.

375
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,250
TB allow calls a little bit larger,

376
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:02,790
but you could see amongst friends it's
all about 104 hundred, five k cal promote.

377
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,030
Um, when you got to measure
something like funnel,

378
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,540
this is an Ooh bond in front all,
but this is only like 86 k cal per mole.

379
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,870
And you go to Christ.
What's wrong here? Well,

380
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,670
this is no regular
alcohol. Uh, uh, uh, here,

381
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:27,020
I drew this. If you, if you, if, uh,

382
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,010
you break the bond in methanol, you get
a hydrogen atom and you get an methoxy.

383
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,990
Dot. And the.is stuck on
the oxygen atom. But if you,

384
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,910
if you pull a proton off funnel all,
now the.is on,

385
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,650
is not on the oxygen,

386
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:47,510
is actually d localized around it
interacts with the Pi system and, uh,

387
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,780
uh, McBride's probably drawn you
some of these residents forms or,

388
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:57,560
uh, you can talk about the interaction of
this extra electron with a Pi cloud. Uh,

389
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,020
uh, this, uh, this is a
catastrophic change. What?

390
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,550
This is like 20 k, cal promote.
That's a volt. So this is,

391
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,270
it's a lot easier for you to pull a,

392
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:12,620
remove a hydrogen atom from funnel
than it is for, from any alcohol.

393
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,230
Um, the, uh,

394
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,900
we've also done a bunch of Peroxides,
uh,

395
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,460
here. Um, remember
here's hydrogen peroxide,

396
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:29,190
here's methyl hydroperoxide.
Here's Ethel hydroperoxide. Uh,

397
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,280
these again look like Ooh bonds.
Uh, here. You're also smart people.

398
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,910
You know that these peroxides are,
they're very reactive compounds.

399
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,730
The reason my daughter's a blonde
is because of this. I mean,

400
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:45,230
you can buy a bottle of this
and only here when, let's say

401
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,290
there's a difference between
chemistry and say, AH,

402
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,680
other subjects in that these
molecules are real. Uh, uh,

403
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,600
when we got to do this, uh,
here, my daughter would get, uh,

404
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,780
you can buy a bottle of peroxide
in the pharmacy for like it's 5%.

405
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:06,940
So it's 5% hydrogen peroxide in
[inaudible] 95% water. So we had gotten,

406
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,630
they have to make a beam of these things.

407
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,870
So there's clever ways that if you can
have these compounds and you can actually

408
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:18,650
distill them and you can make
99% hydrogen peroxide. Um,

409
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,280
the hydrogen peroxide, of course, it's
extremely reactive. Why is it reactive?

410
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,210
Is because the two oxygens are held
together by a single bond and you have all

411
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,350
these electrons that are crammed right
on top of each other so that the bond

412
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:34,990
energy of the AU bon is
actually quite week. Uh, so it,

413
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,480
it's a very good oxidizer. Uh,
and, uh, so it turns out, uh,

414
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,250
I've actually,
we had a bottle of that 99% of this stuff,

415
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,540
and I'm talking to this with Mike, my
students, and I'm not very skillful.

416
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,520
And so it turns out they maybe had about
half a milliliter of this as long as

417
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:57,480
hydrogen peroxide's in, um,
glass or plastic. It's fine.

418
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,560
Nothing's going to happen. It's,
it's, you can, uh, you can, uh,

419
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,750
handle it safely, but it will
oxidize any carbon that it gets too.

420
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,650
So alas,
I dropped it and then when I dropped it,

421
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,780
it bounced once on the floor and then
it broke and went broke the w when the

422
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,900
glass came down in a broken foot and
there's a big orange spot around.

423
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,000
And what happened was all the,

424
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,010
all the dirt and stuff on the floor is
oxidized immediately just gone. Okay. So,

425
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,990
uh, so if you have a solution
of here, it's like, I'm kidding.

426
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,230
You have a, you'd have a hundred
percent solution of something like this.

427
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,630
You take the little bunny rabbit with
the ears and sort of lower this thing in

428
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,360
this thing is, is, is just simply torn
to pieces. Then you pull this thing out.

429
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,750
There's, there's just bones. I
mean this is, this is tremendous,

430
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,710
is this tremendously reactive.
So all of these things,

431
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,200
you have to handle them and you've got
to get them into your spectrometer.

432
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,420
But we, okay, but when, so
when you do this, you see
that the yellow h bonds here,

433
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,970
see the dots steer on
this is, is, is like,

434
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,570
this is 88 k cal promo.
This is a lot different than these guys.

435
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,120
And of course the one that's the, that
that you're really interested in is water.

436
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,230
Okay?

437
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,210
The bond energy for water
is 118 and that goes to o h.

438
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:22,530
Dot. And h. And m. Uh, this is uh, uh,

439
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,540
this is an important number.

440
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:28,650
And remember water covers 70%
of the earth's surface here.

441
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,610
If you're making a list of what are the
most stable compounds that God made,

442
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,020
it's into in the air. 80% of the night
of the air we're breathing is into,

443
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,370
into has got a triple bond. It's
indestructable very, very saveable. Uh,

444
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,170
the sand on beaches.
I mean the silicon dioxide,

445
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,130
the sand is just like a rock.
I mean, it is a rock. And, and,

446
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,990
and then the other thing is, is our,
is water 70% of the earth's surface.

447
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,060
And the reason is so stable is, is if
you want to break this apart to radicals,

448
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:05,000
you got to give me a 118 k cal promote.
That's a whopping amount of energy, uh,

449
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,240
here. And so you notice if you
just replaced, this was a, uh,

450
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,500
an ethyl group. Okay? So, so,
so you make ethanol. So it,

451
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,370
the bond energy is going to drop by
almost a volt to 104 k cal per mole.

452
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,610
Here, imagine you have
a swimming pool, a here.

453
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:24,720
So there's a swimming pool.

454
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,690
Johnny Depp is talking to somebody
next to the swimming pool. Oh,

455
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:31,140
instead of the swimming pool,
you have water, you have
ethanol. Is Vodka in there.

456
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,370
So Johnny Depp takes
a drag on a cigarette.

457
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,100
And then as he's talking to Angela Jolie,

458
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,760
he flicks the thing over and they've
split second. This hits the pool.

459
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,661
There's a flame.

460
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:44,440
I like a 180 meters high
because the ethanol ignites,

461
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,740
it burns. Okay? If it's in water,
there's a cigarette goes out.

462
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,340
So this is bond energies. If it's
a real stable compound, uh, uh, uh,

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,870
uh, uh, this has consequences. Uh, okay.
So the last thing I'll tell you is he is,

464
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,650
this is the here, these are the bond
energies I just told you for, for um, uh,

465
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,390
methanol. This is the Oih
bond. Uh, this is a ch bond.

466
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,860
The weakest bond is the CEO bond.
These are these numbers in k cal per mol.

467
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,150
It's always interesting,
uh, if you knew the bond,

468
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,980
if you knew what these bond energies are,

469
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,050
what are the bond
energies for the radicals?

470
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,170
So if I reach in and cut a bond
here, and I make methoxy. Dot.

471
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,610
If I make methoxy dot.
Uh,

472
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,500
now the bond energy here
for the ch bond here,

473
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,770
I can use the meter stick,
the ch bond,

474
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,940
which used to be 96 k
Cal Promo drops to 22.

475
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,530
You can see why the minute,
the manner that you cut the bond here,

476
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,590
the hydrogen Annaliese,
but this dot couples with that dot.

477
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,450
And you got from Aldehyde
nice stable compound. So, uh,

478
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,280
and the, the, the CEO bond
here is about 90 k cal Pomona.

479
00:30:56,281 --> 00:31:01,000
Is this about the same thing for it is
for the, for the co bond in methanol,

480
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:07,030
you go to the other bond,
which is hydroxyzine methyl.
You got to this species, uh,

481
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,950
again, if you cut the bond
off the Oih Bond, uh, you
get a.here and the other dot.

482
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,940
Then combines back here is formaldehyde.

483
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,580
So now this is 30 k Caliper mall
is to be contrasted with 106.

484
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,240
What's interesting is the COO bond,

485
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,010
which used to be 92 goes up.
I don't know why,

486
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:31,690
but it does. And not by a little
bit. There's almost a volt, so,

487
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:35,560
so, so there's all sorts
of interesting patterns.

488
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:39,820
You can have an in these bond energies
and, and uh, you literally can have, um,

489
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,600
uh, a, uh, uh, a, uh, uh, you,

490
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,770
you can look at, at Donnelly,
the, uh, these alcohols,

491
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,420
but all sorts of alcohol peroxides
and a variety of these things.

492
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,610
Uh, uh, okay. Uh, uh, here I'm
going to finish early. You can see.

493
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,070
All right. All right, so here there's a,

494
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,900
another thing I want to show you and
that is when you're talking about what a

495
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:08,320
bond strength is, uh, um, uh,

496
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,610
it turns out that an early way that
people tried to measure bond strengths,

497
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,170
we'd be that you'd consider a molecule
like methane I need by big stick here and

498
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:21,370
you take methane, uh, you
can burn it and you can, uh,

499
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,440
and you can actually measure the energy
to take this apart to a carbon atom and

500
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:31,410
four hydrogens. So he told you that,
uh, that chuck got, uh, described you,

501
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,170
how you would measure that,
the energies of individual carbon atoms.

502
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,630
You can actually work out
that the bond that, that,

503
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:42,410
that this is the break to break this
to break all four bonds and methane,

504
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,820
it's going to cost you a
four 97.5 k cal per mall,

505
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,890
the scissors for bonds and methane's.

506
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,460
You'd cross yourself think of
Jesus and then just divide by four.

507
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,200
And if you did that, that number
divided by four is 99 k cal per mole.

508
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,730
Okay, that's so you'd figured that must
be sort of the average bond energy.

509
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,610
If you go that these cycles,
like I just told you,

510
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,920
you can actually measure individually.

511
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,070
The first bond is 104 point a 104.99
plus or minus 0.03 k cal per mol.

512
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:15,920
Uh,

513
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,700
and that's the first bond energy that
gives you the absolute heat of formation

514
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,750
of the methyl radical.

515
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,130
You can now take a methyl radical and
break and measure the second bond.

516
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Notice the bond energy goes up from
100 and 105 to 110 then it goes,

517
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:35,000
the third one is 101 and
the last one is 90 k.

518
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,410
Cal promote these guys,

519
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:39,770
give you individually the heats of
formation of all of these species.

520
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Notice that not a single one of these
bond energies equals at average here.

521
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,770
It's close. But, but, but
the uncertainties are such
that, that it's not quite.

522
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,360
And so using these average bond energies,
you gotta be careful.

523
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,650
The other thing that I'll also tell you
is if you actually take the sum of these

524
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:05,420
numbers and add them up is
three 97.5 it's exactly this.

525
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,490
And uh, this is a testament to the
guys who did these measurements.

526
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:12,020
These are very hard experiments to do.

527
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,960
And that means that each one of these
four numbers is right because you know,

528
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:18,470
this thing has to be right. The four of
these guys have to add to these things.

529
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,470
So here the,
so some of these things is this,

530
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,920
that means the first law of thermodynamics
really works. So this is a very,

531
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,250
this is, uh, this is, uh, this
is a very interesting, uh,

532
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,370
uh, set of experiments to do.
Okay. So here, uh, uh, uh,

533
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,530
I'm going to give you people, okay. So I,

534
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm allowed to show my last little
picture then. Okay. Here, uh, this is,

535
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,510
I'm in Boulder,
Colorado,

536
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,090
and we're not as sophisticated as
you people here are in new haven.

537
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,200
So it turns out here, uh, here.

538
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,680
So this is me. Caroline
Berger is the best, is the
captain and the negative ions,

539
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,820
the smartest guy in the world about doing
negative vines spectroscopy. A chuck,

540
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:03,560
the Pew, uh, is here, is,

541
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,850
is a Yale Phd is a member of the
National Academy of Sciences. Uh,

542
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,470
he's an organic chemist in boulder.

543
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,830
Elvin Ferguson is inventor of the
flowing after glow. Is that Noaa,

544
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,110
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in Boulder. Uh,

545
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,700
this is Steve Leonys who's have have,
uh,

546
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,770
one of the most famous chemical
physicists in United States and is now at

547
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,740
Berkeley. He was the head of the
chemical dynamics beamline out there,

548
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,600
cause then Ackerman is, was a
postdoc here, uh, in the 1960s.

549
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,560
Uh, and he's the, at the, uh, uh,
Academy of Sciences in Prague.

550
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,150
And this is, uh, uh, Ronnie Bierbaum,
uh, who is the master of the,

551
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,500
of negative on chemistry. So I've
given you a bit about 10 minutes early,

552
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:49,230
so I'm happy to answer any
questions that you, people may have.

553
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:55,770
[inaudible]

554
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,570
okay, I have one. Well,

555
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,290
let's go back to,

556
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,210
you hit a B blank blend.
Okay.

557
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,170
But I want to go back to them,
the getting some weed, just

558
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,280
for what it's worth.
That's uh, whoa. Yeah.

559
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,280
So now you go down and, okay, here we
go. Square. He'd go up here to sure.

560
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,650
Uh,

561
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,650
that both that spectrum you show that
had vibrational fifth estate here should

562
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:41,300
be, that's right. Yes. There it is.

563
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,740
Now, did people understand how
this was working, right? That,

564
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:51,741
that you put the laser energy
and you measure how much of it,

565
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,090
you mean you're measuring this
difference, right? That's right.

566
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,350
But sometimes some of the energy
went into vibration of the molecule.

567
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,040
So the energy that came out was,
uh,

568
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,380
to the extent that she went
into the molecule, right?

569
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,820
So here's here to say is when no
vibrational energy goes this trek product,

570
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,990
right?
So that's how you know what the lowest.

571
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,550
Now here's a peek here, right? So

572
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,220
that comes from the fact that you have
a vibrationally excited negative vine.

573
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,250
The, the negative iron,
instead of being in his ground,

574
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:35,140
vibrational state has a little bit of
energy and it'll actually be in the COO

575
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:39,610
stretch. He's where this'll be.
So if there's any energy in that,

576
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,720
in the negative ion,
then to go back to why Diagram,

577
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,530
uh, I've got to go here.

578
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,200
If you have a little, if you
have hot bands, in other words,

579
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:56,340
if you have some of the, of the molecules
are, have vibrational energy in this,

580
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,660
then the mall, then, then the molecules
aren't down here in vehicles to zero,

581
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,290
but they're actually populated
in higher states here.

582
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,550
So that means that those electrons will
take less kinetic energy to get off.

583
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,080
And you can always spot them because
they'll have a, a different frequency.

584
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,730
Tha Tha tha

585
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,183
here,

586
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,430
this the frequency diff that you're
going to have a set of frequencies here,

587
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,930
which will be, uh, a mode in the
neutral molecule. This is a method,

588
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,410
the methoxy radical and this
is that of the negative ion.

589
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,570
And so this is a vibration
in the negative on,

590
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:38,840
and there'll be because the electrons are
different in these things. So, uh, uh,

591
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,430
you can guess when you get to a
molecule which gets to be more complex,

592
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:49,720
uh, uh, like fun, oxy radical, I
talked to you about that for Nagase.

593
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,370
Radical has a lot more Adams.

594
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,630
So analyzing this steadily
gets more and more difficult,

595
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,110
but we like to do that.
That's what God put us on this earth for.

596
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:00,883
Oh,

597
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,830
you can also guess is he showed you what
I'm interested in right now in sugars.

598
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:08,560
Cause I'm interested in how
biomass decomposes you. Remember,

599
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,820
we know what glucose looks like.

600
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,240
Glucose is a molecule that has
many different hydroxyl radicals.

601
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,620
Hydroxyls on it and the hydroxyls
are all slightly different.

602
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,820
So now instead of making a negative vine,
like in methoxy mean,

603
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,060
how hard can this be? You only got
one o h what happens? Who, yeah,

604
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,270
ethylene glycol or if you
now have you take glycerol,

605
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,500
I think glycol has two hydroxyls.
Glycerol has three. Uh,

606
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,930
three oaks is going to have four.
Ribosome is going to have five.

607
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,220
So now you're going to have to begin
to tell which, Ooh, this came from.

608
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,210
So this is going to be a bitch,
but it, but if you can do this,

609
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,420
you would be able to take these molecules
and you'll be able to break all the

610
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:50,020
bonds in them in an order that she, in
the order of this, you'd like to do it.

611
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,450
And that's very interesting to do.

612
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,930
So you were very kind to speak about
putting electrons into sigma star or

613
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:01,714
bubbles.

614
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,080
It's Alison is not a big
fan of molecular orbitals.

615
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,330
Yes, that is true. Look,

616
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,070
I do valence bond work. Is it
your, this is a matter of taste.

617
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,140
Uh, there's uh, different ways to
view these things and, and uh, in the,

618
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:26,340
in,
in the end,

619
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,300
the only thing that counts
is what you measure it here.

620
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,143
If,

621
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,370
if you have a model that can
cause it can account for what the,

622
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:41,400
the patterns that you've measured and
you can predict what the next um, uh, uh,

623
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:45,720
values are going to be. You got to,
you have you, you understand this and,

624
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,120
but it's the data.
Is that what survives?

625
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:52,320
The rest of it is all a matter of opinion.
He likes Sigma Star overalls. I don't,

626
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,650
okay. You were talking about, uh,

627
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,130
the stability of the [inaudible]
rabbit hole in terms of its resonance

628
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:06,240
stabilization. Yes. So I think
these people could help you out

629
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,600
or at least point out
something interesting though

630
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,313
that uh,

631
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,780
this radical is stable because you can
draw resonance structures that have you

632
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,800
like, okay. How about if you say that

633
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,510
that did the, uh, starting on all that,

634
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,860
that's the bond that you're
going to right here. Right

635
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,740
here, I've got a pair of electrons. Yep.

636
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,290
That I can draw a resonance
structures and so on.

637
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,750
So it looks to me like it's worth
more here than it is. Listen,

638
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,040
dream on big boy.

639
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,430
How do I push this thing up? How do I
push this? How do I get this thing up

640
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,473
here?

641
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,133
Yeah,

642
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,610
sorry. Sorry. This electron,

643
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:23,070
it's going to get d localized
over the whole molecule.

644
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:25,330
If you try to do this
with an electron hair,

645
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,080
what you're going to have is,

646
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,110
okay,
so if I do that,

647
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,560
I, I'm pushing charges around. I don't
like that. Okay. All right. Here.

648
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,940
I don't like the fact that the oxygen's
going to have starting to, you're,

649
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:56,660
you're starting to suck electrons.
All you're, you're starting to,

650
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,790
as the electrons migrate down the,
this,

651
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,300
the oxygen oxygen's going to become
possible, be charged. So, Jeez,

652
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,070
I just would never do that.
But, but here, but what,

653
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:11,510
but what's true is that
bond energy honestly gotten
really and truly is 86 k cal

654
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,730
per mole. That is a fact. And this is a,

655
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,860
is a flippant way to, um, um, to, uh, to,

656
00:43:19,861 --> 00:43:24,290
uh, to have an, to have anticipated
this contrast that we'll say,

657
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,783
oh,

658
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,020
methoxy. Dot. Where's that
electron gun to go? It's,

659
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:39,070
it's lily stapled to the oxygen in and
there's nothing that can do. It can't,

660
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,200
it can't go anywhere. So when
you, uh, when you have them,

661
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,713
okay,

662
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,740
when you break that bond,
you get hydrogen, Nana,

663
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,650
you get the doc that
just stuck right there.

664
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,670
As you pull this bond off the.now,
uh,

665
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,040
is able to be the local ice and spread
around the whole ring. And that's, and,

666
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,340
and this bond energy then in in
a funnel that this bond energy,

667
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,150
and it's going to be 86 k cal per mall.

668
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,900
They saying lets you measure
the absolute he information

669
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,270
of two 98.

670
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:22,820
Oh,

671
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,820
this thing that has this is this low
bond energy is going to mean that this,

672
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,590
the heat, this heat of formation
is, is going to be low. So what,

673
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,220
what that means is if we're
trying to study Lignin, Lignin,

674
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,660
Lignin or trees, okay.
You know, the uh, uh,

675
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,280
you take a chainsaw and you're
cutting trees down there,

676
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,170
that's very tough material. And these
are these, all these compounds are,

677
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,080
are, are, uh, long, uh,

678
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,710
in three dimensional polymers
of Aero Al Kill ethers.

679
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,270
So if you know the heat of
formation, foxy radical, um,

680
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,810
this bond is turns out
to be 62 K cal per mol.

681
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,720
And if you do these in,

682
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,470
yeah,

683
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,280
this,

684
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,140
it's like 90 and that's a volt and a half.

685
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,640
So when you, when you heat this, these
all these molecules break apart him.

686
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,340
The first thing they do is
they farm from oxy radicals.

687
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,150
And this is if this triggers a
decomposition of these things.

688
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,420
So it turns that I don't like,

689
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,480
I don't like these things that in the
neutral molecule being delocalized because

690
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:37,130
I think you have to separate
charge and I don't like that

691
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,770
there are actually people back there
are smart. That's kind of stuff.

692
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,880
Do you guys find that?
You know,

693
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,270
I know, yeah. What's the case?

694
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,990
It is a little bit

695
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,443
verbal.

696
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,990
Oh indeed. Indeed. There
is. If you, if you look at,

697
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,310
if you look at the EPR
spectrum of this radical,

698
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,940
it is delocalized all over the
place in here. I mean you're,

699
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:11,840
you're an expert in this,

700
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,090
you know about all these hyper
find couplings and whatnot

701
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,100
from the, from the protons are
out there. It's like an Emr.

702
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,240
So after the electron spin gets out
on these protons and it interacts with

703
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,270
nucleus,
even if a molecule is tumbling right,

704
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:29,010
you don't have to worry about
the anti for, yeah. So no
doubt gets the local eyes.

705
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:33,810
But why doesn't this one, so Barney says
it's because he doesn't like the charge,

706
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,190
doesn't like to separate charge and
residents strategies. But that's not,

707
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,970
is this cool on this law or what?
Anybody got an idea?

708
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,940
Well here we, we, we say, what do
you mean this is this cool ohms law,

709
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,530
cool ohms law is what it is.

710
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,900
Okay. Okay, so here,

711
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,440
so here if,

712
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,160
if you had, if you want to draw, if
residents forums like this are important,

713
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,580
then that means that that,
I think as a consequence of this,

714
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:08,110
you have to have charge separation.

715
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:10,080
I think these are high
energy residents forum.

716
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,650
So if they're higher
energy residence forms,

717
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,760
they don't contribute to the super
position of the wave function is the way I

718
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,850
say that because I have a
valence bond going. Okay.

719
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,970
But, but what's true is, is Eddie
six k cal per mole, nothing.

720
00:47:24,971 --> 00:47:26,860
Could be not about that.
Okay.

721
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,540
Okay. I think we're
good. Thank [inaudible].
