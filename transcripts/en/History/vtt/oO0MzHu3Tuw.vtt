NARRATOR: Santa Claus, you

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.215
recognized all over the world.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.509
But did you know
Santa wasn't always

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.553
the fat man in the red suit?

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:14.639
This is "Biography."

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.016
Before the 1860s,
Santa was represented

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:22.272
as everything from a jolly
elf to a tall gaunt man.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.898
In central Europe,
Santa was even

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.484
depicted alongside the
Krampus, a devilish figure

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.446
who punishes bad children.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.781
Eh, yikes.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:37.078
For a long time, Santa didn't
exactly scream yuletide joy.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.456
So where did the man
in red come from?

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.958
There is a popular myth
that advertisers invented

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.127
the Santa we know and love.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.296
But that's not true.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.590
Actually, an illustrator
named Thomas Nast

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.343
helped bring us jolly old Saint
Nick back during the Civil War.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:55.096
Nast was well-known for
his political cartoons.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.848
He created the elephant
figure that stands

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.016
for the US Republican Party.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.434
[elephant trumpet call]

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.144
And he may have been the
first cartoonist to give

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.063
Uncle Sam his iconic goatee.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.316
Nast drew his first Santa
for "Harper's Weekly"

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.902
in 1862 as part of
a political cartoon

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.612
supporting Union troops.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.030
Take a closer look.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.657
Santa's style is already
starting to take shape.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.826
He's sporting the
classic white beard.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.369
But check out his outfit.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.455
He's in a stars
and stripes suit.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:24.250
Nast's first Santa wasn't
exactly the one we know today,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.919
but it was close.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.339
He spent the next two decades
nailing down Santa's look,

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.300
eventually landing on the
red-suited rosy-cheeked guy

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.220
we know and love.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.681
His interpretation became
the American Santa.

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.768
From there, it spread
across the globe.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.730
Santa's new look showed up in
advertisements and magazines.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.317
And American troops
spread the image abroad.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.320
Soon, elements of Nast's design
could be seen in Christmas

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.613
traditions all over the world.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.284
So next time you
think about Santa,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.622
remember it could be this spooky
elf on your Christmas cards.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.708
But thanks to Thomas Nast, we've
got the lovable guy in red.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.710
