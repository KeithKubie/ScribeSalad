00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:01.834
Abrams: Hi, my name
is Jacob Abrams.

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:03.934
I'm a director of engineering
at Glu Mobile.

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:05.734
I'm here to show you
my Android application.

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.667
It's called Bonsai Blast.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:08.834
It's a simple game.

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.234
We have a couple
different modes:

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.767
Survival and Adventure.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.167
I'm gonna show off
Survival here.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:16.300
Just press here
to go into the game.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.801
It's a simple puzzle game.

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.734
It has many different levels
with the balls.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.834
You match three balls,
they explode,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.934
and they don't get
any closer to the end.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.400
When it gets to the end,
it goes down the drain,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.934
and you lose.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:31.133
So here I am.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.267
I'm just matching
these three colors,

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.033
trying to keep the balls from
getting too close to the end.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.701
So I was just playing
Survival mode.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.234
Now I'm gonna switch over
to our other mode,

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:42.434
Adventure mode.

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:43.667
Just bring up the pause menu,

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:46.734
click right here,
and withdraw from this mode.

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.734
We're gonna just go right here
into the other mode,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:49.901
Adventure mode.

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:51.734
And so in this mode,
you get to unlock

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:53.767
all the different levels
and features that are available

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.667
in Bonsai Blast.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:59.634
So we'll start out
on this level three right here.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:01.200
All right,
so the technique here

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.367
is to get as many points
as you can

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:04.701
and fill up the bar
over here

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:05.734
at the top of the screen.

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:07.334
So there I got a big bonus,

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.100
'cause I just unlocked
a treasure chest.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.901
Uh...

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.334
at this point, I'm simply
matching three

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:18.100
and trying to gain
as many points as I can.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.501
So my company, Glu Mobile,

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.601
we decided to develop
a game for Android.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.367
We picked a game
called Bonsai Blast to develop.

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.300
It takes advantage of a lot of
the features that Android has.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.901
It has a touch screen interface.

00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.467
It has a high frame rate.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.868
Lots of sound effects.

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.100
And, uh, it's a fun game
to play.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.634
But it's a difficult game
to master.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.367
So how we developed this game,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.634
we basically ported this game
from J2ME.

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:47.033
So it's got a MIDlet class
and a canvas, just like J2ME,

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.234
but we switched that
to an activity,

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.234
which is like a MIDlet

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.367
and a view which is like
a canvas.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.567
Uh, that part
was pretty simple.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:57.133
Then we moved on
to working on things

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.667
like CPU usage.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:02.033
Uh, one of the advantages
of Android

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.934
is that it has a simple
tick interface.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:07.467
Basically, we just used
the OnDraw method

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.701
to do our threading.

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.133
We called invalidate
in gameplay

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:16.300
to increase the performance
to the absolute maximum.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.634
Uh, when you're in a menu
that has animation,

00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:20.968
we use post-invalidate delay

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:24.834
to slow down the frame rate,
but free up the CPU

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.133
so it's not killing
the battery,

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.267
because this
is a mobile device.

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:30.701
When you're in a non-static--

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:33.467
when you're
in a static screen, we use--

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:36.934
uh, we turn off
the constant repainting

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:39.467
so that the hand set's
not draining the battery,

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.467
and we only respond
to user input.

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.434
And that way,
the battery life is kept

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.033
to an absolute maximum
while you're playing our game.
