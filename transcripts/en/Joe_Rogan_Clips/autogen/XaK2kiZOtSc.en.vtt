00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
is bright and strange and cold and they
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600
is bright and strange and cold and they
think that what this is is they're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
think that what this is is they're
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.959
think that what this is is they're
they're saying that we had this idea

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969
they're saying that we had this idea
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.340
they're saying that we had this idea
that children don't have memories that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
that children don't have memories that
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619
that children don't have memories that
babies don't have memories and so they

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
babies don't have memories and so they
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.000
babies don't have memories and so they
say well why wouldn't they have memories

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
say well why wouldn't they have memories
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260
say well why wouldn't they have memories
that's ridiculous of course they have

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
that's ridiculous of course they have
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330
that's ridiculous of course they have
memories they have brains they they grab

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
memories they have brains they they grab
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.439
memories they have brains they they grab
your finger they looked you in the eye

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
your finger they looked you in the eye
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779
your finger they looked you in the eye
they would have a memory of every second

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
they would have a memory of every second
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299
they would have a memory of every second
that they were born and it's probably

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
that they were born and it's probably
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820
that they were born and it's probably
one of the most profound and disturbing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
one of the most profound and disturbing
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830
one of the most profound and disturbing
memories because before that everything

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
memories because before that everything
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690
memories because before that everything
is incredibly peaceful inside the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
is incredibly peaceful inside the
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090
is incredibly peaceful inside the
mother's womb you know you're just like

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
mother's womb you know you're just like
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.550
mother's womb you know you're just like
taken and pulled out and then there's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
taken and pulled out and then there's
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200
taken and pulled out and then there's
this bright light above you've never

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
this bright light above you've never
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.780
this bright light above you've never
experienced any light so every and your

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
experienced any light so every and your
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.390
experienced any light so every and your
visual perception your field of view is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
visual perception your field of view is
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.859
visual perception your field of view is
all distorted right this is the first

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
all distorted right this is the first
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929
all distorted right this is the first
time using your eyes that's why people

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
time using your eyes that's why people
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.010
time using your eyes that's why people
are saying yes that's interesting this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
are saying yes that's interesting this
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440
are saying yes that's interesting this
is a theory it makes sense to me because

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
is a theory it makes sense to me because
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.899
is a theory it makes sense to me because
of you think about more sense than the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
of you think about more sense than the
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749
of you think about more sense than the
abduction so what does because people

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
abduction so what does because people
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.370
abduction so what does because people
don't really go anywhere see the thing

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
don't really go anywhere see the thing
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380
don't really go anywhere see the thing
about the abduction thing as they put

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
about the abduction thing as they put
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.770
about the abduction thing as they put
like cameras in people's rooms and and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
like cameras in people's rooms and and
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.660
like cameras in people's rooms and and
they say they have these alien abduction

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
they say they have these alien abduction
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980
they say they have these alien abduction
experiences but they don't go anywhere

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
experiences but they don't go anywhere
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.899
experiences but they don't go anywhere
so what they're doing is their dream

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
so what they're doing is their dream
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.560

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720
yeah sure yeah yeah this was also a
theory while natural childbirth is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
theory while natural childbirth is

theory while natural childbirth is
supposed to be less traumatic like women

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920

yeah that is actually kind of like
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.050
yeah that is actually kind of like
moving back to you know it's men start

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
moving back to you know it's men start
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.790
moving back to you know it's men start
to get involved in childbirth around the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800
to get involved in childbirth around the
 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.160
to get involved in childbirth around the
17th century 18th century what happen

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
17th century 18th century what happen
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280
17th century 18th century what happen
before it was mostly women so women in

before it was mostly women so women in
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.900
before it was mostly women so women in
the village would come and actually the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
the village would come and actually the
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.750
the village would come and actually the
term gossip comes from the idea the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
term gossip comes from the idea the
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460
term gossip comes from the idea the
women who would spread the word in the

labor they were called the gossips so
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.550
labor they were called the gossips so
they spread the word negative thing

they spread the word negative thing
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.410
they spread the word negative thing
later so that the gossips would spread

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
later so that the gossips would spread
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.090
later so that the gossips would spread
the word the women would come in this

be brought in if the mother was dying or
 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.410
be brought in if the mother was dying or
if the child was dying and then in that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420
if the child was dying and then in that
 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600
if the child was dying and then in that
case instruments were brought in to the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610
case instruments were brought in to the
 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.940
case instruments were brought in to the
birth the birthing chambers so the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
birth the birthing chambers so the
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.910
birth the birthing chambers so the
doctor might come in and he might take

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920
doctor might come in and he might take
 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.790
doctor might come in and he might take
these sort of forceps and the baby apart

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800
these sort of forceps and the baby apart
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.370
these sort of forceps and the baby apart
and take the baby out baby would die but

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
and take the baby out baby would die but
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.900
and take the baby out baby would die but
in those cases it was like really

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
in those cases it was like really
 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.610
in those cases it was like really
extreme like this was gonna happen like

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
extreme like this was gonna happen like
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.930
extreme like this was gonna happen like
either the mother is gonna die the baby

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
either the mother is gonna die the baby
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.100
either the mother is gonna die the baby
was gonna die both of them were gonna

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
was gonna die both of them were gonna
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.810
was gonna die both of them were gonna
die or if the baby was coming out feet

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820
die or if the baby was coming out feet
 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.350
die or if the baby was coming out feet
first

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360
first
 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.250
first
yeah Midwife could could handle that on

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
yeah Midwife could could handle that on
 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.580
yeah Midwife could could handle that on
but this you know the cesarean section

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590
but this you know the cesarean section
 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.040
but this you know the cesarean section
people think that it comes from the term

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050
people think that it comes from the term
 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.260
people think that it comes from the term
that the idea that Julius Caesar was

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270
that the idea that Julius Caesar was
 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.870
that the idea that Julius Caesar was
ripped from the womb of his mother but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880
ripped from the womb of his mother but
 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.330
ripped from the womb of his mother but
um it's unlikely that that story is true

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
um it's unlikely that that story is true
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.940
um it's unlikely that that story is true
because his mother lives into old age so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950
because his mother lives into old age so
 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.979
because his mother lives into old age so
probably the the terms the Sirian comes

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989
probably the the terms the Sirian comes
 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.340
probably the the terms the Sirian comes
from the Latin term meaning to cut

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350
from the Latin term meaning to cut
 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.670
from the Latin term meaning to cut
and the first sort of record we have of

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680
and the first sort of record we have of
 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.140
and the first sort of record we have of
this happening I think is in the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
this happening I think is in the
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.360
this happening I think is in the
sixteenth century and it's a farmer and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
sixteenth century and it's a farmer and
 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.700
sixteenth century and it's a farmer and
he takes the instruments that he uses to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710
he takes the instruments that he uses to
 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.800
he takes the instruments that he uses to
castrate his pigs to cut this baby out

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810
castrate his pigs to cut this baby out
 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.520
castrate his pigs to cut this baby out
of his wife yeah and and we don't have

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530
of his wife yeah and and we don't have
 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.440
of his wife yeah and and we don't have
any records of whether this it's

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450
any records of whether this it's
 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.150
any records of whether this it's
probably didn't work again no idea of

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
probably didn't work again no idea of
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.790
probably didn't work again no idea of
germs all this kind of stuff no she

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
germs all this kind of stuff no she
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.250
germs all this kind of stuff no she
lived we yeah I don't have there's no

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260
lived we yeah I don't have there's no
 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.990
lived we yeah I don't have there's no
sort of it doesn't follow the records

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000
sort of it doesn't follow the records
 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
sort of it doesn't follow the records
don't follow the story but she probably

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010
don't follow the story but she probably
 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.870
don't follow the story but she probably
died and the baby probably died as well
