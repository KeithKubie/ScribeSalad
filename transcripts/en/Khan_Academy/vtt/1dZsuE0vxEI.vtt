00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.651
- [Voiceover] A farmer used
fence posts to build a fence

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:06.666
for Hazel Horse and Pauly Pony.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.300
The farmer used 26 fence posts

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.201
to build Hazel Horse's fence

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:16.667
and 19 fence posts

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.733
to build Pauly Pony's fence.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:24.133
How many fence posts did
the farmer use in all?

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.104
If you like, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:29.032
and try to figure it out.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.266
I'm assuming you have tried it,

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:33.702
so let's think it through together.

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.466
Whenever you think about
a word problem like this,

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.633
what are they asking?

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.333
What's the story in our head?

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.067
A farmer is building fence
posts for two different horses,

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:42.458
Hazel Horse and Pauly Pony.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:45.184
There's even a picture of Hazel
Horse here and Pauly Pony.

00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:46.766
They look very similar.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.333
The farmer used 26 fence posts
to build Hazel Horse's fence,

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:54.933
so that's these 26 fence
posts right over here.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.469
These are the 26 fence posts

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.222
for Hazel Horse's fence.

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:02.966
I haven't counted it, but I'll
just take their word for it

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.701
that there are 26 here,
and then 19 fence posts

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.500
to build Pauly Pony's fence.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.769
These are 19 fence posts right over here.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:16.276
How many fence posts did
the farmer use in all?

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.067
In all, so what do they want us to do?

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:20.907
Do they want us to add or
subtract these numbers?

00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:22.612
Well, they're looking at "in all."

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:26.466
How many total fence
posts did the farmer use?

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:28.466
Well, the total is how many used

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.999
in Hazel's fence and Pauly's fence,

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.300
so we should add these two numbers.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.076
We're going to add 26 plus
the 19, or let me see.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:43.113
The 26 is in that brownish color, 26.

00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:45.367
That's the 26 fence posts to
build Hazel Horse's fence,

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:47.833
and we're going to add that to 19.

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.133
We're going to add that to 19,

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:54.765
so 26 for Hazel Horse

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:59.033
and then 19 for Pauly Pony.

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.281
We want to add them because we're saying

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:02.666
how many fence posts were used in all,

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:06.630
or in Hazel's and Pauly's fences.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.334
Let's add these two together.

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:10.699
First, let's go to the ones place.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.660
Six ones plus nine ones is 15 ones,

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:18.829
but we only can write one digit here,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.733
so 15 ones is the same thing

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:24.340
as five ones and one 10, right?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.100
15 is just one 10 and five ones,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.466
so we've essentially
regrouped those 10 ones

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.900
as one 10 right over here,
or as some people say,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.733
you carry the one, but
that's all it's saying.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:37.633
We're saying six plus nine is 15.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.723
15 is five ones and one 10.

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.333
We wrote that one 10 in the tens place,

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:47.317
and then one 10 plus two 10s plus one 10.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:49.235
Well, the one plus two plus one is four,

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.353
so it's going to be four 10s, so 45.

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:53.768
How many fence posts used in all?

00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:57.033
45.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.200
Now, some of you all that
might have somehow tried

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.100
to maybe subtract the 19 from 26,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.799
that would have been
what you would have done

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.515
if they said, "How many more
fence posts did the farmer use

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:10.799
"for Hazel's fence than for Pauly's?"

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.667
Then, you would subtract 19
from 26 to find the difference,

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.466
but they didn't ask us how
many more fence posts were used

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:20.938
for Hazel than for Pauly, or
how many fewer fence posts

00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:22.366
were used for Pauly than Hazel.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:23.266
They didn't ask us that.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:27.035
They said, "How many fence posts
did the farmer use in all,"

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.171
and that's why we added.
