00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
Here’s a couple of words you might find
useful in the study of human metabolism.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.760
They also happen to be two words that I enjoy
in general.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.900
Brunch. Buffet.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.120
I’d throw in “all you can eat,” but
that’s kind of implied, and then it would

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.700
be six words, unless you hyphenate them. But
still, brunch buffet!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.839
You’ve got eggs and bacon and french toast
and biscuits and fruit and some kind of weird

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.619
sort of jello thing in there. And once you’ve
paid your twelve-ninety-nine, you know there’s

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.470
a pretty good chance that it’s all gonna
get eaten.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.470
But here’s the thing.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.319
Not everything that you fit into your face
during brunch-time is going to be handled

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.649
the same way by your body.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.720
After you’re done digesting, some nutrients
will go straight to your body’s pile of

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.840
stuff to burn right away. But others will
have to be converted into something else.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.790
For example, the carbs and fats in your buttered
toast can be directly oxidized into useable

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.000
energy, but the amino acids in the bacon have
to converted to molecules that get broken

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.300
down like carbs, if you want to get energy
out of them.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.260
And while excess carbs and fat can be stored
in larger, polymer versions of their original

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.060
forms, any extra amino acids can’t be -- they have to
be converted and then stored as fat or glycogen.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.260
So, as I’ve mentioned before, the molecules
in your body are constantly changing shape,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
and renewing and rearranging themselves to
either build things or to use energy.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.009
And eating food replenishes these nutrients
-- especially glucose. Then, depending on

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.319
what your body needs, and when you last ate,
certain hormones like insulin will help decide

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.399
what to burn, and what to store for later.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.880
This, of course, is an important function.
Which is why things can go badly if this process

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.850
doesn’t work properly because of a metabolic
disorder, like diabetes.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.799
In that case, your body can’t properly use
and store nutritional energy, which makes

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.249
the very acts of eating and metabolizing more
difficult, and possibly dangerous.

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.969
Exactly how glucose levels can spike or plummet,
how we convert nutrients into energy, and

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.389
how all of that that relates to eating, and
hunger, and weight, metabolism, and your health

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.539
in general is -- guess what? -- complicated.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.719
But as you are a living thing that must eat
in order to stay alive, I’d say it’s worth

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.100
learning how it works.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340
And brunch is as good a place to start as
any.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.720
Waiting in line for the all-you-can-eat brunch
buffet is a good time to recall the law of

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.979
conservation of energy.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.759
The law simply states that energy can never
be created or destroyed; it can only change forms.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.690
And the processes of metabolism involves conversions
of energy -- either through catabolizing reactions

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.920
that release the energy stored in your food,
or anabolizing ones that use or store that energy.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.780
So, you can enjoy your short-stack of flapjacks
and biscuits and gravy, but remember: That

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.390
energy has to either get released, or stored,
somewhere inside you.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.070
Now, the conversion of food energy is part
of the great balancing act that is maintaining

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.950
homeostasis, and one of its greatest tricks
is cellular respiration.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.160
Cellular respiration is how we derive energy
from the food we eat, specifically glucose,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.700
which is where most of our food ends up.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.540
In order for glucose to become energy we can
use, we have to to give it some oxygen, and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.590
convert each sugar molecule into six molecules
of CO2, and six molecules of water, which

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.640
usually produces about 32 molecules of ATP.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.360
Cellular respiration occurs in three simultaneous
phases, where glucose is broken down by glycolysis

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.480
and other catabolic reactions; and then turned
into pyruvic acid and acetyl CoA; and finally

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210
ushered into the Kreb’s cycle.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.790
It’s all pretty complicated, but we covered
it extensively in Crash Course Biology, so

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.150
rather than getting into the blow-by-blow here, I
recommend you check out that video for a refresher.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.090
For now, just remember that cellular respiration
breaks down nutrient molecules to generate

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.330
ATP. And in doing so, it captures some of
the chemical energy that was in those bonds

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.520
for use in your body.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.240
Now, when it comes to how that energy is converted
and where, that depends largely on when you

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.440
ate your last meal.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.250
We all switch back and forth between two nutritional
states -- the absorptive, or fed state -- which

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.260
is during or after eating -- and the postabsorptive,
or fasting state, when the GI tract is empty

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.120
and the body is running off of stored supplies.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.160
So, say you’re just post brunch-buffet,
and you’re still in the absorptive state,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.250
unbuckling your belt as your digestive system
breaks up the eggs and bacon and French toast

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.560
and syrup into a bunch of mostly-glucose molecules
that pass into your bloodstream.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.530
The first bit of glucose gets delivered throughout
the body and is tapped to generate ATP on

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740
the spot, through cellular respiration.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.330
But since the meal was big and rich, there’s
more glucose floating around than your cells

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.500
need at the moment.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.150
And remember, ATP is too unstable to be used
for storage, which means all the extra glucose

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.540
is gonna get stored as fat or glycogen.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.180
And that storage is part of how you can end
up gaining weight!.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.240
Because: How much energy gets stored depends
partly on your basal metabolic rate -- that’s

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.510
the number of daily calories your body needs
to do business as usual.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.250
And that rate can be influenced by your age,
your sex, and body size or composition. A

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.920
young bodybuilder is gonna burn way more calories
than that tiny grandma, but generally, if

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.880
you’re absorbing more nutrients than you’re
burning, you will gain weight.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.270
So yeah, for that you can blame the law of
conservation of energy.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.270
Now, of course all nutrients are important.
I mean, your body is basically made of protein,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.740
so that’s kinda key.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.220
But in terms of immediate fuel, glucose is
the easiest source of food for cells like

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.130
your neurons. And it is always good policy
to keep your brain well-fed, so it doesn’t

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.710
get hangry, or dead.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.030
So, your body likes to maintain a blood glucose
level of 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.250
But let’s say that, thanks to the buffet,
you’ve now got 140 milligrams per deciliter.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.240
This means too much sugar is swimming around
in your blood, and your body isn’t happy about it.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.060
If your blood sugar levels get too high, it
can damage blood vessels, especially those

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.280
in the nervous system, heart, kidneys, eyes,
and extremities.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.520
That’s why diabetes is often associated
with a higher risk of heart and kidney disease,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.870
loss of vision, and foot amputation.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.310
But typically, rising blood sugar levels sets
off a series of events that trim them back down.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.500
Specifically, they trigger special beta cells
in the pancreas to start secreting more of

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.940
the hormone that regulates everything that
happens when you’re in the absorptive state.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.100
And this hormone is the all-powerful insulin.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.810
Insulin’s job in this instance is to move
glucose out of the blood and into storage.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.910
And to do that, it triggers a shift from catabolic
reactions to anabolic ones.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.940
For example, it puts a stop to glycogenolysis,
or breaking down glycogen in your liver and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.490
muscles to release glucose for energy, and
instead ramps up the process of glycogenesis,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.449
where extra glucose is linked together to
form glycogen.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.410
It also activates lipogenesis, where very
cool chemical reactions in the liver convert

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.440
glucose to triglycerides and then ship them
off to your adipose tissue for storage.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.340
A similar thing happens with the extra fatty
acids that you got from the eggs and bacon

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.990
that aren’t immediately needed for energy.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.840
They get processed through lipogenesis, too,
and are rebuilt back into triglycerides, and

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.419
then tucked away for a rainy day.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.160
The thing is, if you’re thinking about this, all these
lipids hate water, right? Fat and water don’t mix.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.860
So you should be asking yourself, how can they be
transported in the blood, when they’re so hydrophobic?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.180
The answer is lipoproteins, four specialized
proteins made by the liver that surround fats

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.750
and allow them to move in the bloodstream
as an emulsion.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.500
You’ve probably heard of some of these.
One is low density lipoprotein -- also known as

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.360
LDL cholesterol. It’s what delivers some of the glucose
and fat that you just ate to your body’s fat deposits.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.780
Another is high density lipoprotein -- or
HDL cholesterol, which is the “good” cholesterol.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.720
It starts out as an empty protein packet sent
out by the liver to gather up other cholesterols

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.360
from the blood, and artery walls, and other
cells.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.150
HDL then delivers the cholesterol back to
the liver, or to places like the ovaries,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.380
testes, and adrenal glands, which use it to
make steroid hormones.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.720
Alright, so now your body has put all the
glucose and lipids and proteins where they

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.470
need to go, and you can just coast into the
postabsorptive state.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.889
But several hours later, even though your
small intestine is still working on what’s

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.710
left of the buffet, your cells have been helping
themselves to the remaining glucose in theblood,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.220
and eventually your blood sugar level will
start to drop.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.010
Remember, your neurons are on an exclusive
glucose meal plan, so they need sugar at the

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.240
ready. And if your body senses an imbalance
in blood sugar levels, it sounds the alarm.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.000
A decrease in glucose stimulates alpha cells
in the pancreas to release insulin’s nemesis,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.420
the hormone glucagon.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.669
It starts raising the blood sugar level, by
triggering the liver and adipose tissues to

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.929
metabolize their fat and glycogen stores,
thereby releasing fatty acids, glycerol, and

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:48.440
glucose back into the blood.

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.329
But if it’s been a day or two since you’ve eaten --
for some reason -- and you’ve burned through

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:56.880
both your blood glucose and your glycogen stores,
and you don’t have any sugars left to feed your brain?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.110
In that case, your body will launch into gluconeogenesis,
and convert fats and amino acids into glucose,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.810
so ATP synthesis can continue in your brain
cells.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.960
This process is a sort of last-ditch effort
by the body to protect the nervous system

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.940
from the damaging effects of low blood sugar.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.790
Now, of course, this whole system has flaws.
And one of them is that the whole setup is

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.949
almost entirely dependent on the proper release
and reception of insulin.

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:22.889
People with diabetes either don’t produce
enough insulin, or have abnormal receptors

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:27.300
for it, which is why they often have to inject a
pharmaceutical version of the chemical after eating.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.380
Otherwise, their blood sugar levels will remain
too high after eating, and they’ll start

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:33.960
peeing out large amounts of glucose to try
and balance the levels in their blood.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.250
The problem is, because glucose is being excreted
and not stored, it’s not available when

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.599
the blood sugar starts to drop, so the body
has to draw on fat and protein tissues for

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.570
energy -- which is one reason why sudden weight
loss can be an early sign of diabetes.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.110
Whether you’re diabetic or not, I think
we can all agree it is important to respect

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.600
your blood sugar levels, and remember to continue
feeding the beast.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.450
But, at brunch, just -- you know -- use small
plates, and try to keep the trips to the buffet

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.330
to under five or so.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.440
Today, you learned how your body uses energy
from food -- including through cellular respiration,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.790
which converts glucose into ATP; glycogenesis,
which converts it to glycogen; and lipogenesis,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.200
which converts it to triglycerides. And you
also learned how insulin regulates your sugar

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.550
levels.
