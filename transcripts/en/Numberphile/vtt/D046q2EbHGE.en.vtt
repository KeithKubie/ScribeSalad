Tadashi: Piece of red string,

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.680
and, I threaded it through, a binder clip.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.840
The binder clip is carrying a passenger underneath.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.100
Let's say that this is a top of a mountain,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
and we are designing a funicular.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.460
I want to carry this passenger up to the top of the mountain, summit of the mountain.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.400
How can you do this?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.680
One solution is to just, uh, widen the string *cracks up* like this,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.000
and then make the whole thing go upward.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500
But I don't think the engineers will accept this solution.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.820
So, what we do, is to keep those two strings absolutely parallel,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.980
no cheating,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.660
but then tug on them in alternating fashion.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660
So tug, tug, tug, tug, and look!

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.200
The clip...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.980
starts going up, spontaneously,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.360
toward the summit of the mountain.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.836
That's strange, right?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.480
Because...

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.620
if you are just looking at the vicinity of my hands,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.420
what I'm doing is up and down, up and down,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.720
and it's a purely symmetric motion, up and down, up and down.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.320
So there's no directionality,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.360
and if anything, gravity's pointing downward.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200
I mean this should keep coming down,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.280
but instead, by doing a completely symmetric up-and-down motion,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.200
I can take this thing upward,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.480
in a way that breaks the symmetry, yeah?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820
Prefers to go up, and not come down.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.360
So, that is rather strange.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.920
And the wonderful thing about this is that it works even if you're not paying attention.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.420
You know, it's a really simple device,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540
and even if you're, uh, not paying attention,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.120
and being distracted by, for example, my friend, uh, Brady there,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.000
I can just do this, and then...

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.040
wait a minute, it's coming down, instead.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.800
So, and that's, that's wrong.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.540
So, I am just watching the [unintelligible].

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.680
No no, it's coming down, no, it's not going up.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.860
What is going...

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.320
Whereas, you know, you find, "I'm paying attention."

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.740
And, okay, so this is, uh, the device.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.900
And, if, if I were paying, paying attention,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm not being distracted by the camera or anything,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.680
then I can do this, focus, parallel,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.760
and tug, tug, tug, it does go up. [funicular tugging noise]

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.020
Brady: Hehehe, All right, what's going on here?

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.740
Tadashi: What we are doing,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.980
suppose that, keeping the strings parallel,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.120
I tug on the left one,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.580
whereas, I let go of the right one.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.980
And when they do this initially,  you see...

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.280
To exaggerate a little,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.940
this clip turns a little, like this.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.460
But that means, you see, that this string is touching the left part of the clip

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.020
only lightly. Whereas the right one is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.460
entangled with the clip

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.400
so this produces more friction

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.360
And in fact the static friction

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.280
whereas this can slide and that's dynamic friction

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.840
and we discussed that dynamic friction is slightly smaller than static friction

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.920
when i do this, this static friction wants to pull the clip down

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.620
and this friction wants to push the clip up

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.980
but because the right friction is the static and entangled friction

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.180
and the left one is the sliding and free friction

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.140
and this push up is stronger than this pull down

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600
that's why in this rope it goes up

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.100
and similarly when I pull the right one and left one

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.880
Now it twists like this

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.760
left one gets pulled up by the stronger friction

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.240
whereas the right one which is now pretty free

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680
can slide along the string and doesn't pull down

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.480
so that's why I mean going back and forth, back and forth like this

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.200
even if we keep it horizontal

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.260
I mean this up and down business is a red herring

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.280
it is purely a function of how the string is threaded through the binder clip

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.940
that determines which way it goes

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.580
if I do it for example, down

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.860
it still goes because the binder clip is threaded that way

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.580
when I turn it around

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.320
then the binder clip comes my way

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.000
or downward it's the same thing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.500
oops ahh hehe sorry maybe that's the end of the experiment I have to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900
have a okay, we got it, we got it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.740
okay I have to have some more tape

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.080
behaves exactly the same way

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.700
whereas forty-five degrees off

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.700
you get the...
