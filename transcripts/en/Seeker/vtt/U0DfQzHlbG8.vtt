00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.879
Sexual deception is a biological bummer - at
least for the party that is deceived.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.570
Male solitary orchid bees are the unfortunate
victims of the ultimate sexual trick.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.269
Unlike their communal-living relatives, solitary
bees do not have easy access to sexual partners.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.390
Males must rely on distinctive airborne chemical
cues in order to find a female mate.So what

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.820
happens when a male picks up the scent of
a sexy lady - only to find it’s not another

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.730
bee...or an animal at all?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.190
The majority of examples of sexual deception
come from members of the orchid family.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.500
This kind of mimicry has evolved independently
on at least four continents, and its existence

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.250
continues to perplex evolutionary biologists
and botanists alike.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.040
But why would a plant want an animal to have
sex with it?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.430
Many plants require animals (or other interventions)
for cross-pollination (reproduction), and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.560
sexual deception is thought to have evolved
from plants that offer food rewards to pollinating

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560
insects.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.090
However - in the case of this sexual deception
- after the bee does his “pollination thing,”

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.240
instead of receiving a food gift, the duped
male suitor loses his energy, time and in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.440
some cases, his sperm.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.270
And obviously gets no offspring.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.360
Orchids are able to synthesize scents that
are exact replicas of sexually active female

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360
bees.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.180
The accuracy of this chemical mimicry is astounding,
and this is undoubtedly what initially draws

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.850
the male’s attention.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.740
But the disguise doesn’t stop at the orchid’s
smell.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.220
Deceptive orchids have remarkable colors and
structures that render them nearly identical

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.860
to female bees (well, at least in the eyes
of the male bees having sex with them).

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.590
The shape of the flower, its UV reflectance
and size all mimic different parts of a sexually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.640
receptive females’ body.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.340
Once a male has located his orchid lover,
he will engage in ‘pseudocopulation’:

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.950
a variety of behaviors including full out
sexual action and ejaculation.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.810
Males will erect their genital capsules and
make convulsive movements, rubbing them against

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.090
various parts of the flower.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.260
But all is not lost for our misguided bachelors.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.200
Solitary bees have a sexual system in which
males are polygynous.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.950
They mate with many females during their reproductive
lives.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.510
If they happen to sex a few flowers on the
way to finding true love, there’s usually

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.030
more than enough sperm to go around.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.160
So don’t worry little bee, you’ll get
there eventually.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.900
