00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.367
FAVORITE SCIENTIFIC EQUATION?

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.534
I LOVE THE EQUATION
FOR KINETIC ENERGY

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:11.167
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY ACCESSIBLE

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.400
AS, LIKE, A BASEBALL

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.868
HITTING YOU IN THE FACE
AT 100 MILES PER HOUR.

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.601
YOU CAN DESCRIBE
HOW MUCH ENERGY IT HAS,

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.701
AND YOU CAN ALMOST
FEEL THAT.

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:24.400
AND IT'S 1/2 TIMES
MASS VELOCITY SQUARED,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S GETTING
INTO THE MATH OF IT.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
I LIKE BERNOULLI'S EQUATION.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.968
P1 PLUS RHO GH...

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:34.300
I'M NOT GONNA...

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.033
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT EQUATION,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.234
WE WOULDN'T BE FLYING FROM THE
WEST COAST TO THE EAST COAST,

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:40.567
OR AROUND THE WORLD.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.467
WELL, MY FAVORITE EQUATION
IS A MATHEMATICAL ONE,

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:46.400
WHICH IS E TO THE POWER
OF I PI PLUS 1 EQUALS 0.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.200
'CAUSE IT CONNECTS THE FIVE

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.667
FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL
CONSTANTS.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.033
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.901
IF YOU'RE INTO THAT KIND
OF THING, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.200
BECAUSE IT JUST WORKS,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.767
AND IT CONNECTS EVERYTHING,
AND IT'S THERE.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.968
AND IT'S OF NO VALUE
TO THIS SHOW.
