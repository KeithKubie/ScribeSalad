00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome to Lesson Three.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.520
Right now you have a web page that has
structure, but doesn't look good at all.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.570
That's okay.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.110
In this lesson you're going to
learn how to use CSS code to add

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.020
style to your page.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.690
Now as you learn to write CSS code,
you'll really be

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.260
introduced to one of the most important
ideas in computer programming.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.910
Don't repeat yourself.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.118
Avoiding repetition is essential
in all areas of programming and

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:24.750
this is where you're going to
be first exposed to that.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.662
So as you watch,

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.514
pay attention to how CSS allows
programmers to avoid repetition, and

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:33.250
how that avoiding of repetition can
really help you make good code.
