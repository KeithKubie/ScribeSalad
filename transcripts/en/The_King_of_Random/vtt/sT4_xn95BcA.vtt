00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
[Captions by Y Translator]
Guys, we've got some cool
new shirts up in the shop.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.300
I like this one.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.900
It's pretty cool.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.500
Got some nice "random happens"
writing on the sleeve.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.400
Get yours now.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.700
For thousands of years philosophers
have asked the question, what happens

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.900
if you put firecrackers in a toaster?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.812
Well philosophers,
today is the day that we find out.

00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:25.200
This is a standard ordinary toaster
and this is a firecracker.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.000
It's little but it
packs a good amount of punch.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.442
The premise is pretty simple.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll put a firecracker down
in the toaster,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
turn the toaster on, back off
and see what happens.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.700
If that goes well,
we'll try scaling it up

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
by using more firecrackers.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.800
Will a firecracker light?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.900
If it does light will it
damage the toaster?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.200
Will the toaster explode?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
That's what we want to learn.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.900
Before we start throwing explosives down
inside heating devices.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.300
We do want to go over a few
of the safety precautions

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.100
that we are taking.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.100
You probably have noticed
that we're inside the dome.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500
It's a large concrete structure made
entirely of non flammable materials.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.600
The floor, is made
of non flammable dirt.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.942
We have pretty much nothing
flammable for about 20 feet.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.200
Even though I don't think
that they are going to be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600
any flames shooting off of this.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.300
Additionally, the top
of this dome which

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600
does have a little skylight in it,
has been equipped with a spark arrestor.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.900
So if there are sparks they
shouldn't be able to escape

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.100
and light anything on fire.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.800
And we're also going to make sure
that we are well outside of the dome

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.800
whenever these go off.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.000
The toaster takes a couple
of minutes to get hot.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.900
We will put the firefighters down
into the toaster while it's cold,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.600
push down on the toaster button
and then leave the dome entirely.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.672
Everything is going
to be filmed with tripods.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.200
There's a couple
reasons for that.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.522
One, it eliminates the chance
of debris flying and hitting us.

00:01:38.882 --> 00:01:42.522
Two, it's very echoey in the dome
and firecrackers are loud.

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:47.200
Any sound in here gets
magnified quite a bit

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.600
and even with earplugs we wouldn't
want to be inside when these go off.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.100
Not only are we in a safe place,
but we also went ahead

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.432
and got a permit
from the local fire marshall

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:56.900
to be allowed to do this legally.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
You may notice that we are
also kind of out here

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.400
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.300
There's not much around
and there's a reason for that.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100
We're trying to be courteous
to our neighbors.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.900
Regardless of how well this does
or doesn't work,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.300
it's going to make a lot of noise
and we don't want to bother anyone.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.200
As one final safety precaution, even
though there's pretty much nothing

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.000
that could be lit on fire.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
We do have a couple of fire
extinguishers that we'll have on hand

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.200
and ready near the dome
but not inside just

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.000
in case there's something on fire in here

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.300
so that way if there is a surprise fire
we can make sure we can put those out

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.800
with our fire extinguishers.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.602
Here we go, starting off
with a single firecracker.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:33.672
Place that in,

00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:36.300
it's just sitting nicely where
a slice of bread would sit.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.832
Now we're going to press down
the button and leave the dome.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.082
Here goes.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:47.300
Probably take at least a minute
for it to heat up and we'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.400
see if it gets hot enough to ignite
the gunpowder fuse attached to that.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.300
I think that's
what's gonna happen.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.782
I think that the fuse
itself will ignite.

00:02:54.782 --> 00:02:58.600
It's also possible that just
the radiant heat won't be enough

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.800
and we'll try this again.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.500
Maybe tilting it in an angle to make sure
that that fuse is sort of in contact

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.520
with one of the heating elements.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.300
I think it went off.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.962
All right.

00:03:11.962 --> 00:03:14.642
Let's see the damage.

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:16.300
Oh, the toaster.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.200
The button on the toaster is still down
and these pop up when there's no longer

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.100
electricity to them.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.582
So it did not destroy everything so badly
that the toaster stopped working.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:35.922
Let's just turn that off.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.700
Well, we got one to work, sure,
but our toaster's still

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.000
intact and that's not so fun.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.700
So let's let's
scale this up a bit.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.520
All right, definitely going
for quite a bit more this time.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.612
All right, here we go.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.260
I'll be interested
to see when--

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.652
It started.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.900
That was some of them.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900
I don't know if it was all
of them. What we're going to do

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.500
is just let that run
for another minute.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.242
I can see that the lever
on the toaster is still pressed down.

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:17.300
If nothing goes off for another minute
or two we'll actually just unplug

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.500
the toaster out here.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.972
We've got an extension cord.

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:22.300
And just unplug that
so we know it's not adding

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.900
additional heat, let it cool off
for a couple minutes and then

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.700
go in and investigate.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
So what I was about to say is that
once I see the footage I'm going

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.500
to be interested in seeing like,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.600
how much it looks
like the toaster has heated up

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.292
before the firecrackers start going.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:37.100
Does it wait
until it's glowing orange?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.000
Does it go before that?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.600
Is there like one fuse that's
touching a heating element?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.332
And so that's going off sooner.

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:45.292
Find out.

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:49.200
Just don't want to be looking down
into an exploding toaster

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.472
as things are going off.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.400
Nothing else is happening,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.952
so we're going to unplug
the toaster from here.

00:04:57.882 --> 00:05:00.000
As I do that watch
the lever just pop right up.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.500
Now we'll just give that
a minute to cool down just

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.242
in case something's still going on.

00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:07.500
Ooh, our toaster is smoking
quite a bit still.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.400
It's probably just
all the burning paper.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.620
Let's take
this toaster, remove it.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.300
Oh, so the bottom
of this toaster kinda got blasted open.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.700
Fire crackers did do something
to it, for sure.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.292
I think that's how it's supposed
to be hold closed.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.632
I don't know how it managed
to shoot itself open, but it did.

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:30.000
A lot of blown up
firecrackers right there.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.552
Couple of them did not explode.

00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:36.800
The ones without fuses did not explode
and that one with a fuse didn't explode.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800
But our toaster,
I mean it-- the lever stayed in.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.400
Now it's unplugged

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.000
so it won't but the lever was still down
after everything exploded.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.942
So it didn't
destroy everything.

00:05:48.362 --> 00:05:50.422
Orange glow starting
to show up.

00:05:54.582 --> 00:06:00.192
And then just all chaos
breaks loose at once.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.212
It goes from nothing
to a hundred in two seconds.

00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:05.712
That's great.

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:09.082
One firecracker was neat,
a bunch of firecrackers

00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:09.600
was pretty good

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.500
but we've got a toaster still working
and a lot of leftover firecrackers.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.300
So now we're just going
to fill this thing up.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.500
We also have a couple
of these ground flowers

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.700
and a few of these sparklers.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.462
We're just going to fit as much
as we can into the toasters

00:06:23.062 --> 00:06:24.012
and then see what that does.

00:06:27.162 --> 00:06:29.692
Toaster stuffed full
of firecrackers.

00:06:29.692 --> 00:06:31.152
Let's find out
if it'll survive.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.682
Book it!

00:06:36.902 --> 00:06:38.800
Again, I want to see
the footage because I,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.700
you know, I wonder if the flowers
or the sparklers will go off first

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.200
or the firecrackers will start first.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.700
So much mystery.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.600
Oh, that can't be
nearly all of them.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.500
Something went off.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.032
I heard a psssh, I'm wondering
if that was the flower.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.700
Usually those burn
a little longer.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.180
I think that was round one.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.000
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal
and a Happy New Year.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.992
I still don't think
that was all of them.

00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:15.832
I think there's more.

00:07:16.492 --> 00:07:17.800
The lever on the toaster's
still down.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.200
There's kind of smoke
rising up out of it.

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:21.900
I assume that's all of
the burning paper that

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.100
the firecrackers are made out of.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:24.400
I kind of want it to just
light on fire.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.402
We'll see, maybe it'll happen.

00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:30.152
Oh, it's on fire.

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:32.200
Oh now the fire went out.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.380
It's on fire again.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.000
I worry for the camera.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.200
There's like fire
rising right up to it.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.760
Yeah, you might want
to move that camera.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.700
Plug your ears, back it off
because it's like,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.160
about to melt the camera probably.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.240
It's like, so dusty.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.700
&gt;&gt; Toasters on fire.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.600
The lever is still down
on that toaster, even

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.100
though the whole thing,
like literally the whole toaster is just

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.400
on fire this point.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.300
I don't think it's quite reached
the plastic housing.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.700
I think we're still burning paper,
but I'm impressed.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.302
That's only like a seven
dollar toaster.

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:16.100
Oh there it goes.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.500
I don't know if that
was timing or what.

00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh, and now
the flower went off.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.500
I think it popping back up,
shifted things inside enough

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.582
that changed what did.

00:08:27.552 --> 00:08:30.222
Now we just kind of have
to wait for few minutes.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.512
Suspect most things
have now exploded.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.900
We've now given
this toaster several minutes

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.200
while there were flames.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.552
So I'm pretty sure anything that
was going to explode has exploded.

00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:46.872
Yeah.

00:08:46.872 --> 00:08:50.200
The fire was basically
the burnt paper shells

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.900
of the flowers just sitting there burning.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.720
We have successfully
broken this toaster.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.080
It's very hot.

00:09:02.322 --> 00:09:03.122
Unsurprisingly.

00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:05.600
It was on fire.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.140
Of course it was hot.

00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:11.500
Random fact, the average household
in the United States spends

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.092
about 35 hours a year making toast.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.200
Here's the smoking remnants
from a whole bunch of firecrackers.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.560
Couple other types
of fireworks and sparklers.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.400
Twisted metal remains.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.400
Well, we've wanted to know
since the dawn of time what happens

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.700
when you put firecrackers in a toaster
and that question has finally been

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.000
answered for all of mankind.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.400
So explosions, flames shooting out
the top, melting the toaster itself,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.500
all great stuff.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.800
That is a big old pile of firework ash
and our toaster is quite

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.700
thoroughly ruined.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.100
The lever doesn't even
stay down now, even

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.782
if it is plugged in.

00:09:47.782 --> 00:09:49.600
It's just broken.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.492
I don't know exactly what part broke,
probably several.

00:09:53.892 --> 00:09:54.800
Guys, this was awesome.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.400
But that's not all,
we've always got more for you to see.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500
The Box up at the top
will transport you directly

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.200
to our last video
and you should check that out.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.900
The other box will show you what
YouTube thinks you should be watching next

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.100
and if you aren't subscribed
to our channel yet just hit

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.000
this bomb to get in the club.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.600
That way you never
miss out on a video.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.000
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.600
Talk to you then.
