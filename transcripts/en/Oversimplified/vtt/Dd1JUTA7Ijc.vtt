00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.930
Since Germany's military had to be reduced, Hitler could no longer remain a soldier after the war,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.389
but he kept working for the army as an informant.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.000
After the war, communists in Germany had attempted a revolution,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.260
and the government was worried about communism in general,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.780
so Hitler was tasked with infiltrating and reporting on any new political parties that could pose a communist threat.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.309
A new party called the German Workers' Party threw up a whole bunch of red flags, so Hitler went along to one of their meetings

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.380
but found that they weren't communists at all - they were extreme right,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.620
and shared many of his extreme beliefs, so he left the army, and signed up to join the party.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.200
His fantastic speaking abilities impressed the party's leadership and supporters,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.160
and he very quickly rose to the top.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.000
He decided that the party needs a makeover, so he renamed it to the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.900
National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi for short,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
and he gave it a new color scheme.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.220
The Nazis weren't very specific on policy, but Hitler made extravagant promises to return Germany to it's former glory,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.580
by undoing the Treaty of Versailles, and reuniting all ethic Germans into one nation.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.320
He also said that only pure Aryan people should be allowed to be citizens

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.930
And that all Jews would lose their citizenship. These ideas were already common in extreme right politics,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.849
but what set the Nazis apart was Hitler himself, and they quickly became the leading party on the extreme right.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.780
Many of the political parties in Germany at the time had paramilitary wings,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.240
and the Nazis were no different. Hitler set up the very descriptive "Hall Protection Detachment," later changed to the very delightful

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.159
"Gymnastic and Sports Division," and finally settling on the ominous "Storm Detachment", or SA for short. Their job was to defend Nazi party meetings

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.840
and intimidate political opponents,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.900
and they were frequently engaged in battles with

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.980
communists on the streets. Since the allies had demanded a reduction in Germany's military size, many trained soldiers were left unemployed.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.800
They liked the Nazi ideology, and it was only natural for them to join the SA, which grew larger and larger over time.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.879
The new democratic government that formed after World War I was pretty weak and ineffective. In order to pay reparations

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.380
to the Allies, it started printing more money. The problem

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.780
is that printing money doesn't actually give a country more money - it just makes money less valuable.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.580
So as the country printed more and more money, it became worth less and less and the currency crashed. In 1919, one U.S.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.620
dollar was worth about for German marks, but by December 1923, one U.S.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.780
dollar was equal to 4.2 trillion marks. The price of bread rose to 200 billion marks. Banknotes became worthless.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.900
Unsurprisingly, in such an economic crisis, Germany struggled to pay the allies. The French were pissed about this.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.119
So they occupied the Ruhr, an area full of factories, and took the economic output from the area as payment.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.000
They treated the German civilians badly and in total approximately a hundred and thirty Germans were killed during the occupation.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.360
Germans were furious and Hitler and the Nazis thought that now would be a great time to lead a revolution. In November 1923,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.720
inspired by something a certain bold Italian man did a year earlier,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.759
Hitler stormed a meeting at a beer hall, and called for an uprising against the government. With his supporters,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.080
he marched on the streets of Munich, hoping the police would join his side.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
They did not. *Gun Shots*

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.080
Hitler was put on trial for treason. He could have been sentenced to life, but the right-wing judges thought

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.190
he was a pretty cool guy.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.560
Hitler knew the judges and knew that they would be lenient.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.720
So he took the opportunity to make impassioned speeches during the trial and in the end

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.840
he was sentenced to just five years in prison, of which he only served nine months,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.009
and when I said prison, it was more like a pleasant hotel stay where he had plenty of time to write a book.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.419
The whole affair was covered by the media nationwide, and it made Hitler famous. Hitler and his extreme message were now known throughout Germany.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:26.309
But the everyday German still didn't care much for him. In the 1928 election, the Nazis only one about

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.299
2% of the vote. Many were still intimidated by all the violence and the shouting and how

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.899
un-politician-like he was, but a new economic crisis would change all of that.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.579
To help Germany pay its reparations, America agreed to give it loans. In October 1929,

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:45.599
the Wall Street crash happened and America wanted its money back. The economic strain that stood on an already struggling Germany was severe.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.500
Unemployment skyrocketed.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.130
Poverty was widespread and Germans were sick of it.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.589
It was clear that the newly formed democracy wasn't working. In the face of crisis, Germans began moving to the political

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.749
extremes. If you were German and want to change, your choices now were either the communists or the Nazis.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.888
Hitler claimed that he was the only one who could return Germany to its former glory.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.789
The Nazi party used propaganda to make Hitler seem like a great and powerful man

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.000
and they gave the German people a scapegoat to blame for all their suffering.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.279
The promise of a single strong dictator was a breath of fresh air for Germans after years of failing democracy.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.450
Some bought into his extreme ideology. Some didn't agree with the racism,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.929
but were willing to vote for him anyway. Many didn't know much about politics at all,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.090
but just got caught up in the hype. Election after election, the Nazis became more and more popular until in

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.970
1932, they became the biggest party in the German parliament.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.309
Hitler came to truly believe that he was some sort of great destined savior of Germany. He turned

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.780
megalomaniac. He decided to run for president and did surprisingly well, but still lost to the extremely popular World War I general, Paul von Hindenburg.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.159
Since he was now the leader of the biggest party, though,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.589
he demanded President Hindenburg make him chancellor.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.250
But Hindenburg was reluctant, seeing that Hitler was clearly such a big racist.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.550
Industry leaders urged

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.990
Hindenburg to give Hitler the chancellorship, fearing the rising support for communism, and leader of the center party von Papen, who had been secretly

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.209
negotiating with Hitler, said to Hindenburg,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.780
"How about we make Hitler chancellor on the condition that I get to be vice chancellor and most government jobs go to us, moderate

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.510
conservatives. That way I'll get to keep my power,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.739
I mean, we'll get to keep our power and we'll control Hitler like he's our angry little puppet.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.480
What could possibly go wrong?" As it turned out,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.240
EVERYTHING.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.900
Hitler became chancellor of Germany in January 1933,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.350
but he was not yet a dictator. In February, the German Parliament building was set on fire.

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.049
Historians still aren't sure who did it and many suspect the Nazis did it themselves, but Hitler blamed the communists,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.410
and he convinced president Hindenburg to sign an emergency decree allowing him to imprison all communists and other political opponents.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.329
Communists and others were sent off to the first concentration camp in Dachau. At this time, the elderly president Hindenburg passed away,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.880
giving Hitler the perfect opportunity. He introduced a law to parliament that would allow him to make all future laws and decisions

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.089
entirely on his own. With his political opponents in prison and the SA intimidating others, Hitler's law passed.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.410
Just two months after becoming chancellor, Hitler was now a dictator.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.950
He still had one problem. The leader of the SA wanted the SA to take over the job of the regular German Army and the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.690
German Army didn't like that idea.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.059
Hitler needed to maintain the support of his professionally trained German army, more so than his rough and rowdy SA.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.590
So one night in June

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.489
1934, he had Rohm and many other of his own SA officers rounded up and murdered. While he was at it,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.099
he took the opportunity to brutally settle some personal scores as well. Politicians who had disagreed with him in the past,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.299
reporters who had printed negative articles about him, one guy who did absolutely nothing,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.490
but they thought he was someone else. In some cases, even their families were murdered. In total, up to

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.059
200 people were killed in what became known as the Night of the Long Knives.

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:56.039
The army, now satisfied that they wouldn't be replaced, pledged total allegiance to their new fuhrer and Hitler's control was now absolute.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.609
Life in Germany changed violently. Freedom of the press,

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:05.069
expression, and public assembly were suspended. Jews were initially branded and their businesses

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:12.480
boycotted, and eventually, Hitler would go on to have six million Jewish men, women, and children killed in concentration camps.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.780
Hundreds of thousands of people were forced into sterilization for physical and mental imperfections.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.080
The Hitler Youth became a way to brainwash the young. Boys were trained to fight and returned home from camp violent.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.660
Girls were told their purpose was to have many pure Aryan children

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.489
and they would sometimes return from camp pregnant.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.609
When their parents were understandably horrified, their children would threaten to turn them over to the Gestapo for standing in the way of

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.909
Germany's greatness. The standard greeting changed and you could be sent to a concentration camp for not using it. This way,

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:47.609
it seemed like everyone was a Nazi supporter. If you dare to pose Hitler or speak out against him in any way,

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:50.549
you also would be sent to a concentration camp.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:59.009
German Nationalism captivated the young Adolf. Extreme ideology and anti-semitism vested in him as a young man living a hard life on the streets.

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:03.539
Germany's defeat in the First World War filled him with hatred and a thirst for vengeance.

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:10.498
A political movement that treated him like a god and hundreds of thousands looking up to him as their savior made him a megalomaniac, and

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:18.240
soon, his aggressive foreign policies would drag the world into a second tragic global conflict, otherwise known as...
