00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.600
RYAN GERMICK: Thank you
all for coming or

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.039
tuning in on the internet.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.550
RICH MOORE: Hello, internet.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.750
RYAN GERMICK: You don't want
to know what this man does

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.540
with the internet.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.350
Mr.--

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.985
RICH MOORE: The-- you're--

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:16.450
RYAN GERMICK: What?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.720
Go ahead.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.200
RICH MOORE: No, go ahead.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.570
Go ahead.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.300
RYAN GERMICK: No, your turn.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580
You're the star.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.520
RICH MOORE: You don't
want to know

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.550
what I do on the internet.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.290
That's true.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.150
RYAN GERMICK: OK.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.850
This is Mr. Rich Moore.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.740
Give it up.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.000
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.400
RYAN GERMICK: He's visiting
us from--

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.190
RICH MOORE: Whoa.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.250
Wait a minute.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090
Google's chair is
all-- this is--

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.960
RYAN GERMICK: It's to
add to the drama.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
We want to care about the
characters on the stage, so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.025
you put them in some danger.

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:41.340
RICH MOORE: We do.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.210
We do.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.040
You kind of created a little
conflict here.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.487
And you're trying to see
what I'll do, how

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:46.330
I'll adjust to it.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.130
RYAN GERMICK: My goal is to
create as much conflict--

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.270
RICH MOORE: Checkmate.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.180
RYAN GERMICK: Oh.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.540
Well, I have the same thing.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.320
I think they just have one
nail or something.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.330
It's to fold up.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.160
So it folds up.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.120
RICH MOORE: You guys have a
slide here in your lobby.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.830
RYAN GERMICK: We have
a slide, yeah.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.860
RICH MOORE: That's
pretty cool.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130
RYAN GERMICK: It goes
into the lobby.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.750
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740
I think the entrance to the
slide is on a floor that you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.600
can't go on unless you have,
like, a special badge.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.460
RICH MOORE: Well, where's
it's the fun in that?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, that's
what I want to know.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.680
RICH MOORE: Why would they--
it's like the Winchester

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.120
Mystery House or something.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.050
RYAN GERMICK: There's also, in
building 43, there's a bunch

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.805
of doors that open
into nothing.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.150
It's really spooky.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.310
What are we here for?

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.190
RICH MOORE: I don't know.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.490
I came for the slide, and
now I'm finding out that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.600
I can't ride it.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.370
RYAN GERMICK: We'll
get you in.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.480
RICH MOORE: Do you have
a fireman's pole?

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.030
RYAN GERMICK: No.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.455
Like the Ghostbuster house?

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:36.700
AUDIENCE: New York has one.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.460
RYAN GERMICK: New
York has one?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.920
RICH MOORE: Oh, OK.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.302
Well, good.

00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:40.186
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:43.640
RYAN GERMICK: Oh, of course.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.030
What else do you want to know?

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.480
RICH MOORE: Do you have one of
those balls where you put your

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.350
hands on it, and the plasma
makes your hair stick up?

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.090
RYAN GERMICK: Oh, like a Tesla
coil kind of thing?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.900
Probably.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.485
I would imagine.

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:55.480
RICH MOORE: You got
one of those?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.700
RYAN GERMICK: Nerd fail.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.840
RICH MOORE: Do you have
a Jacob's Ladder?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.550
RYAN GERMICK: Is that like a--

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.480
RICH MOORE: No?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.662
Gotcha.

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:04.075
Well, it's really cool here.

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.810
It's an amazing place.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.080
It's my first time
coming to Google.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.100
RYAN GERMICK: We're really
happy to have you.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.340
RICH MOORE: Well, thank you.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.360
RYAN GERMICK: You all know
this man is a director of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.680
Disney's new film,
"Wreck-It Ralph."

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.910
RYAN GERMICK: But that's
just the tip of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.960
the iceberg for you.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.150
RICH MOORE: The tip of the
animation iceberg.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.050
RYAN GERMICK: You've done
so many things.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.780
I want to go over some of those
things as we start.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.145
I have this clicker, and
I'm gonna go first.

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:32.780
RICH MOORE: Whoa, this
thing just changed.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.630
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
it changed.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.660
RICH MOORE: Oh, you did it.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.260
OK.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.070
RYAN GERMICK: I did it.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.090
So you are a college graduate.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.570
RICH MOORE: I did go
to a college, yes.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.400
RYAN GERMICK: Did
you graduate?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.980
RICH MOORE: I graduated
from a college

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.070
with a degree in cartoons.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.670
RYAN GERMICK: Fantastic.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.980
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.040
Which makes me the dumbest
person in this room.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.490
RYAN GERMICK: Well, college
was less expensive.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.920
RICH MOORE: No math.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.150
RYAN GERMICK: I also
went to art school.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.460
RICH MOORE: Yeah?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.410
Which one?

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.880
RYAN GERMICK: I went to
Parsons in New York.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.300
RICH MOORE: That's nice.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.510
RYAN GERMICK: If they had
a cartoon program, I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.050
would have done it.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.450
But they didn't,
so I couldn't.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.900
RICH MOORE: I love Parsons
in New York.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.330
That's great.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.394
RYAN GERMICK: But I also don't
know a thing about math.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.876
I have no idea.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.300
RICH MOORE: Good.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.180
RYAN GERMICK: It'll be
just the three of us.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.210
RICH MOORE: We've got all these
guys to ask, you know?

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.930
RYAN GERMICK: And your school
was pretty impressive.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.730
A lot of animators come
out of there.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.150
RICH MOORE: Yes.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.910
RYAN GERMICK: Started
by Mr. Walt Disney.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.960
RICH MOORE: Mr. Walt Disney.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.350
Walt Elias Disney.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.220
RYAN GERMICK: When you work for
a Disney movie, do they

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.700
just forgive your
student loans?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.720
Is that how they pay you?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.280
RICH MOORE: No, actually,
they know where you are.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.830
And they were on my
back every day.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.770
It was just, the email,
every day.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.960
Just a reminder.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.300
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.850
Interest.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.970
It changed again.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.410
Back here.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.900
So I did a little research
on the internet.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.530
And you had some pretty amazing
people in your class

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.440
back at CalArts.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.590
Do you want to identify some
of the folks back here?

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.600
RICH MOORE: Well, let's see.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.730
That would be me in the
yellow shirt, or that

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.110
kind of orange shirt.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.920
RYAN GERMICK: Basketball
player.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.875
The athlete of the group.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:58.850
RICH MOORE: Yeah, see,
look at that.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.960
No, that's Steve Markowski
standing next to me, and I

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.890
thin he was holding
the basketball.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.640
That's Tony Fucile
on the right hand

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.120
side, an amazing animator.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.990
RYAN GERMICK: All these people
are wicked accomplished.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.510
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.160
And we have Andrew Stanton
in the black shirt, in

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.820
the front row there.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.840
RYAN GERMICK: Director
of "Wall-E."

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.029
RICH MOORE: Director of "Wall-E"
and "Finding Nemo."

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.269
We have right behind him
Jeff Pidgeon, who is a

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.040
story artist at Pixar.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.790
RYAN GERMICK: This is his
picture, actually.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.900
I stole it from his--

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.640
RICH MOORE: Really, from Jeff?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.330
He's a good guy, you know,
to share it with.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.260
Thank you, Jeff.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.810
That's a nice picture.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.140
And right next to Jeff in the
Hawaiian shirt, that's Jim

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.570
Reardon, co-writer of "Wall-E"
and co-writer of "Wreck-It

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.250
Ralph." And Jim and I worked on
"The Simpsons" together for

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.260
a long time.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.320
And right in front of Jim, in
the pink blouse, is Brenda

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.240
Chapman, the director of
"Brave." So a lot of good

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.170
people in that class.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.980
RYAN GERMICK: A lot
of good people.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.300
That's exciting.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.570
RICH MOORE: Good folks.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.150
Solid.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.040
Salt of the earth types.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.330
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.112
Just good Midwesterners?

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:03.040
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.480
RYAN GERMICK: What did you
learn in art school?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.200
You didn't learn math.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.930
We know that.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.000
RICH MOORE: What did I
learn in art school?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.800
Well, we learned from each
other, really, in art school.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.280
As you see, our class was a
little bit bigger than this.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160
This is not everyone
in our class.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.710
But we were like a
little family.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.560
There were about 25 of
us in our class.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.630
And we really learned how to
collaborate with one another

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.550
very, very well.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.080
At CalArts, then as it is now,
the main goal is to produce a

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.770
student film at the end
of the school year.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.370
And it was always our opinion of
our class, like the better

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.610
our entire class's selection
of films were, the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.990
better the show was.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.285
No one was ever in it
just for themselves.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.490
We really helped each other
a lot with our films.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.290
And that wasn't always the way
in other classes at CalArts.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.210
And I can remember Brenda was
working on a movie, a student

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.290
film about an old lady who'd
been forgotten on her

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.590
birthday, and was having some
troubles with the story.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.820
So even though it was not
something that the rest of us

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.480
had any interest in-- doing
that type of film was very

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.830
serious, it wasn't very
funny at all--

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.610
everyone kind of put aside our
own tastes and really jumped

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.140
in to help Brenda
with her film.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.030
And that's just the
way we were.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.820
And we would always kind
of check on each

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.640
other and go around.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.060
We really enjoyed each other's
company, and we really kind of

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.120
honed the art of kind of being
there for one another and

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.370
collaborating and helping each
other make each other's films,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.360
or whatever the project was,
better than it could be with

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.380
just the one person
working on it.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.605
RYAN GERMICK: It's like the
Wu Tang of animation.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:13.390
RICH MOORE: That's right.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.700
Yeah.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.950
Pretty much.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.420
We were year 10 at CalArts of
the character animation

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.450
department.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.210
And this was also kind of the
way that year one was like,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.240
and that was guys like Brad Bird
and Joe Ranft and John

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.470
Musker, John Lasseter.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.300
This was kind of a tradition
and a way of collaborating

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.120
that was kind of born
earlier at CalArts.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.310
And really, I think when John
and Andrew and Pete Docter and

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.920
all these guys from that
school begin to kind of

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.140
creatively percolate at Pixar,
what they talk about the

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.050
process at Pixar, you hear
about that a lot, and the

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.650
brain trust, and just that kind
of collaborative effort

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.550
that goes into all their movies,
is really, I think, a

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.450
principle that was born kind
of from that college, from

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.360
those classrooms at CalArts.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.190
So I really look back at those
days, like day one, as being

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.770
just the beginning of a journey
into a wonderful kind

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.500
of medium, and mindset that's
just served everyone who's

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.190
been a part of it so well
in their careers

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.309
and in their lives.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:45.220
RYAN GERMICK: So another project
that after you got out

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.390
of school that you started on
was Mighty Mouse-- the "New

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.850
Adventures of Mighty Mouse."
That was another hugely

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.460
collaborative pool of genius.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.070
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.730
There was a lot of great people
working on that show.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.540
And you have to remember that
this was the summer of 1987.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.255
I'm sure a lot of these people
weren't born at that time, or

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:07.505
were very young.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.540
You, little guy, I'm sure
you weren't around.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.960
And the state of animation was
not good in those days.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.090
RYAN GERMICK: He-Man?

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.040
RICH MOORE: It was-- yeah.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040
RYAN GERMICK: A lot
of cheap stuff.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.500
RICH MOORE: It was a lot of
Saturday morning cartoons and

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.950
afternoon half hours that were
basically commercials for

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.690
cereals and for toys.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.550
So it was not as we
know it today.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.330
So none of us graduating at that
time were really going

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.040
into this business for
the money or the

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.350
prestige or the fame.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.870
We didn't know what we were kind
of stepping into, just

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.190
that we loved the medium.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.340
So to graduate and then be able
to step into a project

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.750
like Mighty Mouse, that was
spearheaded by Ralph Bakshi,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.840
who was an absolute hero of mine
for the different kinds

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.460
of things that he tried to make,
or that he did make when

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.050
I was a young person--

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:22.350
to be working with Ralph as a
first job was the best first

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.270
job a young animator could have
at that time, because

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.090
Ralph's a maverick.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.910
He's a bigger than life type of
guy who really made a name

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.300
for himself in animation and
did some great stuff.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.930
And to see him in action,
I mean, he's loud,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.980
kind of just big.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.540
It's like Jackie Gleason and
Fred Flintstone smushed

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.240
together into one
weird person.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.230
A lot of people here don't
know who either of those

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.750
people are.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.990
But it means a big loud guy.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.380
RYAN GERMICK: Who lives
with dinosaurs.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.990
RICH MOORE: With dinosaurs.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.210
He was a great man to work
with, and a mentor to me,

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.390
because you would look at him
and say like, wow, if Ralph

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.340
could make it in this
business, I can too!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.850
He was a real artist, and a
visionary, and a wonderful

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.040
person to work for.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.650
And on that crew were people
like myself, and Jim, Andrew,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:31.480
Jeff, John Kricfalusi was
a major contributor.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.740
RYAN GERMICK: Creator
of "Ren and Stimpy."

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.650
RICH MOORE: Creator of "Ren and
Stimpy." Tom Minton who's

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.490
a really well known animation
writer, wrote for things like

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:47.140
"Pinky and the Brain." Bruce
Timm, who kind of rebooted and

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.510
revamped Batman into the
animated "Adventures of

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.720
Batman." And just
a ton of others.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.810
Eddie Fitzgerald.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.580
I mean, I could go down.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.990
RYAN GERMICK: It's an
amazing pedigree.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.400
RICH MOORE: It was an amazing,
amazing group of people to be

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.770
working with, who really
loved animation.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.760
We were not there to
sell a product.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.310
We were not there to sell
a cereal or a toy.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.860
We were there to tell good
stories, funny stories, and

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.650
make entertainment.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:24.520
And we were very lucky as
graduating artists out of

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.830
CalArts to kind of land in that
position at that time.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.980
RYAN GERMICK: So you did a bunch
of other stuff as well.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.000
But in the interest of
eventually talking about

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.650
"Wreck-It Ralph." there's a few
other projects I want to

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.530
hear your thoughts on.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.260
So you were a huge contributor
to these guys.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.820
RICH MOORE: Well, yeah.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.870
About a year after working for
Ralph, another friend in the

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.730
business said, you've got to
check it out, because the

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.490
Tracey Ullman shorts, "The
Simpsons" shorts that they did

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.150
for TV, they're going to make
a series out of it.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.280
They're hiring people
right now.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.300
And they've got some storyboard
positions open.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.090
I know you like it.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.820
You should check it out.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.110
Because I love Matt Groening.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.840
I loved "Life In Hell," and
just all his comics.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.080
And I loved Jim Brooks.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.630
From a young age, I liked
"Taxi," and "Mary Tyler Moore

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.530
Show," and his movies
that he did.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.760
And it was like, wow, they're
going to do a primetime

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760
animated show?

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.810
And a lot of people thought,
like, oh, well, I give it two

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.730
episodes and it bombs.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.380
RYAN GERMICK: 27 seasons
later, or whatever--

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.630
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.410
So that was the summer
of 1989.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.490
And I started as a storyboard
artist.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.740
And it was a very, very small
crew of people, again, who

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.790
were there because they loved
animation, and they believed

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.510
in this project.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:06.790
And along the way, to just make
the story short, I was

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.290
promoted to be a director after
doing a few storyboards

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.450
on that show, because the
producers felt that I, out of

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.330
a lot of the people there, got
the humor and understood what

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.285
the show was about.

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.600
RYAN GERMICK: And some of the
greatest episodes, like the

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.410
first Halloween episode.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.000
RICH MOORE: Yes.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.600
Well, that particular story.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.190
The first Halloween episode
was divided up between the

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.790
three directors at the time--

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.170
that was myself and David
Silverman and Les Archer.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.990
We each took an act.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.860
And I did this act.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.970
RYAN GERMICK: How to
[INAUDIBLE] humans.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.520
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.220
Which was so much fun, and I
mean, I loved designing the

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.440
characters, and it was a chance
to kind of do something

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.510
very kind of a pulpy
'50s schlocky

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.700
horror type movie thing.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.720
So it was great to
be a part of.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:05.650
And it's not seldom in your
life, or in my life, at least,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.520
that you have a feeling in the
moment when it's happening

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.750
that you kind of get it.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.040
Like, you get what's going on.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.860
And I remember when I first
started directing on The

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.430
Simpsons, that reading the
scripts that we were producing

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.350
and working with that this was
really what I got into the

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.480
business for.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.330
It made sense, like, well, this
is what I wanted to do.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.850
And now I have this opportunity
to do it.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.190
And this could be great.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.870
This is as good as like, a Jay
Ward cartoon or something.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.980
That this really could
be something.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.460
And I had this feeling of I
would not be able to live with

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.170
myself if I do not give every
bit of my heart and soul for

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:01.260
this show, because I wouldn't
want to think, like, what if

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.280
I'd worked harder?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.970
Could "The Simpsons" have
been something?

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.570
There was just this moment of
dedicating myself to the

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.960
thing, of like, I believe in
this material so much that I

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.550
will do whatever it takes to
deliver what I think is the

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.530
end result that it deserves.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.780
RYAN GERMICK: What did that
mean in real life?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.490
Like, did that mean you pulled
all-nighters, or you--

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.350
RICH MOORE: I mean, it's funny,
because I was just

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.980
talking with Amy, who came
in with me today.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:39.160
I would say between 1990 and
1992, that's a big period of

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.900
time that I don't remember a lot
of stuff other than being

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.500
in those studios working
on those shows.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.640
Like, who was president, or
current events, or what shows

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.140
were on, or what movies were out
was just out the window.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.040
RYAN GERMICK: "Terminator
2" was decent.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.910
RICH MOORE: And I resent "The
Simpsons" for robbing me of

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.730
that experience.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.150
But it was at least a year and
a half or two years of seven

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:10.150
days a week, 12 to 18 hour days
for a year, year and a

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.230
half straight of producing
those episodes.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.460
No one was telling
me to do it.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.819
It was coming from me.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.410
I was demanding myself to be
there and just make it the

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.790
best it could be, because we
were doing it with a really

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.020
tiny crew, too.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.140
I mean, a fraction of
the people that

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.960
work on the show now.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.520
I was doing the job of what they
would now divide between

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.210
five people.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.670
And the other directors were
doing the same thing, too.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.920
It wasn't just me.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.990
It was that very small crew was
like, killing themselves,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.696
because they really, really
believed in it.

00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:50.080
RYAN GERMICK: So that
wasn't your only

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.100
project with Matt Groening.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.820
RICH MOORE: No.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.260
RYAN GERMICK: And so it's
something that has a lot of

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.590
love at Google.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.970
RICH MOORE: Would
be this thing.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.530
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.
"Futurama."

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.780
RICH MOORE: "Futurama."

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.690
RYAN GERMICK: So talk a little
bit about going from a

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.560
scrappy, upstart, small team
to like, kind of the second

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.850
version of a kind
of vision here.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.400
Like, how did that work out?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.460
RICH MOORE: It worked
out that--

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.190
well, I was on the Simpsons for
the first five seasons,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.390
and then I worked on another
show with Gracie Films, who

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.015
produces "The Simpsons," called
"The Critic." And we

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.250
did two seasons of that.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.520
And after that was finished--

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.550
see, Matt, even from season two
of "Simpsons," always had

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.130
the idea for "Futurama." I
remember one afternoon, he

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.280
took David, Wes and I--

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.170
the other directors--

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.840
out to lunch, and kind of
pitched through this idea for

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.720
"Futurama."

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.370
And we were like, that sounds
really cool, Matt.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.510
Are we going to work on that?

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.070
Yeah, I'm on it!

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.980
When do we start?

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.770
Oh, I just have to kind of
write some things down.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.640
And then we'll get
around to it.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.220
But I'm working on it.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.690
And then in Matt style, he's
got so much stuff going on

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.030
with "The Simpsons," it was
just such a big beast that

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.920
took his time.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.350
It wasn't another seven years
or six years until I heard

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.460
from him again.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.840
And I was now working at another
studio called Rough

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.640
Draft that was founded
by another

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.410
CalArts grad, Gregg Vanzo.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.160
And I was a partner in that
studio, and Greg was

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.100
associated with the
Simpsons also.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.080
And Matt came to us and said,
OK, I'm doing this science

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.700
fiction show.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.610
And I want you guys
to work on it.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:37.610
And it was a pretty scrappy
production.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:42.160
It's not like things became
kind of fat and benign.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.160
It was still lean and mean.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.850
Because at that point, "The
Simpsons" was still kind of

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.820
considered like, well,
that's an anomaly.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.880
"King of the Hill" was kind of
recreating that success.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.650
And "Family Guy" was kind of
happening at the same time as

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:10.190
"Futurama." So Fox was really
kind of banking.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.140
It wasn't a done deal.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.900
It was like, well, what
can you guys do?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.190
And one thing that Gregg and I
said to Matt about "Futurama"

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:27.020
was, look, if it's going to be
a science fiction show, the

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.970
quality of the animation has
to be higher than "The

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.910
Simpsons." We can't do like we
would do on the Halloween

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.720
shows, where we would try to
kind of animate cool looking

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.340
stuff, and it was
a little clunky.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.030
We really wanted it
to look nice, but

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.610
also in Matt's style.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.640
And that was always Matt's
thing, was, well, don't make

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.610
it too nice.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.630
I don't want to be shiny.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.840
I want it to look like
someone drew it.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:21:00.030
So it was at that point that
Gregg and his brother Scott

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.650
Vanzo, who was the head of
technology at Rough Draft,

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.280
they kind of cracked and they
wrote this program that could

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.760
take computer animation and
render it with the black line

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.660
around it where it looked
like it was like toon

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.460
shaded type of stuff.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:21.740
And today that means nothing,
but this was in 1989--

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.280
or no, 1997, I'm sorry.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.490
Big difference.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:35.980
So before that, you had stuff
like, what was that movie,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.160
"Titan AE," that Fox did?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, like
particle animated, like fluid

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.000
dynamic stuff that's
really weird.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.280
RICH MOORE: Well, it was like,
all the vehicles looked like

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.510
these beautiful, rendered shiny
ships, and then with 2D

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.370
animation flopped
on top of it.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.890
And it didn't marry together.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.680
And it made the world
unbelievable.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.300
RYAN GERMICK: Which is maybe
a good transition into your

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.560
latest picture.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.650
This is a Spanish film,
it's a foreign film.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.350
RICH MOORE: I wanted to work
in Spanish, you know?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.585
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:22:07.585 --> 00:22:09.350
RICH MOORE: I'm from Southern
California.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.930
And I have a deep love for
our southern neighbors.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.250
RYAN GERMICK: Sure, sure.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.650
So this is totally goes into
the realm of computer

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.360
generated 3D.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.980
Although before "Wreck-It
Ralph," there's a really

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.830
beautiful short film
that seems to be--

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.410
RICH MOORE: "Paperman." Yeah.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.160
RYAN GERMICK: That's really
terrific, and plays around

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.230
with the 2D/3D--

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.240
RICH MOORE: Well, yeah.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.820
It's, again, taking that concept
that we were talking

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.470
about with "Futurama,"
of how to kind of

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.970
marry 2D and 3D together.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:43.280
Because at Disney, where this
was produced and where

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.750
"Paperman" is produced, where I
work, it's unlike any other

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.050
animation studio today, because
we have a group of

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.290
traditional 2D artists and
animators that are the best in

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.980
the world at what they do.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.520
So a lot of credit goes to
John Kahrs, who created

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.420
"Paperman" and directed it,
because he wanted to try and

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.700
create something using digital
animation, but then also

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:15.870
merging it with the hand drawn
art in a way that's different

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.070
from what you've seen before.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.410
And I think it's really a
beautiful, really successful--

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.720
RYAN GERMICK: So even if you go
to the theater just to see

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.080
that and leave before "Wreck-It
Ralph" starts,

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.975
that's probably--

00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:27.410
RICH MOORE: Hey!

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:27.730
Hey!

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.050
Hey!

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.780
RYAN GERMICK: But I'm saying,
that's the added value.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.240
RICH MOORE: But the only thing,
it's black and white.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.980
RYAN GERMICK: Well, there's
spot color.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.760
There's a spot color.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.520
RICH MOORE: There's a
little bit of color.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.920
So you're gonna want to
stay for some color--

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.070
RYAN GERMICK: The first
10 minutes.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.290
RICH MOORE: --in "Wreck-It
Ralph."

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.590
RYAN GERMICK: So speaking of
color in "Wreck-It Ralph,"

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.810
let's talk about--

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.186
RICH MOORE: Trying to
sell it somehow.

00:23:46.186 --> 00:23:46.760
RYAN GERMICK: It's in color!

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.850
It's an amazing film!

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.710
RICH MOORE: Guys, if you want to
see a movie in color, come

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:51.200
see this one.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.620
We've got new colors.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.070
We've got some colors you--

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.620
it's kind of purple, and
a little yellow.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.720
RYAN GERMICK: So besides
the color,

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.535
there's an awesome cast.

00:23:59.535 --> 00:24:00.110
All right.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.940
We're going into "Wreck-It
Ralph" land now.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.270
RICH MOORE: OK.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.710
Got it.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.670
RYAN GERMICK: All right.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.420
The cast is amazing.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:07.940
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.810
Very, very good.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.010
RYAN GERMICK: They just
seem perfectly cast.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.195
So you have Jack McBrayer, and
Sarah Silverman, and John C.

00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:17.601
Reilly, and Jane Lynch
as the principles.

00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:20.870
Can you just talk about what is
it like to, as a director,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.510
harnessing the talent of these
terrific performers into their

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.950
cartoon avatars?

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.880
Like, what is that
experience like?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.320
RICH MOORE: Well, it was
a terrific experience.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.200
When Phil Johnston, who's the
screenwriter of the movie, and

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.540
I were developing the story for
"Wreck-It Ralph," Phil and

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.080
I have a similar
kind of method.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.020
We really love the characters.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.170
We like to start with the
characters, and really start

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.110
from the inside of the main
character and kind of build

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.260
out, rather than just starting
with the big world and then

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.420
kind of populating it.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.080
So we were always really, really
conscious of who these

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.480
characters were, and who we
thought would be great to

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.360
portray them.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.140
And a lot of times in animation,
sometimes the

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:13.460
characters will be created and
developed without any thought

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.750
going into, well, who
could play this?

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.730
But I'm a firm believer in,
there's the old saying that

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.380
good directing is 75%
good casting.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:30.850
So we really wanted to play to
the strengths of our actors by

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.500
creating characters
that they felt

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.060
comfortable in their skin.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.630
And Sarah Silverman was the
first one that really just

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.780
kind of presented itself clearly
in my mind, because we

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:51.450
knew we wanted to have this
world of Sugar Rush that was a

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:57.880
candy kart racing world,
game world.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.660
But we wanted the character
from that world to be

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.310
seemingly innocent but

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.930
inappropriate at the same time.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.440
And it was just like, a bell
went off, and Sarah's face was

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:07.910
in my head.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.690
So that one was kind of
nailed very quickly.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:18.670
And once we kind of landed on
who Ralph was as a character,

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:24.270
as a main character, it was very
easy to imagine John in

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:29.210
that role, because I'm
a huge fan of John's.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:35.560
And to me, he can play a
character very funny and very,

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.330
very flawed.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.530
But what's amazing about those
characters that he creates is

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.190
that I always care about them.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.720
I always love those
characters.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.110
And I want them to achieve their
goals and get what they

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.920
want, even if it's the character
in "Boogie Nights"

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.270
that wants to make
his bad record.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.090
It's as wrongheaded
as anything, but I

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.180
want him to get that.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.260
And that just speaks to John's
ability to just find the

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.600
humanity in every character
that he plays.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.635
And I wanted that for Ralph.

00:27:06.635 --> 00:27:08.820
RYAN GERMICK: Can I change
tracks for one second?

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:08.990
RICH MOORE: Sure.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.490
RYAN GERMICK: So I'm wondering
about-- we talked a little

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:15.160
earlier, like before the show,
because we vacationed

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.730
together, and we had this--

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.870
no.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:21.740
But I'm guessing you
were a kid who

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.940
loved to draw cartoons.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.660
RICH MOORE: Yes.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.950
RYAN GERMICK: And maybe a bit of
a smart aleck or something,

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.730
and you ended up doing like--

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:26.930
RICH MOORE: No.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.720
RYAN GERMICK: No no no no.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.990
Well, you don't know any
math, so something

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.810
happened there in school.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.072
RICH MOORE: No math.

00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:34.000
RYAN GERMICK: At what point
did you go from a kid who

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.610
loves to draw cartoons to being
someone who thinks about

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.750
caring about a character?

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.010
Because that transition seems
like a very adult, grown up

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.910
thing to transform as a
storyteller into, like, this

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.390
is funny to, like, this is
somebody that's going to be

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.020
emotionally impactful to me.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.610
RICH MOORE: Right.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:59.870
Well, I can't say exactly when
I realized that component of

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.600
storytelling.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.030
But I think that that's
something, as filmmakers or

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.490
cartoonists or animators, that
that's something that they're

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.740
always striving for.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.160
Because as we create these
characters, we create them to

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.550
tell stories.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:26.350
And in order to do that, they
have to kind of reflect the

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:31.080
audience, in a way, or the
wishes of the audience, or

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.180
feelings and emotion that the
audience themselves have felt.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.330
And that was something, going
back to "The Simpsons," I

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.860
would say that that's where I
learned it would be on "The

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.450
Simpsons" in those early days.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.110
The goal wasn't just to
make a funny cartoon.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:58.970
And Jim Brooks himself would
always say, look, guys, make

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.980
the fact that it's a
cartoon secondary.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.560
We're not making a show that's
trying to show off the humor

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.190
of animation or cartooning.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:15.860
We're making a sitcom, and it
happens to be animated.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.780
That's where we sit
with this thing.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.750
And with that information,
I knew what he meant.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.210
Having watched a lot of sitcoms,
and watched a lot of

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.950
sitcoms that he had produced
and written, I knew exactly

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.460
what he meant.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:36.450
And then it was learning
in practical terms

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.120
how to achieve that.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:44.390
And for me, it was never losing
sight of the Simpsons

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.940
as a family.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.080
That they were very
dysfunctional--

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.930
over the top dysfunctional.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:57.850
But at the end of the day, it
was always my goal to depict

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.170
them as a family.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.600
Like, this is the dad, the mom,
and the kids, and the

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.400
baby, and they love
one another.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.010
And within this household, there
are situations that get

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.180
out of control.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.390
But they are a family.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.780
And I would kind of inject what
I knew of my family into

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.760
them and try to create
characters that would connect

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.810
with the rest of the world.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:25.070
So I would say it was those
informative first years of

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.000
"The Simpsons" where that kind
of clicked in my mind.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.380
RYAN GERMICK: I have some
of these images of the

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.780
development of Ralph.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.020
Could you give us the director's
commentary of what

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.150
you think was going on at this
point, and how did it get to

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.760
the next level?

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.690
RICH MOORE: Well at this point,
there was a point in

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.460
the development, looking at this
picture right now, that

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.200
this would speak to kind of
the process of finding the

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.860
character--

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.840
who he is, what he looks
like, how he's going

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.360
to appear in animation.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.820
And it was at this point that we
would depict Ralph a lot as

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:10.240
a beast or a monster or
sometimes an inanimate object.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.610
He was a bulldozer at one time
with a face and everything.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.790
We knew that he was something
that destroyed things, that he

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.040
was a wrecker.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.450
And at the same time as this
drawing, or this painting, was

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:29.630
being produced and worked on,
a story team was working on

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.060
the story of the movie.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.720
And in doing that, we were
discovering the main

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.690
relationship that Ralph
had in the movie

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.190
with another character.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:44.400
And in filmmaking terms, or the
way that we think about

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.860
it, that main relationship
between our main character and

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.590
another one, between those two
lies the heart, as they call

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.740
the movie, of the story.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:59.750
So at this point, we didn't know
that Ralph and Vanellope,

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.880
that their relationship
would be the main one.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.990
And as the story kind of
dictated, well, Ralph is going

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.160
to become kind of this
big brother.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.360
He starts out kind of like a
kid himself, because he's

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.430
selfish and kind of immature.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.910
And he's going to meet this kid
who's got things way worse

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.660
than he does.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.340
And he's going to kind of mature
into this kind of big

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.620
brother character
to Vanellope.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.290
So as we start to kind of know
that about the story, we look

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.990
at this design, these ideas
for who Ralph is.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.630
And this doesn't kind
of play into that.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:43.730
When he was an ape or an animal
like this one, he

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.390
seemed more like a
big teddy bear or

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.950
something to a little kid.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.530
He didn't seem like a big
brother type of character.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:56.700
It seemed like Sully to Boo,
where she thought he was kind

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.500
of like a doll or something.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.220
So at that point, once we knew
that the relationship between

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.580
Ralph and Vanellope was the main
one, and it was going to

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.530
be an immature guy kind of
becoming a parental figure to

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:14.060
this kid, then we started
to kind of refine.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.410
And as you can see, it came
out just like this.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.590
And then it became
more human--

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.150
someone that the kid
could relate to

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.090
him as like an adult.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.370
And the two things kind of help
inform one another of

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.731
where the design and
the story goes.

00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:33.110
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.055
This is kind of where
we end up.

00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:35.390
RICH MOORE: And there he is.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.750
RYAN GERMICK: So I know a lot of
people at Google, or maybe

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.700
in the audience here, are
really excited about the

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.980
inclusion of the kind of pop
culture crossover of video

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.230
games in the movie.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.170
My favorite crossover
is probably Qbert.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.320
RICH MOORE: Yes.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.480
Mine too, I would say.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.860
RYAN GERMICK: There was
something about Qbert was

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.190
like, it scratched
an itch for me.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.830
I don't know what that was.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.660
Because he's kind of weird, and
he kind of hasn't really

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.740
made it into this generation.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.100
But you still kind of
love him anyway.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.490
RICH MOORE: No, but
he's out there.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.610
And he's iconic, and just
mysterious enough that there

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.690
was never a lot of information
behind him, other than he was

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.630
jumping around on a pyramid
changing colors and things.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.139
RYAN GERMICK: Was he swearing?

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.639
He had this weird language.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.080
RICH MOORE: Was he swearing?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.820
Was he talking?

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.030
And the supporting cast was kind
of cool, these weird tear

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.830
drop shaped guys, and
a coiled snake.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.860
A very strange world.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860
But super appealing.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.020
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.179
Very appealing.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.670
I saw some other interviews
that you did.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.840
And people always try to-- it
was usually a lot of video

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.030
game outlets, and they'll be
like, so, are you a gamer?

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.389
And I've seen you sort
of struggle with the

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:39.620
question, to be honest.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.900
RICH MOORE: Well, because it
means so many different things

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.550
to different people.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.170
RYAN GERMICK: Totally, yeah.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.730
RICH MOORE: It's like, I've
talked to some people like,

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.389
well, do you play Xbox Live?

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.719
It's like, well, no.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:52.010
I'm making a movie, guys.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.580
I don't have the time
to get on there.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.070
And it's like, well then,
you're not a gamer

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.640
unless you do it.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.540
So it seems like there's
lots of different

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.425
definitions for it.

00:35:02.425 --> 00:35:10.000
But if it means am I someone
that as a kid played games and

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.040
followed them through the
different iterations of their

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.820
history, then yes.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.290
And to be able to take a
character like Qbert, from my

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.170
childhood, and be able to put
it next to a character that

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.720
looks like he's right out of
Halo, to me is like, that's

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.380
better than any math.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.370
That's better than solving
any math problem, to me.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:36.830
RYAN GERMICK: There you go!

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.710
Take that!

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.775
So I thought I also heard you
mention something along the

00:35:41.775 --> 00:35:44.050
lines of like, we're kind of at
the point where video games

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.770
are enough of a part of our
culture where there can be a

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.230
rich, universal story
told there.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.650
And that might actually
be a new thing.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:54.350
It might be only recently,
I think, maybe.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:59.700
RICH MOORE: Well, I think
there's a good reason why this

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.110
movie got traction right now.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:07.120
And I know at Disney, they were
trying to kind of crack

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:13.960
this one for 15 years, I think,
without success, up

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.140
until about four years ago when
we started to kind of

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.780
work on this iteration of it.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:27.410
And it may speak more to
culturally people being ready

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:31.620
to hear a story like this,
with video games as the

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:38.320
backdrop of the story, than they
were maybe 10 years ago.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.040
I think "Roger Rabbit" came out
right at the right time

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.100
for that kind of movie, where
those types of animation had

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.690
been around long enough that
children knew what it was, and

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.360
very old people knew
what it was.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.690
And I think we may be at that
point with video games, where

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.830
the timing's appropriate.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.680
Like, it knew when it wanted
to be made, I think.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.050
RYAN GERMICK: I think the "Roger
Rabbit" of video games

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.480
is pretty apt, in many ways.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.130
RICH MOORE: That's pretty cool,
because I really loved

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.810
that movie.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.420
RYAN GERMICK: It's a
great movie, yeah.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.530
I think it lives
up to it, too.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.280
RICH MOORE: And that's another
one that right around the same

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.920
time that I was working on
"Mighty Mouse." And Disney

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.510
Studios was beginning to kind
of launch into their second

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.260
Golden Age, as they call it,
with "Little Mermaid." "Roger

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.590
Rabbit" came out also.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:31.090
So there was like an explosion
of animation going on.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.750
It was a right around the time
that John Lasseter and Ed

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.950
Campbell were beginning to
kind of roll with Pixar.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:44.160
So to have this called the
"Roger Rabbit" of video games

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.263
is quite an honor.

00:37:47.263 --> 00:37:48.770
RYAN GERMICK: Deserved.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:49.600
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.620
RYAN GERMICK: So this is
actually the game in the

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.790
movie, "Wreck-It Ralph." And
there's an interesting divide

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.930
in the movie, I think, between
these types of like, Donkey

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.990
Kong, Pac-Man, sort of more
friendly, accessible games, to

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.090
the kind of horror world that
Ralph finds himself.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:05.710
RICH MOORE: Of Hero's Duty.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.410
RYAN GERMICK: Of Hero's Duty.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.670
I thought that was a really apt
commentary, because I'm

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.470
someone who feels left behind
in the ultra violent, ultra

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.700
realistic, murky world.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.680
RICH MOORE: Right, the
horrific video games.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:16.806
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:18.060
Does that resonate with you?

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.740
Or what kind of commentary--
were you trying to make

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.350
commentary there?

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:21.730
Was it--

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.850
RICH MOORE: Well, I mean, it
was something that started

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.250
more as a joke.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.840
And it's like any kind of thing,
as people start to

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.420
inject a point of view to it, it
becomes kind of commentary.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:41.590
And I think it began as just,
like, what would Donkey Kong

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.210
think if he was thrown
into Halo?

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.460
RYAN GERMICK: Right.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.653
That would be an awesome
game, actually.

00:38:47.653 --> 00:38:49.545
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:38:49.545 --> 00:38:54.410
And it became just kind of
like, his thought on it.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.860
But it is interesting.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.390
Why weren't the games
ultra-violent

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.760
like that back then?

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:16.130
Is it just because we need a
bigger rush, or we're callous

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:17.350
to the old ones?

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.290
I don't know.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.960
But and when you think about
it, what I like about it is

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.980
that it does give pause to kind
of reflect on something

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.100
like that, because do people
realize, like, oh my god,

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.030
yeah, they are pretty violent.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:36.660
I would hate to make them not
violent, because I think there

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:43.230
is a reason and a need for
that type of thing.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.905
But it is interesting.

00:39:44.905 --> 00:39:49.260
And I find it is very
interesting that over the

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.560
course of 30 years,
these things have

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.700
become very, very graphic.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.440
And I think if it opens up a
discussion, then I think

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.530
that's good.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.340
RYAN GERMICK: So another one of
the games that they enter

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.920
in the movie is Sugar Rush,
which is kind of like a Mario

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.370
Kart racer game.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.400
RICH MOORE: And Candy Land kind
of all mixed together.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400
RYAN GERMICK: So here's
something I thought was

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.820
interesting in the film was that
all of the other games,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.780
like the Hero's Quest and the
sort of Wreck-It Ralph," they

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.720
have real life analogs.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.010
RICH MOORE: Right.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.810
RYAN GERMICK: But I wonder, this
is like the ultra girly,

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.950
sort of clearly marketed towards
women video games--

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.950
those don't really exist.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.150
Has the industry failed women?

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.310
Or is that just a stupid
stereotype that shouldn't be

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.260
pursued anyway?

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.410
RICH MOORE: Well, with Sugar
Rush, we were trying to play

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.260
more like it was for children.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:46.030
If Hero's Duty was more adult
and graphic and more for men,

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.765
that this was for
little children.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.230
But as to have women been left
behind, I don't know.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.260
I guess like, it doesn't
seem like--

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.170
all I know is that my daughter,
let's say that this

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.500
was your favorite
type of game.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.820
Like Mario Kart, that was one.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.270
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.970
My sister destroys
me in Mario Kart.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.500
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.220
The day that my daughter beat
me in Mario Kart was the day

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.170
that I knew I should
hang it up.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.420
But I didn't.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:22.700
So I just go by what I know,
and that was always a game

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:30.140
that in my house was popular not
just for my daughter, but

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.910
my son, too.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:35.500
So it was more kind of trying to
depict something like that,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.250
just to give the contrast of
these two worlds and Ralph's

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:44.010
journey of going from one that's
like this, and violent,

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.800
and going to very
kid friendly.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.910
But also, it's the point in the
story where what I like

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.520
about it is it's this very
saccharine sweet type of

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.170
place, but holds kind of the
most nefarious secret of the

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.186
story in it.

00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:02.480
RYAN GERMICK: No spoilers.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.860
RICH MOORE: No.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.750
RYAN GERMICK: So talking
a bit about the story.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.500
You know "Save the Cat!"

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:11.860
RICH MOORE: Right.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.250
RYAN GERMICK: I have to totally
call you on this.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.530
Like, when Qbert gets the
cherry, that's a total "Save

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:17.850
the Cat!" moment.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.250
RICH MOORE: It kind
of is, yeah.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.425
It kind of is.

00:42:20.425 --> 00:42:21.100
RYAN GERMICK: That's cool.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:21.820
RICH MOORE: But it's cool.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.600
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, it works.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.850
It totally works.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.880
RICH MOORE: And that book
does float around at

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.130
our studio a lot.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.970
Some people, that's their
Bible, and some people,

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.900
"Robert McKee's Story"
is their Bible.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.320
RYAN GERMICK: For anybody who
doesn't know, and I've never

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.235
this book, and I'm a total hack
in most things in life,

00:42:37.235 --> 00:42:38.660
including knowing
story structure.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.570
RICH MOORE: Well, it comes
from-- do you know what movie

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.850
it comes from?

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.240
RYAN GERMICK: No, I
don't, actually.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.060
RICH MOORE: Um, neither do I,
off the top of my head.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.945
RYAN GERMICK: "Home Alone
3," I'm pretty sure.

00:42:47.945 --> 00:42:51.510
RICH MOORE: But the one that
they always cite is "Sea of

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.740
Love," with Al Pacino,
where he's playing

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.520
this undercover cop.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.170
The movie begins with all these
dads coming in with

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.420
their sons, thinking that
they're going to get free

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.410
tickets to a baseball game.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.800
And it turns out the whole thing
is a sting operation,

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.380
that all these dads are
criminals, and it's been set

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.300
up by Al Pacino.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.360
RYAN GERMICK: Who seems
like a bad guy.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.610
RICH MOORE: Yeah, who seems
like, oh, that's cold, man.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:24.340
And so as he's leaving the
sting, they're locking all

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.120
these guys up.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.970
Actually, no.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.750
The guys are coming in
without their sons.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.420
It's just a bunch of guys coming
in to get free tickets.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.570
And then as Pacino's leaving, in
the hallway, the last crook

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.685
is kind of coming in.

00:43:35.685 --> 00:43:38.640
He's late, and he's brought his
son with him-- this little

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.280
kid-- and says, am I too late
for the free tickets?

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.620
And Pacino, seeing this, he
doesn't want the kid to see

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.680
his dad get cuffed.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.640
He's like, no, we're all out.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.900
You missed it, man.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.240
Maybe next time.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.450
And the guy gets to
go away free.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.950
But we feel like Pacino's got
a heart, that he's not just

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.620
the tough, mean cop, that he
cares about this guy's kid

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.860
seeing him get locked up.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.430
So that's where it comes from.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.005
And it is kind of one
of those moments.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.160
RYAN GERMICK: Can I spoil
one thing in the movie?

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.242
Is that OK?

00:44:10.242 --> 00:44:10.580
RICH MOORE: Sure.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.730
The whole ending.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.200
RYAN GERMICK: Can I whisper it
into your ear what it is?

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.540
RICH MOORE: I think that's OK.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.440
RYAN GERMICK: OK.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.630
So I like the character
arc of a story.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.880
Close your ears if you don't
want to hear this.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.590
It's an extremely minor
plot point.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.270
RICH MOORE: It's minor.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:31.670
RYAN GERMICK: I love the way
that this develops characters

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.160
and the way that characters
have an arc in this film.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:33.850
It's a really good movie.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:34.640
I really enjoyed it.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.340
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.400
RYAN GERMICK: But the one thing
is that you can't leave

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.700
this movie saying that the main
character didn't change,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.180
because in the beginning, he
doesn't like chocolate, and in

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.220
the end, he likes chocolate.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.910
So at least you have that.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.750
RICH MOORE: That's not the one
you just whispered to me.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.805
You just ruined the whole
movie for these people.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.880
I thought we were friends.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.800
I thought I could trust you.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.050
You invite me to Google.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.750
We're joking, guys.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.430
RYAN GERMICK: There's
a million clever

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.570
things in the movie.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.180
So a couple here-- like,
do you want to

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.470
talk about Grand Central--

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.770
RICH MOORE: Game Central
Station.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.040
RYAN GERMICK: All right.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.790
Bring it on.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.830
RICH MOORE: Well, once we made
the decision to set the whole

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:23.220
thing in an arcade, we knew we
wanted the characters to be

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.940
able to visit one another in
the different cabinets.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.930
So as Phil Johnston and I were
trying to kind of crack like,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:37.630
well, how are they going to
go from game to game?

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:42.630
And the process that we use is
we just kind of throw out any

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.380
idea, like how about this?

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:50.330
Where we weren't afraid
to say anything dumb.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.350
And there was a good
two weeks where we

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.930
thought, OK, this is it.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.720
The device that they're going to
use to travel from game to

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.990
game is that in a toilet,
there is a vortex.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:08.640
And for at least two weeks,
we thought this is

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.850
in the final movie.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.830
This is so good.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:11.820
It means nothing.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.990
I mean, it has nothing to
do with video games.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.060
It has nothing to do
with anything.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.510
But at that point in developing
the story, we

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.230
thought it was great.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:23.130
And then two weeks go by, and we
thought, the toilet vortex

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.200
thing is not so good.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.670
And Phil was living in
Brooklyn at the time.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:35.070
And I was flying out there
a lot to New York

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.250
to work with him.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.410
And this is one of those
stories that you

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.010
go, oh, come on.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.800
Please.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:47.840
But Phil was going back to
Brooklyn, I was in Manhattan,

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.120
staying in a hotel, and
we walked over to

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.080
Grand Central Station.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.310
I was walking him
to his train.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:47:00.040
And it was like, man, I think
it should just be like this.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.120
It should just be like this.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.380
It should just be like a big
Grand Central Station, but

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.670
it's in the power strip
or something.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:12.150
And these trains, these are
the plugs, you know?

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.140
These are the plugs.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.470
And I was like, yeah.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.590
And it would be like Game
Central Station, right?

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:17.900
And he was like, yeah.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.270
It could just be something
simple like that.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.710
And we were like, are we having
an idea right now?

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.430
RYAN GERMICK: Did you
hug or something?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.880
RICH MOORE: No, it was just kind
of, we got very quiet,

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.450
and kind of like an animal gets
kind of bristly after

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.160
it's done what it's built to
do, where it's that kind of

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.620
like gorillas or something.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.490
And it was like, looking at one
another and thinking, I

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.880
think something just
happened here.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.810
And we agreed, OK, before we
decide anything, let's sleep

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.800
on it and see what we think
in the morning.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.840
And we both as soon as we got
up, texted each other, I

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.060
really like that Game Central
Station idea.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.230
And that's what it was
kind of born from.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.830
So if you're ever trying to
figure something out, I

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.740
recommend going to New York, go
to Grand Central Station,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.650
walk around with your friend.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:11.990
RYAN GERMICK: I'll do it.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.760
RICH MOORE: It comes
like that.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.400
RYAN GERMICK: Well, like animals
that have finished

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.330
building what they came
out to build--

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.110
RICH MOORE: Animals don't
build-- well, beavers do.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:21.560
RYAN GERMICK: Beavers do.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.730
RICH MOORE: They do.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:23.470
You're right.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:24.050
RYAN GERMICK: Ants.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.440
Bees.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.150
RICH MOORE: They
do, all right.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.650
Yeah, they build.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:28.030
RYAN GERMICK: Termites.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.530
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.150
RYAN GERMICK: So if there are
any audience questions,

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.520
there's a microphone phone
around that Chris has.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.290
And he will pass it around.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.100
AUDIENCE: How do you, from
a director's role--

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.566
RICH MOORE: This is going
to be a hard one.

00:48:39.566 --> 00:48:39.920
I can tell.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.640
I can already tell this is going
to go for the throat.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.410
RYAN GERMICK: It's gonna
be a math question.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:47.200
AUDIENCE: It's gonna
be a math question.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.490
2 plus 2 equals window.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:49.850
RICH MOORE: Yeah.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.520
AUDIENCE: So my question to
you is, how do you as a

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.380
director keep your
team motivated,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.760
especially your artists?

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.220
Since it's such a
long endeavor.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.440
RICH MOORE: That's
a good question.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.280
Well, it is a long endeavor.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.010
And we worked for four
years on this movie.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:11.880
And sometimes animated films
can go on for eight years.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.120
There's some that have gone on
for 10 years in development

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.780
and production.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:23.170
And what's interesting is,
too, it's a very non

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.640
spontaneous process.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:31.380
And my job is to, by the end,
make the whole experience,

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.790
what the audience is seeing,
feel as if they're watching it

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:39.590
kind of happen right before
their eyes as if it was live

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.490
action captured on film.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:50.040
So I would say the way that I
kind of keep that exciting or

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:57.160
spontaneous is just we challenge
each other in making

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.650
the artwork or the performance
the best it can be.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.580
I think that I work with a group
of people that really

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.760
want the best out of everything
that they do.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.930
So they're looking to
me for guidance on

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.180
this kind of thing.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:31.250
What keeps it interesting and
satisfying for the artists and

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:36.010
myself is that I remind
myself I'm a director.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.260
I'm not a dictator.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.790
I'm not there to dictate to
someone, no, do it like this.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:42.770
I want it yellow.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.060
And I want it like this,
and I want-- you know.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:51.960
My job is to kind of bring out
what this person can bring to

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.010
the idea, not tell them.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.600
To me, they're not
just a wrist.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.050
And that's where the best of
someone comes-- the best of an

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:05.070
artist or technician or
production person

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.420
working on the movie.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:15.550
So I always try to encourage the
crew to take ownership of

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.210
what they're doing,
to not look to me

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.180
for the final answer.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.770
Like, I'm not going to tell
you exactly how to do it.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:26.810
I want you to discover it,
because you are going to bring

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:29.650
something to it that I'm
not thinking of.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:33.400
Your point of view is going
to make it better.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.600
So I try not to dictate.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.350
I try not to tell people exactly
how they should do it,

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.380
because to me, there's
no fun in that.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.210
It's not fun for me, it's
not fun for the artist.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:49.770
The fun is to kind of watch the
thing grow as different

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.740
minds are kind of put onto it.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.730
So I was delighted by the way
you captured the essence of

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:01.340
the '80s era video games like
Donkey Kong and Rampage and

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.730
Elevator Action in the
Wreck-It Ralph game.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:04.380
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.390
AUDIENCE: I'm curious, what was
your creative process for

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:09.450
imagining that game?

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.330
And what was the technical
process for

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:13.360
developing the visuals?

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.500
RICH MOORE: The actual game?

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.090
What we did is--

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.200
and that was one of the first
things that we kind of dove

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:23.910
into was the actual gameplay, or
just concept of that world,

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:25.200
what it was about.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:31.350
And the process was working with
the story crew and the

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:35.240
design crew of just kind
of creating boards.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.260
First, putting up images of
games that we thought that

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.580
this was like.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.940
It's kind of like Donkey Kong.

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.690
It's kind of like Rampage.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:50.540
And then breaking down, like,
what made those games unique?

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.800
How much detail did
they have to them?

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.960
What were the goals?

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.440
And what made them appealing?

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.100
And then beginning a lot of
visual just boards of

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.040
different people's ideas of what
can the gameplay be like,

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:13.400
starting with this idea of one
guy fixes, one guy wrecks.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.280
And it was months and
months and months.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.780
It did not happen overnight.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.680
It was a lot of experimentation,
and a lot of

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.770
going back to those old games.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:28.400
Because I found, for me, it
was one thing to kind of

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:33.200
remember them fondly and have
nostalgic feelings for them.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.160
But to go back and then just
see them again with a more

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.800
critical eye and more kind
of study them was a whole

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.860
different kind of experience
altogether for myself.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:49.070
So it was a lot of
trial and error.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.540
It was a lot of trying different
things and trying to

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.340
kind of capture the kind of
off-beat nature of them.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.600
They're kind of funky
in their concepts.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.770
And that's where the idea of
fixing a broken window with a

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.420
hammer came from, because it
just doesn't make any sense.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.820
But it seemed like, well, but
that seems like what they

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.480
would have had in one
of those old games.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:18.520
So we never let logic ruin
of the good ideas.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.470
And again, it was a lot
of trial and error.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.620
It was a lot of going
back and forth.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:30.280
And then we tried designing kind
of a very crude version

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.900
of the game, what the graphics
would look like.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.000
And I think we did
that in Flash.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.880
And as we got further into
production, we knew we wanted

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.700
to build an actual cabinet
with the game

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.920
in it that was playable.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:52.380
And for that, we went to someone
who programmed games

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.720
back in that time period.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.010
And he used the 8-bit boards.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.040
And there's a CRT in it.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:04.610
We wanted it to be as authentic
as it could be.

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:10.400
And because of making that one
game, the studio realized,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.430
well, this would be great.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.940
People would love this if we
built a bunch of these things

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.300
and took them around the
country, put them in theaters,

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.650
and at old arcades
that still exist.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:29.740
So the first one that we built
was made out of a gutted--

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.970
it was a Donkey Kong game.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.740
So the studio was saying,
we would love 50

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.630
to 60 of these things.

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:42.680
So not wanting to be the studio
that put 50 Donkey Kong

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.120
cabinets out of commission, we
decided, well, we're going to

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.500
build them from the ground up.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.410
So I think a couple were here.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:51.750
Did they bring some over?

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.290
RYAN GERMICK: Nobody let
me play anything.

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.754
RICH MOORE: Oh, Google,
I am sorry.

00:55:57.754 --> 00:56:00.830
I feel like a jerk now.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:01.670
RYAN GERMICK: Thanks a lot.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:02.610
Movies in color, everybody.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.194
That's it.

00:56:05.194 --> 00:56:05.686
RICH MOORE: Why?

00:56:05.686 --> 00:56:06.180
Why?

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.420
Why?

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.630
But they did a great job
of weathering them.

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:15.210
They really feel like they're
30 years old, and they play

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.940
very much like those
old games.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.000
I'm really proud of them.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.660
And it happened kind of right
in tandem with the movie.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.390
So we made a movie and a game.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.420
Ha!

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.200
Pretty good, huh?

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.450
RYAN GERMICK: Not too bad.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.640
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.290
So in seeing you with your
classmates and hearing you

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.020
talk about them and that
experience, I realized you

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.530
must have been there at the same
time that my roommate's

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.680
grandfather was teaching.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.820
And I was wondering if you could
say something about the

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.080
teachers, and specifically
if you--

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.330
RICH MOORE: Wow, that
makes me feel--

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.520
AUDIENCE: Uh, Bob McCrea.

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.950
RICH MOORE: My father's Daddy
Pop's uncle was there.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.990
About the teachers that
were at CalArts?

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.700
Who was--

00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.520
AUDIENCE: Um, Bob McCrea.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.300
RICH MOORE: Oh, Bob McCrea was
the director of the program at

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.790
the time, and he was a
wonderful teacher.

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.810
He was someone that worked at
Disney during the golden age

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:16.360
of animation, and he was kind
of a father figure to us.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.050
And he had, let's see.

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.550
Hal Ambro was our animation
teacher.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:27.480
Our design teacher
was Bob Winquist.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:34.100
And Bob Winquest took over for
Bob McCrae, because he became

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.630
ill during our--

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.970
he was very old--

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:41.830
during our sophomore year, and
Bob became the director of the

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:45.420
department our junior year.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.730
And I really, really
loved Bob Winquist.

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:55.080
Not only was he a great designer
and a great design

00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:01.150
teacher, but he had a way of
talking to us in our class.

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:03.060
He was very nurturing.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.750
He really knew how to kind of
bring out the best in people.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:10.630
People in our class who did
not consider themselves

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:15.180
designers, by the end of his
classes really felt like, wow,

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.900
I never knew I could
design something.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.730
I didn't know I had
this in me.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:28.210
So he was just someone that
really fostered feeling in us

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:33.030
that we could do something
in animation.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.040
We had one teacher in particular
who felt it was his

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.100
job to teach us another
vocation, because he said we

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:44.580
would never make it in
animation, that animation was

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.480
a dying business, and it
was going nowhere.

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.280
So we really knew
how to paint.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.010
We would have to know how to
paint paintings to be Denny's

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.430
menus covers.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.690
And he thought he
was helping us.

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:05.560
But Bob Winquist really
instilled in us this feeling

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:11.540
that if enough people with a
passion for something were to

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.050
go out in the world, that
you could change it.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:19.190
And that you could bring back
an art form that seemed at

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.740
that time to be--

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.800
there's nothing going on.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.780
It was dead.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:32.510
And I credit him a lot for
awakening up our ability to

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:35.610
have vision for the
future, and our

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:37.280
careers, and our lives.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.830
And I miss him a lot.

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:40.940
He passed away three
years ago.

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.330
And he was a wonderful guy.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:47.770
And so many people credit him as
just an instrumental figure

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.040
at that school at the time.

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:55.260
RYAN GERMICK: Do we have time
for one more question?

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.790
This man came all the way
from Los Angeles.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:57.700
RICH MOORE: All the
way from LA.

00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.770
RYAN GERMICK: The land of video
game arcades that we'll

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.020
never be able to play.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:03.960
One more?

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.550
In the middle over here?

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:06.960
AUDIENCE: So one thing that's
really interesting to me is

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.460
you talk a lot about how Ralph
had go back and be redesigned

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.180
several times.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.210
And the game had to go back
and be redesigned.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:16.470
And like, every element it seems
like you chose like 30

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.150
different things before you
finally decided on one.

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:20.300
Have you ever reached
a point where--

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:20.600
RICH MOORE: I'm indecisive.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.990
I'm wishy washy.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.750
RYAN GERMICK: I'm not gonna
tell you what to do.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.345
It's just gonna--

01:00:24.345 --> 01:00:26.325
RICH MOORE: You know what,
he flip-flops.

01:00:26.325 --> 01:00:27.840
He's a waffler.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.230
AUDIENCE: So it seems to me like
a movie is a very-- like,

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.500
a really great movie--

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.235
RICH MOORE: I thought we were
gonna have a debate.

01:00:33.235 --> 01:00:35.460
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
more conflict.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.720
AUDIENCE: So my question
basically stems from the fact

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.630
that a great movie seems to be
a very delicate balance of a

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.540
lot of things.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.860
And in being so indecisive
you find that balance.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.710
But have you ever gotten maybe
halfway through making a movie

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.530
before realizing your entire
premise was wrong, and either

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.970
giving up or starting
over on everything?

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:55.750
RICH MOORE: Well, that has not
happened to me, personally.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:59.690
But I know some people that
that has happened to.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.280
So it does exist.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.600
It does exist.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.980
Or they won't give up
on the whole thing.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.590
But they will try to take
elements of something that's

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:12.140
not working and reimagine
it as something else.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.040
And I think that having
that ability to

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.990
do that at a studio--

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.310
and it sounds scary.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.940
And it sounds like it's
a horrible thing.

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.450
But some really good movies have
come out of moments like

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:34.180
that, where they were going in
one direction and turned into

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.310
something else.

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:42.870
And movies at Pixar, things
like that have happened.

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:48.050
And I think it speaks a lot to
the management of the studios,

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:51.770
like Pixar and like Disney, that
are willing to give the

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:55.950
artist and the directors the
room to make mistakes and to

01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:01.280
try different things and to
really take a stab at

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.240
something and gamble.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.870
And if it didn't work,
then it didn't work.

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:09.870
So now let's try something
that did work.

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:13.180
And that's what we always tried
to do on this movie was

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.460
to be wrong quickly.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.330
Let's just throw it out there
and see if it works.

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:21.560
And if it doesn't, OK.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.730
We know what we're
shooting for.

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:31.130
We knew early on in this movie
who our characters were, when

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.060
Phil and I were designing the
characters and putting

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.260
together the cast.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.540
So we knew from a very early
point in the development of

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.760
the film who those
characters were.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.820
And the story changed
quite a few times.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:50.490
We knew exactly what we wanted
to happen to Ralph at the end,

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.110
so the mechanics of
the thing changed.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:56.510
And we got there, to the one
that we have now, the final

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:59.310
one, by trying lots of
different things.

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:04.455
And it doesn't just happen
like that overnight.

01:03:04.455 --> 01:03:07.970
It takes time to kind of let
these things percolate.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.740
And the whole thing has an
organic feeling to it.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.290
It grows at its own
pace, I believe.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:19.540
I think things will happen
when they want to happen.

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.480
Things will be solved when
they need to be solved.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.990
And for me, it's just being
patient enough to

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:29.460
kind of let it happen.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.360
AUDIENCE: So one quick
follow up.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.140
I kind of have a theory that a
lot of the really great shorts

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.350
come from movies that just
couldn't be fished out as long

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:39.120
as they wanted to.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.830
Do you know if any of those were
just made from elements

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:44.610
of a failed path?

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.510
RICH MOORE: What, like
the Pixar shorts?

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:49.160
Or shorts like the
classic shorts?

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.410
Or just shorts in general?

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:53.330
AUDIENCE: Whatever
you know about?

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:57.220
RICH MOORE: No, I think a lot
of the shorts that you see

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.330
before a Pixar movie
or a Disney movie

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:03.080
did begin as a short.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.300
They were imagined as shorts.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.570
I can't think of one off the top
of my head that began as

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.330
something more than a short.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:19.990
And usually, they've began as
avenues for a new director to

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:25.090
try his hands at directing or
getting his feet wet in

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.360
something a little
more manageable

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.620
than a feature film.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.290
I can't really think
of something that--

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.690
it's a good theory.

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.295
I credit you on that.

01:04:35.295 --> 01:04:35.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:37.670
RICH MOORE: It's astute.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:42.820
But I don't have any evidence
to back up your theory.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.550
RYAN GERMICK: Rich Moore,
thank you so much

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:44.790
for coming to Google.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:45.140
RICH MOORE: Thank you.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:45.440
Thank you.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.440
RYAN GERMICK: It was
truly a pleasure.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.650
RICH MOORE: Thank you, Google.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:48.940
It's a real pleasure.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.086
RYAN GERMICK: The movie
is "Wreck-It Ralph.

01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:54.370
It's in theaters November
2nd, and it's in color.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:55.162
Check it out.

01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:56.040
RICH MOORE: In color.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.980
Glorious color.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.230
Thank you very much, everybody.
