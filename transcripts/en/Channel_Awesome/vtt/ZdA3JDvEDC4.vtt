The Jungle Book was the last animated film that was made while Walt Disney was alive, which is interesting, because the two films that would follow would

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.369
steal such an unbelievable amount of animation from it, and as Disney films

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.619
Go, this is another one that I probably just place in the 'okay' category. Personally,

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.380
I'm not a huge fan of the more sketchy style of Disney animation at least not around this time period They always sort of look like pencil

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.680
Sketches that were painted over and never quite looks finished to me if you're a fan of it great it just doesn't do much for me

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.800
but to each their own

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.719
So, how's the story: well based on Rudyard Kipling's book, though very loosely, it follows the story of a little boy or

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.299
man-cub as the animals call him named Mowgli.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.039
He's raised by a pack of wolves

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.859
But suddenly his life is in danger when the evil tiger Shere Khan is coming to town. Shere Khan hates man

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.499
And the wolves know he'll end up ripping him to shreds if he ever finds him. So a panther named Bagheera takes Mowgli to the man village.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.499
The only problem is Mowgli doesn't want to go, he wants to stay in the jungle and tries every chance he can to get away.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.769
While on the way he comes across a friendly bear named Baloo, a marching elephant army, a crazy ape named King Louie and a

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.559
Hypnotizing snake named Kaa. well, let's talk about the good stuff. The best thing in this movie is Shere Khan

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.850
He's just a great villain. He actually reminds me a lot of Maleficent

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.699
There's not really much motivation to him, but just the style and class he has is so friggin awesome

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.040
He's so confident in what a badass

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.679
He is that it really does actually come off pretty intimidating he just has nothing to fear the snake Kaa

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.729
Though not a main villain

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.798
is also pretty cool some of the best parts of the movie are just all the jokes they can make with how long he is?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.420
Don't take that the wrong way aside from that the boy is okay the other characters are okay?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.489
The songs are you guessed it okay?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.240
actually

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.519
[I] take it back the very last song the girl sings while giving the water actually I think is a very nice tune

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.079
I'd almost like to hear a different updated version of it because it actually has a very soothing melody

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.380
but aside from that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.729
Nothing really stands out too much for me about this jungle book which is a shame because the original book is not only much

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.860
Darker, but it's much more interesting

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.419
The way the animal world views the human world is actually sort of a fascinating commentary the characters are more developed, too

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.940
And it follows Mowgli through sort of a coming-of-age story

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.959
Which is really a shame because I think Disney could do the story great

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.769
Chuck Jones did a version that was much closer to the book in a half hour

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.619
I found that infinitely more fascinating than this film.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.610
But as is there's nothing really bad about the jungle book except like I said not following the book that closely

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.000
But as its own separate thing, it works out fine.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.420
It's a very basic kids film, what you see is what you get. It kept me entertained as a little kid

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800
And I'm sure it will keep your kids entertained as well.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.000
A few creative scenes and one or two characters definitely make it worth a watch.
