00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.770
Are we debugging code here or are we building coding standards?

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.530
Are we building coding standards or debugging code?

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; I dunno. It seems to me that I'm being blamed on a lot of things,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.690
that just you know, depending on the fact of having a standard or not but

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.470
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.470
&gt;&gt; Research says building standards significantly reduces the number of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.546
errors in software.

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:20.281
And so, we should.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.470
Make a note that there are no standards existing in this group, and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.415
that they ought to be done.

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:27.008
Here's some suggestions, but

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.800
that's a bigger problem than what we're addressing here.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] While you're starting it, let's continue it Doctor Vaughn.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.190
&gt;&gt; At this point we just you know,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.710
there's just brackets to c lose catch statement And

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.320
then the method, and then the classes, and then that's it, the codings.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.520
&gt;&gt; What is the exit status if everything runs correctly?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.670
&gt;&gt; Oh, it just says it's fine.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
&gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be setting an exit status of zero.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.650
&gt;&gt; I think that's probably by default or something.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.270
&gt;&gt; Is it? I don't know, I'm not so sure.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.568
&gt;&gt; I don't know I thought it was by default.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:04.143
That's what told me.

00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:05.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but- [CROSSTALK]. &gt;&gt; That was for in our job.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.336
So, you have to be. [LAUGH].

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:12.178
&gt;&gt; Well, while we're [COUGH] mention printing to a log.

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:15.277
Shouldn't we, for the, when we're printing the characters in the while loop.

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:16.984
Shouldn't that, isn't that debug information.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:18.293
Does the user even need to see that?

00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:20.180
They just really need to see the count, right?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.820
Shall we be worried about what's being print to kind of the logger and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.750
then what's printed to standard out?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.660
&gt;&gt; Well, I see that you're kind of changing the specs on me but yeah.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.210
If there has to be a logger then yeah the model will have to change.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.360
&gt;&gt; Well, it says right here, the purpose.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.780
Count the number of blanks in a sentence.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.570
&gt;&gt; Right, I know. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say a purpose.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.010
Write out all of the things.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.446
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; You know, as you're going along.

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:43.390
&gt;&gt; So is the comment wrong or the spec wrong?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.000
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a, that's an excellent question.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.830
I would say that the I believed what I read there.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.070
But I could be incorrect.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the spec I got.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.870
&gt;&gt; Since this is a program without a specification.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.145
I think he just invented it, you know, just.

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:59.110
[CROSSTALK] So he said I need to do this.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.855
He said, okay I can do that.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:04.553
[CROSSTALK] I can copy code from various places and hack this thing together.

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:08.511
&gt;&gt; This way it was nice for the users to see what [INAUDIBLE] but

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.750
it doesn't have to be the case.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.380
&gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of users you've been around.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.854
&gt;&gt; Oh, you know, users that can put a period at the end of the sentence.

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:16.583
[CROSSTALK].

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:19.840
We did and Dr. Bug, anything else for this?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.340
&gt;&gt; That's sound perfectly good.
