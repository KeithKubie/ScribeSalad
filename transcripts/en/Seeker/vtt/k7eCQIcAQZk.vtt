Now on DNews: Five Fun Facts about Pee!! Because,
this is the internet people, get over it.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.929
Hi everyone!
Crystal here for DNews ready to share my five

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.970
favorite facts about pee. There are so many
weird or funny things about urine that its

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.820
hard to choose just five but here are my highlights:
First, as Im sure you know, pee or urine is

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.910
liquid excreted from the bladder. When excreted
it carries with it salts, sugars, chemical

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
byproducts, and any potential toxins or chemicals
that the body can’t break down. We call

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.010
these excreted compounds, metabolites, because
they are the leftovers from the biochemical

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.629
process of metabolism.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.859
And that leads me to Fun Fact #1! In “you
can find anything on the internet” news,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.749
I am here to tell you that there is a database
for what can be found in your pee. The human

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.559
body produces thousands of chemical metabolites
that are found in urine in differing concentrations

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.499
depending on diet, environment, and overall
health. And Canadians are so nice, you can

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:06.810
find a publicly available list in a continuously
updating database called the “urine metabolome

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.480
database”. yep, thats a thing, there is
a database of pee.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.050
Fun Fact #2!: In mammals, chemicals in urine
can be used for biological communication between

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.720
sexes. Just as an example, there is literature
to suggest that exposure to the urine of a

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.540
dominant male mouse causes new neurons to
form in the brain of a female mouse. And the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.400
importance of urine in the mating behavior
of Giraffes has been (very) well documented:

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.120
(Here’s the cliff notes: male giraffes drink
the pee of potential female partners to see

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.380
if she “suits his taste”)

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.030
Fun fact #3!: Genetics can dictate the smell
of your pee. Some people born with a genetic

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.680
inability to metabolize branched amino acids
suffer from maple syrup urine disorder. this

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.930
disease is rare but easily recognisable by
pee that smells like pancakes. Now at least

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.810
50% of you are probably wondering if Im going
to mention Asparagus here and if you are wondering,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.510
its a good bet that you do NOT contain the
genetic mutation that makes humans selectively

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.719
anosmic to the sulfur containing compounds
that give asparagus pee its special odor.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.649
Isn’t human genetics wonderful?

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.019
Fun Fact #4!: Our urine can reveal secrets
about our health and diet. Urine analysis

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.670
has been used for centuries to diagnose health
problems and I’m sure you’re familiar

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.870
with the common tests for drugs or pregnancy,
but recent work by scientists show that it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.299
is possible to use ratios of metabolites to
predict development of less obvious conditions

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.959
like obesity! For those of you scared of needles
this is good news! Because a urine test for

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.409
these conditions would be less invasive and
(hopefully) less anxiety producing than the

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.840
standard blood test.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.870
And last but not least: Fun Fact #5!: Human
pee is putting fish on birth control. In yet

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.480
another case of human action unknowingly affecting
the rest of our planet, recent studies have

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.079
shown that metabolites of the human birth
control pill, that are excreted in urine are

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.760
finding their way to waterways and building
up in some fish species. Not only is this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.439
exposure contributing to reduced fertility
in these fish, but there are documented cases

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.340
on the US East Coast, of male fish switching
sexes after prolonged exposure to these synthetic

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.510
hormone bi-products!! That my friends, is
the power of pee.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.859
So the next time you urinate, I hope you will
find a new appreciation for the act and think

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.859
about all those powerful and revealing chemicals
that you are just casually flushing down 
the toilet.
