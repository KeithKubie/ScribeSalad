LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I'm here today

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.720
to talk about a technology
called Sign-In with Google.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.950
My name is Laurence Moroney.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm a developer advocate.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.680
I work out of our
Seattle offices.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.120
And I focus mostly on Android
and on Google Play Services.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.580
I've been doing a lot of work
with Identity, a lot of work

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.580
at Sign-In with Google
over the last few months,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.340
and having a whole lot
of fun with the new APIs.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.140
Has anybody tried out the new
Sign-In APIs yet, by the way?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.871
OK, a few.

00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.370
Cool.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.520
Oh, actually one thing I forgot.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.740
Before I go back, at the
bottom of this slide here,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.970
you see I put a URL--
[? j.mp/offeedback. ?] If

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.300
you've any questions,
any feedback,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.881
anything you'd like to
let us know about the API,

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.380
anything you want us to get
back to you on, or anything like

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.556
that, there's a simple
Google form on there.

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:46.930
You can do it
anonymously, or you

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.370
can give us your e-mail
address to give us

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.330
some feedback on that.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.180
So you know, anything
along if I don't

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.263
have time for questions
at the end of the session,

00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:56.110
or anything like that, I promise
we'll try and get back to you

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.150
with answers if you
fill in that form.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.080
And if there's any really
difficult questions,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.970
Paul here at this table will
be the one to answer them.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.920
[CHUCKLES] He's glad they
turned the lights down.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.010
Today, I want to really
talk about Sign-In

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.742
with Google and a particular
Google sign-in technology.

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.450
I have a blue button
on this screen here.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.297
But we actually have a
branding guidelines document.

00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:17.880
There's a link at
the end where if you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.830
don't like the blue button,
we also have a white one.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.330
There's also guidelines if you
need to customize the button,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.020
if you don't like it, to
say Sign-In with Google.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.440
And you want to localize it
to your own language, or maybe

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.917
something like Pig Latin, or
something along those lines,

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.750
then you can actually
customize that button.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.166
There's lots of
resources on there

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.460
that will allow you to do that.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.720
But before I begin talking
about Sign-In with Google,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.080
I'm a bit of a stats geek.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.090
And I love stats.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.280
And I find there
are some great ways.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.154
I know there are lies,
there are darned lies,

00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:43.260
and there are statistics.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.801
But I'm going to
use some statistics.

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.670
And I hope that you
find them interesting.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.461
So the first of all
I'm going to start with

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:52.300
is that research has
found that 86% of users

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.280
do not like creating and
remembering new passwords

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.150
to interact with you.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.950
What I find stunning about this
number is that it's not higher.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.600
I mean I certainly hate
going to a new app,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.360
or going to a new
site, and having

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.910
to do yet another signup.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.550
And they probably
have different sets

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.310
of rules for what's
a valid password

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.120
and what isn't a valid password.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.011
And I have to remember
all these things.

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:16.760
And then six months
later, the next time I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.820
use that site or
app, again, I have

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.080
to remember what that
username and password was.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.850
86% though, according
to research.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.910
The next number is 54% of
users that, if you present them

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.710
with yet another signup,
will quit altogether.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.540
So think about all
that time that you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.540
spent building your app,
maybe making your app

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.750
work on multiple platforms,
like IOS, Android, Windows

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.170
Phone, all the
different platforms,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.610
maybe working it with
a website as well,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.510
and having a user's
identity with that--

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.020
All that time building that,
all that time marketing that,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.050
all that effort that you get
for people to access your site,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.810
or download your app and use it.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.332
And more than half of
them will walk away

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.790
if you ask them to build yet
another username, or password,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.096
or sign up with yet another
username or password.

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:05.220
So that's why technologies
like Sign-In with Google

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.017
are very important
to me, in particular,

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:08.850
because I don't want
to build apps like this

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.080
and have more than half
of my audience walk away.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.240
And one more number is 92%.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.760
92% will give up if they
don't remember the username

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.250
and password that they
signed up for on this site.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.304
So if they try-- whoo, whoo.

00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:24.720
I'm a little active
with my hands.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.346
If they try to sign in, and then
they can remember the username

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:29.678
or password, and you provide
them with a forgotten link,

00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:31.300
research has shown
that 92% of them

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.590
will just walk
away at this point.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.350
So it's all very nice to be
able to give them that facility

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.520
to sign in, to recover a
forgotten password or identity.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.210
But if only 8% of
them are using it,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.760
that's a lot of wasted effort.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.620
And a funny story
and a true story

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.980
is I'm doing grad studies at a
university that's not too far

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.040
from here that I won't name.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.730
One of the best IT, one of the
best technology universities

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.640
in the world.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.709
And I'm not a matriculated
student there.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.250
So I come in through--
what they have

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.650
is a professional
development center.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.970
And when I go to their
professional development center

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.630
to sign into that, I have to
give a username and a password.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.860
The passwords on
this center has a set

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.452
of rules about what's a
valid password or not.

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:12.910
And their set of
rules for this one

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.280
is that you're not allowed
to have any capital letters.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.410
And you're not allowed
to have any punctuation.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.810
It's just lower case
letters and numerics.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.300
So I come, and I sign in.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.870
And I put in a
password for that.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.410
And like most people,
all of my passwords

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.130
are kind of variations on a
theme, a very obscure theme

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.010
that only means something to me.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.600
And so no uppercase
letters, no punctuation.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.420
So I use lowercase letters
and a sequence of digits.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.630
And then once I'm signed into
that, then to access everything

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.730
in the university like I'm a
real student-- so to access

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.760
e-mail, or to access my grades,
and all that kind of stuff--

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.920
they have a different
username and password.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.280
And the password on that, you
have to have capital letters,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.110
and you have to
have punctuation.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.919
And as a result,
I'm like thoroughly

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.960
confused whenever I try
to sign in to this thing.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.001
And almost every time I
have to reset my password

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:00.450
to be able to access my stuff.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.041
I'm one of those 8% because
I have to access this stuff.

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:05.790
So I go through all
of that kind of thing.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.600
And that to me is
really, really annoying.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.920
And I'm sure it
would be to you, too.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.510
So the idea, and part of our
goal with Sign-In with Google,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.550
is to help you to use what
you know, to feel secure

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.130
that your credentials are
backed up by what we hope

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.934
and what we believe is a
world-class infrastructure.

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.350
And then if you're a developer,
so that you can offer this

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.797
to your users, too.

00:05:25.797 --> 00:05:27.630
Instead of giving them
all of this friction,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.640
instead of giving them
all of this hassle,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.160
instead of different
sets of validation rules,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.130
instead of having to remember
yet another username and yet

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.951
another password, that they can
just sign in with a Google ID

00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:39.450
that they already
have, or hopefully

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.490
that they already have.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.790
So some of the
features behind this.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.880
So what we want to do is
we want to make it easy.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.280
And we want to make
it familiar for users.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.410
Most of your users will
probably have a Gmail address.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.610
And most of your users are
familiar with signing in

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.500
for Gmail.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.430
They probably know their
username and password

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.170
for Gmail.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.380
And they can sign in to
your app or your site

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.989
as frictionlessly as
they can with Gmail.

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:04.655
We really want to
keep it that familiar.

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:07.180
And we want to keep it as
strong branding on that.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.670
They know and they trust Gmail.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.627
They sign into it
probably every day.

00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:12.210
It's not a case of
a few months later,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.740
they've forgotten
their password.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.610
They're using this.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.260
It's very easy.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.680
It's very familiar for them.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.806
It's also secure.

00:06:17.806 --> 00:06:19.680
One thing I'm going to
talk about in a moment

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.000
is phishing and hacking.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.184
And being me, there's
lots more stats.

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:25.350
So there's a lot more stats
on phishing and hacking.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.980
But before I get to that, one
of the things about security

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.590
is that backend infrastructure,
the support mechanisms,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.950
the overall machine behind
securing your user's identity,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.410
if it's provided by Google,
it's at least as good as the one

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.660
that you would build yourself.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.682
But I would argue it's
probably a lot better.

00:06:41.682 --> 00:06:43.640
You want to focus on
building your application.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.410
You want to focus on building
your site without thinking

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.510
about all of the time,
and effort, and cost

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.480
in building and maintaining
a world-class security

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.380
infrastructure.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.910
Most of us aren't big enough
to be able to do that properly,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.440
whereas if you're
using a Sign-In

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.220
with Google-type
technology, then

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.440
Google have done that for you.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.570
So I think that's something
that it's very secure.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.236
And it's also really
good for your users

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:07.980
as well as being
very good for you.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.170
Then the next part of
this-- and it's part,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.380
I'll be frank, that
we kind of failed on,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.910
but we're really improving
on-- is making it easy to code.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.880
If you've used
Sign-In with Google,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.050
if you've tried to build
with Sign-In with Google,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.160
up until about, I think it was
like September of this year,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.824
the API was quite complex.

00:07:25.824 --> 00:07:27.740
There'd be a case of you
would try to sign in.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.760
And the way that you'd sign in
is by connecting a Google API

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.640
client.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.140
But what would happen is the
first thing that the user would

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.940
see is a dialog asking
them, well, which

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.490
ID are you signing in with?

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.372
That would actually error
out the connection process.

00:07:41.372 --> 00:07:43.330
And how you, as a
programmer, would handle that

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.870
is by handling that error.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.340
Then once the user has selected
their ID, then in many cases,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.340
the application would
ask them for some kind

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.036
of a permission, like
maybe accessing contents,

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.910
or if you're building
something, for example,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.660
that uses Google Drive, the
user to give their permission

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.170
to access Google Drive.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.760
That would also error out
the connection process.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.200
And you'd have to handle
that as if it was an error.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.270
And how you knew when
the user was signed in

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.942
was when your Google
API connected.

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:10.400
And you'd handled
all these errors.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.240
And as a developer, to me, I
found that a little bit ugly.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.220
A user picking their
name is not an error.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.945
A user giving permission
is not an error.

00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:21.820
And so we've really,
really improved the API.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.195
I'm going to be showing off
some of the stuff in the API.

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:25.700
So I find it a lot easier.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700
I find it a lot quicker.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.241
I find it a lot more
straightforward.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.770
I hope you do, too.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.200
And then the next thing
is to make it extensible.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.307
It's all very well if
you've got a mobile device.

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:36.640
And you've got to sign-in
dialogue in the mobile device.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.860
And the user has signed
into the device on that.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.480
But then what?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.907
Most of you likely have some
kind of backend service.

00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:44.990
Most of you are probably
storing some kind of data

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.800
in that backend service that
has the user signing in.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.110
Some of the customization of
the app comes from that data.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.319
And maybe you want that
data to be secured, too.

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:56.360
Now, think about what can
happen with a middleman

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.249
attack between the
device and your server.

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:01.790
We'll talk about that a little
bit later in the presentation.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.748
But one of the things
about Sign-In with Google

00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:05.820
is it's not just
about your phone.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.230
It's not just about your device.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.620
It's also about being able
to secure backend services.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.536
So first of all, I'd to talk
a little bit about the UX,

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:15.910
and some of the
things that we've

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.590
done to help you
focus on the user,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.390
reduce some of this
friction, and improve the UX.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.716
So my speaker notes, one
is really small here.

00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:24.090
So I'm going to
just turn around.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.590
So this is what it
used to look like.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.650
So on the very left hand side,
you have your application.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.810
And you've got a set
of sign-in buttons.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.500
Like the top one is
Sign-In with Google.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.680
The middle one is Facebook.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.199
The bottom one, I
think, is Yahoo.

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:37.990
So the user would pick
Sign-In with Google.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.850
What would happen?

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.840
Well, first of all they
would get a request asking,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.890
can this access their contacts?

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.770
Can this access your contacts?

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.930
Why, when signing
into this application,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.120
should this application
access my contacts?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.080
And there's a rule
of thumb that I

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.070
like to follow that every time
you give the user a choice that

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.470
really isn't
relevant to what they

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.950
want to do at this moment in
time, you lose 90% of them.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.500
And to me, this is
a great case where

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.960
you could lose 90% of them.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.260
So you then select that
when the user is very nice.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.950
And they say, OK, yes I will.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.440
And then they get this, oh,
you got to give me permission.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.530
And then they say OK to that.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.210
And then it's like OK, once
they've given permission,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.170
now I have to ask for
the contacts again.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.680
Once they give that
permission, now finally,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.297
oh, what account do you
want to sign in with?

00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:26.880
This phone only has
one account on it,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.580
but yet you need to tell
me the account that you're

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.740
going to sign in with.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.700
So that's what?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.300
That's the fifth from the left.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.720
So once they pick that one, and
they sign in, now guess what?

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.690
This user didn't have
a Google+ profile.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.970
Oh, we can't continue.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.780
We need to fill out
a Google+ profile.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.300
So they would have to fill
out a Google+ profile.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.730
They create that, submit,
and then finally, guess what?

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.370
It's asking them for
their basic info,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.560
including the list
of their contacts.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.840
And then they say, OK to that.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.450
They allow it.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.100
And then finally, they're
signed into the application.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.470
There's a lot of friction here.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.512
We understand this.

00:10:57.512 --> 00:10:58.720
So we've tried to improve it.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.600
And we fixed it.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.470
So now it looks like this.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.420
So now we say, OK,
let's get started.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.816
Let's sign in with Google.

00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:07.190
The first thing
is, well, we just

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.530
need to know which
account on your phone

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.607
you're signing in with.

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:11.440
In this case, I'm going
to pick the account.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.470
And then in most cases,
I'm straight into the app.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.170
Sometimes, there
will be another step

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.970
between the second
and third of these,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.890
and that's if the user has
to give specific permissions

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.780
to access something.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.790
I like to use Google
Drive as an example.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.498
So if you're building
an application that

00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:28.420
accesses their stuff
on Google Drive,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.090
then they would have a third
step in between the middle one

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.340
and the one on the right here.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.162
But that's how
frictionless it has become.

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.620
We're really, really
proud of this.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.078
We shipped this in the last
version of Google Play Services

00:11:39.078 --> 00:11:40.560
back in September-ish.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.650
And we think it will make it
a lot easier for your users

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.400
to be able to sign in, and to be
able to feel secure in signing

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.760
in without all these
dialogues asking them

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.750
for stuff-- sometimes
stuff that may not

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.200
be actually relevant to what
they're doing right now.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.319
So the next part is I
spoke about security.

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:58.860
And one of the
points-- so we've made

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.270
it easier for your end users.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.630
And now we want to
talk about security.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.210
And I think it's really
important in security

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.690
that security isn't
a static thing.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.526
Security is always
a moving target.

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:07.900
And it's really,
really important

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.140
to stay ahead of the game.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.500
And part of our job at
Google is to stay ahead

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.350
of the game in the
security landscape.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.100
I like to show this infographic.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.584
So this is from a website called
informationisbeautiful.net.

00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:19.500
There's a public link.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.410
I have it in my slides.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.880
If anybody wants the slides, I
can share the link out later.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.796
Or if you fill out that
form, and just ask me,

00:12:24.796 --> 00:12:26.630
I'll send the link to you.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.670
Now look at all
of these breaches.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.890
And look at all of the users
that were impacted by that.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.000
Some of these are in the
tens of millions of users

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.080
that were affected by a breach.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.610
Some of these we might
be familiar with.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.040
Probably the most
famous one recently

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.870
was the Ashley Madison
one where 36 million users

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.590
had very, very personal data
leaked onto the internet.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.150
And then some banks, and
stores, and that kind of thing

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.499
where people had personal
information leaked out-- maybe

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:58.040
not onto the internet, like in
the case of the Ashley Madison

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.690
one.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.730
But the overall picture
that people have

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.540
is that their data, their
personal details, their credit

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.910
card, other stuff
like that, is at risk

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.770
every single day from hackers.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.710
Now a lot of this stuff,
of course, was inside jobs.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.280
Some of the retail
ones where people

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.442
had planted a worm inside the
credit card scanning machines

00:13:17.442 --> 00:13:19.650
that was able to collect
data about credit cards that

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.862
were scanned.

00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:22.570
It's a little bit of
a different scenario

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.770
than you may be
facing when you're

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.210
building something for sign-in.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.230
But the bottom line is to
users, it's all the same.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.910
It's really, really a
feeling of insecurity

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.560
that people are out
there to get them.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.372
And it's our job to
at least try to help

00:13:34.372 --> 00:13:36.330
them feel a little bit
more secure when they're

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.160
using your apps,
when they're using

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.720
your sites, that kind of thing.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.200
So you don't want
to be this guy.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600
And you want to help
them not to be this guy.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.020
Sometimes I think I should
just change my passwords

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.270
and correct for this reason.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.460
We really want to help
them not be this guy.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.040
So the next part that I want
to talk about a little bit

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.350
is one of the biggest things
where your users are at risk,

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.276
and that's from phishing scams.

00:14:00.276 --> 00:14:01.650
Now, there was
some research done

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.070
by the Canadian government.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:11.300
And this research found that
156 million phishing emails

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.707
are sent out every single day.

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.290
Now, by the way, this research
was done a couple of years ago.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.500
So I think these numbers
are probably bigger now.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.070
So of those 156 million phishing
e-mails-- now of course,

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.690
we all have great
e-mail filters.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.370
We all have great tools
that allow us to filter out,

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.290
and to stop phishing
scams, and to block them.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.010
So how many of that
156 million do you

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.860
think got through these filters?

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.120
Anybody take a guess?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.250
Did somebody say 10%?

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.490
That's a good guess.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.590
16 million, around 10%,
actually got through.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.640
So when you think
about this, a lot

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.500
of the free e-mail providers,
like Gmail, and Yahoo,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.600
and Hotmail, et cetera, they
all provide these spam filters.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.520
And I'm sure like
many of you, I've

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.196
gotten my name on all of them.

00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:01.862
I'm lmoroney@yahoo,
@hotmail, @gmail,

00:15:01.862 --> 00:15:03.070
and all these kind of things.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.540
And these try their best to
keep spam and phishing away

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.464
from my eyes.

00:15:08.464 --> 00:15:09.630
Some are better than others.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.327
I won't say which are bad.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.660
But most of them try to keep
phishing away from my eyes.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.060
But some of them do get through.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.750
But it's a little bit of
a side benefit, I think,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.640
if you're using
something like a Gmail

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.620
because these services
receive the most phishing.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.720
They're best at identifying
phishing-- much more than maybe

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.454
an independent server would be.

00:15:30.454 --> 00:15:32.870
And as a result, if your users
are already using something

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.650
like Gmail, then
they're already being

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.000
less exposed to phishing
scams because less

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.209
are reaching their inbox.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.750
I don't know about
you who use Gmail,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.440
but I think when
I look at phishing

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.870
e-mails that are sent
to me, far less than 10%

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.000
get to my Gmail inbox.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.720
All right.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.870
So 16 million of the 156
million got through filters

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.050
to end users.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.020
How many of those
16 million do you

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.130
think were actually
opened by the end users?

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.050
A quarter of a million?

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.080
OK.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.190
It's higher than
quarter of a million.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.780
Sorry?

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.860
25%?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.110
OK, it's actually
higher than 25%.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.120
I feel like a game
show here, right?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.700
80%?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.840
It's lower than 80%.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.640
50%.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.810
Thank you.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.360
It's actually eight
million-- about half.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.910
Now remember, this is every
single day users are opening--

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.240
and this was an older research.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.730
I think it's
probably higher now.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.260
Every single day,
users were found

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
to be opening eight
million phishing scams.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.380
OK, next question.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.380
Most phishing scams have
a link in them, right?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.040
The typical phishing
scam is like, oh, I'm

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.170
from-- insert your
mail service here--

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.060
Your password has failed.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.340
Please sign in here to
change your password.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.410
That's the typical one.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.826
So there's usually
a link that you

00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:51.950
go to, to a fake website, where
they harvest your password.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.380
So how many of
those eight million

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.820
do you think the people
actually clicked on the link

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.050
and went to the website?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.630
A million.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.630
OK, that's close enough.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.560
It's 10%.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.220
It's about 800,000.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.380
So every single day, 800,000
of these links are clicked on.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.640
And people are going to sites
with phishing scams on them.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.550
All right.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.660
You go to this site.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.270
Now, a lot of the time you've
gone to this site-- and most

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.228
people in this room, I'm
sure, are smart enough

00:17:19.228 --> 00:17:22.050
to look at the URL and see
that, hey look, this URL isn't

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.720
yahoo.com or google.com,
or wherever, Facebook,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.079
or wherever.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.670
It's bob.biz slash something.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.275
And nowadays, browsers have
that like little green thing

00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:34.650
that they put in the address
bar to show that this really

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.070
is certified, that this
is the correct site.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.150
But 800,000 of these people
have gone to these sites.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.310
How many of them do you
think were still fooled

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.650
and actually entered
their user data?

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.390
Half?

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.550
OK, thank God it's a
bit less than that.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.100
It's still 10%.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.460
It's about 80,000.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.700
So per day, 80,000 people
fall for a phishing scam.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.440
And many of those usernames
and passwords are compromised.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.330
People might be using
the same username

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.230
and password on other sites.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.400
Like I said, for me,
there is a phrase

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.210
that I know that
nobody else knows.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.590
And most of my passwords
kind of root off

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.230
of that phrase by changing
letters around, or adding

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.770
numbers, or punctuation.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.530
And it helps me to
remember passwords.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.112
So had I gone to one of
these phishing sites,

00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:19.320
and if any of phishers are
watching this live stream,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.820
they now know that my password
has that kind of combination.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.450
So maybe I need to change it.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.660
But if they've gotten one of
these sources of my password,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.900
then they already
have several steps

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.060
towards being able to compromise
my account in other places.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.060
So it's a tough
landscape out there.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.820
And it's up to us
as app developers

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.880
and as site developers to
protect our end users in that.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.190
So as part of the
values that we try

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.340
to offer with Google Sign-In,
all of this kind of stuff

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.460
becomes possible.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.410
So when you use a Gmail sign-in,
when you use a Google account,

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.790
I'm sure a lot of you, like
me, travel around-- maybe

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.710
around the country,
maybe around the world.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.920
You've probably
encountered these things.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.160
I was in England two weeks ago.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.460
And when I tried to
sign in in England,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.310
Google didn't challenge me.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.810
I then the following
day went to Wales.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.690
And when I tried to
sign in from Wales,

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.136
Google were like, this
is suspicious activity.

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:14.260
We're going to challenge
you for some extra details

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.136
just to make sure that you
really are moving around.

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:19.010
You've been in three
countries in three days.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.450
What's really going on here?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.190
And it was an extra
layer of security

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.020
that Google were able to provide
to protect my password in case

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.200
somebody really was
scamming me, somebody really

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.900
was taking that kind of thing.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.940
Another tool that's
in there is being

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.854
able to sign out of
sessions remotely.

00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:34.270
Now, one of the
things that's nice

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.280
is that if you use internet
cafes, or that kind of thing,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.570
and you sign into your Gmail,
and you forget about it,

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.550
you can go, and you
can sign out remotely.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.520
But it's also really
nice that, hey, you've

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.190
gotten this warning.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.490
We've detected suspicious
activity on your account.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.020
Somebody in Wales has tried
to sign into your account.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.031
What's going on here?

00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:53.280
You can then go and just
kick that person out remotely

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.110
before you change
your password details.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.110
Things like that.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.510
Unusual activity alerts--
same kind of thing.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.730
If there's strange activity
going on, you get alerts.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.005
You get alerts sent to you.

00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:06.580
You can have alerts details
and all that texted to you,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.480
and whatever.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.050
There's some
intelligent challenges

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.430
on there for the same reason.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.090
There's all of this
infrastructure designed

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.830
to protect your
username and password.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.870
So if you were one of these
people who inadvertently gave

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.600
some details out
in a phishing scam,

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.840
you can find out right
away when your users,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.206
or when you are using
a Google identity.

00:20:29.206 --> 00:20:30.830
And then there's all
the infrastructure

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.580
that I mentioned behind
it, all the security

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.496
of the infrastructure.

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:35.950
One of the main places that
passwords get compromised

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.700
is that somewhere
in a system, they're

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.580
stored in a place
that's unencrypted.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.550
Or maybe they're
passing from A to B

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.490
across an infrastructure
that's unencrypted.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.150
And it's easy for somebody
to sniff that off a network.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.420
And as a result, passwords
can be compromised.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.740
Again, the infrastructure that's
behind Google's credential

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.189
system, behind our
ID system, hopefully

00:20:54.189 --> 00:20:55.230
doesn't have any of that.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.400
We haven't had any--
at least that I

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.460
know of right now-- any
major compromises or that

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.043
kind of thing.

00:21:00.043 --> 00:21:03.090
So again, if your users
are using Google Identity,

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.490
if they're using any kind
of Sign-In with Google,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.130
all of this backend
is there for them.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.620
So enough about the user.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.350
What about the developer story?

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.270
And I mentioned earlier on about
there were some difficulties.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.600
And there were some bumps
in the road that you have

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.840
when you try to sign in.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.510
So we've tried to
make it a lot easier.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.960
And I'm going to talk through
some of the steps here.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.660
I'm not going to demo it because
unfortunately, the emulator

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.590
doesn't yet run the version
of Google Play Services that

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.460
has this on it.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.793
And it's just too awkward to
try and do it with a device

00:21:30.793 --> 00:21:31.630
while I'm on stage.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.800
So I'm just going to
demo by showing the code.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.440
So first step-- instead
of connecting directly

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.950
to Google API Client, the API
has this thing called a Google

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.280
Sign-In Options Object.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.700
Or we just call it
a GSO for short.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.640
So your first task
is to create a GSO.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.020
And in this case, I'm
doing a very simple one.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.490
I'm not requesting any
additional permissions other

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.380
than the basic email identifier.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.490
And thinking about just
the person's email address

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.650
as the thing that they
identify themselves with,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.610
you saw that dialog
earlier with the pop-up

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.460
where it was like [INAUDIBLE]
and his email address.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.040
That's what springs this.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.730
And this doesn't require any
permissions from the user other

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.700
than just filling in
that account picker.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.910
If you were, for example,
to access Google Drive,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.740
or you wanted to access Google
Drive, or any other things,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.969
there would be an additional
dot on here before the .build.

00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:19.510
And then the user would get the
dialog saying, hey, you know,

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.114
this app also wants to access
to Google Drive, et cetera.

00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:23.530
But if you're doing
this, and this

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.897
is the basic and the
most common case,

00:22:25.897 --> 00:22:27.980
you're just going to have
those three steps that I

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.500
showed in the earlier slide.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.300
Next now, if you have built
with Google Play Services,

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.040
and if you've built with
authentication and Identity

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.580
with Google Play
Services, you'll

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.320
know about the
Google API client.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.670
And here's where you set
up the Google API client.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.180
You create it with a builder.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.860
And you access it with the @API.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.820
And you pass it the
GSO that you just

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.080
created earlier on the
second parameter there.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.310
It's off the Google Sign-In API.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.060
And you just pass
it that GSO object.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.190
And that GSO object
had the configurations

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.070
for the type of permissions
that you want to access.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.364
So it's as simple as that.

00:23:00.364 --> 00:23:02.530
The function to determine
if there's an auth class--

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.696
there's a constant on there.

00:23:03.696 --> 00:23:06.000
And that constant is
the Google Sign-In API.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.030
So now you've created a GSO.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.250
You've created your
Google API client.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.070
So the next thing to do
is to get a sign-in intent

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.507
from the API for this
Google API client.

00:23:15.507 --> 00:23:16.590
And you can see it's here.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.820
I just create intent--
.signin.Intent--

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.390
equals of the
Google Sign-In API.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.350
I pass it the API clients.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.030
Remember the API
client was configured

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.360
with the sign-in object.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.980
And then I start an
activity for that result.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.480
There's a constant
on the right hand

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.770
side there-- [? rcSignin. ?]
That's not part of the API.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.750
Usually, if you're
building an application,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.630
and you start an
activity, so that Android

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.140
can tell which activity
result is for which activity,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.549
you just pass it an integer.

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:45.090
And it can be anything
that you want.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.240
It's just up to you.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.300
If you've got multiple
activities going on,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.160
it's up to you to identify
them with your own constants.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.500
So in this case, this
constant, [? rcSignin, ?]

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.515
I think we've made it.

00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:56.140
There is a sample
that you can download

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.264
that I took this code from.

00:23:57.264 --> 00:23:58.760
I think was like 7,001.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.440
So when you get the
callback saying,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.559
hey, we got a result
for activity 7,001,

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:04.850
you know that it's that one,
that it's the sign-in one.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.817
But like I said, it can
be anything you like.

00:24:07.817 --> 00:24:09.400
And then you can see
the callback here

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.600
where you catch the
activity results.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.360
So you get your own
activity results.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.300
And then on the
activity results,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.496
you have a request code.

00:24:17.496 --> 00:24:19.870
Remember the request code that
I said that you passed in.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.660
If it's that request
code that you created

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.230
for the sign-in activity,
then all you have to do

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.250
is create a Google
Sign-In result object.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.780
And this is going to be the
result of the call to Google

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.910
Sign-In API, .getSignin
result from the intent.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.020
And the intent passes you
back the data parameter

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.460
that you can see at the top.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.040
So now you have your
sign-in results.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.180
And this sign-in result
object gives you everything

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.550
that you need to know about the
sign-in, such as the account.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.650
And the account is a Google
Sign-In account object.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.410
And you get that using the
result .getSigninAccount,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.160
as it suggests.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.410
And then you can query that
account object for things

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.827
that the user has given you
permission to, including, hey,

00:24:56.827 --> 00:24:58.534
has this user actually
signed in and out?

00:24:58.534 --> 00:24:59.480
That kind of thing.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.390
So now that you have
your accounts, now

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.060
you can personalize your
application for that end user.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.630
And it's as simple as that.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.590
And again, just to look at the
flow again, it looks like this.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.100
The user clicks the
Connect with Google button.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.070
They get given the picker,
which asks them which accounts

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.420
do they want to sign in with.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.530
They pick that account.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.400
And then they're taken
to your application.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.983
And you can customize
your application

00:25:19.983 --> 00:25:21.986
as you please for that user.

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:23.360
Like in this case,
we see we have

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.150
the user's name, and
a picture, and stuff

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.470
at the top for that user.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.178
And as I mentioned
before, that if you're

00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:30.600
doing additional
scopes-- for example,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.240
the one I always like
to use is Drive--

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.448
that if your app is going
to access the user's Drive,

00:25:34.448 --> 00:25:37.087
there'll be an additional
step in between the middle one

00:25:37.087 --> 00:25:38.670
and the right one
there where the user

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.530
has to give permission to that.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.610
So this is great.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.940
But guess what.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.612
This is all very nice for
authenticating on the device.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:48.820
But what happens when you
want to extend beyond that?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.030
And I like to give a story here.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.950
Before I joined Google, I was
an independent application

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:54.640
developer.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.716
I worked for a lot of startups,
building applications for them.

00:25:57.716 --> 00:25:59.340
And there was one
startup that I worked

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.580
with that they had this really
interesting app for a very

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.240
unique audience.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.100
And their audience
was people who

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.340
own pets who hire other people
to look after their pets

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.360
for them.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.520
So part of this was
like, I have a dog.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.750
I'll use my own dog.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.200
My dog is called Bucky.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.320
And if I, for example, work too
much, and I can't walk Bucky,

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.840
then I can hire somebody
to walk Bucky for me.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.840
But how do I know that
that person has actually

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.640
walked my dog for me?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.550
So the idea behind
this app was that I

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.680
would have this person
they've hired use this app.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.030
So then as they're looking
after my dog during the day,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.613
as they're walking the dog, it
would collect data around that.

00:26:39.613 --> 00:26:41.580
It would collect data
of where they walked,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.704
and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:44.520
It was an interesting
little concept.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.550
But of course, in order
to be able to use this,

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.310
people needed to sign
up for this service.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.510
They register that
I am who I am.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.320
And here's my password
that I sign in.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.320
And I add dog walkers
to my account.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.590
And so first of all, we
hit the first barriers

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.050
that I was talking about earlier
on of yet another sign-up

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.100
that people had to do.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.020
So we thought, OK,
let's add social.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.620
Let's add Sign-In with Google.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.370
Lets add sign in with Facebook.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.000
Lets add sign in
with Yahoo, and sign

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.458
in with Microsoft, and all
these kind of things in the app.

00:27:12.458 --> 00:27:14.460
So it makes it easier for
people to get into it.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.010
So that was the first part,
and it was all very nice.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.640
But then we had all this backend
data, the backend example

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.460
including the address
of the person who

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.082
owns the dog, the site
where the dog gets walked,

00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:27.040
all this kind of stuff.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.660
And it's like, OK, it's
not crazy sensitive data,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.080
such as bank account
details, or other stuff that

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.530
has been leaked on the
internet in the recent past.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.270
But it's potentially sensitive.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.580
People know where I live.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.810
Maybe I have a really
expensive breed of dog

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.360
that could be kidnapped.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.106
Who knows?

00:27:44.106 --> 00:27:45.480
So there is
sensitive data there.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.640
So how do we secure
that backend data?

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.840
And it's all very nice that if
we had a Sign-In with Google

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.870
that gets people
into my application

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.290
locally on my device.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.030
And I can customize it for them.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.270
But what then if those
credentials get passed up

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.370
to my backend
server, and I start

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.740
needing to identify the
person on the backend server?

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.760
Now suddenly, you can have a
middleman coming in, and maybe

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.370
a middleman posting stuff
to my server, saying,

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.130
yes this is Laurence Moroney.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.230
It's lmoroney@gmail.com.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.250
Give me his details.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.440
So we need to be really
careful about extending

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.330
our applications to handle that.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.570
So here's an example.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.026
Here's my app.

00:28:22.026 --> 00:28:22.900
My app has signed in.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.390
By the way, do you
love my diagrams?

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.306
I'm not the most artistic
person in the world.

00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:29.140
So my app has a
Sign-In with Google.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.820
Google has provided an
identity for my user.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.420
And maybe I'm
keying that identity

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.070
off the user's email address.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.630
I then pass that e-mail
address up to my server.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.770
And what can happen is
the bad guys can say,

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.280
huh, I can pass an e-mail
to the server as well.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.880
And then what happens?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.770
If I pass the email
to the server as well,

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.320
the server might be
able to post back

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.660
to me some of the details
about this person.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.380
That would be bad.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.750
So part of the extensibility
of Sign-In with Google

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.390
that we've done is say, OK,
let's treat this a little bit

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.380
differently.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.760
My application, as well as
being able to sign in and get

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.070
an identity from the
user, such as their email,

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.820
I can also get this token.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.820
And this token says,
OK, lmoroney@gmail.com

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.910
has signed in.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.250
He signed in at this time.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.150
Here's some of the
metadata around that.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.510
Here's how we're signing that.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.940
Here's how we're encrypting
and securing that.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.190
My app can pass that
token up to my server.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.070
So now the server passes
that token to Google

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.400
and gets an ACK back
saying, yes, this is good.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.160
Or this really is a
token that we issued.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.540
This really is
lmoroney@gmail.com.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.250
This isn't some kind of fake.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.940
This is the person.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.680
Now, how we can do
this-- there's two ways.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.126
The way that we recommend is
we've got a set of libraries

00:29:40.126 --> 00:29:41.000
that you can do this.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.390
So those libraries do that
communication on your behalf.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.080
And I have a few code
snippets I'll show

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.205
in a moment that show them.

00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:48.342
But we also have an
endpoints that you can call.

00:29:48.342 --> 00:29:50.800
Then you can just call that
endpoint and get the data back.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.830
We recommend the
endpoint for debugging.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.980
And it's all in the docs.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.330
I have some links at
the end of the slide.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.740
But we recommend the
libraries for production work.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.460
So now if a bad guy comes
in, and the bad guy passes up

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.670
a fake token, of course
the usual security happens.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.384
Your server can then try and
pass the fake token to Google.

00:30:07.384 --> 00:30:09.300
And Google will come
back, and they go, uh-uh.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.580
That's not going to happen.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.260
And then you will
know So it just

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.350
secures your backend server
with your user's identity

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.250
from Google that much better.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.810
So let's look a little
bit at the code for this.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.000
Remember earlier
on, the first step

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.044
on your Android application
was creating the GSO.

00:30:27.044 --> 00:30:29.210
Well, one of the things
I've just highlighted in red

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.280
here-- I've added
another method to this.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.040
And this method
was requestIDToken.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.040
And I passed this thing called
the server client ID in there.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.590
And the server client ID
is this unique ID that's

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.460
generated for your server.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.210
There are steps in
our documentation

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.732
that show you how to do that.

00:30:44.732 --> 00:30:46.690
It's a big, long, ugly
string that you can just

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.290
put as a constant in your
app, or any other way

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.550
that you want to do it.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.270
And so when you call
the requestIDToken,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.010
now once the users
sign-in, once you've

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.468
got that successful
sign-in, you're

00:30:57.468 --> 00:30:58.780
able to get that token, too.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.070
So that's the only change
that you need to make.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.209
So then step two-- when you're
setting up your Google API

00:31:05.209 --> 00:31:06.375
client, spot the difference.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.894
There is no difference.

00:31:10.894 --> 00:31:12.060
It's exactly the same thing.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.976
You don't need to change
anything in your code

00:31:13.976 --> 00:31:15.890
for setting up the
Google API client.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.500
Now, step three-- to
get the sign-in intent,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.020
it's exactly the same.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.280
We've added that one
line of code to the GSO,

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.580
but creating the
Google API clients,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.510
calling the Google API
client, connecting it,

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.070
and getting the
sign-in intent back,

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.010
the flow is exactly the same.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.500
But then once you get your
result back-- So earlier,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.070
if you remember this one on our
activity results coming back,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.100
if the activity was the
rcSignin activity, when

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.580
we get our result back, and
we get our account back,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.200
there's a method on the account,
which is get the ID token.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.930
So this gets the token for us.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.910
We have this token
now in our client

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.640
upon a successful sign-in.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.790
And it's a simple case
of posting that token

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.875
to the server, to
our own server.

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.500
When I say, "our,"
I don't mean Google.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.690
I mean "our" if I'm the
application developer.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.090
So my backend server is
an application developer.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.390
Post the token to that.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.350
And then that token
can be posted to Google

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.830
and authorized by
Google on your behalf.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.950
So again, just looking at that
flow-- here, my application.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.000
The user has signed
in with Google.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.290
They've gotten the
identity token from that.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.100
They post the token
to the server.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.719
So now Google will
get the server,

00:32:22.719 --> 00:32:23.760
ACK it, and send it back.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.630
So we avoid the
bad guys doing it.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.192
Let's see what the code
for that would look like.

00:32:28.192 --> 00:32:30.150
Here's how you process
the code on your server.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.691
Sorry I need to turn
around because I

00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:33.360
can't read it on my laptop.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.550
So first of all,
the ID token string

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.680
is that token that's come
from your Android client,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.840
has been posted to the server
just as a string on an http

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.180
post, or hopefully in an https
post-- your secure post--

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.557
and you get your ID token.

00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:48.640
So you want to just check.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.610
If it's not null, now
you have this on the API.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.570
This is not part
of the Android API.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.520
This is part of the
libraries that I mentioned

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.030
that you can use on your
backend server, the Google

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.960
Libraries for authentication.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.720
An object in there
is called-- surprise,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.780
surprise-- a Google
ID token verifier.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.810
The Google ID token
verifier is then

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.750
built just using a
couple of objects

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.162
to transport in the JsonFactory.

00:33:11.162 --> 00:33:13.620
But the important thing is,
two things that you need to do.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.700
Number one, you need
to set the audience.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.846
Now, the audience can be a
number of different servers

00:33:19.846 --> 00:33:21.720
because you may have
multiple servers posting

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.330
into this thing.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.163
And you want the audience
for each of these.

00:33:24.163 --> 00:33:25.600
In the scenario,
I just have one.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.990
And the ID for that--
if you remember,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.010
I was talking earlier
about the server client ID.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.150
I know it sounds like an
oxymoron, a server client.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:35.340
But it's the client ID from
your server to Google servers.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.610
So you set the
audience with that ID.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.960
And then you set the issuer.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.350
And the issuers is just
accounts.google.com.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.100
And then you build this thing.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.750
And then after you
build this thing,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.650
you can then just verify
your token by calling verify,

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.090
or .verify, that actual
string that was posted up.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.290
And if that comes
back as not null,

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:57.027
then this token has a
payload associated with it.

00:33:57.027 --> 00:33:59.110
All the things in orange
on the slide, by the way,

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:00.370
are part of the API.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.189
So the payloads that you
create from that ID token

00:34:03.189 --> 00:34:04.980
has something, for
example, a method in it,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.030
which is the getSubject.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.940
And that just gives
you the user ID.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.320
So if you think about the
flow, the user on your device

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.610
tries to sign in.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.489
When they sign in, Google
issue a token to your device.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.710
Your device then gets that token
and posts it to your server.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.000
Your server gets that token
and posts it back to Google.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.480
Google then verify that
token, and come back and say,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.070
this is the user ID
associated with that token.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.420
So you have the complete flow
from your device to your server

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.774
securely for your
actual end user.

00:34:34.774 --> 00:34:36.690
So then if you're building,
for example, a dog

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.150
walker application,
and you don't

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.832
want a nefarious third
party to access data

00:34:40.832 --> 00:34:42.790
such as the breed of your
dog, or your address,

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.130
or where you live, this is
a great way of doing that.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.840
So all of this data
that's in flight

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.271
is much more secure
than if it was

00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:50.020
just an e-mail being
passed to your server

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.712
to identify the end user.

00:34:52.712 --> 00:34:54.170
So that's really
part of the value.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.489
And that's what Sign-In
with Google is all about.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.330
And that's why we're working
so hard to make it the best

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.240
technology we possibly can.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.730
So all of those above
scenarios that I spoke about

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:04.770
become possible.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.979
Hopefully, you avoid your
users having the issues

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:09.020
that I spoke about earlier
on, where many of them

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.950
walk away if they forget their
password, and stuff like that.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.990
There's a few resources
that I've put here.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.820
So the main website
that we have,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.791
developers.google.com/identify
has all of the background

00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:23.290
information on this, as well
as some more complex scenarios.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.360
There's one that I
haven't gone into here,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.070
but to describe it briefly
was we spoke about your server

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.340
being able to access
Google's back end

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.230
to verify that a person
is who they say they are.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.830
But what if-- using my
Drive scenario again--

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.290
if you've built it so that
you're requesting Drive

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.969
on the phone, and the
person is able to access

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:45.760
Drive on their phone,
that's all very well.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.050
But what if you want
your server to access

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.970
Drive on their behalf?

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.190
Maybe instead of the dog walks
being saved on the phone,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.940
you want to save them
to the user's drive,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.898
and you want your server
to be able to do that?

00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:57.490
Or something along those lines.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.620
Again, there's a more complex
flow that you have to think

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.520
about because now you're having
your server talk to your end

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.570
users' identities
on their behalf,

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.200
accessing stuff which could be
sensitive in their Google Drive

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.424
on their behalf, et cetera.

00:36:11.424 --> 00:36:13.090
And you want to make
sure that's secure.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.200
I don't have all the details in
this talk to go through that.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.450
But those kind of scenarios,
as well as the two that I

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.140
mentioned, are all on
developers.google.com/identity.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.480
There's really, really
great sample code.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.760
It's on GitHub under
googlesamples/googleservices.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.030
And the sample code actually
has four scenarios in it.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.530
The first scenario, simple
Sign-In that I've shown.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.980
The second scenario of simple
Sign-In, but with Drive

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.000
on the device being shown.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.660
The third scenario
of authenticating

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.677
against your backend
server that I've shown.

00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:43.760
And in the fourth scenario,
that more complex one,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.420
that we're saying
where your server may

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.270
need to also authenticate
against Google

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.860
services on your user's behalf.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.140
That's also in that sample.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.310
So it's pretty cool.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.330
And then finally,
if you frequent

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.460
androiddevelopers.blogspot.com,
we actually

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.380
have an ongoing
series on Identity.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.950
There's a post actually going
out today about all the server

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.190
scenarios that I mentioned.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.259
So great resource.

00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:04.550
Go take a look at that if
you're interested in anything

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.300
Identity.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.495
And of course, reach out
to me or any of the team.

00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:09.350
I gave a form at the
beginning of the talk.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.430
And here it is again.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.922
So [? j.mp/offeedback. ?]
And with that,

00:37:12.922 --> 00:37:15.380
I'd just like to say thank you
for coming and spending some

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.009
time with us.

00:37:17.009 --> 00:37:19.693
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.150
I have three minutes
for questions.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.900
We have one here.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.000
Yep, in the center here.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.963
Oh, waiting for a mic.

00:37:33.777 --> 00:37:35.360
AUDIENCE: Some
applications might have

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.140
some sort of age restriction.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.750
So is there any way
to check for age,

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.212
or if they haven't already
put their age in their Google

00:37:43.212 --> 00:37:47.260
account, ask them to provide it?

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.410
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's a good question.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.430
Is there an access on the
ID object for their age?

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.340
This is Paul from
the Identity team.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.400
PAUL: Hi, guys.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.090
So basically, what
it sounds like is

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.090
you need actually additional
information that we

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:01.690
don't provide.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.880
So we don't provide specific
ages and things in Profile.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.150
So actually, once they've
signed up with a Google account,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.900
I would then ask some
additional questions

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.350
to build out their profile.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.470
So it saves you asking for
username, and password,

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.830
and everything.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.996
But then the rest of the
information you might need,

00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:19.089
you would request at that
point in your sign-up flow.

00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:20.880
By that point, they've
already got a login.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.379
So you could
potentially delay it to

00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:25.570
later on if you don't
need that age immediately.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.340
You may have seen
LinkedIn and other sort

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.920
of social network
sites ask, hey,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.020
your profile isn't
100% complete.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.110
Maybe you can add this
information later on,

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.610
and encourage them to do so
with benefits and things.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:41.750
But that's typically how
we see it [? done. ?] OK?

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.110
There may also be age
restrictions on how young

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.320
you can be to have
a Google account.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.820
I don't know off
the top of my head.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.268
But if you post a question
to that, we can confirm that.

00:38:54.294 --> 00:38:55.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Over here.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.980
AUDIENCE: Does the new flow
request any permission?

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.790
Like in the old flow, you
required this getContact

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.200
or the [INAUDIBLE] permission?

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.416
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it
will request permissions

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:13.040
in a number of
scenarios, like if there

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.366
are things that you're
requesting that need

00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:16.490
that additional permission.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.160
I used Drive as an example.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.200
But if you're just saying
that .requestEmail on the GSO,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.150
then there's no further
permissions required.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.260
PAUL: So sorry,
just to add to that.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.690
Are you talking about
Android permissions or user

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.190
Permissions?

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.367
So like with Android
M specifically,

00:39:31.367 --> 00:39:32.950
the great thing about
this new library

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.910
is that it actually removes
any getAccounts permission.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.550
So there's no sort of
system dialogue permissions

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.980
you need to request now
to use Google Sign-In.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.885
And so that's actually one
of the beauties of updating

00:39:44.885 --> 00:39:46.260
to the latest
version of the API,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.890
is that you can remove
that whole step.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.681
That was one of the
steps that was actually

00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:51.990
in that horrific slide
with thousands of steps.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.840
So as far as that's
concerned, under Permissions,

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.355
no permission is requested
from the user, like contacts,

00:39:58.355 --> 00:39:59.730
or camera, or
anything like that.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.730
There's just the
permissions you're

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.120
asking for the services
you're trying to use.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.074
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you

00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:08.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've
only time for one more.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.333
Maybe at the front here.

00:40:14.152 --> 00:40:15.610
So any other
questions, please just

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.620
fill them out on this form,
and we'll get back to you.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.136
AUDIENCE: Quick question--
the Google Drive and YouTube

00:40:21.136 --> 00:40:22.510
authentication,
that's just going

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.130
to work with this as well?

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.450
So if we want to
post from the app

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.480
to YouTube or
access Google Drive,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.844
do we need to do anything extra?

00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:32.385
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So of course, there

00:40:32.385 --> 00:40:34.442
will be Drive APIs for
accessing Drive itself.

00:40:34.442 --> 00:40:35.400
You'll need to do that.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.816
This is just the
permissions layer

00:40:36.816 --> 00:40:37.950
to give you access to that.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.170
AUDIENCE: But
authentication-- once I

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.615
do this, it should
just still work, right?

00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:44.240
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, so for example,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.310
if you've got multiple accounts
on your phone, as many of us

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.217
do, then there's
multiple ways into Drive.

00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:50.050
And there's multiple
access points on Drive.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.650
So if your application
provides the identity

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.160
to Drive that you've
signed in with,

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.300
it will be that Drive account
that you're able to access.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.050
PAUL: The new Sign-In
account has just

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.320
replaced the sign-in
that used to happen

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.440
on Connect and everything.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.190
This now, you'll
notice that it's still

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.400
feeding back into the
same Google API client.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.600
So that still functions
in the same sort of way.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.150
So this is all about
the process that

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.275
happens in the sort of
startup with the API client,

00:41:14.275 --> 00:41:16.184
and Connect, and
all the rest of it.

00:41:16.184 --> 00:41:17.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: All right.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.170
Thanks everybody.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.545
And again any questions, just
fill them out on that form.

00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:23.710
It's [? j.mp/offeedback. ?]
Thank you.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.510
