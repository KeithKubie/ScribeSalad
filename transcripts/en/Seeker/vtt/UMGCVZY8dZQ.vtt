00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.000
Sometimes when it's hot, I stick my leg out
from under the covers and it's like an instant

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.220
cooling effect.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.560
But when it's cold, I want socks to keep my
footsies warm!

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.480
Why do the feet have so much thermal power!?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.400
If you're watching this, you are warm-blooded.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.260
Unless you're an alien, or a reptile that's
learned to understand human speech…

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.300
If so… then, um.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Hello.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.330
Warm-blooded animals have thermoregulation
-- we're constantly burning energy to keep

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.440
our internal organs at optimal body temperature[a].

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.600
Temperature is maintained by the burning of
energy, but ALSO sweating, shivering, and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.499
overall skin blood flow, and our feet and
hands' major weapons in maintaining temperature.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.489
Normally, blood runs from the heart, through
arteries, vessels, capillaries, to cells and

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.639
then back through veins to the heart.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.949
When it's hot, things open up and blood flows
more freely; and the opposite happens when

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.949
it's cold.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.629
The thing is, not all parts of the body are
treated equally by the brain.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.440
In the 1930s, the cortical homunculus was
created to describe how our brains see our

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
bodies.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.510
Limbs aren't that important, and thus input
is largely ignored by the conscious mind;

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.300
but, hands, lips, genitals and so on are REALLY
important!This model vogues with thermoregulation

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.820
in some respects as well.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.340
Our feet, for example, are often ignored…
but are really important for thermoregulation!

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.320
When you feel uncomfortably cold, the somatosensory
cortex of your brain triggers to start thermoregulation

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.570
-- to up your body temperature by shivering,
or opening blood vessels.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.640
Inside the feet are arteriovenous anastomoses,
which connect arteries directly to the veins,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.850
bypassing the capillaries.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.080
When you're warm, vessels in your feet dilate
allowing more blood to get to the skin -- regulating

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.080
your temperature -- cooling you down.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080
But, when you're cold, those arteriovenous
anastomoses restrict, forcing more warm blood

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
into the surface, which lets heat escape,
cooling you off.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.630
This is why you put one foot out from under
the covers.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.980
According to a spokesperson for the National
Sleep Foundation,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.560
when you stick your foot out, the arteriovenous
anastomoses allow the foot to cool you off,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.110
regulating your body temperature without disrupting
your overall comfort.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.520
Biology aside, thermoregulation also has to
do with comfort.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.099
Mom used to say most of your body heat was
lost through your head and feet.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.829
But it's a myth, sorry Mom.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.079
It probably originated from the 1970 U.S.
Army Survival Manual, where they said "40

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.549
to 45 percent of body heat" is lost through
the head.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.299
Because the brain focuses on the head and
chest for thermal comfort rather than the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.640
appendages and your feet chances are they
were more concerned with the comfort of their

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.510
soldiers; not the actual core temperature.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.140
In reality, a 2008 study in the British Medical
Journal found heat loss is spread pretty evenly

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.459
across the body, with only about seven to
ten percent being lost through the head.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.810
According to a 2009 paper from the University
of Wollongong most of that discomfort centers

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.550
on the heat levels in our[e] head, hands and
face.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.950
Perhaps because of that brain perception problem.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.670
Our poor downtrodden feet just get left in
the dust.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.669
Our feet can be colder than our hands, head
or chest, without affecting our conscious

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.669
discomfort levels.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.999
Thus it is the perfect candidate to thermal
regulate while asleep.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.450
Long story short, feet can be a bit cold and
you'll still be snug as a bug in a rug.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.709
What kind of crazy things do you do to get
to sleep?

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.670
Maybe we'll do a video about how that works…
