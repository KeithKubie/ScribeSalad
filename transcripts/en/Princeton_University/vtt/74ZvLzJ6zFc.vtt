[CHEERING]

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.525
RANDALL KENNEDY:
Insistence upon academic freedom.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:42.550
Facilitation of respectful deliberation.
Joy in academic discovery.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.491
Delight in artistic brilliance.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:53.446
A determination to do better
tomorrow than we did today.

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.740
These are the representative
features of the Princeton

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.579
that inspires us,
the Princeton we admire,

00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:04.907
the Princeton we love,
the Princeton in whose honor

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:09.622
we ought be ambassadors
for higher education.

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:12.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:17.555

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:59.424
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
2016, enjoy Class Day. Congratulations!

00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:06.571
JODI PICOULT:
Look up and see where else

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.956
you can climb.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:12.442
There will no doubt be someone,
or something in your way - well, good.

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:14.381
Embrace the obstacles.

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:18.801
The person who gets where he wants
easily may not break a sweat -

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:24.241
but he also will not have a story that
inspires change, or that inspires others.

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:29.298
Go on, Class of 2016.
Make the rest of us proud.

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:33.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.024
[MUSIC]

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:41.606
SANJEEV KULKARNI:
The process of mastering

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.305
a disclipline and contributing
something new to a body

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:48.128
of knowledge with a deep focus
is in fact broadening and liberating.

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:53.769
It enables you to pursue new directions,
new fields, or entirely new endeavors

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.936
with the abilities and confidence
not just to succeed but

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:59.214
to excel and to lead.

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:15.821
CAMERON PLATT:
Class of 2016, thank you

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.081
for four years of
remarkable conversation.

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:23.413
As you go out of FitzRandolph Gate,
hopefully for the first time,

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:28.852
tell your stories, listen to
the stories of others,

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:32.235
and mind the many ways -
often unexpected -

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:34.826
in which they speak
to each other.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.836
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
The world that awaits you

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:43.341
will sometimes be frustrating and
difficult, but it is a world that needs

00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:48.994
your talents, your citizenship
and your engagement.

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:53.236
You have shared friendships,
rivalries, highs and lows,

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:56.506
cooperation, competition
and conflict.

00:03:56.506 --> 00:04:00.174
For most of you, your enduring
connections to one another

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:04.254
and to this University will be one
of the most important legacies

00:04:04.254 --> 00:04:06.267
of your time here.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.836
My colleagues and I here on stage
look forward to cheering you on

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:12.586
as you address these
and other challenges.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.701
We hope that all of you will return
often to Old Nassau and update

00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:18.203
us on your progress.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.871
We are proud of you,
we will miss you,

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:24.595
and we eagerly anticipate seeing
what you will achieve, because

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:28.497
all of you are now, and forever
shall be part of Princeton's

00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:32.988
Great Class of 2016!
Congratulations and best wishes!
