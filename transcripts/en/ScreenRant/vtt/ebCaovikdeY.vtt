00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.120
Even if a movie follows skilled sword fighters,
warriors, or martial arts experts, it's still

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.431
actors who need to play out the scenes. And
as good as fight choreography might be, mistakes

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:20.560
are bound to happen. And the bigger the budget
or drama, the funnier those slip ups become.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.009
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Mistakes That
Slipped Through Editing FIGHTS EDITION.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.009
Terminator 2

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.510
By the time this sequel was released, everyone
knew the skills and strengths of the T-800.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.600
But the opening barfight for Arnold's character
put the mythology - and the props - to the

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.789
test. A small knife can barely do any damage
because of the metal skeleton underneath his

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.489
skin, but seeing the rubber stunt knife completely
bend and deform proves that steel isn't the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.760
only factor at work.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.120
300

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.170
If Zack Snyder knows one thing, it's a speed-ramp
filled action sequence. The Spartans showed

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
they were more terrifying than any other soldier
by breaking ranks to slash, stab, kick, punch,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.410
and spear their oncoming enemies. But it may
not have been as hard as it sounds. When the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.270
Spartan king throws a spear into the chest
of a Persian, the soldier next to him is sent

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.700
flying. Whether it's sympathy impact, or just
looking for an excuse to get out of the battle,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.940
we'll never know.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.940
The Matrix

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.060
The Wachowskis' idea of "bullet time" changed
action movies forever, but when they weren't

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.020
inventing new types of action, they were copying
plenty others - like the wire work of Eastern

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.210
martial arts movies. Every fan knows that
Keanu Reeves couldn't&nbsp;really&nbsp;backflip a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.920
dozen feet in the air out of the way of a
subway train. But when you watch the actor's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.270
hands, and realize he's holding onto the wires
pulling him up the entire time, you might

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.040
wonder why the directors didn't even bother
to hide the giveaway, or ask for another take.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.310
The Dark Knight Rises

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.130
Bane's henchmen don't get too much attention
in the final chapter of Christian Bale's Batman,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.290
but a few nameless stuntmen do end up earning
the spotlight - for the worst possible reason.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.020
There's the highly-trained League assassin
who falls for absolutely no reason during

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.520
a rooftop fight with Batman and Catwoman.
But that's not the worst fight scene mistake

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.370
in the movie: that honor goes to the other
League gunman who decides to just pretend

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.840
he's been hit, despite nobody even coming
near him. It may have been his best option.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.519
Star Wars: Revenge of The Sith

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.060
When most of what's seen on screen is created
in a computer, you would think that mistakes

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.130
would be easy to hide or avoid. But what happens
when Jedi start fighting hand-to-hand, or

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.240
foot-to-foot, and the actors can't sell the
moves? Anakin's running kick during his showdown

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.320
with Obi-wan is a rough enough stunt, since
Ewan McGregor reacts before the kick even

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.520
lands. But the move that immediately follows
it is.... well, the less said about it the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.320
better.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.560
Mr. and Mrs. Smith

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560
This movie might be most famous for uniting
one of Hollywood's biggest couples, but the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.390
fight scene between Brad Pitt and Angelina
Jolie is anything but forgettable. Buried

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.750
between the punches and kicks, there's even
a scene played for laughs, when the pair's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.590
battle sends a couch shaking and jumping on
the floor of their house. Don't bother asking

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.290
how it's done, either - you can clearly see
the crew member shaking the couch when he

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.620
pops into frame.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.620
Fast Five

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.470
There's no point in poking holes in the physics
or realism of the Fast &amp; Furious series, but

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.920
that doesn't mean they don't make SOME mistakes
worth catching. When the crew steal a vault

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.860
in the fifth installment, the police they're
stealing from take exception. The first officer

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.810
to investigate gets a surprise hello from
The Rock, dropping him with a single punch.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.820
It's hard to say if it was the actor or the
character who wanted to go easy on the cop,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.970
but the boxing glove taking him out was a
nice gesture all the same.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.720
Transformers: Age of Extinction

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.890
There are too many continuity errors to count
in the Transformers series, assuming audiences

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.720
are looking for them. But there's one that
is more obvious, more baffling, and more worrying

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.160
than any other. When star Mark Wahlberg is
heading to take out the movie's transforming

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.280
villain, he takes cover behind a stone wall,
moments before it's blown to pieces. But the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.330
man who suddenly appears just in time to be
killed is never explained. If you've got a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.490
theory, we're all ears.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.490
Gladiator

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.410
Everyone knows that Ridley Scott's Gladiator
epic is filled with small mistakes or fake

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.561
attacks, but it's the stranger, less expected
mistakes that are the most fun to spot. During

00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:59.130
the reenactment of the Battle of Carthage,
there's a good chance that audiences will

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.010
be too distracted by seeing an archer sliced
in half to notice the chariot supervisor tucked

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.720
away on board. But his black clothing and
work boots are hard to miss, once you've spotted

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.170
them.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.170
Return of The Jedi

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.020
We covered this one in our other video “10
Hilarious Details Hidden In The Backgrounds

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.650
Of Movies” but it’s just too amazing to
leave out! In Star Wars Episode 6 Return Of

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.889
The Jedi, when Luke is battling Jabba’s
goons on a ship near the Sarlacc Pit, he is

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.550
seen kicking one of them in the face. The
fast movements almost hide the mistake but

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.819
if you slow down the sequence, it’s obvious
Luke was nowhere near the stuntman’s face…

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.770
Or was it a Force Kick?! I guess we’ll never
know…

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.759
Those are the mistakes, blown punches, kicks,
and overall errors we found in our favorite

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.669
fight scenes, but which ones did we miss?
