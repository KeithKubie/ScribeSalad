BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.200
interesting developer community.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.040
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.320
has asked this question.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.465
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:08.720
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.600
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.850
would like to ask questions.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.810
NICK BUTCHER: We have
a recording.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.710
NICOLAS GARNIER: We should
try to be very serious.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.085
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.460
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yes, so I--

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.155
IDO GREEN: So we're here in
GDL IL, episode number

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:32.680
[INAUDIBLE], we'll see.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.920
Later, in the future,
we will edit it.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.110
So I guess--

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.730
NICK BUTCHER: It'll be
a loud voice editor.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.985
Four!

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.222
Four!

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:42.190
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.165
IDO GREEN: So we are lucky to
have with us people from the

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:46.970
Android team and Drive team.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.860
Maybe we kick off with each
and every one of you just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.060
presenting yourself?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.600
NICOLAS GARNIER: Sure.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.300
I'll start.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.080
I'm Nicolas Garnier.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.556
I'm a Developer Advocate working
on Google Drive, and

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.310
I'm based in Zurich,
Switzerland.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.000
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Hey.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600
I'm Richard Hyndman, a Developer
Advocate for

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.610
Android, based in London.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.420
NICK BUTCHER: I'm Nick Butcher,
also an Android

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300
Developer Advocate
from London.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.580
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.893
And for the ones that didn't
know, I'm Ido Green, Developer

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:14.970
Advocate working now here
in Google Israel.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.650
So maybe you want to ask the
people about what we're doing

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.030
here, why you came--

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.160
took the long, long
flight to Israel.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.425
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --like
four hours.

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.331
How did we survive that?

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:25.790
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.000
So what are we doing here?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.970
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Why would
Android and Drive

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.160
be in a room together?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.410
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.910
NICOLAS GARNIER: We came here,
and we're doing, actually a

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.080
bunch of different things.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.010
The first thing is we're meeting
local companies.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.550
And personally, I'm meeting
companies that are potentially

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.205
going to integrate with
Google Drive.

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.880
And I'm trying to see if
they need assistance.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.904
Or trying to show them what are
the features, and how they

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:57.760
could use and integrate Google
Drive in their products.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.910
I guess you guys'll do the same,
right, with a bunch of

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.470
different people?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.735
A lot of the awesome start-ups
here in Israel that have been

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:05.590
working at the hackathon turned
up at the Afeka College

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.479
of Engineering, where we're
based for this couple of days.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.220
IDO GREEN: So you came,
basically for a GDG event that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.450
we had yesterday.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.960
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So first
we met people.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.214
And yesterday, there was this
nice event organized by the

00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:20.840
GDG Tel Aviv, right.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.785
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:23.900
NICOLAS GARNIER: And the
college here, Afeka.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.590
What's the full name?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.760
Afeka--

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.668
IDO GREEN: Afeka College.

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:26.576
NICOLAS GARNIER: Afeka college.

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:27.030
Good.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300
IDO GREEN: It's easy.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.920
And I did a one-hour
presentation basically about

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.643
Google Drive SDK, and
Google Drive itself.

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.300
Just explaining how it
works technically,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.710
what are the features.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.700
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It was supposed
to be a one-hour

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.420
presentation.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.444
Really [INAUDIBLE] one hour
thirty-some-odd presention.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:48.380
NICOLAS GARNIER: It was suposed
to be 45 minutes.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.902
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE],
he was like, this is when my

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:50.910
presentation's supposed
to finish.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.720
I'll take another
half an hour.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.650
You guys?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.970
Psh.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.710
NICOLAS GARNIER: I was
like, oh shit.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.100
I'm overdue over time.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.240
I'm in the middle of
my presentation.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.740
Well, screw it, I'm just
going to [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.190
IDO GREEN: Well guys,
just bear with me.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.970
slides.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.110
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Slide
29 of 100.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.736
NICOLAS GARNIER: Drive is
so interesting, though.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:09.728
You can't stop.

00:03:09.728 --> 00:03:11.216
You just can't.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:13.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The audience
was silent the whole time.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.314
Just engaged.

00:03:15.314 --> 00:03:17.845
Following that, we had a little
talk about Android.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.395
I did the talk, and
so did Nick.

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:21.940
I was talking about
Android 4.1--

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.756
JB, API level?

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:26.010
NICK BUTCHER: 16.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.720
IDO GREEN: Wow.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.350
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Testing.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.630
Testing.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.500
16.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.790
API level 16.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.280
And Project Butter.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.930
Went into a bit of detail about
some of the new APIs in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.720
Android 4.1.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.130
The media codec.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.100
All that lower-level media API
stuff, so you can inspect

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.310
media files.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.720
You can encode and decode
using the hardware.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.950
It's not so much fuss than
previous versions.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.980
NICK BUTCHER: And after
Richard's low-level technical

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.630
goodness, I went completely in
the other direction, and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.380
talked all about UI, and much
more fuzzy, hand-wavey topics.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.780
So I talked about some of the
things that we see lots of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.270
developers not doing so great.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.970
Like, say, how to make an
application that's responsive

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.550
and friendly to use,
easier to use.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.680
And especially how to make an
application feel Android-y.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.380
How to make it feel right at
home on the Android, and not

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.190
carry over conventions
from other platforms.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.459
And I talked in depth about some
new patterns that we're

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.750
seeing emerge.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.050
So things like how to build
swipe-to-dismiss, which you

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.666
might have seen on your
phones, with the

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:25.830
notifications.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.750
How to do rich notifications.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.820
How to do some tricks with
scrolling, to make most of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.220
your small area.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.020
And I also talked about the
mindset you need to be an

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.450
Android developer.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.045
Like how to think mobile.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.380
How to design for the vast
array of small, large,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.110
medium-size devices.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.570
It was a great, great
audience.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.160
They asked some really good
questions, and seemed to

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.435
really enjoy the content.

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:51.420
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I thought you
were going to say, it was a

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.660
great, great talk.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.120
NICOLAS GARNIER: It was
really awesome.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.072
NICK BUTCHER: No, I'm not
going to say that.

00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.860
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I really
think you would.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.140
IDO GREEN: I did an amazing job,
and everybody liked it.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.075
NICK BUTCHER: But it might as
well be online [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:03.075 --> 00:05:04.110
It was a good audience.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.742
It was like 140 people turned
up for the GDG event.

00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:07.520
There was a huge [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.970
IDO GREEN: It was actually very
surprising, because we

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.770
had about 170, 180
that registered.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.990
And then usually, it's
like 60%, 50%.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.860
And then the show-up was
really impressive.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.350
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.460
partly the falafel.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.544
I think word's got out that
the falafel is very good.

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:23.794
NICOLAS GARNIER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.555
IDO GREEN: That's actually--

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:29.275
Michael did a really, really
wonderful job just organizing

00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:30.706
everything.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:33.620
We love coming to Israel because
the developer audience

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.580
is really, really super,
super sharp.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.200
The questions you get when
people are pitching topics to

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.360
do in a hackathon.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.510
There's some real
smart groups.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.826
And some are really keen to make
things and ship stuff.

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:48.140
So it's really awesome to
come here and see that.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.400
IDO GREEN: Cool.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.380
That's actually really
interesting.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.750
I wanted to ask--

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.980
I spoke with Nicolas before
about maybe you could

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.362
highlight two or three companies
that you worked with

00:05:55.362 --> 00:05:57.430
that were impressive, and why.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.450
What they did right, what
they could improve.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.870
NICOLAS GARNIER: You mean today,
or in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.800
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.860
Just speak.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.350
NICOLAS GARNIER: OK.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.820
Anybody?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.730
IDO GREEN: Yeah, sure.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.518
NICOLAS GARNIER: So Microsoft,
they're really--

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:09.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.008
IDO GREEN: Netflix.

00:06:10.008 --> 00:06:11.004
I like the service, but--

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.000
NICOLAS GARNIER: --you're
doing everything wrong.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.494
I'm joking.

00:06:13.494 --> 00:06:14.744
I love you, Microsoft.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.810
Actually, right here, I've
met with [? Majisto ?]

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.200
and also [? Powtuns ?]

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.945
who are local companies
here in Israel.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.330
And they are actually
integrating with

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.150
Google Drive today.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.680
So we haven't sat
down already.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.340
But there's a hackathon going
on today, where people are

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.960
trying to build Android
and/or Drive apps.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.260
And these two companies have
started integrating with

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.880
Drive, and they're making
good progress.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.560
It's actual products, with
lots of users already.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.830
And they're integrating today.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.760
Actually, [? Majisto ?] was
super-advanced already.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.784
They have something pretty
much working.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.180
So it's nice to get
real companies

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.750
engaged when you come.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.300
And we actually met them
yesterday, right?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.680
For example, [? Powtuns. ?]

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.820
And we showed them what the
Drive integration was like.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.840
And they were like, cool.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.260
We'll integrate.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.854
We'll start tomorrow
in the hackathon.

00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:14.710
And boom, they're doing it.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.960
NICK BUTCHER: That's
philosophy.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.155
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We've met with
a whole load of partners.

00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:22.970
A lot of them have been
asking for UI reviews.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.270
So you've got a niche
speciality there.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.400
Especially partners
who have their

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.720
apps live in the Android--

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.500
well, in Google Play.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.306
It was the Android market
at the time.

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:32.234
I don't need to [INAUDIBLE],
because it is valid.

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:35.010
They had it in the Android
market before we launched our

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.000
design guidelines.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.852
So it was still there.

00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:40.513
And obviously, the one UI
review-- because they had

00:07:40.513 --> 00:07:42.180
their app launched before our
design guidelines came out.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.580
And now we have design
guidelines.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.446
They just want to know how to
really ship their app across

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:47.830
to make it into the new
Android look and feel.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.900
And the ones that have done
well have already read the

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.640
design guidelines.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.440
And they've come in, and just
said, this is what we're

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.740
thinking about for our design.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.640
And that makes our lives
a whole lot easier.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.180
It's very, very nice to see.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.500
They just come back with
something that's

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.190
looking great already.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.650
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.620
That's really cool.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.326
And actually, we
should mention.

00:08:02.326 --> 00:08:06.695
We put all the links in the
show, so people could jump on

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.480
and see exactly what
we have where.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.820
Sure.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.620
IDO GREEN: Because
of resources.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.018
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:12.420
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.082
Any other thing you'd
like to talk about?

00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:19.560
The event, or new stuff that
we're going to have in the

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.830
near future?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.200
I know that usually, we're not
making a spoiler-breaker.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.000
But things that are we
can share with--

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.770
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Well, when's
this going to be broadcast?

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.210
IDO GREEN: Two weeks from now.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.680
So it's live.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.540
NICK BUTCHER: We haven't got
any announcements tonight.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.278
But some of the cool stuff I
highlighted is, for me, in the

00:08:38.278 --> 00:08:41.840
Android world, I love the open
source contributions.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.785
So many people take the patterns
we've introduced,

00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:46.520
like on our design site.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.390
And implements them
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.950
and so on, so that they
can share them.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.830
Like I said, I'll give a link
to the slides of the

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.170
presentation, which has more
links to a bunch of open

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.190
source implementations of stuff,
as well as a couple of

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.812
new things which came out
in the last couple of

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:00.450
days which I like.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.260
Which is a few online
style generators.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.920
One of the things I talk about
when I talk is how to take the

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.780
Android style, the hollow
themes we call it.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.130
And customize it.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.060
Use it as your base,
and marry that with

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.280
your product's branding.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.520
So a few cool tools have come
out, like some online style

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:16.970
generators.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.600
So you put in the colors and
look and feel that you want.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.690
And it'll generate all the
image [? drawables ?]

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.210
and XML files that you need to
put into your Android app, to

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.736
make it have that
look and feel.

00:09:27.736 --> 00:09:30.410
So those are some cool
tools to check out.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.215
If you're following my Google +
profile, I've posted slides.

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:34.650
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.325
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.750
Excellent.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.490
Drive?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.810
Drive had an announcement,
right?

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.220
I saw a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.980
I would just say there
was just [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.778
some quick start sample code--

00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:48.254
Cheers.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.682
NICOLAS GARNIER: --that
we've added.

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:50.158
Yes, well.

00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:51.110
We do that every day.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.360
That's perfect [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.710
[? I'm sure that's ?]

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.210
[? normal. ?]

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.780
So [INAUDIBLE] there's
actually quite a few

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.740
things coming up.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.850
My boss has already leaked it
on [INAUDIBLE], so I can

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.870
totally talk about it.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:12.500
So we're working on adding push
notifications to our API,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.670
so you'll be able to register
a callback.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.154
Whenever a file changes on
Drive, we'll let you know.

00:10:17.154 --> 00:10:18.618
And you don't have to--

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:22.220
the other method was to pull
every minute or every hour.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.490
So I could now sync between
my Android devices

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.335
using Google Drive?

00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.885
Because every time I'd change it
on one device, sync that to

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:31.230
Drive, then Drive will
then invoke a

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.920
callback to push it through--

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.160
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.620
NICK BUTCHER: --somewhere
else.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.550
NICOLAS GARNIER: Then Drive will
broadcast a callback to

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.960
other subscribers, and
they will know

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.710
that your file changes.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.740
And the other big thing
that we're doing--

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.360
I can't go into many
details there--

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.080
But we're working on and
improving a lot, and changing

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.210
a lot the experience about
discoverability of Drive apps.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.320
And making it way easier for
users to find Drive apps.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.171
A lot of Drive apps
exist for us.

00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:04.093
And it will allow the developers
also to get more

00:11:04.093 --> 00:11:07.015
visibility-- a lot more
visibility, I expect--

00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:08.963
for the app on Drive.

00:11:08.963 --> 00:11:09.940
I see.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.708
That, hopefully, will come in
the next couple months.

00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:16.098
Two, three months.

00:11:16.098 --> 00:11:18.010
Some big changes there.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:18.830
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.730
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.070
Thank you.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.150
That was very good.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.990
We'll catch you later,
on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.725
We'll do the next episode.
