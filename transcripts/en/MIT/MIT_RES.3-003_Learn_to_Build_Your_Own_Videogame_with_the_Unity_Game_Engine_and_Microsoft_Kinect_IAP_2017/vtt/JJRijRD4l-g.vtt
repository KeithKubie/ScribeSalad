00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:16.600
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.650
So at this point, we have
our roller ball demo.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.470
Now, we would like to
interface with the Kinect.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.250
To do this, we're going to
use the simple Kinect Unity

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.976
package.

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.630
It's over here.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.560
So in the simple Kinect
package there is a prefab.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.740
You can drag this
prefab into your game

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.440
and it will initiate the Kinect
and do all the stuff that's

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.190
required for that.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.660
So now, when I start my game,
the Kinect will turn on.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.550
And it's not going
to do anything yet

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.560
because I haven't interfaced it.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.730
So, now I want my ball
that we created previously

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.890
to follow my right hand sign.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.550
So what we're going to
do is go into our player

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.170
and we're going to add a script.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.860
The script that we're going
to add is the follow join.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.490
You can find it in
scripts, no, Kinect stuff.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.720
There it is and follow join.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.350
So let's drag it
on to our player,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.410
and then we need
to fill out which

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.660
object we would like to track.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.300
So in this case I'd like
to follow my right hand.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.535
And you can find that I have
a right hand object here.

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:52.310
So you can drag this right
hand object into the player

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.060
controller script.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.570
So that's the tracked object.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.830
And now the ball should
follow my right hand.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.610
So you can see it
there in the scene.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.140
As I move my hand
closer to the Kinect,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.150
it moves closer to the camera.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.520
In many gamines, this isn't
what You'd want though.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.650
So inside that
follow join script

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.470
there is an to
invert each access.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.540
Since the z-axis is one
goes toward the camera,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.460
in this case, we're going
to invert the z-axis.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.790
So now, when we click play,
as I move my hand forward,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.440
the ball moves forward
within the world space,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.320
and back, left,
right, up, down, etc.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.480
So now, with my right hand,
I can control the ball.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.002
All of the pick-ups should
still work as they did before

00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:59.730
and the game can still be won.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.795
So I'm getting all the
pick-ups with my right hand.

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:08.070
Have to go back it up a little.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.890
It's just like using a mouse
or arrow keys, but in 3D.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.387
So as you can see,
that still works.

00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:18.847
Your turn.

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.680
So now, let's say we
want to track something

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.491
other than our right hand.

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:27.340
You can adjust this in
the moving object parent.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.280
So I have a detect joint
script attached to here

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.830
and this has a
track joint option.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.440
You can change this to
be any joint you like.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.050
So let's say I want
to do my left and.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.958
I'll select the hand left
object, which is somewhere.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.954
There it is.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.430
And then, for the sake of
making things make sense,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.290
rename my object to
left hand object.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.820
So now that this is
called left hand object,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
we want to make sure that the
object attached to the player

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.350
controller, follow join, is
indeed the left hand object

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.360
as is visible right here.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.900
So now when I click play, it
should follow my left hand

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.908
not my right hand.

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.788
If the Kinect can find me.

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:34.730
There it is.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.760
And so I can move my
left hand forward,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.744
left, right, up, down, etc.

00:04:39.744 --> 00:04:41.744
So now, let's say we want
to try multiple joints

00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:44.280
at the same time.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.510
This whole moving objects
parent part can be duplicated.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.780
So Control D or
Command D to duplicate.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.740
And we can now create a left had
object and a right hand object.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.253
So let's go back to being
hand-right and rename this.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.820
So I'm going to add
another sphere to my scene

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.560
in order to have another
object for my game.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.100
So let's create a sphere.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.980
And then I'm going it so that
my right hand follows this one

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.536
since my left hand already
follows the player.

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:32.840
So in Kinect stuff, follow join.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.830
Drag it right on to that sphere.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.190
OK.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.910
So now, I want this to
follow my right hand object,

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.230
so I'm going to drag that
in as my track joint.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.561
And now that sphere should
follow my right hand,

00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:50.894
while the other follows my left.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.465
So I didn't set the
invert option on that one

00:06:03.465 --> 00:06:05.270
though, so as I
move forward, they

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.920
each go in opposite directions.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.830
But otherwise, left and
right work as you'd expect,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.190
and up and down.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.370
So let's say I want to
try a different joint.

00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:23.905
Like, let's make my left
hand object be my head.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:26.984
We'll go to that
moving object parent ,

00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:29.150
change it to head here.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.346
And let's rename this to head.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.053
Now, my right hand
controls the sphere

00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:52.810
that we just added and my
head controls the player.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.080
So, where is my right hand?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.980
There is my right hand.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.990
Where is my head?

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.944
Can we see it?

00:06:58.944 --> 00:06:59.610
Can I get it in?

00:07:05.022 --> 00:07:08.470
It's down here.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.640
You can see it up on scene view.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.900
I'm struggling to get bearings.

00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:18.930
Oh, I never set invert axis.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.190
That would explain that.

00:07:23.557 --> 00:07:26.924
Probably going to--

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.768
It was on player, right?

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:37.754
No, it was not.

00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:38.740
It was on the sphere.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.120
Hope I can re-enter
myself in world space.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.600
There it is.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.510
So, as I move my head left
and right, up and down,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.320
and my hand, they
all go properly.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.290
Each object's position can be
addressed by other objects.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.790
And so this is how you can
gather your data to use however

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.460
you like.
