TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
Timothy Jordan here.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.840
Your friendly developer
advocate, taking you

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.030
around Google I/O 2017.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.300
We're now in the maps
and mobile web tent

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.070
and I'm here with
Chris Wilson, who's

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.741
going to show us how
Lighthouse works.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.740
CHRIS WILSON: All right.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.730
Thank you, Timothy.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.710
So Lighthouse is
a tool that we've

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.610
created to help build
really good web experiences,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.620
help you improve
web experiences.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.990
I'm going to actually
enter in a URL right here.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.610
This is the media
player application

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.250
that we showed off in the
Web State of the Union talk.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.130
We also have a talk
about it tomorrow,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.250
in the future of
audio and video.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.370
And it's going to
run a series of tests

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.980
here to test a bunch
of different things

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.920
about whether it has a manifest,
whether it has a service

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.400
worker installed, if it's going
to work when it's offline,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.211
how it works in different
network environments, all kinds

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:53.710
of stuff.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.400
How long it takes for the user
to get an interactive access

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.470
to the page, all
that kind of stuff.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.300
And something went
hideously wrong.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.840
So let's take a
look at the report.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.140
So this is kind of
cheating, because

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.420
this particular
application gets 100%.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.370
It does super well, right?

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.900
I mean, we hand-coded this.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.349
Paul Lewis is an expert--

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:13.390
he knows what he's doing.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.848
Like, he has a manifest on
here, it's got a service worker,

00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:16.681
it works offline.

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.430
You know, there's still
things to be done.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.900
Like performance--
you can always

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.530
try to do better at performance.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.000
A little bit-- a tiny
bit in accessibility.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.830
We could do, maybe
some best practices,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.810
and passive listeners--
that kind of stuff.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.950
A really awesome score, right?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.470
I had to use this site because
all of mine are horribly bad.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.394
Everything.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.810
You know, I know what the
lowest score I've seen today is.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.295
It's my own site, so.

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:41.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well I would say
I'm not going to tell anybody,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.420
but you just told everybody.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.302
So now-- this is a social
contract to fix that.

00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:47.760
CHRIS WILSON: It's
all open source,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.960
so you could go fix my site.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.615
Maybe?

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:52.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I don't
think that's going to happen.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.500
Chris, thanks so much.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.220
CHRIS WILSON: Thank you.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is Paul, and Paul's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420
going to tell us a little bit
about what's going on with AMP.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.120
And I have a fancy
question to ask.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.590
PAUL: Then ask your
fancy question.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
My fancy question

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.618
is the overlap
between AMP and PWA.

00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:08.909
When are we going to see it,
and how well does it work?

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.330
PAUL: Yeah, there's a good
reason why we're so close

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.250
together here with the stalls.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.740
And I just talked
about it this morning--

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.200
how to combine those two in
a really, really nice way.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.360
And there's-- there are three
development models that really

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.860
work well.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.320
Because what we're saying is
that you want to start fast

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.700
and you want to stay fast.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.430
So you can either build an
AMP that is both a PWA--

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.970
you can actually do that.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.170
But you also lead from an
AMP to a progressive web app,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.499
and use your AMP
content as a data source

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:36.665
in that progressive web app.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:37.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.420
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.430
You have something
you can show me?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.330
PAUL: Actually, yes.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.020
Yeah.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.715
So--

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:45.106
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's go ahead
and show it to the camera here.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.470
PAUL: So if you
take a look here,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.170
this is actually using live
data from the Guardian, who

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
graciously offered us their
access feeds to do this.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.400
And so this is a demo app
that I built a few days ago.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.920
And so, as you can see, it's
a fairly smooth navigation.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.020
This is actually a
progressive web app,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.680
so I can navigate in categories.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.030
And then, if I click
on one of those links--

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.230
there we go, let's try that--

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.966
it opens the actual AMP article.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.340
So this article that you see
right here-- as you can see,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.230
there was a transition
going on here.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.310
And this article
itself is all AMP.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.040
So you have a
progressive web app shell

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.960
that just does the navigation.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.436
But then you use AMP as a
data source in your app.

00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:31.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
totally awesome.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.290
Hey, thanks for
showing us that, Paul.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.260
PAUL: Absolutely you're welcome.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is
this going on over here?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.097
It looks cool, and
live, and data.

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:38.680
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.970
It's the I/O transport
tracker, which

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.170
this is the second year
we've been running it.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.257
And basically we're--

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:50.244
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Show me
what it is up here close.

00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:51.910
SPEAKER: There's a
few components to it.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.600
There's an Android app that we
put on to each of the shuttles

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.150
running to the different hotels
around the I/O conference.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.130
Those Android apps are
using the Firebase API

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.820
to report their
locations as they

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.620
travel to each of their stops.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.890
And then this is just a
Google map on a web page

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.660
that you subscribe to that same
Firebase database and, funnily

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.079
enough, each time the bus moves,
the bus icons on here move.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.270
And so it allows us
to see exactly where

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.390
all the buses are.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really awesome.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.164
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:26.164 --> 00:04:29.157
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So this
is us right here, right?

00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:29.740
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.600
You can-- some of the buses
you can see are parked there.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.987
And it's all hooked up
with GTFS data, as well.

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:36.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.740
So that is the maps
and mobile web tent.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.250
And I think it's time to get
on and see some more stuff here

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.780
at Google I/O 2017.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.430
