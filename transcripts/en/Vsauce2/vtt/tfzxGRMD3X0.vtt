Pinokio is a robotic creation created by students
from Victoria University of Wellington&nbsp;by

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.349
modifying a lamp and adding animatronic elements.&nbsp;
Its actions are driven primarily by Arduino

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.439
and image processing software OpenCV, which
searches for faces with its webcam, once it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.640
finds a face it attempts to follow it as if
trying to maintain eye contact.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.500
Theo Jansens latest miniature kinetic sculpture
is called the Animaris Geneticus Ondularis.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.480

a fluid wavelike sequence. It incorporates

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.550
122 moving parts and is produced by the on
demand 3D printing service Shapeways.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.230
"Box" is an ongoing series of unusual photos
from Belgium based 354 Photographers. Crafted

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.519
out of cardboard and filled with miniature
furniture each diorama was built around the

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.080
perspective of the camera to ensure the scenes
had the right angle and depth. Photos of the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
human subjects were then added using photoshop.
The creators describe the scenes as a little

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
depressing and a little funny but they want
the viewers to do the interpreting for themselves.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.820
The bird buggy was created by University of
Florida engineering student Andrew Gray to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.040
keep his parrot occupied and quiet. The vehicle
is controlled by a joystick that the bird

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.329
can move in four directions with it's beak
and is also equipped with bump sensors and

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.439
infrared collision sensors to keep the bird
from getting stuck. Once the bird is removed

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.939
the bird buggy returns itself to a docking
station utilizing a web camera.

colleagues in the medical and art fields.
She was provided with prepared slides of various

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.350
