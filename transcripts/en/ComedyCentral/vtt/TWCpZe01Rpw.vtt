- What are all these
other gravestones?

- Pets don't live forever, Adam.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.866

Your voice sounds perfect today!

I wouldn't be too sad if we

with a little song from you!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.814

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.084
I've never sang before.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.720

the saddle, you puppy!

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.555

I want you to think
of this dog's life

as a book that we all read.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.256
- Not a very good book.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.424
- No, not a very
good book at all.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.393
In fact, most of it was
written like a shit.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.895
- Yes, a stupid book.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.130
It's a children's book,
I wish I'd never read it!

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.099
- But we read it
because we had to.

- Zach, Zach, pick me, pick me!

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.137
I think it's important to

Who knows what this little
guy witnessed, or maybe saw?

So count your blessings, folks.

Coulda been us in that hole.
