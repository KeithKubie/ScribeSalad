00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.200
Now, finally, there are some
overrides that we need for

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.770
when the connection fails
called onConnectionFailed, or

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.420
the client gets disconnected
called onDisconnected.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.020
For these, we'll just log the event,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.740
and in the case of failure,
we'll also log the relevant error code.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.710
And now that we've added these,
we've gotten everything that we need, so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.580
let's run the application and
see what happens.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.440
Awesome!

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.240
As you can see, it works.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.010
Now take some time to
make your changes and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.020
finish up the app on your own machine.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.970
Maybe you could even do something simple
like making these labels a little big

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.680
bigger so they're easier to read.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.120
Have fun playing with
the application and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.680
seeing the kind of things
you can do with it.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.240
Maybe visualizing latitude and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.910
longitude in a lot more nicer way than
we've done here, by just using numbers.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.520
You might be able to use,
like, a dial on a compass, or

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.120
something along those lines.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.040
Well, whatever you do, have fun with
it and let's see what you can do next.
