Do you love your dog? I mean, really. Love.
Your. Dog. … like it’s your child. ?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.969
Hi guys, Crystal here for DNews

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.590
I live in LA and let me tell you, people there
really love their dogs. There are doggy gyms

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.000
where your dog can meet with his trainer,
doggy spas where he can get a massage, restaurants

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.230
that offer “locally sourced organic” dog
food, and places where you and your dog can

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.130
get a side-by-side mani-pedi. I know many
dog owners who say that their dog *is* their

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.760
child. Well, researchers from Massachusetts
General Hospital say that actually might not

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.789
be as crazy as it sounds …

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.750
When examining functional MRI data of women
who were shown pictures of their dogs, pictures

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.989
of their children, or neutral pictures of
unrelated dogs or children, researchers noticed

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.359
that neural activation was similar if the
subject was looking at either her own dog,

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.940
or her own child. This implies a similar level
of attachment to both the dog and the child,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.210
and could explain why we really do treat dogs
like part of our families … we think they

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
are! &gt;&gt;In fact, in this study there were no
brain regions active when subjects viewed

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.440
photos of their own dog that were not also
activated by pictures of their own child.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.080
But before you go out and start a savings
account for your dog’s college education,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.030
there was a very important difference between
a mother’s response to her child, and response

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.450
to her dog. Areas of the midbrain associated
with the dopamine reward circuit were only

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.360
activated when a mother was looking at pictures
of her own child.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.910
These crucial brain areas, the substantia
nigra and ventral tegmental area, are swimming

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.800
in receptors for all the feel good molecules
associated with the feeling of being “in

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.850
love”: dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin.
Activation of this midbrain region is usually

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.590
associated with human pair-bonding, basically
love and romantic relationships, and dogs,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.440
just can’t turn it on.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.610
So you love your dog, but you’re not “in
love” with them. and as a person not unfamiliar

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.520
with unrequited love, I thought Id ask: How
does your DOG feel about all this?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.260
Turns out, our dogs don’t necessarily reciprocate
our feelings. In an article published in Applied

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.299
Animal Behavior Science, and titled “I like
my dog, does my dog like me?” scientists

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.579
used the Monash Dog Owner Relationship Scale
(yep thats a thing) to determine that owners

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.650
who interact more frequently with their dog,
have dogs showing more affectionate, proximity-seeking

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.200
behaviour and this might be due to more positive
reinforcement of close interaction by the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.690
owner. Not any emotional attachment on the
part of the dog.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.249
The study concludes “there is no support
from this study for the view that the strength

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:40.499
of the relationship an owner feels to his/her
dog is mirrored in the strength of the bond

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.799
of the dog to its owner”. In other words,
you can’t force your dog to love you back.

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.900
But a day at a doggy spa probably wouldn’t
hurt.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.709
