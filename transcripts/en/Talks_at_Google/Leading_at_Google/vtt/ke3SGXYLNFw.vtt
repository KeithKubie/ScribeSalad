00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: And today I have the honor to
be seeing of introducing our speaker, who

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.230
along with being an accomplished business
leader, an author, happened to be my uncle,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:24.161
and a darned good one at that.

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.161
[laughter]

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:26.161
Jack is here today to speak about his book,
"Lessons on Leadership", which he wrote in

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.161
order to help pass on leadership skills that
he learned during his career at Coca-Cola

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.161
and Revlon.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.119
Jack started his career at Coca-Cola in 1979.
He represented the company to Wall Street

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.130
and led the team responsible for planning
and acquisitions.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.960
At just 36, Jack became CFO of the company.
He had become responsible for all financial

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.300
strategies as a Coca-Cola employee.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.300
Jack moved on to become president and COO
of Coca-Cola worldwide and served in this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.300
position until 2001.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.570
Next, Jack took the position of president
and CEO of Revlon, where he was able to use

00:00:48.570 --> 00:01:00.710
his key understanding of branding and his
relationship to consumers to improve market

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.190
share, reduce debt, and position the company
for continued profitability.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:21.050
Jack currently serves on many boards, including
Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, The Boys &amp; Girls

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.450
Clubs of America, and The United Negro College
Fund.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.460
Jack's book, "Lessons on Leadership: The 7
Fundamental Management Skills for Leaders

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:38.540
at All Levels", was published in 2007 and
will be the basis for his talk today.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.545
I think the eighth published skill may have
been knowing when to shut up. So, I'm gonna

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:40.545
go ahead and pass it on to Jack.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:41.545
[applause]

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.700
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Thank you all very much. It's
my honor to be here today.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.180
I'm humbled in thinking about the fact that,
while I was at Coca-Cola for over 20 years,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.490
and I thought of Coca-Cola as a very big,
very global company, I realized it took Coca-Cola

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.430
120 years to be a 20 billion dollar company
-- something that your company did in only

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.890
nine years.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.580
So, that's quite an amazing achievement and
I suspect the parallel between the two companies

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.470
is inside of each, there are some great leaders
at all levels of both companies.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.160
And what I'd like to do today is, perhaps,
provide a framework for thinking about leadership.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.620
Whether or not you manage people, it doesn't
really matter.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.170
Some of you might manage projects, you might
manage functions, you might manage a portion

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.420
of a project, or a customer relationship,
and I think leadership skills, in a framework

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.340
for thinking about leadership applies across
all of those ways of doing business.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.520
So, that's what I'd like to share with you
today. And

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.820
[pause]

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.160
to do that, let me ask a question. And I'm
just gonna take a quick poll.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.980
How many of you would think that, as you think
about leaders that you know that are effective,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.750
maybe it's your boss or a peer, it might have
been a parent or friend, how many of you would

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.560
say that leadership is something that you're
born with, itâ€™s an attribute that you inherited

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.960
in some fashion, versus a skill that can be
learned?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.870
I'm curious to how you would think about that.
How many of you think of leaders as being

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.599
born and have those skills?

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.270
OK. And those of you who think of it as a
set of skills that can be learned over a period

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.470
of time?

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.900
Well, I can go home. This is a very easy talk
at this moment.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.900
[laughter]

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.120
Normally, people tend to think of leadership
as something that is born or inherited.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.430
I happen to believe, based on working with
people for over 30 years, that you can think

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.020
of leadership as a flow of very concrete actions
that over time, can help you lead effectively

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.410
and move an organization, or a function, or
a relationship, in a positive direction.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.930
And if you do those series of actions well,
when things get crazy, you can be the emotional

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.239
touchstone. You can be the center for what
your organization, or your function, is trying

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.239
to do.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.659
So, I'm gonna walk you through just one framework
that I have found has been useful to me over

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:29.249
a long period of time. And that framework
starts with setting a compelling destination

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:38.620
for your organization, developing a strategy
and a plan, a lot of emphasis on communication,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.480
a focus on management routines, which are
important in getting things done in a project

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.870
environment, or in any role; execution, being
visible for your people and then developing

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.740
the organization that you are responsible
for.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.279
And I'm gonna try to provide some anecdotes
from Coca-Cola and from Revlon.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:03.250
Now remember, when you hear my Coca-Cola stories,
this is from the company and the person that

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.449
was very involved in developing New Coke about
20 years ago, which was probably the biggest

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.189
new product disaster in the history of mankind.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.749
So, everything I say, you're gonna have to
take with a slight grain of salt.

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.939
But there are some learnings, even in that.

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.800
So, this is the framework that I'm gonna walk
through.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.650
And I'll start with setting a compelling destination
for your organization.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.150
I was interested to read, when I did a Google
search on Google, about your destination,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.749
which was set out by your founders of organizing
and making useful and accessible the world's

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.669
information. And I can think about working
here and having that being something that

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.289
would pull me in a positive direction towards
trying to make a contribution to the growth

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.569
of the company.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.430
And I think in so many worlds, whether it's
a religious environment, or a business environment,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.469
people want something bigger to point to.

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.300
And I'll give you some examples of my own
past.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.690
At Coca-Cola, we were looking for a way--
mind you, Coca-Cola had a very strong market

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.849
share position, like a 45 percent share of
market, as Google has a strong position today--

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:25.750
but we wanted to move that up dramatically.
And, at one point in the mid-90s, we set a

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.409
destination for creating what we called a
360 degree Coca-Cola landscape.

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.610
To some of you, that sounds a little bit bold
and audacious; maybe a little bit obnoxious.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.249
But if you're in the beverage business and
you're trying to grow it, the notion was having

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:48.651
Coca-Cola be available within an arm's reach
of desire, having the brand be preferred by

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:54.649
consumers all around the world, and having
the price and value of the product be right

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:59.159
in consumer's minds, whether you were in New
York City or in Beijing.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:05.369
The price and value had to be right and had
to be affordable. So, setting a 360 degree

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:11.029
Coca-Cola landscape became the goal, became
the objective of our business in the United

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.379
States.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.689
And I would suggest to you that in any role,
or any function, managing a project, managing

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:23.310
a customer relationship, to the extent that
you can set a goal, a destination that means

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.479
something to the people that you're working
with; you'll get there that much faster.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:33.159
I was amazed when we set this destination.
We actually had a little mural done, -it was

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:39.289
kind of corny at the time, a little painting
that actually pictured a Coca-Cola landscape,

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:46.610
with people and teenagers walking around with
various Coca-Cola products and Coca-Cola was

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.399
an important part of the community, doing
the right thing around the world.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:55.309
And it was amazing how many people had this
up in their offices as a way of reminding

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:59.969
them where the company was going. So, an important
part.

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:05.849
At Revlon, which was a bankrupt company when
I got there about eight years ago, we set

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:12.210
a destination that was meant to be compelling,
which was delivering the promise of beauty.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.860
And beauty, to our customers, to women, means
so many different things, both physical and

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.110
emotional.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.640
And the promise of beauty meant delivering
profits to our retail customers, whether it

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.499
be drug stores, or Wal-Mart, or whoever sold
cosmetics, and to our shareowners.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.960
So, this was our destination that we set for
ourselves in the beauty business.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.089
And again, it's amazing how people rallied
around setting a destination which they found

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:42.539
compelling.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.639
So, I think the first building block for strong
leadership in any function is to think about

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:51.569
how you set that for the activities that you're
part of in the organization, that you're part

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:52.569
of or leading.

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:57.190
[pause]

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.589
I'm curious. In the roles that you play, how
many of you are actually managing people versus

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:06.620
performing a function, or managing, say, a
customer relationship? Do many of you have

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.110
actually people management responsibilities?

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.860
OK. And to any of you, have any of you had
experience, or have you experimented with

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.220
setting a destination for your own functions
or organizations that meant something to you.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.000
Is that something you've done? I'm just curious.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.380
&gt;&gt;audience #1: Sure. Yes.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.980
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK. What's your function?

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.980
&gt;&gt;audience #1: I'm an account executive working
with customers and inside teamsâ€¦

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.980
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Okay.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980
&gt;&gt;audience #1: driving against a main objective
across [inaudible] trying to focus onâ€¦

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.980
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Okay.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.839
&gt;&gt;audience #1: how much of a [inaudible]

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:39.910
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:47.550
So, having a destination and then quantifying
it makes it more real for your team and, very

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.680
good.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.290
Any other experiences in setting destinations
that have been useful to anybody? I'm curious

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.449
about your own experiences. Yes.

00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:08.420
&gt;&gt;audience #2: We have [inaudible] and share
our personal objectives.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.709
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK.

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:15.000
&gt;&gt;audience #2: [inaudible]

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.490
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Great. Beautiful. Good.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.230
I think those can be very powerful.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:31.920
The next question, OK, once you've got a destination,
great leaders always are very thoughtful about

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.540
the pathways, the strategies in other words,
to get there.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.310
And I'm gonna use a very historical example,
and that's Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:48.920
invented the automobile for all intents and
purposes. He mass-produced it and his strategy

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.079
was to make the automobile affordable. And
that's how he thought he could grow the industry.

00:10:56.079 --> 00:11:03.839
And the way he got there was mass production.
That became an important, strategic tool for

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:08.579
him. And the old saying went, "You can have
any color Ford you want as long as it's black."

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:10.269
[laughter]

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:16.790
And he got people with an affordable car;
it built the industry, and the rest is history.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:23.139
But he was very strategic about using mass
production as a way of building his particular

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:29.699
industry. And I think setting strategies,
or pathways, are important for any leader

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:32.079
in any function.

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:38.920
So, the beauty of a clear strategy is everybody
in your organization can understand it, they

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.910
can get their arms around it and it allows
them to prioritize; it allows them to stop

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:52.180
doing stuff that isn't on the strategy. And
I would ask you, as leaders, are you being

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.180
clear enough about what the strategies, or
the pathways, are that you want to follow

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.670
for your area of responsibility? Yes.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:08.069
&gt;&gt;audience #3: How do you galvanize people
[inaudible]

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:14.949
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: When I use the word "galvanize"
there, and I'll go back to the Coca-Cola example,

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:22.790
we had set a destination of a 360 degree Coca-Cola
landscape. We had three key strategies for

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:31.269
getting there and it was so simple. It was
the three "A's". Affordability of the product,

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:37.470
acceptability of the product--meaning the
brand was loved-- and availability of the

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.410
product, which meant we wanted the product
within arm's reach of desire.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:49.029
So, those three "A's", affordability, acceptability,
and availability. If an action wasn't tied

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:55.850
to one of those three A's, then you were expected
to deprioritize it. So, all the energy was

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.040
pointed in those directions.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.160
&gt;&gt;audience #3: [inaudible]

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.279
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Galvanize is -- you could think
about it as focus. That's my way of saying

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:07.110
focus, I guess.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.959
Does the word mean something different to
you in that context? Did it trigger something

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:12.600
for you? What was in your head? I'm curious.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.000
&gt;&gt;audience #3: [inaudible]

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.279
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Ah. Are you a scientist?

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.089
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Most of us are.

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:23.740
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK. Well, let's use your word.
What's your name?

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.790
&gt;&gt;audience #3: Alexander.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:30.029
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Alexander's point was galvanize
is, in scientific work-- terms, the attraction

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:31.959
of chemicals to--

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:34.640
&gt;&gt;audience #3: An electrode.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.459
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: An electrode. And this is attracting
people's energy to a set of focus priorities.

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:46.149
So it is, I think, very similar. Thank you
for that.

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:49.699
But then the question becomes, are you, as
leaders, making those tough choices?

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:55.149
When I got to Revlon, the company was basically
broken and bankrupt. There was a lot of money

00:13:55.149 --> 00:14:00.699
to be made serving men, with men's products.
People believed that men's cosmetics was gonna

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:02.439
be the next great thing.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:07.240
We had to get it right with women first or
we were not gonna be able to pay the bills.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.000
Or, somebody here said "we're not gonna be
able to afford the cookies." We had to get

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.810
it right by focusing on men and galvanizing
energy around focusing on women.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.040
Any other questions or comments on this? Yes.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.920
&gt;&gt;audience #4: [inaudible]

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:34.529
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Could you say that just a little
bit louder?

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:41.980
&gt;&gt;audience #4: How much of what you have said
assumes that the person who has good quality

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:49.149
strategy has a position of authority in the
organization versus [inaudible] without necessarily

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:51.899
having a position of authority?

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:55.129
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah. I think both models work.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:15:03.800
I tend to think of this as situations where
you have ownership for some level of work

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.759
or activity, without necessarily positional
authority.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:14.699
So, for example, if you're on a customer team
and you've got a customer relationship that

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:22.339
is a ten million dollar business today, you
believe it can be a 20 million dollar business

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:29.231
and you go about setting pathways to get there;
that's not necessarily positional authority

00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:34.680
and you may have coworkers that can help deliver
against that 20 million dollar goal, but I

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.259
don't think it requires positional authority.

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:42.110
I think it requires ownership of an activity
more than positional authority. Does that

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.110
address your question?

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.089
So, I do think it's broader than a traditional
hierarchy.

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:50.699
[pause]

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:59.899
Any other comments or questions, thoughts
or reactions, here? OK.

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:07.529
And then, with a strategy in mind, what about
quantifying it? I'm sometimes embarrassed

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.420
to talk about this number, but I will anyway.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.459
[laughter]

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:19.550
When I was asked to run the North American
business, and this was in the mid-90s at Coca-Cola,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:27.269
people were actually drinking 400 drinks per
person per year of Coca-Cola products.

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:33.579
And I can see the reactions in terms of health
and wellness and the concerns. And those are

00:16:33.579 --> 00:16:37.329
very fair and we did react to that and I'll
talk about that in a moment.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:43.040
But we were in the business of selling beverages.
And we thought to ourselves, "If it's 400

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.890
today, where can it be in the future?" We
did some analytics and we found out that it

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:59.050
was 400 overall, but believe it or not, it
was 750 in certain parts of southern Mississippi.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.949
And it was 675 in North Dakota, believe it
or not.

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:08.720
So we started asking ourselves the question,
"If it's 400 on average, but there are places

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.700
where it's much higher, there must be places
where it's much lower, like Southern California

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:20.770
for one reason or another. If we can get the
75 up to 300, and the 300 up to 550, then

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.490
overall, let's set a target of 600 drinks
per person."

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.420
And the organization looked at us like we
were crazy. There had been about 50 of us

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:35.830
who had developed this goal, but once we had
set that goal, we went about setting the clear

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:42.070
strategies and tactics to get us there and
it required us to introduce juices and healthier

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:48.090
products and waters and teas and ready-to-drink
coffees, and a whole host of vitamin enriched

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.510
products.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:56.960
And sure enough, seven years later, we didn't
make the 600, but we made 550 up from 400.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.900
And only by setting a very aggressive target,
did it force a different set of conversations

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.701
amongst our team about how to get there.

00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:11.450
It took more vending machines; it took a wider
range of products, mostly healthier products

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.720
than carbonated soft drinks.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.740
And I would ask you as leaders, are you setting
objectives that are stretched and aggressive

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.280
enough to force a different set of thinking,
different questioning of assumptions that

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.700
can help propel your organization, or your
function, forward?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:38.340
And I think it's critical to creating growth
and value.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.860
Any questions or comments on this one, because
oftentimes this creates a little bit of angst

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:50.690
about the idea of over-pushing an organization
or a group of people and it can create a fair

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:56.000
number of questions sometimes. You're a salesperson.
Typically, it's the salesperson who jumps

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
at me at this point.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[laughter]

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.370
&gt;&gt;audience #5: [inaudible]

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.540
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK, fair enough.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.440
&gt;&gt;audience #5: [inaudible]

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.180
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: We had to think outside the
box, exactly. Yes.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:16.000
&gt;&gt;audience #6: Will the sales of the [inaudible]

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:30.210
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah. Alexander's question was,
and underneath it really, maybe would you

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:39.340
be better off targeting 550 and achieving
550, than setting such a stretch goal?

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:49.160
For me, it was never â€“ it was never -- if
we'd set it at 1300, or 1100, or even 900,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:55.860
it wouldn't have seemed credible, but something
that was big enough to create a different

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.520
dialogue, a different conversation.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520
Go ahead.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.820
&gt;&gt;audience #5: In other words, if you had
set 650, you would have achieved 600?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:13.400
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Oh, I think we probably maxed
it out, but I think my fear when setting objectives

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.120
is if you don't set them aggressively enough,
you don't force different enough conversations.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.950
And people will go about with their same patterns
of growing the business, or dealing with customers,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.340
or thinking about how they develop code.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:34.290
Only by setting a more aggressive target,
can you help force people's thinking into

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:40.440
different pathways. So that's why I think
the numbers are so important. Yes.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.710
&gt;&gt;audience #6: So different organizations
look at stretched goals differently. People

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:52.160
get nervous about it
[inaudible] trust ourselves. Another looks

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.220
at it as a challenge and something to strive
for.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.040
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.890
&gt;&gt;audience #6: So is there anything else [inaudible]

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:11.530
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right. Well, I think to get
to 600, we had to say to the organization,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:17.010
"We're willing to invest another 500 million
dollars in vending machines," for example.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.060
We had to say that we were willing to build
up our new product development department

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:27.880
dramatically. So they knew that Coca-Cola
was willing to invest behind that goal.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.920
And the other thing we did was, we said, "Look,
we're gonna set our compensation systems up

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.740
in a way where if you get to 550 over a six
or seven year period of time, you're gonna

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.900
be rewarded for that. You're not gonna get
hit on the head for falling short of what

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.460
seemed like a very aggressive goal."

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.190
So I think it's a combination of resources
and how you set the compensation systems that

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:57.460
were important. Does that address your question?

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.350
&gt;&gt;audience #6: [inaudible]

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:11.290
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK. I'm gonna speak to that
directly in just a few minutes, but it did

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.990
start with the strategies that got us here.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.940
I got input from probably 6000 people as a
leader. I travelled to every location in the

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.080
United States. I was on every shop floor,
as an example. I met with every salesperson

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.690
in one form or another and it was, literally,
a two-way dialogue that shaped the strategies

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.690
to get there.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.270
So, it did start with that.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.270
Yes.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:42.110
&gt;&gt;audience #7: [inaudible]

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:55.000
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah. The question was, how
did we decide, at Coca-Cola, to go from carbonated

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.850
soft drinks into a newer product like water?

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:05.070
It was grounded in consumer research. People,
even 15 years ago, were increasingly calorie

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.260
conscious. They were increasingly aware of
ingredients that were listed on the package.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:16.440
We can see trends in other parts of the world.
We spent a lot of time, for example, in the

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:23.310
Japanese soft drink market. If the US had
this much variety, the Japanese market had

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.730
15 times the amount of variety.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:32.030
And we began to see the consumer wanting more
products on the shelves and in-and-out products

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.620
and more excitement.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.330
And it told us to we had to extend the product
line and water seemed like, from a research

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.450
standpoint, the biggest market segment that
was first available to us.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.450
Yes.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.880
&gt;&gt;audience #8: As a publically traded company,
how do you balance that stretched goal and

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:53.930
if it's out there in the world and you over-hit
by 50, all the analysts say you failed and

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.030
your stocks go through the floor? How do you
manage that? What's public and what's private?

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.900
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: It's a great question.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:07.340
I was always a believer that the external
communication needed to be consistent with

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.040
the internal communication.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:16.760
While we might not have been quite as specific,
we might have said, "OK, 600 drinks inside;

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.290
we wanna get there by the year 1999," as an
example.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.870
With the three street, we would have said
over the next seven to ten years, we wanna

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.870
get to 600 drinks per person per year.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:35.830
So, we were somewhat less specific so it didn't
turn into earnings guidance and quite as specific

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:40.410
as that, but we were pretty clear that this
is where we going and it was gonna drive our

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.420
strategies and behaviors at Coca-Cola.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.420
So, it is a balance, 'cause you don't wanna
get over your tips with Wall Street, but at

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:54.170
the same time, people need to hear the same
stuff wherever they go in terms of where the

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.730
company was going. So, we tended to over communicate,
is the real answer.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.730
Yes.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:17.790
&gt;&gt;audience #9: I had a question where you
talk about a stretch in the organization.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.990
Basically [ ]

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.600
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:41.870
&gt;&gt;audience #9: So your role is to sell more
of the same than you did [inaudible]

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.760
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:53.030
Well, we did and we talked about other lines
of business that were in the refreshment business:

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:58.620
snacks, candies. Pepsi was in the snack food
business, for example.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.400
But when we looked and did the analysis internally,
we saw that in our core strength, which was

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.650
beverages, at the core, carbonated beverages,
but then broadening, there was opportunities

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.150
if you broke the market down in bite-size
chunks.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.160
And it said "let's stay close to home and
let's stay focused on what we can do best

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.130
and that's gonna carry us for another 15 years."
It was a conscious decision to stay a little

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.690
bit closer in.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.810
[pause]

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:35.110
OK. And then, I'm sure a lot of you have seen
different models for thinking about how to

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.240
develop a plan.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:43.980
This is just a simple framework that I have
found useful over a period of time.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.860
If you're going to 600 drinks, what are the
assets that you have to work with? Well, you

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.510
have a great brand. You have customer relationships.
You've got a great employee base.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:59.550
What are the action steps? Well, for us, it
was availability, affordability, acceptability.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.380
Who has to do what? What were the barriers?
That's very important.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.030
We realized we didn't have a great, new product
development department. We realized we didn't

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.000
have enough vending machines on the street.
We didn't have enough sales people calling

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.100
on stores across the United States.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:21.600
Those were barriers we had to address in the
strategy. How can you overcome those barriers?

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.070
And sometimes they're simple.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:30.030
At Revlon, we were trying to strengthen the
workforce and just by walking around the building

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:37.510
one day, I walked into the head of staffing
and I said, "Well, are we hiring good marketing

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:42.281
people?" And she said, "We can't." I said,
"What's the barrier?" She said, "Well, we

00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:45.740
don't have enough good recruiting materials."

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.360
And I went back to my office and I made copies
of five different analystsâ€™ reports who

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.710
said Revlon was gonna turn the company around,
and I said, "OK, here's some materials."

00:27:54.710 --> 00:28:00.610
And just understanding the barriers that your
folks are facing and helping to try to solve

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.200
those problems as a leader can help get you
there.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.310
And just listening to the challenges and the
problems.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.460
And then finally, what do you expect to get
back in terms of financial and marketplace

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:18.600
results? So, overall, just a very basic strategy
model.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.900
Any thoughts or comments in response to that?
OK.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.900
[pause]

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.900
&gt;&gt;presenter: Jack?

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.900
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yes.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: The folks in VC can't hear just
from the camera.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.930
Can you talk in front of the mic, unfortunately?

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:35.230
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK, sure. OK, this goes back
to your question about communication.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.700
[pause]

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.330
And can you all hear me? OK, great.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:50.890
And communication is such an important part
of the process, and I like to say as a leader,

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.320
particularly in a change environment.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.670
When things are broken, or you're trying to
build something for the first time, whatever

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:02.210
you think is required in terms of the amount
of communication you're doing, double it and

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.710
then double it again.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:09.490
And there are enough math majors in the room
who can do that math and all of a sudden your

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:15.000
multiples, in terms of your communication
effort beyond what you thought was necessary

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.810
to move your organization, and it is just
the nature of people.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.880
To your point earlier, how did you motivate
the organization?

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.450
When I went to Revlon, again, which was a
company in trouble -- not Google, a company

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:38.530
that's going from great to greater -- I made
it a point of every week, writing a letter

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.190
myself that went to five thousand people.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:49.880
And then, every week I would get on a global
teleconference call and take any questions

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.680
in response to that letter about the progress
of the company, where Revlon was being successful

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.280
with retailers, our new products, where they
were working, where they weren't.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.520
And just spend an inordinate amount of time
talking about the progress of our change pattern.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.660
And as a leader, I think that's the kind of
effort that's required, particularly when

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:16.610
you're on a rapid growth curve, or you're
trying to change an overall environment.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:22.580
And I would encourage you to think about your
own level of communication as leaders with

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:28.260
your team, with your customers, and is it
adequate for the environment that you're operating

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.900
in, and given the goals that you're trying
to achieve?

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:38.340
Any questions or comments about communication,
generally, or my point about what at least

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.670
I believe is required?

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.670
Yes.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.680
&gt;&gt;audience #10: Did you ever go out on your
own after this and then just kind of spot

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.920
check and see if the average employee was
getting that message?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:53.730
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: I did. And I'll make the point
in a moment, but I set a goal at Revlon to

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:59.151
try to have at least one hundred one-on-one
conversations a week.

00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:02.990
[laughter]

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:08.310
And whether that was in the elevator, or in
the parking lot, and I'm not talking about

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:13.460
being part of a larger meeting, or even a
scheduled meeting, but at least a hundred

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.770
unscheduled conversations a week.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.610
And if a work day is five days, it's 20 a
day.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:24.600
And if it's stopping someone in the elevator
and saying, "OK, tell me what you do, what

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.760
challenges are you experiencing? Are there
things that you think I should be doing differently

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.590
as your leader?"

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:37.110
And that was one way of spot-checking to your
question about what messages were and weren't

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.110
getting through.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:42.190
And it's amazing what didn't get through for
as much as we tried to communicate.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.190
Yes.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:49.010
&gt;&gt;audience #11: [inaudible]

00:31:49.010 --> 00:32:03.030
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah, yeah. I found you almost
couldn't do too much.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.830
And the problem is it takes, as a leader,
it takes a lot of energy.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:12.460
Many of us are social people by nature and
some aren't. But even if you're a very social

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:19.030
person by nature, having a hundred conversations
a week just tires you out, believe it or not.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.360
It can give you energy on one hand, and tire
you out. But I think most organizations that

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.610
are, if we said we're going to 600 at Coca-Cola,
or if at Revlon, we said we're gonna deliver

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:35.810
the promise of beauty and save the company
from bankruptcy, you couldn't over communicate.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.760
It had to be part of what you did every single
day. 'Cause you would find people wouldn't

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:44.730
understand. Someone was writing that the company
was in trouble, or an analyst would say that

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:50.630
our new products and lipstick and cosmetics
weren't working. And you had to be constantly

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.990
reinforcing what was working and what wasn't
working.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.080
[pause]

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:02.910
Any of you been in tough environments and
have seen the power of communication? Or any

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:08.280
examples that you all would want to provide
that might be useful? Anything that jumps

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.300
out where you've seen that work or not work?

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.800
[pause]

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800
Yes.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:23.160
&gt;&gt;audience #12: [inaudible]

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:32.530
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:34:09.990
&gt;&gt;audience #12: [inaudible] -- And just that
one communication from one person changed

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.990
the morale so much.

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.990
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.990
&gt;&gt;audience #12: [inaudible]

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.990
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: That's great.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.990
&gt;&gt;audience #12: [inaudible]

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.990
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Terrific example.

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.990
Yes.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:31.280
&gt;&gt;audience #13: I'm in [inaudible] and I am
constantly trying to look at a calendar trying

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:56.671
to figure out how to fit in every single meeting
that you're talking about communication with

00:34:56.671 --> 00:34:57.671
all hands, sending e-mails, meeting people
in person, meeting with groups o f people

00:34:57.671 --> 00:34:58.671
in person, doing all these things. And I guess
my question is, how do you fit it all in?

00:34:58.671 --> 00:34:59.671
How do you know which method is the best method?
Is it better to do all hands? Is it better

00:34:59.671 --> 00:35:00.671
to do all one-on-one? Really, what's going
to work the best? Because it doesn't seem

00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:01.671
like there's going to be enough time to do
all of these things.

00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:02.671
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right. OK.

00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:03.671
Well, and I'm gonna speak to that in a minute
because I think begins to get to, as a leader,

00:35:03.671 --> 00:35:08.200
how do you organize your own time and how
do you maximize your own effectiveness.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:15.480
And part of it is, I think, the routines that
you set up for yourself. What do you look

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480
at?

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.070
How frequently? A weekly meeting, a monthly
meeting, a routine report, and getting those

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:29.560
routines set up that cover the things that
are important to your business that are strategic.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.360
If you get those routines set up properly,
itâ€™s amazing how much time frees up for

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.440
you to be more flexible to communicate on
a broader fashion about what's happening in

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440
your organization.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.970
So, part of it is around organizing your time.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.360
And I think part of it is just listening to
your organization, letting them give you feedback

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.240
for what tools are working or not as a communication
effort.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.360
And sometimes, you have to adjust.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:02.000
At Revlon, we did quarterly updates and we
got feedback that they didn't want to hear

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.520
from me. They wanted to hear success stories
from people that were actually making things

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.440
happen in different parts of the company.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.820
I got off the stage. All I would do was introduce
two or three people and they would talk about

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.810
how they made a sales call that worked, or
they developed a new lipstick that sold like

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:21.450
crazy, or they developed a market in Asia,
and we shared success stories.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.680
It gave people hope, but we were getting feedback
about the nature of our communication and

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.930
then we were adjusting constantly.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.580
So, I think that helps to prioritize.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.530
Yes.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:58.550
&gt;&gt;audience #14: From sales, we sell a range
of products to people and I think each product

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.010
team here has a leader and those leaders communicate
to the sales team. So in that sense --

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.010
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.010
&gt;&gt;audience #14: [inaudible] Do you ever see
a situation like that happening [inaudible]

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.250
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah. I've seen that often with
sales teams, because they've got external

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.960
pressures that are real--they're called customers.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:15.300
And making sure that you're listening to your
sales leadership about what works for them

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:21.310
and what routines work for them and what don't,
I think is very important.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:27.710
Because you want those people out selling
as opposed to necessarily only being focused

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.710
on internal communication.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.030
So, I think it comes back to, again, a matter
of listening and just recognizing the importance

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:39.010
of that external pressure that that salesperson
is facing and making adjustments.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.540
Did you have something in mind when you were
thinking about that?

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.540
&gt;&gt;audience #14: No. I think we're working
on ways to get those various teams in line

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.540
and streamline that communication. It's just
that it's hard to know which products are

00:37:43.540 --> 00:38:02.030
going to be the right ones to push sometimes.
[inaudible] It's almost like setting up a

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:09.720
system where they all communicate together.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.360
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: I think there's probably no
single solution that works and it is sometimes

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.400
just trial and error.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.570
[pause]

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:26.380
And this comes back to your question about
how do you make it all work given the time

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.710
pressures.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:36.450
And I am really a big believer in regularizing--that's
probably not a word-- but setting routines

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.300
around what it is we do as leaders.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.390
And I'll give you an example.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:46.600
At Revlon, when I went to the company, I would
walk around drug stores to see the cosmetics

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.051
products on displays in a Walgreens, or a
CVS, or wherever we were.

00:38:51.051 --> 00:38:56.570
And it was obvious that the different functions
in the company were not talking to each other.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.260
And I found myself having a series of one-off
meetings with sales, making sure they were

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:06.600
talking to marketing about what products were
coming out and operations, and my day was

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.751
becoming jammed with one-off meetings.

00:39:09.751 --> 00:39:16.170
I finally set up, on Monday morning at 7:30,
a meeting with sales, new product development,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:21.770
operations, finance, where we talked about
the new products that were coming out for

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.990
the next month, the next quarter, and over
the remainder of the year.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.900
And who had responsibility for the product,
and what had to happen with sales and promotional

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.780
material for the product to make it to the
customer on time.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:40.180
And only by setting up those regular meetings
did we get the right people in the room and

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.660
it tended to minimize the amount of problems
and crises that we were dealing with. Stuff

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.470
was happening real-time in the room, cross-functionally.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:55.720
And so, being thoughtful about your control
systems, what you look at as a leader, the

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.730
information that you see, the meetings that
you participate in, all can I think buy you

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:05.110
time to have real impact on your organization.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.100
[pause]

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.190
Any thoughts or comments, reactions to this
as you think about your own time in trying

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.450
to maximize your own impact?

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.150
[pause]

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:21.550
OK. Yes.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:29.660
&gt;&gt;audience #15: [inaudible]

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:40.480
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah. Yeah.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:46.260
I was in a business, the cosmetics business,
or the beauty business, new products are very,

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.260
very important.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.050
At least 20 to 25 percent of your business
each year comes from products that weren't

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.510
on the shelf six months ago.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:41:00.570
And you had to be fast in seeing a consumer
need, getting a product developed, whether

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:05.560
it be a face make-up, or a nail enamel, and
you had to be prepared to get it out the door

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.550
as fast as you could.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:15.220
My experience was having the right routines,
while they can be boring and repetitive, if

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:21.230
you've got all the cross-functional people
in the room, make it up every week, and you're

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:25.960
looking each person in the eye; the salesperson,
OK, "what issues do you see? What are we missing?"

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.940
And you get problems surfaced early, and then
you can agree to follow up on that over the

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.810
course of the next week and take action and
then see if it happened.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:41.360
If you can pull out from people what's causing
the issues, while it's tedious and time-consuming,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.310
you're gonna pull months out of the new product
development process, for example.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:51.790
And so, I think these control systems, or
management routines, are critical. I think,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:57.600
to actually, speeding up time as opposed to
slowing it down, at least based on the businesses

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.230
that I've been a part of.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.650
Excuse me.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:07.760
Any other thoughts or questions on that one?
Comments?

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.530
OK. Execution. Leaders are sometimes taught,
well, they should operate at the strategic

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:15.869
level.

00:42:15.869 --> 00:42:22.580
I think the best leaders that I've seen operate
at all levels, and they are very situational

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.540
in deciding where to spend their time and
energy.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.770
I'm gonna give you an example.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:36.090
At one point at Coca-Cola, I was responsible
for taking the company public and I had to

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.130
develop what's called an offering circular.
It's about a 300-page document that investors

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.130
read.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:46.890
We were taking a bottling company public in
Canada. And you had to get this document done.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:52.980
It describes the company, the financials,
the products, the system, and I was supposed

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.590
to get it done with the help of the lawyers,
the accountants, the tax people.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.450
And I would call up the lawyers and say, "OK,
is your section done?" "Yeah, it's coming

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.230
along."

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:06.800
And I'd call up the tax people, "How's your
section coming? You got pages 32 through 60."

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.210
"Yeah, it's good. We'll be there."

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.950
And my boss came into the room one night.
He said, "Well, let's see your document."

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:17.150
And we had about 20 people sitting around
the table. And he gets to the first page of

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.170
the document, and mind you, we were taking
this company public; it's gonna be a new company

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:25.090
based in Canada, and he turns to the first
page and he says, "What's the phone number

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.410
for the new company?"

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:31.110
And I said, "The phone number." And I thought,
"Oh, I guess it is gonna need a phone."

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.870
And I said, "Well, we'll get that done the
day before we file."

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:40.010
And he said, "Well, why don't you do today
what you can do today? You're gonna have a

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.930
lot to do the day before you file this document
with the government."

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:49.140
And at that point, I had this flash of pain
in my mind, thinking, "Oh my God, he's gonna

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:53.020
go through the whole document like this."
And we did.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.380
We were there till 2:30 in the morning. There
were 267 holes in the document like that,

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:03.160
starting with the phone number, the address,
certain financial data.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.619
And it told me, as a leader, and I was leading
that project, that I need not assume good

00:44:09.619 --> 00:44:12.560
execution by my teammates.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:18.290
Now, when I saw it demonstrated by the lawyers,
for example, or the tax people, I wouldn't

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.320
have to worry about them.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.390
But until I saw some evidence at ground level
that it was coming together, I was making

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.550
a big mistake. And I was convinced I was gonna
get fired.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:34.600
And we sat there till three in the morning,
the guy took me home, he dropped me at my

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.280
house, I thought that was my last day and
he looked at me and said, "You'll catch up.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.810
You're about two weeks behind, but you'll
catch up."

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:47.031
And he knew I was gonna experience that. He
just knew as a leader, I needed to learn the

00:44:47.031 --> 00:44:51.970
lesson about the importance of focusing on
the details.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:58.000
And I would just encourage you to think about
that. It's not just focusing strategically;

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.720
it is about knowing where to bore in and where
you can pull back.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:07.210
And you have to be able to judge both.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.210
Any comments on this one?

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:09.210
Yes, Alexander.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:20.420
&gt;&gt;audience #16: I notice over the years that
there's a problem with the level of commitment

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:31.300
among our staff. People grow until they hit
their level and then they stay at the position

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.800
for a long time [inaudible]. In the spirit
you have just describedâ€¦

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Right.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800
&gt;&gt;audience #16: How do you impart that in
the organization? How do you keep people aligned

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800
with their actual culpabilities?

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.190
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: I'm gonna speak to that in just
two clicks. It talks a little bit about people

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:44.720
development and it is thinking about how to
bundle those skills for people on a more systemic

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.700
basis. So if you'll allow me just a moment.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.290
[pause]

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:54.240
Another element of the framework we've talked
about, so I'm not gonna belabor it, the importance

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.650
of being visible.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:46:00.121
And I talked to you about a hundred one-on-one
conversations per week, and just setting a

00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:05.000
target for being in touch with the people
at all levels of your organization, and across

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.680
the organization.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.450
And setting yourself targets for doing that.

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:15.970
At Coca-Cola, when I was president of the
company, I kept a card in my pocket with the

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.531
company's hundred largest customers from around
the world.

00:46:18.531 --> 00:46:25.500
And I knew if I didn't call, at least try,
to call three every day -- I would, because

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.940
my goal was to try to get to each of these
top one hundred customers about six times

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.280
a year on the telephone.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.640
And I would just call and say, "What's happening?
How's Coca-Cola's service? How's the account

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.740
team servicing you? Anything I can do to be
helpful to you?"

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.520
It was a two-minute call. Sometimes, I'd learn
about something about their business where

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.740
we could create value for them, or a product.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:54.050
And so, being visible to your people, to your
team members, to other functions, to your

00:46:54.050 --> 00:47:01.460
customers, I think it's so important as a
leader, both learning and communicating what

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.790
you believe is important.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:12.400
OK, what about developing people? And I think
this speaks to your question, Alexander.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:19.869
I believe it's very important to demonstrate
to people that you, as a leader, particularly,

00:47:19.869 --> 00:47:28.900
this is a hierarchical point to your question
earlier, that you have people management responsibility.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.670
And I think to the extent that you can frame
up for your organization, and I understand

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:39.500
at Google, at some point you talk about universal
skills and you may or may not use that language

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:44.500
today, but what we tried to do at Coke was
develop something we called "core skills"

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:51.130
that are important across all functions, and
learning and questioning the environment around

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.130
you.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:57.580
Do you read? Are you out in the world? Are
you seeing data that you can then use to connect

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.550
to something that's important to you on the
job?

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.369
And asking questions about what's possible.

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:09.590
At Coke, the question was, why do we sell
600 drinks per person per year in Mississippi,

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:14.830
but it's only 77 in California as a whole?

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.481
And asking those questions that can point
you to opportunities. That's a core skill

00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:23.840
that I think is important in any environment,
whether you're coding, or whether or not you're

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:30.040
dealing with customers, or leading a marketing
operations team.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.270
Another important skill is developing a plan.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.859
We talked about a model to do that.

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:38.540
Focusing on the details is critical.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.481
And how is that lesson learned, as an example?

00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:46.400
I'll tell you how I learned it in addition
to the story that I told earlier.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:53.030
At one point, I was Coca-Cola's Chief Financial
Officer and I was going off to Vienna, Austria,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.890
to review business plans.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:00.850
I got to Vienna; I was scheduled to be there
for a week. I had a long flight. I was looking

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.161
forward to having a great dinner, and I got
to Vienna and I unpacked my suitcase and I

00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:09.090
had my shirts on the shelf and all my toilet
articles were stacked up and everything.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.520
I was looking forward to a nice dinner with
my colleagues and I got a call on the phone

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.430
from the chairman of the company.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:22.460
His name was Roberto Goizueta; very proper,
Cuban gentleman, actually. Ran the company

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.130
for about 20 years.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:29.680
And he said, "Jack, I just got a financial
report about Spain and the numbers are wrong."

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:37.590
I said, "Roberto, itâ€™s an internal company
report. I know there's an error. My team is

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:42.250
focused on it and I'll have an answer for
you when I get back a week from today."

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.420
And it was like he hadn't heard anything I
said. He said, "Jack. No, no, you don't understand.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.280
What plane are you coming back to Atlanta
on tomorrow morning?"

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.780
And I said, "Roberto, I'm here for a series
of budget meetings and I'll be back a week

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.390
from today."

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.050
And he said, "And what plane did you say you
were on tomorrow morning?"

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.050
[laughter]

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.800
And I said, "Well, I think there's a nine
o'clock."

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.740
So, I calmly got my shirts down off the shelf
and my toilet articles, packed them into my

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.610
little suitcase, told my colleagues I wasn't
going to be having dinner with them after

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.440
all and got on the plane the next morning.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:18.650
And he was reminding me about the importance
of detail, and getting it right, and getting

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:24.031
internal reports correct, or whether it was
that or calling on a customer, or a project

00:50:24.031 --> 00:50:27.190
that you might be working on. I learned that
lesson forever.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:34.920
I never wanted to have to repack my suitcase
and miss an important business trip, as an

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.920
example.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:43.260
And I think just looking for ways to remind
people about that skill and these other skills

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.260
are critical.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.510
It's constant reinforcement. It's constant
conversation with your people. It's asking

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:56.440
them about their challenges in these areas,
helping think through solutions. It's dialogue.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:02.580
And I think with that, you've got a much better
shot at developing an organization with core

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:08.260
skills that they can use in any environment,
whether it be at Google or somewhere else.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.280
And so, I think it's about conversation and
investing in your people. And people did it

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.180
for me and I learned and I make it a point
to do it with the people that I have responsibility

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.180
for.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:25.260
So, I think the most important thing is, in
building organizational capability, is dialogue

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.740
and being clear about what counts.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:34.540
Any reactions or thoughts to this one because
people development is so critical, particularly,

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.480
I would think, in an organization like this
one that's growing so fast and having capable

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.410
people to lead it, becomes increasingly critical.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.410
Any thoughts or, yes.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:52.460
&gt;&gt;audience #17: What would be your advice
for [inaudible]

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.070
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yeah.

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:55.130
&gt;&gt;audience #17: [inaudible]

00:51:55.130 --> 00:52:00.050
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: I have this conversation a lot
with people because I'm involved in a bunch

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.250
of different organizations.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:13.570
And my view is if your goal is to advance
in a business environment, let your focus

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.850
be one of skills orientation.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:23.610
And a lot of people have an orientation, "Gee,
I wanna get exposure to different marketplaces,

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.520
or different parts of the business."

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:32.690
My view has always been decide what skills
are important and find an area where you can

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:38.130
learn these core skills, or those that might
work at Google, or somewhere else, and find

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:42.430
people that are willing to invest in you and
have conversations about where you're getting

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.440
it right and where you can do it better.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.000
And then once you've learned these core skills,
you can take them anywhere.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.240
At an early point in my career, before I had
learned many of these skills, I was at Coke

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.170
in Atlanta and the thought was "you should
go international" and I was asked to go move

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:06.250
to Germany to be like the assistant controller.
I was like, 26 or 27. That was a big job for

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:09.630
me when I was 26 or 27.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:13.350
But the guy that I was working for in Atlanta
said, "Don't go to Germany. That person's

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.609
not gonna teach you those skills."

00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:21.540
And I got five or six different jobs in Atlanta,
and I moved very well. I made more than my

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.590
share of mistakes. He let me do that, as I
indicated.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:28.980
But I found I could take those skills out
of a financial environment and take them to

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.420
a general management role, running the US
business.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.180
I'm convinced if I'd focused on something
different than the core skills, and focused

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:43.210
on just exposure, exposure to Germany or a
different business unit, I'd still be in Germany

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:49.980
today as the number two controller person
in Germany, which for me would have been a

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.530
missed opportunity.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:57.380
So, for me, my experience and where I've seen
people move and create the most options is

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.900
decide what skills are important, who can
help me learn them, and stay where you get

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:07.580
the opportunities on projects, or different
roles to learn them, cause then it creates

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.580
options.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:13.240
So, that's just one perspective on it.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.470
[pause]

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:23.030
That really is the framework that I wanted
to share with you, from setting a destination

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:28.550
all the way through how to think about developing
your own people by setting a clear set of

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:33.869
expectations and investing in the dialogue
and conversation, but I really believe that

00:54:33.869 --> 00:54:38.440
this framework can be applied in a lot of
different environments.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.220
So, let me stop there and see if there are
any other questions that I could address,

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:46.570
or thoughts that you all would like to throw
out.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:47.570
Yes.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:54.190
&gt;&gt;audience #18: You mentioned ownership once.
Where does that fit in? In other words, assigning

00:54:54.190 --> 00:55:01.310
or trying to make sure that people own the
things that are important [inaudible]

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:08.020
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Well, I think that notion of
ownership is, in a sense, something you can

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:15.140
hire against and you're looking at wherever
I've been, whether I've been at Coca-Cola

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:21.640
or at Revlon, you're looking for people that
really felt very strongly about the work that

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.369
they did, or the projects that they had been
responsible for in the past.

00:55:27.369 --> 00:55:32.460
Could they give you examples of where they
really dug in and made things happen? Where

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:39.070
they focused on the details, where they set
a clear strategy and really felt like they

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:42.349
had the responsibility for the success or
failure of something.

00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:51.550
And I think that attitude and looking for
it as you recruit and give people more responsibility

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:56.920
is, I think, critical. Because I think if
people have that, and they have a set of core

00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.970
skills, that attitude, and those core skills,
I think chances are, they're gonna get off

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:05.151
to a reasonable start in most roles or most
environments.

00:56:05.151 --> 00:56:06.151
Bright people will and you all are bright.

00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:07.151
Yes.

00:56:07.151 --> 00:56:08.151
&gt;&gt;audience #19: So I was just curious how
[inaudible] I'm sure you got all the time

00:56:08.151 --> 00:56:11.800
offers to go other places to work. What [inaudible]
had you decide it was the right time to make

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:31.250
that move and why Revlon? Why did you go that
way? I'm sure you could find many other [inaudible]?

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:39.650
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: I felt, at Coca-Cola, I had
been part of a very big company and by the

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.320
time I left, the basic processes work.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.680
We had a planning process. We had ways of
calling on customers, and it wasn't all perfect.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:53.890
We made tons of mistakes, but all the basic
disciplines were pretty well defined.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:59.300
And what I wanted to do at the next stage
of my career was do something that was a little

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:04.700
bit more entrepreneurial and operate in a
place that all that stuff wasn't working.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.980
And I really wanted to see if I could help
create it and build it and help turn a company

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.410
around.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:12.970
So, it was about that kind of challenge for
me.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:16.660
It could have been in any industry. I just
happened to get a call about running a beauty

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:21.869
company, which seemed a little bit crazy and
I'm convinced at Coke, we always wore white

00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:25.670
shirts and blue shirts, the only reason this
guy hired me was because that day, I had a

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.640
particularly colorful shirt on. Otherwise,
he would have said, "No, no. He's a boring

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.160
soft drink guy. He can stay there."

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.440
For me, it was about being more entrepreneurial
at that stage of my career than I had been

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.190
up until that point. I thought it would be
interesting for me.

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:40.369
&gt;&gt;presenter: We have time for one more.

00:57:40.369 --> 00:57:57.690
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: OK. Yes.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:19.790
&gt;&gt;audience #20: So most of the things you
[inaudible] were about business management

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:20.790
and leadership. Do you think all these methods
in terms of Google is [inaudible]? Do you

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:21.790
think if you had Coca-Cola based [inaudible]?

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:27.200
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Well, I think when we made that
switch from high fructose corn syrup to sugar,

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:33.340
we viewed it as a very important part of the
formulation of Coca-Cola, but we did a tremendous

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:40.390
amount of research which said that both from
a health standpoint, a taste standpoint, even

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:47.099
a mouth feel standpoint, which is an important
part of a beverage, that the product was not

00:58:47.099 --> 00:58:52.390
differentiable; you couldn't really tell the
difference.

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:57.430
And the economics of high fructose corn syrup
were much better than refined sugar and so,

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:03.430
we thought, "OK, if we can adopt a lower cost
sweetener for our products, it gives us more

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:09.359
money to reinvest in the brands and create
more growth." And so, I know that there's

00:59:09.359 --> 00:59:11.980
some concerns today about HFCS--

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.590
&gt;&gt;audience #20: [inaudible]

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:17.650
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: but from a taste standpoint,
there is no fundamental difference.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.530
&gt;&gt;audience #20: [inaudible]

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:20.781
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: Yes.

00:59:20.781 --> 00:59:23.140
&gt;&gt;audience #20: You can't tell the difference?

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:28.960
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: No. And I can, just having been
in a beverage company for so many years, I

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.830
can virtually smell the difference between
Coke and Pepsi, for example.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:38.920
But I couldn't taste the difference between
sugar and high fructose corn syrup. I promise.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920
We could do it.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920
[laughter]

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.240
&gt;&gt;presenter: All right, well thank you very
much.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.400
&gt;&gt;Jack Stahl: All right. Thank you.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:45.619
