[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.934
EMMA SERLIN: So
today, the idea--

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.350
I'm going to tell
you a little bit

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.995
about the origins of
London Speech Workshop,

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:14.870
and also, the method.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.369
So we've got quite
a unique method

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.410
that we use with clients.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.660
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about how it came to be.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.190
And then what you
see here is a sample

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.510
of some of the kind of
work we do with clients.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.180
There's some tools that we
use-- a whole load of tools.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.840
So we're going to give you
one real concrete tool today,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.670
and we'll work
through, and probably

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.860
ask for a bit of
audience participation,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.420
and actually, one
volunteer as well.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.830
And then, the rest of
the time is all about

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.040
asking us questions.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.320
So any little communication,
niggle, or conundrum, or just

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.820
I'd really like another tool for
that, anything from meetings,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.616
to arguments, to getting
irritated by your boss

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.240
and you don't know
how to deal with it,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.680
just throw it at us, because
that's the really fun stuff.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.687
So you've got lots
of time for that.

00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:05.770
And this is, obviously,
Jamie, and I'm [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.645
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Hello.

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:07.530
EMMA SERLIN: Hello.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.300
So to begin, I set up London
Speech Workshop nine years ago.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.020
I was actually working as
a TV producer at the time,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.210
and realized I was
going to need some cash.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.090
I was designing all
these drama series ideas,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.190
and I put up three
ads on Gumtree.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.350
It started totally by
accident, is the idea.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.940
So I put three ads up on
Gumtree and thought, what

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.970
are the three things I can do?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.900
And bought domain named London
Speech Workshop, London Script

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.580
Workshop, and London
Acting Workshops.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.980
And not much creativity
went into it.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.890
And London Speech Workshop
was the one that took off.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.830
And I found myself with lots
of accent softening clients.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.930
So non-native
English speakers who

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.300
were wanting to feel more
confident communicating

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.710
in English.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.050
And when I began, it
was really generic,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.635
and I was doing
stuff out of a burk.

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:57.370
It wasn't very creative.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.380
And I honestly was wondering--

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.930
I had a philosophy degree, and
I'd won an award as a theater

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.221
director, and I was like what
am I doing telling people

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:06.090
where to put their
tongues in their mouths,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.660
like this is weird.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.840
And then one day it all changed.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.550
Literally in a eureka moment.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.510
I had a client called Damien.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.584
He was French and successful.

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.500
We were sitting there
and I was saying to him,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.970
you need to be able to find
yourself in these words.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.260
You need to sort of
put yourself here.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.250
And then I said, you know
what, why are you doing this?

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.506
You've got a lovely accent.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.130
There's loads of
wonderful connotations

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.720
with the gorgeous French accent.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.136
You're married to
an Englishwoman.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:34.420
You're really successful.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.180
And he said to me, that's
exactly the problem.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.980
I can't find myself
in these words.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.200
And then I realized
that actually it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.130
was so much deeper and more
profound than I had got before.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.720
But for many people, the
accent represented a blockage

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.000
to them being able to be fully
themselves in the language.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.710
So they were unable
to fully share

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.320
in a congruent way, the
ideas, the inspirations,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.280
or their personality, through
that language, through English.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.380
And I realized
something else which

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.160
was that I could really help.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.330
And it was actually the nexus of
loads of my interest and loads

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.850
of my passions from theater
directing to psychology--

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.050
I was doing a psychology
master's at the time.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.370
I started to create different
tools that kind of unlocked

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.500
the language for each
individual that I worked with.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.910
And we're going to give you
an example of that in a bit.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.210
But one of the first tools that
I created, and this was all

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.100
through seeing issues
come up with the clients.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.980
The first one was
realizing that vowels,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.000
so that space between
two consonants.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.040
For non-native speakers
there's often an issue

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.290
with getting a length right.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.390
So is it shorter, is it
long, so ship or sheep,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.910
which can lead to
some challenges.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.880
And then what I realized was
it's not just about going long.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.240
Short-long is the generic,
silly, tedious way of doing it.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.130
It's actually about
an opportunity

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.950
to show your feelings.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.300
So a vowel is a space
to put your feelings in.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.330
And being able to
share a tool like

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.160
that with a client
just suddenly opens it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.618
up, because you're
not telling them

00:04:09.618 --> 00:04:10.920
this is the right way to do it.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.560
You're saying, this is a way
to release what you really

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.150
feel into a word.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.820
So it's kind of bang-on
connected to my theatre

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.470
directing days.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.360
So from there I got interviewed
by the "Times" newspaper

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.280
around the royal
wedding, so to look

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.750
at Kate Middleton's speech.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.450
And as a result of
the double-page spread

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.470
in the "Times," and
as a result of that,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.030
I'd be getting lots of
native English speakers

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.230
who came with all
sorts of things.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.700
But essentially thought
they wanted elocution.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.049
And there was
absolutely no way I

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.090
was going to give them
something straightforward,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.050
straightforward elocution,
because I didn't believe in it.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.050
It's not just an accent.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.600
This is so much bigger.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.090
It's communication.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.460
And so I started to
develop more and more tools

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.120
to do with facial
expression or eye contact.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.025
Simple little [INAUDIBLE]
in to releasing people

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.150
so that they could find
themselves in the language,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.530
essentially.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.720
So after a few
years, all of that--

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.930
I decided to put all the
effective communication

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.330
stuff into a book.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.370
And I did a bigger, longer book,
and then shrunk it down to size

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.710
to a quarter of its
size into this books.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.590
So this is what is in this
book, which many of you

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.610
have a nice copy of.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.110
So hopefully you'll enjoy that.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.200
And then there's lots of
other stuff about conflict

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.720
and meetings and
all sorts of tools.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.464
So that's kind of the origin.

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.380
Since then, we've been
working for nine years,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.050
and Jamie is very much
on the front line working

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.945
with hundreds of clients who
are kind of addicted to him.

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:42.780
Seriously.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.155
They come back
and back and back.

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:46.970
JAMIE CHAPMAN: No offense
[INAUDIBLE] to me.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.876
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.250
EMMA SERLIN: So
on that note, I'm

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.583
going to pass you over to Jamie.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.250
He's going to give
you some examples

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.760
of how some of these tools
have worked with some clients.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.900
And then we're going
to do some practical.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.550
Thank you.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.810
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Lovely.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.090
Well, you will also
be addicted to me

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.670
by the end of today,
one hopes, otherwise,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.760
I shall consider it
a complete failure.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.710
One thing I want to
add, just as somebody

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.890
who works with people
almost every day,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.860
really, is in terms
of communication--

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.150
and I don't know how many
people here also feel this--

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.140
it ought to be the nicest,
best thing about being human,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.320
did it not.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.900
Surely, what sets us apart
is our ability, potentially

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.400
at least, to communicate in an
extremely sophisticated way.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.000
And yet, I work with people
day after day, not just

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.460
non-native speakers, but
English people as well,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.370
who are torturing themselves
about communication.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.360
So for instance, I was doing
a huge workshop two days ago,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.360
and this great strapping exec
chap who literally said to me,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.600
he gets a rush of adrenaline
when somebody asks

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.190
him a question in a meeting.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.900
And has three sleepless nights
before giving a presentation.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.790
That has to stop.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.410
Chat is fun, and
I simply adore it.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.800
And what we're going to look
out today-- no, I really do.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.590
I really love chatting.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.960
And the point is I want
everyone else to love it, too.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.690
And the key thing is
what we have here is,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.610
in a sense, tools,
but also a sort

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.440
of formula for how to make
sure, if you do this and this,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.090
you end up with this.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.190
Because too often
for communication,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.700
it's a bit like spinning
the roulette wheel,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.575
and sometimes you go I
was really good today.

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:39.574
And then you spin the
roulette wheel and you go,

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:41.230
no, that didn't
work at all today.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.600
Just did the stars
weren't aligned.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.070
And it's about saying a formula.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.487
If you do one, two, and
three, you end up with four.

00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:50.820
And that's what we're going
to look at in just a moment,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.310
I believe, Miss Em.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.850
EMMA SERLIN: Great.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.332
Yes.

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:56.200
Thank you.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.770
So we're going to start with
this is called the intonation

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.310
technique, and it's a
three-step technique.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.910
It works with, so if you've
got a prepared presentation,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.690
this works really, really well.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.060
So we're going to share it
so that we can all do it.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.635
So Jamie's going to begin.

00:08:12.635 --> 00:08:13.510
JAMIE CHAPMAN: I can.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.360
Now, the first thing is I
never do anything technical.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.660
I need to appoint a
willing volunteer who

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.510
would like to-- this is as
far as audience participation

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.650
effort goes in this.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.560
I promise.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.490
And it is just weeding out this.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.485
So can we have a
volunteer, please?

00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:30.110
EMMA SERLIN: Just
to read [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.920
But you'll read it at the end.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.366
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Do I have to
pick a willing volunteer?

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.299
Do I?

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.300
EMMA SERLIN: Oh yay!

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.799
Brilliant.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.176
Will you come forward.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:37.248
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Hurray.

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:38.789
EMMA SERLIN: For
this, it's actually,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.873
you read it out badly,
like the worse, the better.

00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:42.664
Because at the end,
you're going to read it

00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:43.923
out again using the tools.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:48.510
So no stress whatsoever.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.770
OK, so I'm going to record you.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.330
Would you be able to come here?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.600
That would be--

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.100
Sorry.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.570
Is that all right?

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.921
Thank you so much.

00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:57.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.894 --> 00:08:58.394
Yay.

00:08:58.394 --> 00:09:03.540
[INAUDIBLE] So I
just need to find--

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.040
there we go.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.910
Voice memos.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.410
OK.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:11.650
And what's your name?

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.750
YOSH: My name's Yosh.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.460
EMMA SERLIN: Yosh,
lovely to meet you.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.740
OK, so here we go.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.750
We're just going to--

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.600
I'm going to press
record in a minute,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.290
and I'd just like you to
read this, all the way

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.600
to the bottom.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.290
Don't worry about it being good,
just any which way is fine, OK?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.100
YOSH: Yeah.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.099
EMMA SERLIN: Here we go.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.660
YOSH: I feel that this award
was not made to me as a man,

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.210
but to my work--

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:41.260
a life's work in agony and
sweat of the human spirit.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.700
Not for glory, and least of all,
for profit, but to create out

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.790
of the materials of the
human spirit, something

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.677
which did not exist before.

00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:52.510
EMMA SERLIN: Lovely.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.396
Round of applause.

00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:55.561
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.060
Excellent.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.060
Thank you so much.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.090
So we're going to call
on you again at the end.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.750
But if, for now, if you want
to take your seat again.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.458
That was amazing.

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:02.460
Thank you.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.292
OK.

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:04.750
JAMIE CHAPMAN:
Thank you very much.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.420
Now, very, very basically
in terms of communication,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.190
let's define our terms.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.530
All communication is
ever was or ever will

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.690
be, is simply the effort to
get what's in here in there

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.560
in the best possible way.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.420
And quite often,
it's when that stops

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.880
being the aim of the game,
when it turns into some ghastly

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.880
test of yourself, an
exam that you fail,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.710
that it all goes
down the toilet.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.090
So this is the key thing.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.580
And if you remember nothing
else from today, what I'd

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.470
love you to remember is this.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.530
The task of a good
speaker is to do as much

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.100
of the listener's work for
them as you possibly can.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.550
And that starts with
knowing how words work.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.140
Emma's already just
touched on this.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.930
Words are, after all, the
currency of our communication,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:47.950
aren't they?

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.130
Words are made up
of what, chaps?

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.000
AUDIENCE: Sounds.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.249
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Sounds, hurrah.

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:55.960
And two key kinds of sound
in particular, vowel sounds

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.670
and consonant sounds.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.950
And the first thing is you need
to know what they do for you.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.970
Now, somebody very
wise once said,

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.340
and I love this quote,
that vowels are a space

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.100
to put your feelings in.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.010
And the way you get all
the color, the feeling,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.510
the meaning in a word.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.630
Now, I can demonstrate this
better than I can describe it.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.630
If I say to you,
I want to go home,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.270
or if I say I want to go home.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.870
What, obviously, conveys
more feeling to you?

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.238
Would you try, please, for me
just saying, I want to go home.

00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:35.602
AUDIENCE: I want to go home.

00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:36.560
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Exactly.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.360
[LAUGH] Now, the
key thing is you

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.360
know when you listen to
a speaker and you think,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.790
I love their voice.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.730
They're so expressive.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.080
I like listening to them.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.490
That's not magic.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.560
Mother nature did not
just sprinkle fairy

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.960
dust over that crib
when they were little.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.290
This is simply how they're
using their vowel sounds.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.760
David Attenborough's a master.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.900
Have a listen.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.450
Now, consonants are different.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.590
If vowels are about
color, feeling, meaning,

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.355
consonants are about
precision and clarity.

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:06.100
They're about efficiency and
respect for the language.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.620
They're a bit like if you
see a tower block being built

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.890
and you see the steel
frame go up first,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.040
those are your consonants.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.760
They keep everything in
place and clearly delineated.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.640
Now, there's a
three-step formula

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.890
that we look at for
intonation, i.e.,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.740
if you're doing these
things it will sound good.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.270
Number one is emphasis.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.730
And this is the idea that when
we speak, not every word we say

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.840
is of the same value.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.470
So some words are of
much greater value

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.250
to your listener than others.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.910
And I would say it's a bit
like a highlighter pen.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.582
Now, I'm old enough
to still not really

00:12:41.582 --> 00:12:42.790
be able to read off a screen.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.149
I have to print it out and
read it in front, like this.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:46.690
And whenever I'm
looking at something

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.550
and I know I have
to come back to it,

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.580
I just highlight the
key words and phrases.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.740
And that's exactly
what you need to always

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.580
be doing with your voice.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.970
It's like you have a
highlighter pen in your voice.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.270
And you're highlighting all of
the keywords for your listener,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.920
and the words that
you highlight are

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.470
words that contain information.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.550
I'm doing it with my voice now
in rather an exaggerated way.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.890
So these are the words.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.230
If you were popping
them into a car,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.390
these are the ones in a
sentence-- all the words

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.700
in a sentence-- you
have to put some words

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.670
in the front seat and some
words in the back seat.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.980
Now, here we are.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.040
If we take each phrase,
let's underline the words

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.750
we would want to put
in the front seat.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.700
Now, I will do the first one.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.830
I feel-- I think that's
a jolly important word--

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.010
that this award.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.220
Next one is 'was not
made to me as a man.'

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.750
Suggestions from
the floor, please.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.407
What shall we underline?

00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:42.990
AUDIENCE: Not.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.781
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Not.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.887
Yes, negatives are
always important.

00:13:45.887 --> 00:13:46.470
AUDIENCE: Man.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.800
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Man, marvelous.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.670
Next one, 'but to my work.'

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.590
AUDIENCE: Life's work.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:51.820
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Lovely.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.944
A life's work.

00:13:53.944 --> 00:13:54.653
AUDIENCE: Life's.

00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:55.652
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Splendid.

00:13:55.652 --> 00:13:57.280
And this is absolutely
critical here,

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.640
because what you're especially
telling us is new information.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.500
We already know it's your work.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.460
It's your life's work.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.500
Imagine how
ridiculous it would be

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.930
if you went to see Daniel Craig
in his latest incarnation,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.490
and he said, the name's
Bond, James Bond.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.220
You'd say, well, yes, I know.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.760
He has to emphasize James.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.440
Lovely.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.760
Life's work.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.820
Now, here's a long one. 'In the
agony and sweat of the human

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.370
spirit.'

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.470
What shall we have, chaps?

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.310
AUDIENCE: Agony.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.185
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Agony.

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.050
AUDIENCE: And sweat.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.718
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Marvelous.

00:14:27.718 --> 00:14:29.050
AUDIENCE: Human spirit.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.490
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Splendid.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.410
Excellent.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.987
What should we have
in this next bit?

00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:34.570
AUDIENCE: Not.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.730
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Not, negatives.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.229
Yes.

00:14:36.229 --> 00:14:38.460
Glory.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.950
'And least of all, for profit.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.384
What do we fancy here?

00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:42.050
AUDIENCE: Least.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.450
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Least.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.410
Profits, marvelous.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.670
'But to create out of the
materials of the human spirit.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.018
What should we have here?

00:14:51.018 --> 00:14:52.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:53.260
AUDIENCE: Create.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.176
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Create.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.200
Materials, yes.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.090
And what should we have here?

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.550
I think this one's
fairly obvious, yes.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.667
And 'something which
did not exist before.'

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:07.250
AUDIENCE: Not.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.041
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Not.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.754
Exist.

00:15:12.754 --> 00:15:14.170
Yes, I suppose we
could have that.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.211
Now, let's have a listen.

00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:17.800
Now, just to prove my point
about how some words are

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.830
of much greater value to
your listener than others,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.730
just close your
eyes for a moment,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.210
and I'm going to
read you just the 2/3

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.120
to a half with the words
that we haven't underlined.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.230
If that's for me,
tell them I'm busy.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.980
And what I'll do is I'm going
to read those back to you.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.560
And I want you to imagine,
if I gave you some paints,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.260
would you be able to make
any sense of this at all,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.920
and could you paint any picture.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.880
So just the words that
aren't underlined.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.560
I that this was made to me
as a, but to my a work in b,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.760
and of the for and although for.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.810
But two out of thee of thee
something which did before.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.140
What sort of a picture
did you manage to produce?

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.460
AUDIENCE: None.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.990
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Very little.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.460
Now, let's have a look.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.190
Again, close eyes, and let's
see what sort of images

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.430
we can come up with for the
1/3 to a half with the words

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.990
we have underlined.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.020
Here we go.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.010
Feel award, not man, work.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.210
Life's agony,
sweat, human spirit.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:29.500
Not glory, least profit, create
materials human spirit not

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.220
exist.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.230
Can you see how
much clearer that

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.380
is in terms of just the
images you can have.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.050
So that's our first top tip.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.860
And now my glamorous assistant
will now tell us the next two

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.880
steps on our little odyssey.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.820
EMMA SERLIN: Great.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.634
Thank you.

00:16:46.634 --> 00:16:47.300
That was lovely.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.700
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Pleasure.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.860
EMMA SERLIN: So the idea
of this tool as well,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.730
just to add to the
brilliant stuff Jamie said,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.330
is that you can choose.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.510
So it can be every word
that has money or value,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.920
or it can be a selection.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.960
And it's up to you,
but as long as you

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.300
are choosing and
consciously placing them

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.180
in the head of your
listener or your audience,

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.220
that's what starts
to give you control

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.730
over the landscape that's
being built in their heads.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.869
So step number two is pauses.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.460
And this is the
idea that we don't

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.260
talk in very long
sentences like this,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.849
that start at the
beginning and go to the end

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:23.920
with tabloids of
thoughts in them

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.390
and you never stop so no
one can keep track with you.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.410
Like that.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.120
We use pauses and
we speak in units.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.150
So there's a kind
of balanced sense

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.210
of taking your
listener by the hand

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.960
and walking at a pace that
works for them and for you.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.220
So there's sort of a flow,
like a phrasing in music.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:43.880
So here we are.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.820
If we take that idea
and put it here--

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.740
again, let's do
it with everyone--

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.750
finding the first pauses.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.152
And again, it's not absolute.

00:17:54.152 --> 00:17:55.610
There's not the
right way to do it.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.080
There's a sense of
feeling it out as well.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.820
So the first pause
I'll do, and then we

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.930
can do the rest together.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.790
So I feel that this award.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.790
So we can put one there.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.330
Thank you.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.790
Now my glamorous assistant.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.640
Both very glamorous.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.430
So next one.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.512
I feel that this award.

00:18:12.512 --> 00:18:15.664
Who's got an idea where
the next one could be?

00:18:15.664 --> 00:18:16.552
AUDIENCE: Man?

00:18:16.552 --> 00:18:18.260
EMMA SERLIN: Was not
made to me as a man.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.970
Perfect.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.559
Next one?

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.600
AUDIENCE: But to my work.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.766
EMMA SERLIN: But to my work.

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:25.430
Absolutely.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.403
Next one?

00:18:26.403 --> 00:18:27.330
AUDIENCE: Life's work.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.900
EMMA SERLIN: A life's work.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.350
Brilliant.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.720
Next one?

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.690
AUDIENCE: Agony.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.560
EMMA SERLIN: In the
agony and sweat.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.217
Absolutely.

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.800
So we always do full
stops, obviously.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.510
Of the human spirit.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.587
And next?

00:18:42.587 --> 00:18:43.420
AUDIENCE: For glory.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.690
EMMA SERLIN: Not for glory.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.340
Perfect.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.010
And least of all, for profit.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:51.690
Next?

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.439
Can people see it?

00:18:53.439 --> 00:18:55.730
But to create out of them--
so I'll do the whole thing.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.724
But to create out of the
materials of the human spirit.

00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:00.390
So we can probably
divide that up a bit.

00:19:01.366 --> 00:19:02.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.520
EMMA SERLIN: Yeah, so we have
got some different options

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.020
there.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.520
But, create, and materials.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.682
And all of them can work.

00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:08.390
That's the thing.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.250
So it's about what you
want to frame and place

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.250
in your listener's mind.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.070
So to show you what that would
look like, but, for example,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.770
or but to create, for example.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.000
Or but to create out
of the materials.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.180
So do you see it's about
what you decide to put in.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.210
If you decide to put a
whole lot of words in,

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.800
you're reducing the value,
the energy you can give,

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.600
to each individual word.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.080
Which means that if you've
got a really important word,

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.950
and Barack Obama's, like all
of his inauguration speeches

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.740
way back when are really
good to listen to for this.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.600
Because he would say
such important things,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.500
he'd do them in sentences
of two or three words,

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.470
and he'd get the impact.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.590
And if you do any more,
if you do complex words

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.190
in a sentence of seven words,
people will just get lost.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.550
The brain can't hold on to
it, figure it out, and listen

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.910
to the next sentence.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.540
So let's go for create.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.860
Thank you.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.120
So but to create.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.080
And then another one?

00:20:11.524 --> 00:20:12.510
AUDIENCE: Spirit.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.870
EMMA SERLIN: Great, spirit.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.960
And then the final one.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.360
I'll read it all out and see
if we want any in between.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.690
Something which did
not exist before.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.200
So we could do that in one.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.024
Do you want any--

00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:25.990
AUDIENCE: Something.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.198
EMMA SERLIN: Something, yeah.

00:20:27.198 --> 00:20:28.680
We could do something.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.220
Brilliant.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.190
So that's the idea of pausing.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.850
Now, it's not enough
to just pause.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.650
Because if you do just pause
and you don't put anything

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.660
in the units-- we call
it justifying the pause.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.082
If you don't justify the fact
that you're putting in a pause,

00:20:43.082 --> 00:20:45.540
it can just sound like you're
stopping, starting, stopping,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.040
starting.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.350
So I'll give you an example.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.370
I feel that this award was
not made to me as a man,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.789
but to my work, and life's work.

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:54.080
You can see what I mean, right?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.950
So we actually have
to fill the space

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.120
in between those two pauses.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.240
Fill that unit with
something, with some color,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.582
with some intonation.

00:21:01.582 --> 00:21:03.790
Now, we call this-- we've
got all these funny phrases

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.373
at London Speech
Workshop, and we call

00:21:05.373 --> 00:21:06.870
this one a psychological hook.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.990
And the idea is that if you've
got a little puppy on a leash

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.370
and it's wandering off, you're
just tugging at the attention.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.270
So that's the attention
of your listener.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.910
So we want a little
hook in each unit

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.150
to make sure that
you've got people.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.750
And it's the
difference between me

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.334
going Jamie, [SHARPER] Jamie.

00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:25.500
And I can tell by that look.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.000
Jamie.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.494
But he's going to perk up.

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.410
JAMIE CHAPMAN: He did.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.700
EMMA SERLIN: He did.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.950
So you see I'm doing
something with my voice,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.240
and it's literally
going up and down.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.640
And if we just isolate it as a
sound, I go mmm, like a hook.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.210
So that's what we want
to do within a unit.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.930
So for example here, I
feel that this award.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.910
Rather than I feel
that this award.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.460
So can you hear where
I'm doing it here?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.829
I feel that this award.

00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:54.120
And you could also do it there.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.757
I feel that this award.

00:21:55.757 --> 00:21:58.090
But do you see, it's having
a slightly different effect.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.097
Now, that is-- you
don't have to get overly

00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:02.430
into the science of it because
it needs to be intuitive.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.710
But when you've got
your presentation,

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.090
you'll know what's
really important to me?

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.110
What do I really want to
get into my listeners minds?

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.640
And that's what you underline.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.449
And actually, Barack
Obama, we didn't train him.

00:22:15.449 --> 00:22:16.740
It's a ridiculous thing to say.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.960
But if you look at
one of his speeches,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.670
there's all of these
underlined words.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.520
Like he has annotated his
speech in this kind of way

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.510
because it works.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.890
Because if you
know what you want

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.680
to get into your listener's
head, it's going to get there.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.800
So it's really nice advice.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.190
So to carry on.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.700
Another point to make is
that if for some reason

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.080
you need to buy
yourself some time.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.270
So if you've like let's say
you've got a splurge of ink

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.470
on your presentation and
you're trying to figure out

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.004
what that word is, or
trying to figure out

00:22:50.004 --> 00:22:51.420
what you're going
to say next, you

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.690
couldn't overly work one unit.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.867
But if you work it
with intonation,

00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:58.950
people will just think,
oh, they really mean that.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:04.680
So for example, I feel that
this award was not made

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.239
to me as a man, but to my work.

00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:09.030
So obviously I'm going
really slowly there.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.760
But if you work it, you can
sort of break it open, in a way,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.040
rather than I feel that
this award was not made

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.850
to me as a man, but to my work.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.120
Because you guys aren't
going to get that,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.340
and I'm not going to
have any opportunity

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:31.110
to put my feelings or my
vision and what matters to me

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.140
into the words if I just
say it really quickly.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.130
So with that in mind, let's
actually-- it's quite fun.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.340
We'll just do a little
bit just with the top row.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.340
And what we'll do
is one unit each.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.010
And so just to get
the idea of a hook.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.530
So I'll start, and
then if you go next

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.100
and we go along, if
that's all right with you,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.190
and we'll just enjoy doing--

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.770
putting a psychological
hook into each unit.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.730
So I feel--

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.018
EMMA SERLIN: And you
can pass the mic on.

00:24:03.018 --> 00:24:03.810
Thank you, Rob.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.190
I feel that this award--

00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:10.865
can you see it?

00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:14.760
AUDIENCE: Was not made to me.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.570
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Oh.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.990
All the way to--

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.490
sorry.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.781
I should have said all the
way to the end of the pause,

00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:22.046
but that was brilliant.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:24.549
AUDIENCE: Was not
made to me as a man.

00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:31.395
But to my work, my
life's work in the--

00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:36.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.154
JAMIE CHAPMAN: So if
you'd carry on from there.

00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:43.422
AUDIENCE: Life's work
in the agony and sweat

00:24:43.422 --> 00:24:45.450
of the human spirit.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.426
EMMA SERLIN: Good.

00:24:46.426 --> 00:24:47.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.794
AUDIENCE: Not for glory.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.840
AUDIENCE: And least
of all for profit.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.560
AUDIENCE: But to create
out of the materials

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.738
of the human spirit--

00:25:11.014 --> 00:25:14.067
AUDIENCE: Which did
not exist before.

00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:14.900
EMMA SERLIN: Lovely.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.400
Thank you.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.850
Yosh, would you please
come to the front?

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.630
Right.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.960
You ready?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.257
YOSH: I think so.

00:25:36.257 --> 00:25:38.840
EMMA SERLIN: Why don't you have
a little practice run and then

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.640
we'll record, OK?

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.140
YOSH: OK.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.556
EMMA SERLIN: So
what we want to do

00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:45.560
is just really enjoy
each unit, and putting

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.550
some kind of little
intonation hook in each unit.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.288
And obviously, you put the pause
in each time there's a line.

00:25:53.288 --> 00:25:55.120
YOSH: Sure thing.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.530
I feel that this award was
not made to me as a man,

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.300
but to my work, a
life's work in the agony

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.870
and sweat of the
human spirit, not

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.775
for glory, and least
of all, for profit.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.650
EMMA SERLIN: And I'm
going to stop you there,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.584
because this is so good, we
might as well just record.

00:26:14.584 --> 00:26:19.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.710
Ready?

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:20.790
From the top.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.400
Really good.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.330
OK.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.510
YOSH: I feel that this award
was not made to me as a man,

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.750
but to my work, a
life's work in the agony

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.540
and sweat of the
human spirit, not

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.780
for glory, and least
of all, for profit.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.480
But to create out
of the materials

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.650
of the human spirit, something
which did not exist before.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.870
EMMA SERLIN: Wow.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.330
That was fantastic.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.580
Thank you so much.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.930
That was wonderful.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.120
Let's do-- you do the next bit.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.930
You're going to--

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.260
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Oh, yes.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.100
Of course.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.020
So I was enjoying that so much.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.420
Just one tiny thing
I adapt to it.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.580
Key thing I think
often that's missing

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.710
when people think
about communication

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.770
and they get into that rabbit
in the headlights mode,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.480
is that you end up
reading the news,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.640
rather than telling us a story.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.450
Now, who here has read a story
to a child ever in their lives?

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.440
Right.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.287
Now, my nephew, Berty,
is four years old.

00:27:22.287 --> 00:27:24.370
Well, he's five now, but
he was four at Christmas.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.030
They are-- you can
corroborate this, I'm sure--

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.959
the most merciless critics
in the world, are they not?

00:27:29.959 --> 00:27:32.250
Because if they're bored,
they just get up and they go.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.300
No filter.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.390
They are bored.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.750
So when I was reading
Berty's story,

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.450
I was trying to keep his
little four-year-old attention

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.150
span on the story, and
quite instinctively,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.020
I was emphasizing the
keywords, and upping my energy,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.630
and really trying to use my
voice to paint some pictures,

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.520
because otherwise,
he's out of there.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.160
And my discovery, or our
discovery at London Speech

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.660
Workshop is just this.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.620
All adults are, are
grown up children.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.987
They will still be bored
and want to leave the room,

00:27:59.987 --> 00:28:02.070
but socially and professionally,
they're no longer

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.410
entitled to say so or do so.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.874
Now, of course,
I'm not suggesting

00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:08.040
that you speak to all of
your colleagues and clients

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.700
as if they are four years old,
whether they deserve it or not.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.910
But the principle
remains the same.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.860
Because as adults,
we're still drawn

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.480
to speakers who tell us stories,
and that's the key thing.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.980
Now, whenever we listen back,
and we're going to listen back

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.480
now I understand, right?

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.635
Three questions,
because you must never,

00:28:26.635 --> 00:28:29.010
ever slag off the speaker,
because everyone when you hear

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.840
yourself, everyone always
just goes, oh, my god,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.965
I can't believe I
sound like that,

00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:33.540
can't believe I look like that.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.430
Key thing is you focus
entirely on you as a listener,

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.770
and you ask yourself just the
following three questions.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.680
Number one, how much does the
speaker value what he's saying?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.900
Two, how much does the speaker
value me as their listener?

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.890
And then finally, does
the speaker make me care?

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.790
And that's it.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.220
And I think what
we're going to do

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.340
is listen back to
both those recordings

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.271
and we'll ask ourselves
those three questions.

00:29:05.271 --> 00:29:07.520
You're so much better at
writing on the board than me.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.420
If you notice, look.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.880
Now the other one took me ages,
and it was my second attempt.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.780
There we are.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.692
Lovely.

00:29:17.692 --> 00:29:19.400
EMMA SERLIN: I'm going
to write these out

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.143
so you can have them at the end.

00:29:21.143 --> 00:29:21.976
Yeah, let's do that.

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:23.059
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Yes, let's.

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:25.145
EMMA SERLIN: Thank you.

00:29:25.145 --> 00:29:25.978
[RECORDING PLAYBACK]

00:29:25.978 --> 00:29:26.946
- I feel that--

00:29:26.946 --> 00:29:30.380
I feel that this award was
not made to me as a man,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.558
but to my work, a life's
work in agony and sweat

00:29:35.558 --> 00:29:38.300
of the human-- of
the human spirit,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.724
not for glory, and
least of all for profit,

00:29:41.724 --> 00:29:43.140
but to create out
of the materials

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:49.512
of the human spirit, something
which did not exist before.

00:29:49.512 --> 00:29:53.752
I feel that this award was
not made to me as a man,

00:29:53.752 --> 00:29:57.390
but to my work, a
life's work in the agony

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.555
and sweat of the human spirit,
not for glory, and least

00:30:01.555 --> 00:30:04.645
of all, profit,
but to create out

00:30:04.645 --> 00:30:08.440
of the materials of the
human spirit, something

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.528
which did not exist before.

00:30:11.528 --> 00:30:12.069
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:12.069 --> 00:30:12.860
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Yay!

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.775
Lovely.

00:30:17.775 --> 00:30:18.946
EMMA SERLIN: Great.

00:30:18.946 --> 00:30:20.650
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Emma.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:21.320
EMMA SERLIN: OK.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.570
So the three
questions correspond

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.390
with the communication
equation, which

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.800
is the name of the first book.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.780
Which is A, for authenticity.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.529
So that is, how
much does a speaker

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:37.820
care about what they're saying.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.611
Are they authentic?

00:30:38.611 --> 00:30:39.340
Do they care?

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.760
Do they value it?

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.460
Two, is C, for connection.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.750
So how much do they care
about their listeners

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.980
and their audience?

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.160
Now, if A and C are
authenticity and connection,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.470
or I care about what I'm
saying and I care about you,

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.720
if that's there, you
get E for engagement,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.600
which is the listener cares.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.070
So let's ask the
audience for listening

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.450
to Yosh who was brilliant.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.550
Thank you, again.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.760
So in the first recording,
what do we think?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.050
How much did the speaker
value what they were

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.859
saying in the first recording?

00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:20.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.571
EMMA SERLIN: Not that much.

00:31:21.571 --> 00:31:23.535
AUDIENCE: Well,
he didn't really--

00:31:23.535 --> 00:31:25.106
it was his first
time reading it I

00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:26.980
think so he didn't know
how he felt about it.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.390
EMMA SERLIN: Yeah.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.510
Yeah, and it's-- absolutely.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.320
It's about our
impression as well.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.190
So it's not like Yosh just
didn't care, because actually,

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.200
he probably didn't care
that much differently

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.180
from either one to the
other, like it was just

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.560
a piece of recording.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.930
He was surprised in
front of loads of people.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.790
But it's about our perception.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.710
Because if we feel he
cares, we're going to care.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.530
So good point.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.910
So not very much
at the beginning.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.560
Any ideas of why that was?

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.005
What gave us that sense
that the speaker didn't care

00:31:56.005 --> 00:31:58.471
very much at the beginning?

00:31:58.471 --> 00:32:00.460
AUDIENCE: He was quite
monotone and flat.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.850
EMMA SERLIN: Monotone
and flat, absolutely.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.046
Yeah.

00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:06.020
AUDIENCE: I think it's
a lack of context.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.820
EMMA SERLIN: And
lack of context, OK.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.890
Yeah.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:09.700
Great.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.920
What about number two?

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.900
So did you get the sense that
the speaker cared about you,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.800
the listener, in the first one?

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.120
Not really.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.050
It didn't reach out.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.136
Oh, the mic's gone.

00:32:28.136 --> 00:32:29.504
Now it's back.

00:32:29.504 --> 00:32:31.790
Wow.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.470
And then finally,
so how much did

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.020
you care in the first one about
what you were listening to?

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.770
Not very much.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.300
And the second one,
how much do you

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.414
feel that the speaker cared
about what they were saying?

00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:46.550
AUDIENCE: A lot more.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.550
EMMA SERLIN: A lot more.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.450
And what do you think gave
that impression to you?

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.218
What was the feeling?

00:32:54.218 --> 00:32:56.630
AUDIENCE: Because there's
more passion than words.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.560
EMMA SERLIN: More passion.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.259
Anything else?

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:02.550
There's no right or wrong here.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.586
I'm just curious.

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:04.560
AUDIENCE: More punch.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.134
EMMA SERLIN: More punchy, yeah.

00:33:07.134 --> 00:33:08.050
AUDIENCE: More rhythm.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.470
EMMA SERLIN: More rhythm.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.450
AUDIENCE: Emphasis.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.560
EMMA SERLIN: And emphasis.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.830
Yeah.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.190
And actually, all of
that is more energy.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.150
Because when we give our energy
to something, it's our way of--

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:18.844
whatever we do.

00:33:18.844 --> 00:33:19.510
It's our breath.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.830
It's the way we show
we value something.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.620
So it's like
actually, this is just

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.710
a device for putting
your energy into words.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.320
Brilliant.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.820
So how much did you
feel the speaker

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.604
cared about you, the
listener, in the second one.

00:33:33.604 --> 00:33:34.870
AUDIENCE: A little more.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.910
EMMA SERLIN: Yeah We
won't go into why,

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.040
but there's a general
sense that he cares more.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.620
Good.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.070
And as a result,
honestly, did you,

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.657
or did you engage more with
the text in the second one?

00:33:48.657 --> 00:33:49.240
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.770
EMMA SERLIN: Yeah, OK.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:51.270
Good.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.260
Well, that's right answer.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.762
But really, it works.

00:33:54.762 --> 00:33:55.470
That's the point.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.310
It's simple steps.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.643
And what you're doing, what
we actually asked you to do,

00:33:58.643 --> 00:33:59.670
is very mechanical.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.040
It's just pauses, it's
an intonation hook

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.830
with your voice.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.100
You can do it on an
entirely fresh text.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.189
You do not need
to know the text.

00:34:07.189 --> 00:34:09.480
The weird thing is you don't
need to know the context--

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.010
I think you said context.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.889
But it gives the impression
that you know the context

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:14.969
and that you care.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.860
That's why this works.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.440
Do you got any more
to add on that?

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.648
JAMIE CHAPMAN: What I would
say, the key thing for me

00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:23.370
is simply that the
second one sounds

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.190
like it's being read for me.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.590
So you're reading
this for my benefit,

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.090
and it's no longer just a
test of you reading this out.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.510
And that's absolutely vital,
because that immediately

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.310
makes me hook into it.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.199
Later on we have
an exercise, when

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:39.810
we're doing non-verbals, which
we won't get to do today,

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.139
and we tell a story
two different ways.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:43.820
Absolutely true.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.090
Done this hundreds of times.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.620
And for every client
it's the same.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.469
I can do the first
one completely blank,

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:50.489
and you'll get nothing.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.780
And then I will tell exactly the
same story, same words exactly,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.960
but this time really engaging
with my voice and physically.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.880
And do you know what
people do every time?

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.670
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.960
I've just told you this.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.640
And everyone's the same!

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.610
But all I'm doing is I'm telling
you, you will engage with this.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.380
I'm going to hook, hook, hook.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.470
It's so powerful, genuinely.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.280
There you are.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.530
That's my input.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.370
EMMA SERLIN: And
that's the thing.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.520
The whole point of all of
these things, like Jamie

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.400
said at the beginning,
it's not magic dust.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.230
It's simple techniques of
using our own toolbox, which

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.920
is eyes, hands.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.660
I mean, everyone has it.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.790
Like no one's stuck
with a monotone voice,

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.130
or a mouth that won't open,
or a tongue that moves--

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.370
[DISHES FALLING]

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.850
No, that was a great exit.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.140
Even breaking plates.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.240
JAMIE CHAPMAN: I valued
the way you dropped that.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240
I valued it.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.734
You know, that's just
what would happen to me.

00:35:48.734 --> 00:35:49.730
Bless your heart.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:50.980
EMMA SERLIN: That's brilliant.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.040
That's a good exit.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.312
So that's a little sample
of the kind of work

00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:58.020
that we do, but
hopefully a tool that you

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.460
can use for yourselves.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.160
Now, questions.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.410
I open the field to questions.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.649
So really, the
meatier, the better.

00:36:03.649 --> 00:36:05.190
Or even, if you're
like, I don't even

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.683
know if I can be bothered
to ask this, ask it.

00:36:07.683 --> 00:36:08.183
Great.

00:36:23.288 --> 00:36:26.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:26.637 --> 00:36:28.470
EMMA SERLIN: Do you
want to start with this?

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.710
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Well, do you
know, that's a jolly good one.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.501
And I tell you why.

00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.640
It comes right back to here.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.200
Because imagine
you have to discuss

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.420
something awfully boring.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.450
And it's just, so you think
I'm not personally, absolutely

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.765
delighted with this information.

00:36:42.765 --> 00:36:46.450
If you go into
that view, that is

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.300
what your listener will feel.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.870
Now, it's still authentic
because there'll

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.010
be some part of you in
a work presentation that

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.750
thinks I have to get this over.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.510
This is part of my job,
and I value my job,

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.660
and this information, dull as
ditchwater though it may be,

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.460
will actually,
nevertheless, have

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.620
to be conveyed in
an interesting way.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.160
But if you break that
equation, A for authenticity,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.940
I value what I'm saying and
I value you as my listener,

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.800
down the toilet.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.730
In fact, you've got
to work doubly as hard

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.445
when it's dull as ditchwater.

00:37:17.445 --> 00:37:18.820
Because you've
got to think, I've

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.320
got to hook you in somehow.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.470
By hook, line, and
sinker, I will get you in.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.130
And that's when the technical
actually really helps.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.200
EMMA SERLIN: And
just to add, that's

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.100
where the intonation technique
is really useful, because you

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.900
can literally, mark
in your pauses,

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.560
mark in literally the key words,
the front seat words, and fake

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.060
it.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.250
If we can find our
integrity with it,

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.540
so our reason for doing
it, why are we motivated,

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.940
what do we value.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.140
And it could be as much
as I'm proud of my team.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.250
If you can find that
brilliant-- sometimes you can't.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.240
But you still want
to engage, you still

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.860
have the connect piece.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.480
So it's like finding that.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.990
Because what we're wanting
is in an ideal world

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.260
you're going to care, but if you
don't, but you care about them

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.510
and you want them to be
engaged, that's enough for you

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.130
to put the A in for yourself.

00:38:33.147 --> 00:38:34.480
EMMA SERLIN: Very good question.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.580
We've got a whole- that's
session two in our 10 session

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.277
course.

00:38:38.277 --> 00:38:39.610
But it's a really good question.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.125
Jamie, you start, and
then I'll add as well.

00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:41.500
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Sure.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.041
I mean, for me, I
always try and make

00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:45.280
it session two
and session three,

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.030
because it's a really
important thing.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.450
Because it's a perfectly valid
thing to say, now listen,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.240
[INAUDIBLE],, it's all very well
when you've got this lot here.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.040
Of course it sounds
better the second time

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.790
when I've circled bits
and underlined bits

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.210
and read it three times.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.490
But how do I get that into
when I'm speaking off the cuff?

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.880
Now, without going into an
enormous amount of detail,

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.400
each one of these is this unit.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.870
And each one has to be landed
with care and with energy.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.860
So for instance--

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.140
I'm going to use a pen.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.690
Excuse me.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.340
I would like to
hand you this biro

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.900
and I should like
you to take it.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:25.870
Now, what feels more
like I value this?

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.260
I've got a really good idea.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.920
Or does it feel more
valued when I do this.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.650
I've got a really
good [SOFTLY] idea.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.800
And it simply doesn't land
because you're already often

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.790
off the cuff, thinking of the
next thing you have to say.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.940
So we start with this idea
of landing the thought,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.870
so really valuing it.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.130
And the key thing that I notice
when I'm working with people

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.280
and getting them from this
into off the cuff speech,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.330
is that they think about their
presentation as like a mountain

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.770
that they have to
pole vault over,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.730
and they go, oh my
god, I'm never going

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.813
to get over that mountain.

00:40:01.813 --> 00:40:03.920
You think, well, no,
you won't in one go.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.270
But it's this one
little step at a time,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.390
and it's the same thing when
you're speaking off the cuff.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.100
It's also really
good when you start

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.560
working on speed
of delivery issues

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.250
for people who get really,
really fast when they

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.096
are presenting, because
they're nervous.

00:40:20.096 --> 00:40:21.970
But I won't go onto that
because someone else

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:23.267
may have a question about it.

00:40:23.267 --> 00:40:24.100
Thank you very much.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.490
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.400
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Do.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.180
May I have my pen?

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.311
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Thank you.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.796
JAMIE CHAPMAN: In terms of the
work for the listener, yes.

00:40:35.796 --> 00:40:36.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.986
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Oh, yes, yes.

00:40:37.986 --> 00:40:39.250
It was a jolly good question.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.125
You were saying that
one of the things I said

00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:44.650
is we have to do the work for
the listener as much as we

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.640
possibly, possibly can.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.640
Now, the ways you do that
are actually the ways

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.270
we've looked down here.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.680
So number one, I'm
telling you what words

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.900
are important to emphasis.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.920
So that does a lot
of the work for you.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.220
So for instance,
if I say to you,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.130
I never said you stole
my hat, I can give you

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.000
seven different meanings of
that sentence to emphasis alone.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.280
I never said you stole my hat.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.600
She did.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.910
I never said you stole
my hat, I said he did.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.400
Can you see just through
emphasis you're actually

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.840
not only giving your
listener the words,

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.050
you're giving them an
interpretation of the words.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.910
That's why this helps.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.857
Next thing, pauses.

00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:25.315
So [TALKING FAST]
when we speak, we

00:41:25.315 --> 00:41:26.275
don't speak in
big, long sentences

00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:27.440
and never come to an
end, because if we did,

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.970
it'd be really difficult for
the listener really difficult

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.530
to speak, especially
if everything

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.160
turns into one long stream of
conscious without a beginning,

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.743
middle or end.

00:41:31.743 --> 00:41:34.190
I've just made your
life really hard there.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.540
You've managed it, but
you're trying to follow him.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.350
You're going just
about got it, OK.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.120
But you're going to give up on
me after a while of doing that.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.960
So hence, giving you
this in bite-sized chunks

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.520
is a bit like spoon
feeding the baby.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.130
Now, once you're spoon
feeding the baby, with one

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.130
piece of information at
a time, and telling you

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.290
where the key
information is, you

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.957
find that just as a
listener, your job

00:41:56.957 --> 00:41:59.165
has become a lot easier,
[TALKING FAST] than saying I

00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:01.620
want to get this done as
fast as possible and finish.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.600
That makes sense?

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.140
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Fabulous.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.670
Sorry, that was a
jolly long answer.

00:42:11.419 --> 00:42:12.960
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.870
EMMA SERLIN: So a good technique
for that is coming back

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.920
to this idea of delivering.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.850
So that's sort of with the
response of off the cuff.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.030
If you speak in
each unit and you're

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.650
thinking about a unit at a
time, and you're delivering it,

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:35.997
then you arrive at a pause,
rather than an oh, my god,

00:42:35.997 --> 00:42:37.330
I've got to say loads of things.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.970
I've got this whole long
thought and I've got to it.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.511
And oh, my god, now I'm starting
in the middle of a sentence.

00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:42.050
Um, ah, oh.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.590
So it breaks it down.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.390
It's like a ladder.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.400
It's a steady rung by rung.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.560
And in this idea of
delivery, and also

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:54.440
even getting physical with it,
it grounds you in each moment

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.640
because you're breaking it down.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.250
Because the mind comes up
with your ums and your ahs

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.922
when you feel stranded,
and you're going,

00:43:01.922 --> 00:43:03.130
what can I come up with next?

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.760
And there's this pressure
to pick an idea that's

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.830
in your head somewhere.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.460
Whereas actually, you
don't need to do that,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.043
because you can just
do, oh, I'm here.

00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:12.900
I'm present in the
one comment or the one

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.240
thought that I have to say now.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.560
And I've delivered it.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.500
Oh, and another one's come.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.660
And giving the message
of that to your brain,

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.320
both through your intonation,
so it's kind of landing it.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.320
And through this concept of
connecting and delivering

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.720
takes away the pressure,
and it actually

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.090
gives you more space to think.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.370
And the other little tip
for that is also the vowels.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.974
So elongating your vowels,
rather than [TALKING FAST]

00:43:40.974 --> 00:43:42.390
saying [INAUDIBLE]
really quickly,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:46.110
and then your thought processes
at the end of the words where

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.806
you go um, you can go, and
saying a word really quickly,

00:43:50.806 --> 00:43:52.680
and you've just given
yourself thinking time.

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:10.980
EMMA SERLIN: That's an
interesting question.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.510
JAMIE CHAPMAN: That
is a good question.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.885
EMMA SERLIN: I
think I'd probably

00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:16.248
need to sit down and
create a new book.

00:44:16.248 --> 00:44:19.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.560
We've got a lovely little--

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.950
one of our tools is based on
a poem called "Jabberwocky",

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.480
and I actually created
that with an 11-year-old,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.560
and then was like, this
is great for adults.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.950
But they've got a
different mindset

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.700
and a different
attention span, so it's

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.140
about gamifying things a lot.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.150
As Jamie said, it's
communicating with an adult.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.040
When you think of
them as a big child,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.900
he's slightly more polite.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.790
And it's a good return,
because with our clients,

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:53.942
we gamify everything.

00:44:53.942 --> 00:44:55.650
There's a before and
an after, and it all

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.060
becomes very relaxed and fun.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.556
Like we did with
Yosh, rather than we

00:44:59.556 --> 00:45:01.590
taught you the technique,
get it right now.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.710
So again, that psychology
of just lighting up, taking

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.630
the pressure off is good.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.380
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Do you know,
that's a blooming good one.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.270
I think that's an
excellent question.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.590
Can I just respond to that?

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.940
EMMA SERLIN: Sure.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.010
JAMIE CHAPMAN: The key
thing about speaking off

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.890
the cuff that I notice is this.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.540
You've got to understand that
when you speak off the cuff,

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.270
it's completely different from
when you've written something

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.020
down.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.840
And people seem to judge
it by the same criteria,

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.360
and judge it jolly harshly.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.350
Now, the USP, the unique selling
point of written communication

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.520
is that it is polished,
edited, and logical.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.770
And therefore, you can
come back to it perfect.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.310
You can polish and polish it.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.260
That is not the USP of speaking.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.950
And yet, I watch people give
presentations, and clearly,

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.740
what they are attempting to
do is attempting to dictate

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.680
the perfect email in one go
and they will punish themselves

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.480
if they cannot manage this.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.510
This is unfair.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.040
I absolutely call the ref
because this is not allowed,

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.550
because that's not the point.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.960
The USP-- I mean, for instance,
if you sent me an email,

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.660
and it had dot, dot, dot,
and abandoned sentences,

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.540
and an illogical structure,
and grammatical errors,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.250
I'd think, now, come along.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.220
Read it through before
pressing send, and tidy it up.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.886
But I never think that
when you just speak to me.

00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:48.260
Of course I knew
sometimes you'll

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.010
struggle to find
that word, and that's

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.480
not the end of the world.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.240
Because the USP of
verbal communication

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.040
is that it's interactive and
spontaneous and engaging.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.180
That's its USP.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.160
So of course, if
it doesn't come out

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.370
in beautifully eloquent
phrases and completely fluent,

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.130
that's fine.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.560
That's not really the point.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.857
It just has to engage me
and take me on a journey.

00:47:10.857 --> 00:47:11.940
So that's the first thing.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.189
EMMA SERLIN: And I will just--

00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:14.140
Brilliant, I agree.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.160
And I will just add to that.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.000
And also, I say ums, too.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.090
Lots of ums.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:25.980
A really good thing that
I love is owning it.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.500
Owning that space where
you're looking for the word.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.230
Because it's your word,
and it's your idea,

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.440
and it's your perfectly formed.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.240
It's going to be.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.710
The apple's going to drop
from the tree and land.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:38.490
And so giving it.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.910
Rather than going oh,
white headlights, panic,

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.150
and a rabbit in the headlights,
I can't think of the word.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:49.200
It can be this
wonderful pregnant pause

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.910
of finding that word.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.450
And I remember an example.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.030
When I worked as a
theatre director,

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.130
I remember I would get a
moment where I'd be like, oh,

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.500
there's something here.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.617
And I remember having
a rehearsal process,

00:48:01.617 --> 00:48:02.700
and then going stop, stop.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.930
There's something here.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.260
And then my mind went blank.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.510
And I was like, this is funny.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.046
Everyone's watching
me going, what's

00:48:08.046 --> 00:48:09.920
she going to come up
with, this wonderful bit

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.340
of creative vision.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.200
And I was just like, [STARING].

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.980
And then, because I
could, I just sat in it.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.570
And after about five seconds,
the idea started to come in,

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.520
and I delivered it.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.727
Now, if I had panicked
at that blank,

00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:26.810
and it was total blankness
for those five seconds.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.710
But if I panicked,
as we can easily

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.380
do under the pressure
of a conversation,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.120
nothing would have
happened, and I

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.735
would have lost status
in the room, or whatever.

00:48:35.735 --> 00:48:38.790
So it's about enjoying
that moment of just going,

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.350
it's going to land
and trusting it.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:43.320
And it's your vision.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.960
So even if it's not the word
that a native English speaker

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.307
would use, it's yours.

00:48:49.307 --> 00:48:51.890
JAMIE CHAPMAN: It's the thought
that happens during the pause.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.330
I can only say the thought
that happens for me.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.860
I always think for me, if
I can't think of the word,

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.090
the thought in my head
has to be no, just let me

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.710
find the perfect word.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.000
Not just any word,
because you're worth more.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.130
As opposed to [SINGING] da
da, dun, da, dun, dun, duh.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:10.940
I'm a bad communicator. da-da,
da, da, da-da-da-da fail.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.350
Get rid of that.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.950
That helps absolutely nobody.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.370
Good.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:20.975
EMMA SERLIN: We have, I
think, six minutes left.

00:49:20.975 --> 00:49:23.486
So if there's any
more questions,

00:49:23.486 --> 00:49:24.500
you've got six minutes.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:47.090
EMMA SERLIN: I would say working
out which bits of the story--

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.600
It's not about
doubling your speed.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.609
Because as we know, if
you don't put anything--

00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:54.150
if you don't get it
into their heads,

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.525
they're going to
walk away going,

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:57.200
well, that's six
minutes that's wasted.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.280
So actually, it's about you
going, what are the key points,

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.080
and being in there enjoying it.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.580
And we haven't really been able
to talk about it much today,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.680
but one of our metaphors is
about creating a landscape

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.220
in your listener's head.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.620
So you can engage physically.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.339
You can sort of this is over
here, and that idea's there,

00:50:15.339 --> 00:50:16.880
and then we've got
sort of this here.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.660
So by doing that,
by moving around,

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.135
you can actually imprint
the different ideas.

00:50:22.135 --> 00:50:24.260
And you might be like
there's three salient points,

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.560
and just, I want to land there.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.857
Get those points
in, rather than--

00:50:28.857 --> 00:50:29.690
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Yeah.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.740
Excessive speed never works.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.156
It's a huge misnomer about, say,
I've got a lot of information.

00:50:35.156 --> 00:50:35.655
I know.

00:50:35.655 --> 00:50:37.655
I'll say it really fast.

00:50:37.655 --> 00:50:38.750
It does no good.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.030
Because go back to the
very first thing we said.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.400
The whole point is getting
information from here

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.650
[POINTING TO HEAD],, in there
[POINTING TO AUDIENCE]..

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.382
Not getting information
from here, out.

00:50:47.382 --> 00:50:49.340
Because if that were the
case, speaking quickly

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.560
would be a wonderfully effective
way of doing it, but it's not.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.341
It's not.

00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:55.840
Oh, yes.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.140
JAMIE CHAPMAN: Good one.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:09.740
Good one.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.516
Emma, you'd be better for this.

00:51:11.516 --> 00:51:22.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.354
EMMA SERLIN: So
I'm actually really

00:51:24.354 --> 00:51:25.520
passionate about this stuff.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.060
I did training in San
Francisco called non-violent

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.186
communication, and it's--

00:51:31.186 --> 00:51:32.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:35.440
It does what it says
and is beautiful.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.690
Like really, really beautiful.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.320
And it's based on this
work from this therapist,

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.010
and Carl Rogers,
and then someone

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.090
called Harvey
Rosenberg created it.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:48.470
And there are some
ideas from that.

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.150
This is actually all
in the book as well.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:55.040
So step one is knowing
about breathing.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.650
So your first
reaction, that heat

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.580
when we get when something
happens that gets us mad,

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:05.420
is the part of our brain
that is basically very basic.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.414
It's animal.

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.580
And that's where it goes to.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.440
It's like our amygdala.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.140
If we wait, because it
takes about five seconds

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.020
to move into your
cortex, so to move

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.340
into the sophisticated
part where you can go OK,

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.649
let's figure this
out, what's going on.

00:52:19.649 --> 00:52:20.690
So you just have to wait.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.370
First thing, wait five seconds.

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.950
And if you can breathe
during those five seconds,

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.060
even better.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.070
Rather than I'll
wait five seconds.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.690
So you breathe out.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.380
And then when that five
seconds have passed,

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.760
a really good tip from
non-violent communication

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.480
is trying to figure out
what's going on for them.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.510
And then figuring out
what's going on for you.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:44.000
So one of the lines in it is
be an advocate of your own,

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.200
and the other person's, values.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.410
So if they're mad at you
because they're like,

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.340
this is late again, and I've had
enough, and what are you doing?

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.410
Are you doing this
to wind me up?

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.770
And your reaction is [ANGRY]
no, it's not all about you.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.353
I've got this, this
and this deadline,

00:52:57.353 --> 00:52:59.060
which you asked me
for, or whatever.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.512
So you breathe.

00:53:00.512 --> 00:53:02.720
And then it's like, right,
what is going on for them?

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.830
Like actually, is this
because their value

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:11.000
is I have to get things
on time for my senior boss

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.469
and it puts me into a panic if
I don't get what I've asked for,

00:53:14.469 --> 00:53:16.010
or is it stress at
home, or whatever.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.040
So just that process of asking,
and not necessarily getting

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.270
to the right answers, gets you
into a place towards empathy,

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.650
towards compassion.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:29.630
And also towards these feelings
and this heat may not actually

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.140
be the whole story.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.990
And once you're at
that, it's so much

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:37.012
easier to be able to ask them
a question, or to go, OK,

00:53:37.012 --> 00:53:38.220
and what was going on for me?

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.520
Like actually this heat is
because I'm working really hard

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.139
and I don't feel I'm getting
the recognition I want.

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:45.680
Well, that's actually
something else.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.638
That's from-- you know.

00:53:46.638 --> 00:53:49.290
So you can start to
separate, take the heat out.

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.630
And then from that place,
it's communication.

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.730
And questions are so powerful.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:59.000
So it might just be, depending
on what the situation is,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.160
it might be I'm not
sure I understood

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.180
before how important this was.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.260
But can you just explain
to me this and this

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.010
just so I get it, or is
it because this and this.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.860
So it's just that gentle
digging can just take--

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.570
also, if they've come
to you with anger,

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:20.390
can just take the wind
out of their angry sails.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:23.390
AUDIENCE: With that,
please [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:27.640
[APPLAUSE]
