00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:03.770
THE REAGANS WERE MARRIED
IN 1952.

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.807
NANCY, YOU KNOW,
DEFINITELY CONVINCED RONNIE,

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.142
WE'RE--WE ARE HAS-BEENS.

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.211
LIKE WE--WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT
IN HOLLYWOOD.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.748
YOU NEED TO BE
MORE CONSERVATIVE.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.451
OW. OH, [bleep].

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.653
- YOU OKAY?
WHAT'D YOU DO?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.388
- I'M FINE.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:26.426
I STABBED MY OWN EYE OUT.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.861
- I DIDN'T LE--
- WHAT?

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.363
- HOW DID YOU STAB
YOUR EYE OUT?

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:33.433
- LET'S BE FAMOUS,
YOU KNOW, POLITICALLY,

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.737
AND BECOME THE--THE FACES
OF CONSERVATISM?

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.472
SHE WAS BASICALLY LIKE
HIS MANAGER.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.509
YOU NEED TO BE THE MOVIE STAR
THAT YOU ARE, ALWAYS SMILE,

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.447
AND HOLD YOUR HEAD TO A HALF,
45 DEGREE RIGHT ANGLE.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.017
I THINK SHE, IN HER MIND,
RAN HER OWN STUDIO,

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.719
AND--AND--AND SHE HAD
ONE--ONE PLAYER,

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.221
AND THAT WAS RONALD REAGAN.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:59.893
REMEMBER, BUSINETH--BUSINESS.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.895
SO IT WAS 1964.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.898
BARRY GOLDWATER WAS RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT,

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.235
A HYPER-CONSERVATIVE,
A BORING HUMAN BEING.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.037
THEY EMPLOYED RONALD REAGAN,

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.141
WHO WAS THIS FAMOUS, GREAT ACTOR
TO GIVE THE SPEECH.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.412
IN THE SPEECH HE SAID YOU CAN
EITHER GO RIGHT OR LEFT.

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.882
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS,
IT'S EITHER UP OR DOWN.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:27.221
AND UP, YOU CA--YOU CAN CHOOSE
TO BE UP

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.358
TOWARDS INDIVIDUALISM,
OR DOWN

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:35.629
IN THE DEPTHS
OF TOTALITARIANISM.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.166
PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
WOW, I NEED TO WATCH THIS.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.370
HE HAS A CHISELED JAW,
I TRUST HIM.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.706
I LIKE THIS GUY.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:48.008
AND SO LIKE, THEN HE GOT VERY
POPULAR WITH THE REPUBLICANS.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.310
SO THEY WERE NOT
SUCCESSFUL ACTORS AS ACTORS,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.813
BUT THEY WERE INCREDIBLY
SUCCESSFUL ACTORS

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.314
AS POLITICIANS.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.483
AND RONNIE BECAME
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.753
NANCY WAS ALWAYS
ABOUT BEING FAMOUS ON ANY LEVEL.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.355
LIKE, IF I'M NOT GOING
TO BE A MOVIE STAR,

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.456
I'M GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
