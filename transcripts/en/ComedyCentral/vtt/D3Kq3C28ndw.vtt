Your eyes are the 
color of...

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.670 align:start position:0% line:92%
...Really pretty eyes. 

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:08.008 align:start position:0%
Oh, your skin is like
a milk-fed piglet.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.146 align:start position:0%
Oh, I wish we could
sail away together.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414 align:start size:22% position:78%
Me too.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.150 align:end position:100%
Faster, boy. I want to feel
the wind in my hair.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.554
(Dodo)
Why are you two lawn boating?

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:25.191
Afternoons are for defecating
and learning Latin.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.226 align:end position:100%
Mother, we can't work
all the time.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.761 align:start position:0%
Frederick, put on
a clean top hat.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.431 align:start position:0%
I've invited a widow
to the manor

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.133 size:84% position:42%
in hopes of making a match.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.601
Frederick
will never get married.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.271
All the women Mother's brought
so far have either left

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.273
or had accidents.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.543
Pussy Von Anderstein's former
husband was a coon-tie tycoon.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.180
He made a fortune designing
raccoon-skin neckties,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.682
and as long as you don't do
anything stupid,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.851
that fortune will be ours.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.586 align:start position:0%
But we have
infinite money!

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.856
Yes, if we have infinite money
and we add Pussy money to it,

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.724
we have double infinite money.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.126 align:end position:100%
But, Mother,
infinity can't be doubled,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.395 align:end position:100%
as its very nature is
its boundlessness.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:06.265 size:75% position:38%
It frightens me when you
act all smart like that.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.301
Look, the day moon!

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.404
Frederick,
you must take a wife.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.507
You're 23 years old.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.809 align:start position:0%
Mother, I'm 35.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.277
You're what?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.346 align:start position:0%
Yes. Right?

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.582 align:start size:22% position:78%
Mm-hmm.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.186 align:start size:16% position:84%
Okay.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.487
