00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, it wasn't too precise in what I meant by difficulty.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You might have chosen different answers than me, but I see that the cleanliness

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of the water wasn't very important and nor is the temperature.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In fact, it's the total weight or total amount of water that we have to lift

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the distance we have to lift it that most affected how difficult this task could be.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We see this total weight and force we're going to need to supply

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and this distance we need to supply are both seem to be somehow important concepts.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Qualitatively, we know that these are the important concepts,

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but how can we quantify difficulty?
