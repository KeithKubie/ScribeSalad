00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.360
So let's get going today.
And what we were talking about

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.402
last time is the discovery that
the atom was not the most basic

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:23.470
constituent of matter,
that there was a particle that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.783
was even less massive than an
atom.

00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:33.046
And that is the electron.
But today, we're going to

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:38.042
discover the nucleus.
And so this is 1911.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:42.915
And this is Ernest Rutherford
in England.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:50.226
And what he was interested in
doing was studying the emission

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:56.563
from these newly radioactive
elements that were being

00:00:56.563 --> 00:01:02.188
discovered.
So the emission from radium,

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:07.085
for example.
What he did was he got a sample

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:13.348
of radium bromide from
his friend Marie Curie.

00:01:13.348 --> 00:01:19.498
And what was known was that
this radium bromide emitted

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:23.142
something called alpha
particles.

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:31.000
And the exact nature of these
alpha particles was not known.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.915
However, what was known was
that they were heavy particles,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:40.237
that they were charged and that
they were energetic.

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:44.050
And, of course,
today we know what these alpha

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.525
particles are.
They are helium double plus,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:51.338
a helium with two
electrons removed.

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:54.728
All right.
So he got this radium bromide.

00:01:54.728 --> 00:02:01.000
And alpha particles are being
emitted from the radium bromide.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.149
And he had some kind of
detector way out here,

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.469
which detected these alpha
particles.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:13.818
And what he found was that at
the detector there were about

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:16.953
132,000 alpha particles per
minute.

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:21.657
That was the count rate that he
was able to measure.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:27.282
And then, because he was just
trying to figure out what is the

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:33.000
nature of these particles,
he did this experiment.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.400
He took a gold foil,
a really thin gold foil here,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.036
really thin meaning 2^10-5
inches.

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:48.428
That's two orders of magnitude
thinner than the diameter of

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:52.506
your hair.
I've always wondered how he

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:56.142
handled that.
That is pretty thin.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:01.611
But he put that in there.
And lo and behold,

00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:06.716
the count rate that he measured
once this gold foil was in

00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:11.910
place, the count rate was still
132,000 alpha particles per

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.955
minute.
It appeared that all of the

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:20.328
alpha particles that were being
emitted just went through the

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:25.432
foil right to the detector.
It didn't even seem like those

00:03:25.432 --> 00:03:30.000
alpha particles knew the foil
was there.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.046
The same count rate.
It doesn't sound like a very

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:38.598
interesting experiment,
but at that time he was working

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:42.898
with a person named Geiger,
a post-doc named Geiger.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:46.017
The same Geiger as the Geiger
counter.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:50.485
And Geiger wasn't too happy
about the results of these

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:52.845
experiments.
And in addition,

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:59.000
Geiger had this undergraduate
student hanging around the lab.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.548
This undergraduate named
Marsden.

00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:05.529
And Marsden was really excited
about doing science.

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:09.351
He just hung around there.
He really wanted to do

00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:11.341
something.
And Geiger was,

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:14.606
jeez, what am I going to do
with this guy?

00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:19.065
Geiger goes to Rutherford and
says I've got Marsden here,

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:23.285
he really wants to do
something, what should I do with

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:25.594
him?
And Rutherford said well,

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:30.213
okay, let's have him build a
detector that can swing around

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:36.282
that gold sample.
Let's have him build a detector

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:41.788
that will rotate around such
that the detector can be

00:04:41.788 --> 00:04:46.764
positioned this way,
so that we can look for any

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:51.317
alpha particles that might be
backscattered,

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:57.988
backscattered meaning scattered
back in the direction from which

00:04:57.988 --> 00:05:02.047
they came.
And Geiger said ah-ha,

00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:06.422
this will keep this guy busy
and not in my hair.

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:09.960
No problem.
So he goes down to Marsden,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.148
Marsden is all excited to build
this detector.

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:18.244
He builds the detector and gets
Geiger, okay,

00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:21.316
we're ready to go.
Let's try this.

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:25.691
And so they put the radium
bromide there in this

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.414
arrangement.
They're sitting there at the

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:35.000
detector and they hear tick,
tick, tick, etc.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.758
Hey, particles at the detector.
And they go,

00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:42.954
oh, well, that must just be a
general background.

00:05:42.954 --> 00:05:47.587
So what they do then is they
take this gold foil away,

00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:52.220
so that presumably all the
particles are going in that

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.328
direction and they listen and
they hear nothing.

00:05:56.328 --> 00:06:00.000
And they put the gold foil
back.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.289
And they listen and they hear
tick, tick, tick,

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.313
etc., 20 alpha particles per
minute.

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:14.602
And they then pick another
foil, platinum foil,

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:20.466
basically the same result.
They go up to Rutherford,

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:24.491
they get him down in the
laboratory.

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:29.780
Rutherford's looking over their
shoulder, tick,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.305
tick, tick, etc.
Hey, there are some alpha

00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:38.072
particles coming off.
Not many.

00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:43.144
Look at what the probability
here is of the backscatter.

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:47.201
Hey, that probability,
we can calculate that.

00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:51.997
The probability is simply the
number of backscattered

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:57.530
particles, 20 (the count rate of
the backscattered particles,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.063
20), over the count rate of the
incident number of particles,

00:07:03.063 --> 00:07:08.266
132,000.
That probability is 2x10^-4.

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:14.566
Not large, but not zero.
There is something coming off.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:21.100
And Rutherford was amazed.
And what he wrote later on was

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.100
that this experiment was quite
the most incredible event that

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.000
has ever happened to me in my
life.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.375
It was almost as incredible as
if you fired a 15 inch shell at

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:44.810
a piece of tissue paper and it
came back and bit you.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.991
So how does he interpret that
experiment?

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:54.322
Well, what he said is that
since most of these alpha

00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:59.966
particles went right through
this foil to the detector,

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:06.028
that must mean that those gold
atoms that make up that gold

00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:12.509
foil must be mostly empty.
So the picture is that you've

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.625
got this gold atom here.
And he knew,

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.605
roughly speaking,
how large that gold atom was.

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:22.721
He knew it to be about 10^-10
meters.

00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:27.567
But what he was proposing is
that these helium ions going

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:32.586
through, these alpha particles
are just going right through

00:08:32.586 --> 00:08:37.000
that volume because most of the
atom, --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.411
-- and he knew that there were
electrons in this atom because

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:47.462
he knew about the electrons
already, most of that atom is

00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:49.988
empty.
However, occasionally,

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:54.227
once in a while,
not very often but occasionally

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:57.835
these helium ions,
these alpha particles,

00:08:57.835 --> 00:09:02.700
what happened?
Well, occasionally they hit

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.200
something very massive in that
atom.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.700
And when it hit that massive
part of the atom,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.600
it reflected,
it scattered back into the

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.200
direction from which it came.
And from knowing what these

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.600
scattering probabilities are and
from knowing roughly the size of

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.000
this atom and the thickness of
the gold foil,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
he could calculate what the
diameter of this nucleus was.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.621
And that number came out to be
about 10^-14 meters,

00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:47.336
the diameter of this heavy
massive part of the atom.

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:52.697
Now, he called that massive
part, he called it the nucleus.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:57.966
He called it a nucleus in
analogy to the massive center of

00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:02.910
a living cell.
That's where that name comes

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.028
from.
And this number of 10^-14

00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:12.161
diameter, that's a good number
to know, the relative size of

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:16.318
the nucleus.
All MIT students should know

00:10:16.318 --> 00:10:19.956
that.
He also knew that that nucleus

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:23.594
really had to be positively
charged.

00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:29.000
Why did it have to be
positively charged?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.281
Well, because he knew that
these atoms were neutral,

00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:39.667
he knew already that an
electron was part of an atom.

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:44.638
And so this nucleus had to be
positively charged.

00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:49.609
And, in addition,
he made some very sophisticated

00:10:49.609 --> 00:10:54.373
measurements of the angular
distribution of the

00:10:54.373 --> 00:11:00.587
backscattered alpha particles.
And from those measurements of

00:11:00.587 --> 00:11:05.972
the angular distribution,
he was able to back out the

00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:11.358
fact that this nucleus had a
charge of plus Z,

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:17.261
where Z is the atomic number,
times unit charge e.

00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:22.439
So his model is the Z electrons
filled this volume,

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:30.000
this sphere effectively of
10^-10 meters in diameter.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.266
The electrons filled that up,
but somewhere in the center

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:41.097
there is something that is very
small and very massive that has

00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:46.645
a diameter of 10^-14 meters.
Because occasionally that alpha

00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:52.382
particle hit that massive part
so most of the mass of the atom

00:11:52.382 --> 00:11:56.802
is in this nucleus.
Now, isn't this a great UROP

00:11:56.802 --> 00:12:00.000
project for Mr.
Marsden?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.059
What did he do?
He discovered the nucleus.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:07.821
Fantastic.
I also want to tell you that

00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:13.069
this kind of Rutherford
backscattering experiment here

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:18.118
is also the basis of the
experiment that was done to

00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:22.178
discover the quark.
The quark which is the

00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:26.534
elementary particles that make
up the proton,

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:30.000
the neutron.
Same idea.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.955
There is a high energy particle
that comes into the proton and

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.123
backscatters from the quark
essentially.

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:42.915
That is an experiment carried
out by one of my colleagues in

00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:46.733
the Physics Department,
Jerry Friedman and Henry

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:49.820
Kendall.
Henry Kendall has since passed

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.689
away.
But the same idea.

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:56.238
It's really the Rutherford
backscattering experiment that

00:12:56.238 --> 00:12:59.000
was done.
All right.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.976
Well, now it is time for us to
do our own Rutherford

00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:13.636
backscattering experiment.
And the way we are going to do

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:21.160
that is we're going to be
scattering off of this lattice

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.000
here, this lattice of these
Styrofoam balls.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.126
These Styrofoam balls are gold
atoms, gold nuclei,

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:36.926
and then the space around them
is where the electrons are.

00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:40.126
So this is one monolayer of
gold atoms.

00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:42.905
Now, this scale is a little
wrong.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:47.873
The real scale would be if we
had a pinhead in the center of

00:13:47.873 --> 00:13:52.926
this room and then the rest of
the room was the atom and then

00:13:52.926 --> 00:13:57.557
there would be another room
10-251 with a pinhead in the

00:13:57.557 --> 00:14:01.918
center of that.
That's the real scale,

00:14:01.918 --> 00:14:06.453
but the fact that the scale
isn't right, that's okay.

00:14:06.453 --> 00:14:11.337
We are going to be able to
understand the principle here.

00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:16.395
And what we want to do is we
want to be able to measure the

00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:21.366
diameter of these Styrofoam
balls or the diameter of those

00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:24.941
gold nuclei.
And we're going to measure it

00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:30.000
by measuring the probability of
backscattering.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.200
And the way we're going to
measure the probability of

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.299
backscattering,
the way we are going to do

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:44.299
that, is we're going to take
these ping-pong balls,

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:48.700
and they are going to be our
alpha particles.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.000
And we are going to aim them at
the lattice.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.500
And we are going to have a
total of 287 ping-pong balls,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.299
or 287 alpha particles.
And so the probability of

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:09.635
backscattering will be simply
the number backscattered over

00:15:09.635 --> 00:15:13.682
the total number incident,
which will be 287.

00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:17.270
So this is what we are going to
measure.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.789
Now, the next thing we have to
do is that we've got to relate

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:25.916
this probability of
backscattering.

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:31.160
We are going to have to relate
it to the diameter of those

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.806
nuclei.
How do we do that?

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:40.025
Well, the probability of a
particle backscattering is

00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:44.942
simply going to be the total
area of this crystal,

00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:49.258
there's our crystal,
the total area of this.

00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:55.179
Now, you've got to ignore these
aluminum blocks here because

00:15:55.179 --> 00:16:01.000
this piece of equipment comes
from my laboratory.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.146
And I pressed it into service
for this demonstration.

00:16:06.146 --> 00:16:11.986
This has nothing to do with the
demo that we're going to put

00:16:11.986 --> 00:16:15.252
here.
It's just structural because

00:16:15.252 --> 00:16:20.399
this is my manipulator
puller-outer from our machine.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:26.139
So you've got to ignore those,
but that whole area there is

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:33.572
equal to 2,148 square inches.
And now the probability of that

00:16:33.572 --> 00:16:40.371
backscattering is this total
area of the nuclei to the total

00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:45.557
area of the crystal.
And the total area of the

00:16:45.557 --> 00:16:52.933
nuclei then is just the sum over
all nuclei, and there are 119 of

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:57.312
them here.
So i=1 to 119 of the area of

00:16:57.312 --> 00:17:03.870
each one of the nuclei.
And so that is just 119 times

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.720
the cross-sectional area of
these nuclei actually,

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:14.262
which is pi d squared over 4,
and this is all over 2,148.

00:17:14.262 --> 00:17:19.409
That's the probability.

00:17:19.409 --> 00:17:22.774
This is the diameter of the
nuclei.

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:30.000
And now I am going to rearrange
that and solve for the diameter.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.427
And when I do that I get 4.79
times P to the one half.

00:17:35.427 --> 00:17:40.437
If I measure the probability of

00:17:40.437 --> 00:17:45.239
backscattering by this,
measuring the number of

00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:51.084
backscattered balls over the
total number we throw at it,

00:17:51.084 --> 00:17:55.989
then I can calculate the
diameter of the nuclei,

00:17:55.989 --> 00:18:01.000
the diameter of those Styrofoam
balls.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.720
That is the idea.
Now, you're going to do this

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.125
experiment.
And so now the TAs are going to

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:13.902
give you all a ping-pong ball or
two.

00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:17.363
Come on.
We need to distribute the

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:20.720
ping-pong balls.
Here's the deal.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.804
What you have to do is you have
to aim to hit this lattice.

00:18:26.804 --> 00:18:33.806
That's all you've got to do.
Then you have to watch your

00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:39.211
ball, and you have to see if it
scatters back to you.

00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:45.448
Now, what doesn't count is if
you hit these steel bars and it

00:18:45.448 --> 00:18:48.878
scatters back.
That doesn't count,

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:52.308
okay?
It also doesn't count if the

00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:57.817
ball hits the Styrofoam but it
continues going in that

00:18:57.817 --> 00:19:02.574
direction.
Your ping-pong ball has to

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:06.237
actually scatter back at you to
count.

00:19:06.237 --> 00:19:12.079
And then, when we get all done,
I am going to ask whose ball

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:16.237
backscattered.
That's what we've got to do.

00:19:16.237 --> 00:19:21.881
Now, some of you aren't in the
optimal position to hit the

00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:25.544
lattice.
I invite you to come down and

00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:30.000
get a little closer.
That is okay.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.850
Now, are you roughly ready?
Yeah.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.502
All right.
But there is one other piece of

00:19:36.502 --> 00:19:41.133
information that is very
important that I have got to

00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:44.696
tell you.
And that is that only fools aim

00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:48.793
for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER] Okay,

00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:52.000
go to it.
Watch your ball.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.367
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles

00:20:58.367 --> 00:21:00.397
been launched?
Yes.

00:21:00.397 --> 00:21:02.384
Fantastic.
All right.

00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:08.145
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha

00:21:08.145 --> 00:21:14.006
particle that backscattered?
Okay, so now I've got to count.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:19.668
Keep your hands up because
there are some lights that make

00:21:19.668 --> 00:21:25.629
it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?

00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:27.615
Yes.
One, two, three,

00:21:27.615 --> 00:21:30.566
four, five.
Six.

00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:34.528
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?

00:21:34.528 --> 00:21:39.339
That's it?
Six alpha particles that

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:44.575
backscattered.
Okay, so now we have to

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:49.245
calculate some probabilities
here.

00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:55.754
The probability of
backscattering is the number

00:21:55.754 --> 00:22:03.979
that backscattered.
6 divided by 287 and that gives

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:11.810
me 0.021,
carrying one extra significant

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.533
figure.
And if I now take that

00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:22.851
probability and I plug this into
here, I've already done a

00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:26.831
calculation.
I got a table here.

00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:33.121
I find that that diameter to
the correct number of

00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:41.160
significant figures is 0.7.
And the actual diameter of

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.872
these balls is 0.8.
So you guys did a very great

00:22:46.872 --> 00:22:49.911
job.
[APPLAUSE] All right.

00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:54.895
This works.
That's how they calculated the

00:22:54.895 --> 00:23:00.000
diameter of the nucleus.
That's it.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.003
Nothing else involved in this.
That is the principle behind

00:23:07.003 --> 00:23:10.383
how it was done.
Very simple.

00:23:10.383 --> 00:23:17.628
That is the principle behind
how the quark was discovered and

00:23:17.628 --> 00:23:21.733
the size of the quark was
revealed.

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:27.529
That is terrific.
Now, we've got the problem that

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:34.532
the scientific community had in
1911, 1912, right after the

00:23:34.532 --> 00:23:40.638
discovery of the nucleus.
And the problem is,

00:23:40.638 --> 00:23:45.814
now we know the atom has got a
nucleus, we know it has got an

00:23:45.814 --> 00:23:49.523
electron, what is the structure
of the atom?

00:23:49.523 --> 00:23:53.923
How does the electron and the
nucleus hang together?

00:23:53.923 --> 00:23:57.632
In particular,
what we have to do is we have

00:23:57.632 --> 00:24:02.118
to ask what is the force of
attraction that keeps the

00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:06.000
nucleus and the electron
together?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.541
We are going to talk,
here, about this classical

00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:18.026
description of the atom.
And we've got to talk about the

00:24:18.026 --> 00:24:24.746
force of the interaction first.
Well, there are four known

00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:30.406
fundamental forces.
What is the force that is the

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:33.837
weakest force?
Gravity.

00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:38.025
Absolutely.
What is the force that is the

00:24:38.025 --> 00:24:41.794
next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.

00:24:41.794 --> 00:24:45.563
Absolutely.
What is the next stronger

00:24:45.563 --> 00:24:47.342
force?
Weak force.

00:24:47.342 --> 00:24:50.693
And the next force?
Strong force.

00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:54.880
All right.
The weak and the strong forces

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:02.000
here, these are intranuclear
forces within the nucleus.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.192
That's what keeps the protons
and neutrons and the quarks

00:25:07.192 --> 00:25:09.695
together.
For the most part,

00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:14.516
the weak and the strong force
don't have an effect in

00:25:14.516 --> 00:25:18.596
chemistry, with the exception
for beta decay,

00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:24.158
for some radioactive elements.
That's where you need to think

00:25:24.158 --> 00:25:27.496
about, in particular,
the weak force.

00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:32.081
Gravity also --
Well, gravity actually has no

00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:36.244
known consequence for chemistry.
It doesn't mean that there

00:25:36.244 --> 00:25:40.263
isn't one, but it has no known
consequence for chemistry.

00:25:40.263 --> 00:25:44.641
All of chemistry is tied up in
this force, the electromagnetic

00:25:44.641 --> 00:25:47.296
force.
Now, what I am going to do is I

00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:51.531
am going to simplify it just a
little bit and just call this

00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:54.904
the Coulomb force.
And why I am going to do that

00:25:54.904 --> 00:26:00.000
is going to be a little more
obvious when you get to 8.02.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.576
But I am going to call it the
Coulomb interaction.

00:26:04.576 --> 00:26:09.153
And we know what the Coulomb
force law looks like.

00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:12.703
The Coulomb force law is the
following.

00:26:12.703 --> 00:26:17.280
Say I have a positive charge,
which is my nucleus.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.296
I am going to call that force
plus e.

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:25.500
And at some distance R,
R is the distance now,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.730
between that nucleus and the
negatively charged particle,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:36.460
which is my electron.
I can describe the force of

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.203
attraction between this electron
in the nucleus by the following

00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:46.031
expression.
That force, which is a function

00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:51.591
of the distance between the two
charges, is just the magnitude

00:26:51.591 --> 00:26:56.786
of the charge on the negatively
charged particle times the

00:26:56.786 --> 00:27:01.617
magnitude on the positively
charged particle over 4 pi

00:27:01.617 --> 00:27:07.177
epsilon nought r squared.

00:27:07.177 --> 00:27:11.517
Now, I am going to treat this

00:27:11.517 --> 00:27:15.423
force, just for simplicity
purposes right now,

00:27:15.423 --> 00:27:18.895
as a scalar.
I am not going to talk about

00:27:18.895 --> 00:27:22.454
the direction,
but because this is a force

00:27:22.454 --> 00:27:27.663
between a positive and negative
charge, this is an attractive

00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:30.701
force.
This epsilon down here is the

00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:36.116
permittivity of the vacuum.
It is in there for doing our

00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:40.197
unit conversion correctly.
That is all I will say about

00:27:40.197 --> 00:27:42.540
it.
Maybe you will talk a little

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.866
bit more about it in 8.02.
And then, finally,

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:49.569
here is the r squared.
That is the important part.

00:27:49.569 --> 00:27:53.877
That is the distance between
the electron and the nucleus.

00:27:53.877 --> 00:27:58.337
And what I want you to notice
here-- I don't need the screen

00:27:58.337 --> 00:28:00.865
down yet.
Hello.

00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:05.913
She just switched it?
Oh, all right.

00:28:05.913 --> 00:28:11.105
Sorry.
It looks like I'm not going to

00:28:11.105 --> 00:28:15.432
get to it, actually.
Thank you.

00:28:15.432 --> 00:28:24.375
What I want you to notice here
is that when r goes to infinity,

00:28:24.375 --> 00:28:30.441
what is the force going to do?
Zero.

00:28:30.441 --> 00:28:34.764
When those two particles are
infinitely far apart,

00:28:34.764 --> 00:28:40.147
you've got an infinity in the
denominator, this force is zero,

00:28:40.147 --> 00:28:43.235
there is no attraction between
them.

00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:47.470
But when r goes to zero,
what does that force do?

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.588
Infinity.
When r is zero,

00:28:49.588 --> 00:28:52.411
there is an infinity large
force.

00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:56.294
And in between,
what is happening is that the

00:28:56.294 --> 00:29:03.000
closer the particles get to each
other, the larger the force.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.413
The more attraction there is.
The more they want to be even

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:11.306
closer to each other.
All right.

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:15.693
Now, what this equation is
telling me is simply,

00:29:15.693 --> 00:29:20.920
what is the force of attraction
between the nucleus in an

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.306
electron for a fixed distance r?
In other words,

00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:30.906
if I were holding the electron
and the nucleus in my hands at

00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:34.920
some distance r,
that equation would tell me

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.442
what the force was.
And you can bet that in order

00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:44.147
to keep them apart,
I would really have to be

00:29:44.147 --> 00:29:46.842
pulling like this.
You'd feel it.

00:29:46.842 --> 00:29:51.810
But you also know that if you
let them go, what would happen

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.263
is that they would move toward
each other.

00:29:55.263 --> 00:30:00.147
What this equation does not
tell us is how they move toward

00:30:00.147 --> 00:30:04.600
each other.
It does not tell us how r

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.281
changes with time.
It doesn't tell us anything

00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:15.627
about r as a function of time.
Although we know the force law,

00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:21.557
we don't know anything from
that force law about how those

00:30:21.557 --> 00:30:26.550
two particles move under
influence of that force.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:33.000
And so what we need is we need
an equation of motion.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.864
And the equation of motion that
was known at that time is,

00:30:37.864 --> 00:30:42.983
of course, Newton's equations
of motion, Newtonian mechanics,

00:30:42.983 --> 00:30:47.250
classical mechanics,
the mechanics that governs the

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.688
motion of all bodies around us
that we see easily and

00:30:51.688 --> 00:30:54.589
astronomical bodies.
In particular,

00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:58.258
Newton's second law,
F equals ma,

00:30:58.258 --> 00:31:02.695
this force equals the mass of
the particles times the

00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:06.201
acceleration.
And, of course,

00:31:06.201 --> 00:31:10.608
in this acceleration term,
well, I think you know what's

00:31:10.608 --> 00:31:13.413
in there.
In that acceleration term,

00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:17.660
let me just write it out,
the acceleration then is the

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.628
change in velocity with respect
to time and the velocity is the

00:31:22.628 --> 00:31:26.233
change in the position r with
respect to time.

00:31:26.233 --> 00:31:30.000
So we have a second derivative
here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.505
What is in this force law is a
way to get r as a function of

00:31:36.505 --> 00:31:40.254
time under influence of this
force.

00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:46.429
So we take this force and we
substitute it in here and we

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:52.273
would be able to solve a
differential equation for how

00:31:52.273 --> 00:31:59.000
those two bodies moved under
influence of that force.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.134
And when we solved this
equation, we would know exactly

00:32:04.134 --> 00:32:08.128
where the two bodies would be at
all times.

00:32:08.128 --> 00:32:13.549
As long as we know where the
bodies were when they started

00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:18.588
out, using that force law and
this equation of motion,

00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:23.723
we could tell you what r would
be for all future times.

00:32:23.723 --> 00:32:30.000
That's called deterministic.
That's classical mechanics.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.304
Well, we're not going to do it,
but we could actually set up a

00:32:36.304 --> 00:32:42.299
differential equation and solve
for what r(t) is using that

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:45.090
force law.
We could do that.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:51.085
And if I did that and if I
started out the electron and the

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:56.666
nucleus at one angstrom from
each other, like they are,

00:32:56.666 --> 00:33:01.421
roughly speaking,
in an atom, what would happen

00:33:01.421 --> 00:33:07.002
is that that electron would
plummet into the nucleus in

00:33:07.002 --> 00:33:13.718
10^-10 seconds.
If I solved these equations,

00:33:13.718 --> 00:33:21.156
I would find that r would be
equal to zero and t equal to

00:33:21.156 --> 00:33:27.000
10^-10 seconds.
We've got a problem here.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.557
The problem is that this
classical physics,

00:33:30.557 --> 00:33:35.554
Newton's second law and the
force law, it is predicting that

00:33:35.554 --> 00:33:40.213
after 10^-10 seconds the
electron and the nucleus are on

00:33:40.213 --> 00:33:44.363
top of each other,
they've neutralized each other.

00:33:44.363 --> 00:33:49.614
We no longer have an atom that
has a diameter of 10^-10 meters.

00:33:49.614 --> 00:33:52.579
That's contrary to our
observations.

00:33:52.579 --> 00:33:58.000
This is saying the atom
collapses in 10^-10 seconds.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.391
But what we see is that the
atom seemingly lives forever.

00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:08.397
So we've got a big problem
here, as they did in 1911,

00:34:08.397 --> 00:34:11.574
1912.
And the problem is that this

00:34:11.574 --> 00:34:16.677
kind of classical way of
thinking does not predict our

00:34:16.677 --> 00:34:20.624
observations.
It does not predict the fact

00:34:20.624 --> 00:34:25.052
that the atom lives together,
it lives forever.

00:34:25.052 --> 00:34:31.603
It says the atom falls apart.
So it could be that the Coulomb

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:35.213
force law is wrong,
or it could be that this

00:34:35.213 --> 00:34:40.335
equation of motion is incorrect.
And of course what's going to

00:34:40.335 --> 00:34:45.122
turn out is that this equation
of motion does not work for

00:34:45.122 --> 00:34:48.732
electrons in atoms.
You cannot use classical

00:34:48.732 --> 00:34:52.931
mechanics to describe the
electron within the atom.

00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:57.297
We need a new kind of
mechanics, and that new kind of

00:34:57.297 --> 00:35:02.000
mechanics is going to be quantum
mechanics.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.294
That is where we will pick up
on Monday.

00:35:05.294 --> 00:35:06.627
Have a nice weekend.
