Hey, Georgia.

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:04.130
Georgia.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.060
&gt;&gt; Hey Anthony.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.980
Sorry about that, what's up?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.270
&gt;&gt; So, I collected some data
about project compos, but

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.490
I want to format it in a way
that doesn't look so boring.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.800
&gt;&gt; Well, data analysis not only
analyze and extract data, but

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.378
they also create data visualizations.

00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:21.286
What data visualization?

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:25.550
A data visualization is
a representation of data.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.811
So like charts, maps or graphs.

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.400
Okay so I've seen that everywhere.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.705
I didn't realize they were also
called data visualizations.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:34.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.020
There's a lot of ways you can
create data visualizations but

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.840
a couple libraries are D3 js or
temple js.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.510
They both use HTML and CSS.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.220
&gt;&gt; Like frontend programmers.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.680
&gt;&gt; Exactly, let me show you an example.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.280
So as you can see,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.230
when I hover over this data point
it shows me more information.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.500
&gt;&gt; That is cool, I think I'll try using
Dimple for my project compass data.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.560
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.200
&gt;&gt; Definitely check out
the documentation if you need help.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.750
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Georgia.
