00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.360
 Let's talk about one of the most fundamental ideas in science - the idea of ​​energy. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 Usually we imagine things that move or are hot and bright, 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.760
 as energetic, but what I'm going to talk about in this video, 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 is a more formal, more scientific definition. 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.220
 The most typical explanation given is the ability to work. 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.900
 But I will put "work" in quotes, why the idea of ​​working here is not the same 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.360
 such as in the everyday life when you go to work from 9:00 to 5:00 and get a salary. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 In the context of physics, work is not entirely different from this idea 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.575
 to work in our everyday life, but I will give you an example to make you clearer. 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.080
 Let's say there's some object here and you're going to apply force 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560
 in this way. 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.780
 Let's say this force is from 10 Newtons. 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.200
 If the Newton unit and the notion of force are not very familiar to you, 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.280
 do not worry, you can recall them from these videos from the Cannes Academy. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.100
 So, you apply force to the right of the object 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.500
 and thus you can move the object, 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.460
 to change its location in the same direction of power. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.540
 Let's say you move him 10 meters. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.940
 When you're done, the object is already here. And so by applying force 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.820
 you make the object move to space in the direction of that force 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.160
 And it can be said that work has been done. And the amount of work done 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.939
 is 10 newtons of 10 meters. 10 by 10 is equal to 100. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.930
 And then the unit of work is Newton-meter - 100 Newton meters. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.600
 Because we multiply the Newtons by the meters. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 Newton-meter is defined as a joule - it is a unit of work and the same unit of energy. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.920
 That's the same 100. I can write 100 joules. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.500
 Abbreviatedly we can write it with J. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.379
 So here are 100 joules of work 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.660
 by moving this. 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.160
 We have done something here that is considered a job - 100 joules of work. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.800
 If we move this two times farther, then we will have 200 joules of work. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.037
 So energy is the ability to do such work. 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.560
 Now let's take a look at these photos here, 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.260
 representing different forms of energy. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 And let's see if we can determine which are these forms 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
 how they can relate to actual work. 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.520
 If we look at the fire here, there are some obvious ones 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.360
 forms of energy - we have some thermal energy. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.060
 The fire is definitely hot, so we have thermal energy. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.380
 But we need to think about what is thermal energy at its core: 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.580
 the temperature of a system is the average kinetic energy of its molecules. 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.840
 Therefore, thermal energy is the real energy of motion. 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.160
 It's really relevant to all these little molecules here. 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.040
 Because of the combustion reaction, they are excited and have higher kinetic energy. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 And so the temperature rises, their average kinetic energy rises. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.580
 Therefore, thermal energy is actually a form of energy caused by motion. 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.299
 The basic term for motion energy is kinetic energy, 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.820
 so that thermal energy is a real form of kinetic energy. 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.160
 You also have the light of light that has energy. 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.200
 We call it light energy because light is emitted. 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.300
 This is the reason we can see this fire. 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.940
 Light energy. 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.360
 Now you might think that it's probably all the energy in the system. 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.780
 But I will say: No. There is another form of energy. 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.200
 And even on this picture most of the energy is safe here. 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.480
 And this is the potential energy. And where exactly is she? 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.440
 It is locked in fuel connections here, 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.660
 whether pieces of wood or coal or other - they are all made of carbon, 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.769
 of carbon bonds. And you have these carbon bonds. They may be connected 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.470
 with other carbons or other things. They will also be related to hydrogen atoms in places. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.329
 So you will have different connections in this way, 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.650
 who store energy in themselves with the potential to be released: 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.310
 if you can break these chains, these electrons 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.919
 will enter a state of low energy or will connect 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.310
 with other things. And in the process will release energy, which 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.207
 will be light and thermal / kinetic energy. 

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:37.440
 How does that work? 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.729
 How do these links actually break up? 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.150
 This is through our good old friend - the burning reaction, 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.740
 where you take a little oxygen and heat 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.580
 (or we can say a little energy). It takes a little energy to get started. 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.289
 So maybe you have to burn this with a match match at first. 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.349
 So we need oxygen plus energy. And you can say plus these carbon bonds. 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.040
 Ie. plus what this fuel here is from carbon compounds: 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.140
 whether coal or wood. I will write it this way: 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.729
 any carbon-carbon bonds here are going to ignite. 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.469
 I will color this. (I have a problem with changing colors.) 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:35.520
 It will ignite and release, 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.960
 will release water because the fuel has hydrogen in itself. 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.060
 And it will release carbon dioxide. And much more energy. I will write it in capital letters. 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.919
 It will release a lot of energy. And we see this energy 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.159
 in the form of the kinetic energy of the molecules and the separated light energy. 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.580
 Now you might say, Well, I can assume I have this potential energy. 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.820
 And this potential energy, which is in the bonds between these atoms - 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.660
 we call it chemical potential. We have chemical potential energy. 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.800
 The potential energy is here. 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.770
 But maybe you're saying, "I understand that. 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.520
 The chemical energy is transformed into thermal energy and 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.490
 light energy. "This is actually an interesting idea for energy - 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.060
 it is a law for the preservation of energy. It can not be created or destroyed. 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.419
 It can only be transformed from one form to another. But you must say, 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.260
 "Okay, I can turn it from one form to another, but how do that 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.860
 can it do a real job, the way it was depicted at the beginning? " 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.920
 Well, the whole industrial revolution aims to transform one form of energy into another 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.240
 and to do the job accordingly. 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.840
 The steam engine is built to heat steam by burning. 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.560
 And then this steam is expanding and pushes the pistons that do all things, 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.380
 including trains. Burning occurs in automotive engines, 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.430
 in which the pistons expand because of the thermal energy. 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.820
 And that makes the parts of the car work. 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.660
 Here are some other examples. It's lightning - 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.630
 when we have a flash, something very clearly kinetic happens. 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.360
 You have electrons moving from a cloud cloud to the ground. 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.870
 And maybe you're saying, here's kinetic energy. 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.940
 You may be wondering: how can I do this? 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.880
 That's what the whole electronics industry is all about. This is the basis 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.400
 of electric cables - the movement of electrons. This is an electric current. 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.380
 And he can be used to do any incredible things. 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.360
 There may be an electric motor: this is one way to do the job. 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.720
 This is kinetic energy. Obviously, we have light energy, 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.580
 we can see the flash. And the light energy is produced, 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.400
 because the air is ionizing and heating. That's why we also have thermal energy. 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.680
 The electrons descend down and heat is generated. 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.080
 And where did this energy come from? She has not come from nowhere. 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.970
 You have all this potential energy that begins to accumulate 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:12.220
 in these clouds, with the increase in water vapor. The mechanisms of action are not 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.260
 fully understood. It's not quite clear how it happens. But we know it because of it 

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.639
 the energy from the sun has rising water vapor, and with the increase in the clouds, 

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.300
 the lower side becomes more negatively charged. It becomes richer in electrons. 

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.460
 And the top of the cloud becomes more positively charged. 

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.450
 And you have these electrons that really want to descend to the ground. 

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.820
 And because the air above ground becomes more negative, the earth is getting up 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.800
 more positive. And you can imagine these electrons want more and more 

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.080
 and more to come down here. This air, however, is not a natural conductor. 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.760
 But when the electrical potential rises up enough, the electrons find their way. 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.650
 The air is ionized and the electrons can find a path down. 

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.660
 As long as all this accumulates, you have accumulated this electrostatic potential. 

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.519
 Electrostatic. 

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.172
 (Oh, I can not see the writing.) 

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.860
 You have electrostatic potential. 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.000
 And how is he formed ... once again this is an area in which people are still discussing 

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.860
 some good theories about his formation, 

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.060
 but not yet 100% established. 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.880
 And here in the third picture we have a man who jumps from a stand of hands. 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.660
 This is probably the most typical example you can find in a physics textbook 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.580
 to turn potential energy into kinetic energy. 

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.540
 Here at the top of the tram the man 

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.180
 there is potential energy because of its position 

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.240
 and there is an obvious potential to fall and the potential to turn the potential 

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.600
 energy in kinetic. At the moment of falling most of the 

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.640
 potential energy has become kinetic. 

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.680
 This is potential, and it is kinetic energy. 

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.820
 So the big conclusion is that energy is the ability to do the job. 

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.920
 It can not be created or destroyed, 

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.280
 but it can move from one form to another. 

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.370
 And all forms at its core - you can think of them 

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.380
 as for two large buckets as for potential energy 

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.940
 and kinetic energy. For the last example, you may be asking yourself: 

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.600
 "But how does this person work?" 

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.180
 Imagine if there is a system here. 

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.650
 We create some mechanisms. 

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:37.080
 Maybe there is a reel here and it raises weight here. 

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.370
 If he jumps, he will not fall so fast, 

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.670
 but while heavier than this, the weight will pull down. 

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.810
 And this weight goes up. So he has the potential to do the job 

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.680
 because of its position here. But it does not really have this reel system, 

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.150
 to do the job.
