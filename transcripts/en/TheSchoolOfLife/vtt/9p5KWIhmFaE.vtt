00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm not what you'd expect from a guy.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.080
You know, I'm not one of these guys that you see in porn or something,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.460
going at it for hours and hours on end...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.900
I'm not like that.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.640
Uh...

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.380
It took me a long time to actually say it:

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.180
I find sex tricky.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.720
I've felt weird about sex my whole adult life, I think.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.680
I think what I want to do, or

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.600
maybe what I don't want to do,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.420
is sometimes exactly what I'm expected to do, in my head anyway.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320
I don't know if that makes sense, but

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.280
I think when you're younger, you just go along with it,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.600
you just try and treat it casually,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.420
but it's never really felt "me."

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.160
I think if there was a porn that was designed specifically for me,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.880
it would be called, something like,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.500
"shy porn" or something.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
You know, something, basically, porn for people who are a bit hung up about sex.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.960
My ideal porn...

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.040
Well, the guy...

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.160
I think the guy would be...

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.560
The guy would ask the girl if he could touch her, and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.760
I think she...

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.020
I mean...

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.200
They would like each other, but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.640
there would be this skill and this kind of conflict, and...

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.820
I don't know. That's how I feel about sex.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.360
I had a dad who was really macho

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.060
I didn't really get on with him; he kind of rejected me.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.100
And... I suppose I rejected him back.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.540
And since then, I've just been really uncomfortable

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.540
with the idea of, you know,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.940
that masculine, high-powered, sort of turbo-charged masculinity.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.900
My mum's life was messed up by men.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.660
Maybe that's where it comes from.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.540
For years, I've struggled.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640
I even tried it with girls,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.440
and that's fun, but

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.060
it didn't really feel like a solution.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.700
I think what I don't like is the loss of control

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.840
I think I'd like to hide my discomfort, maybe,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.180
but my body always gives me away.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah, and you know, you can't really...

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.380
Sometimes your dick just isn't up for it, right?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.560
[Laughing] It just isn't up for it. Sorry.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.800
[Woman] When we met, we were both, just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.020
I think, both at our lowest points, so

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.500
that's why we could be really honest with each other.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.680
[Man] Yeah. She was the first person I could be really,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.120
totally up-front with from the get-go.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.140
I think, actually, I said to you, "I find sex quite daunting,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.160
and I might get impotent."

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.740
Can you imagine? This is a real turn on. [Laughing]

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.800
[Woman] But it was, and that's the thing:

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.580
it was him being really honest about something like that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.300
that made me kind of open up.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.580
It was that date, actually, after, when we were making tea in the kitchen.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.260
Well, I told you that I suffer from vaginismus,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.100
which is a disgusting word, but

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.380
it's basically this thing where...

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.740
It's when you get too tight during sex.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.480
It can make things really difficult because like nothing will go in.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.000
And, well, I'd never really told anyone that, but

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.260
once I did, it was like a massive weight had lifted.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.700
[Man, agreeing] And because we could be completely honest with each other,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.540
it was really good.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.860
[Woman] It was the best it had ever been!

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.240
[Man] And then we have sex all the time now.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080
It's probably not how most people have sex.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.680
You know, we think of it as sex for people who are a bit fucked up about sex.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.080
But, you know, we might do something like:

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.820
we might take it really slowly,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.460
or we might just watch each other touching.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.540
Or explore...

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.700
some sort of fetish or something.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.960
[Woman] Oh, you've got this thing about  doing it in public places,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.020
or, um, I don't know, like,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.820
sometimes, you enjoy just watching me.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.200
[Man] Yeah, sometimes I do enjoy it... That's probably enough... [laughing]

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.520
Yeah, basically, people will think this sounds really weird, but

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.760
it works for us.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.280
Our Sex book explores how sex truly operates,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.920
demonstrating that: far from thinking about sex too much,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.100
we haven't begun to think about it nearly enough.
