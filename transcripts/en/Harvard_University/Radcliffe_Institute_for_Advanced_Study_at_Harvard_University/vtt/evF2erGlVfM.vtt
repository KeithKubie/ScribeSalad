00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:04.880
- Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.430
Good evening.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.040
My name is Jennifer Roberts.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.580
And I am an art history
professor here at Harvard

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.450
and also Faculty Director
for the Arts at the Radcliffe

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.250
Institute.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.360
I want to welcome you all
to the opening of our spring

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.240
exhibition, Willie
Cole, Beauties.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.330
It's very gratifying to see
such an enthusiastic response

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.320
to this exhibition from both
within and beyond Harvard.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.689
I'd just like to
extend a very special

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.720
welcome to the many members
of the Boston printmaking

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.100
community who are here tonight.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.090
We're very glad to have you
here and also a very special

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.430
welcome to the group
of high school students

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.220
from RAW Art Works in Lynn, who
are also here with us tonight.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.720
Welcome.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.700
So for those of you who haven't
been to an opening at Radcliffe

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.560
before, this is
how it will work.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.310
I am going to deliver for
about 15 minutes along

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.450
with the introductions a quick
orientation to Cole's work

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.700
and to this exhibition.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.720
Then Willie Cole and Cole
Rogers will be joining me up

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.120
on the stage for approximately
30 minutes of discussion.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.510
There will not be a public
question and answer period

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.310
here in this room
mostly because we

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.800
want to get everyone
across to the gallery

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.350
to get in front of the
work as soon as possible.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.200
So at around a
quarter or 10 to six,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.200
we'll all adjourn, walk two
buildings down to the gallery,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400
and then reconvene along with
the work where we can continue

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.590
our discussions, both
amongst ourselves and also

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.672
with our guests.

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:45.130
So before I begin,
of course I want

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.430
to extend a few special
thanks on behalf of everyone

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.500
here at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.910
First of all, of course, I
want to thank Willie Cole

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.860
for the remarkable work that
brings us here this evening

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.100
and of course for
being here as well.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.770
Thanks to Highpoint
Editions in Minneapolis

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.560
who've been incredibly generous
with their time and expertise

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.920
and with their prints
for this exhibition.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.560
Thanks to everyone
who has thought

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.040
deeply about these prints with
us over the past year or so.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040
And many Radcliffe Fellows
and Harvard faculty and staff

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.710
have come together for
a series of discussions

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.200
over the past year,
really grappling

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800
with the philosophical
and social meanings

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.002
of pressing in the largest and
broadest sense of the word.

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:39.460
And I really look
forward to having

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.085
these kinds of
conversations continuing

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:45.680
with the work present with
us for the next few months.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.370
Finally, I want to thank
four graduate students in art

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.140
history and American
studies who have

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.600
worked very closely
with us on programming

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.710
and the publication--

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.250
Julia Silverman, Chassidy
Winestock, Thea Goldring,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.510
and Chloe Chapin.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.920
Thanks to you all.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.030
All right, I've just been
running through the prints

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.830
to give you a quick
orientation to them.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.622
Of course, they look
much better in person.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.620
Cole is best known
perhaps for the links

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.280
he has forged between ironing
and domesticity embodiment,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.940
questions of servitude,
refinement, beauty, power,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.200
and danger.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.330
The tools of ironing have
been central to his work

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.660
for over 30 years.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.750
Probably his best known
work is this print, Stowage,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.150
from 1997 in which he forged
important links between irons,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.220
ships, and migration,
particularly

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.760
the trauma of the Middle Passage
in the Atlantic slave trade.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.210
The infamous Brookes slave
ship diagram silently

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.490
inhabits all of his
work with ironing,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.530
including the Beauties.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.350
He's also developed multiple
resonances between irons

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.150
and ironing and African art--

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.230
masks, shields, scarification
practices, and sculpture.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.260
Drawing particularly upon
Yoruba ritual traditions,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.800
he's highlighted the
elemental associations of iron

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.560
as a metal--

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.580
so not just an appliance,
but actually an element--

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.970
invoking Ogun the Warrior
in spirit of metalwork

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.649
in Yoruba tradition, also
known as the god of iron.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.710
At the same time, he's explored
the Christian resonances

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.520
of the iron motif, cultivating
its echoes, for example,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.840
in the veil of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, as in this print,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.420
as well as to Christian
liturgical vestments

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.560
and to the Gothic arch.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.790
The Beauties which
bring us here today

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.430
absorb all of these
dense meanings

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.410
while also developing
the ironing

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.780
motif in new directions.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.880
The Beauties were made
by stripping, crushing,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.940
and flattening steel
ironing boards then inking

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.320
them and running them through
an etching or roller press.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.950
This produces a powerfully
raw and immediate impression

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.170
of the flattened boards.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.770
At the base of each of
these impressions is a name.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.480
These names provide
a direct link

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.250
between all of
these other themes

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.070
that we've been
discussing around irons

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.210
and the labor of generations
of black women in America.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.400
Cole's grandmother
and great grandmother

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.990
were housekeepers
who often asked

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.500
Cole to fix their steam irons
when he was a child growing up

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.820
in Newark.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.760
The names are a testament to
the strength and persistence

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.250
of women of their
generations, as well

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.810
as a kind of tacit
recognition, I

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.970
think, that their
own work of ironing

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.450
shares a great deal with
Cole's work of printmaking.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.720
Cole made the Beauties in
2012 at the Highpoint Center

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.640
for Printmaking in Minneapolis.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.740
In collaboration
with Cole Rogers

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.950
and the other expert printers
in the professional studio

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.000
there, he developed a unique
process for this very unusual

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.720
printmaking challenge.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.090
Now the first and inescapable
thing to say about this process

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.960
is that it was a violent one.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.460
You can't just put an ironing
board through a printing press

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.330
as is.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.970
First you have to flatten it.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.570
Cole and the printers
did this first

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.990
with hammers, sledges,
and concrete blocks,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.970
a process which both
crushed the boards

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.050
and marked them with various
patterns of impact markings.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.000
As Cole said, "We
destroyed them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.522
We surfed them down hills
and hammered them out.

00:06:22.522 --> 00:06:24.230
We even ran trucks
over them to give them

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.580
a little more history.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.570
I think of them as
ironing board warriors."

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.090
Then they were put
through the roller press

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.220
multiple times without
ink to be flattened

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.570
further until they were down to
just a few millimeters thick.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.700
Then they were
inked and printed.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.320
Each time through
the press, something

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.710
on the order of 45,000
pounds of pressure

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.510
was distributed
along that line where

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.020
the roller meets the board.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.040
Now, when we confront
the intensity,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.370
the power of this
process and its violence,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.740
it's tempting to see this
simply as a kind of diminution,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.130
a sort of violent
reduction of the boards

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.170
and all that they
might represent,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.500
crushing them into the tiniest
possible space, silencing them

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.460
as if dominating them.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.240
But something happens as the
prints emerge from the press,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.280
from that intense process.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.230
They unfold in a sense.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.590
They expand both perceptually
and conceptually.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.170
Despite the harsh forces at
the heart of their making,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.920
they come to have something
like a regal bearing, a quality

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.060
of strength, a sense of
expansive and even luminous

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.380
transparency.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.880
And we get a sense
of this, I think,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.100
in the profusion
of different kinds

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.590
of often contradictory
associations that

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.020
come to settle on the boards
when you come and see them.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.470
So some of these
associations, yes, do

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.460
speak about trauma and
violence, death even.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.980
So the boards look
like slave ships,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.670
like tombstones, like
shrouds, like mummies.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.460
But other associations
also shoulder their way

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.060
into this scene with different
and even contradictory kinds

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.750
of valences.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.020
So they also look like
stained glass windows,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.380
like shields, veils,
bolts of patterned fabric,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.760
sentinels, guardians,
saints, even surfboards.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.460
The prints rapidly oscillate
between associations

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.580
of violence and beauty and
precariousness and permanence

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.150
and matter and spirit.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.500
It's as if the intense
pressure of that printing press

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.470
has somehow taken a set
of cultural binaries

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.290
and oppositions and sealed
them together so that they

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.110
can no longer be separated,
so they constantly

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.250
inhabit each other.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.490
So let's look, for
example, at just one

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.460
example of that kind
of collapsed binary

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.799
that we see happening
in these prints.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.780
The Beauties managed to imply,
for example, both a horizontal

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.070
and a vertical posture
at the same time.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.570
When you look at
them on the wall,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.987
as you'll see in
the gallery, they

00:08:53.987 --> 00:08:56.650
have a kind of dignified
verticality about them.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.620
They resemble royal or
aristocratic portraits.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.500
So Queen here on
the left really does

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.920
tap into a very long history
of aristocratic, full-length

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.722
portraiture in the west.

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:10.430
But it's never quite
possible, of course,

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.450
to forget that these were
made prone on the press beds,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.540
subject to a drama of
crushing pressure and counter

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.670
pressure, a stress
position as it

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.070
were, something that's totally
different from any kind

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:26.130
of airy, easy, blithe
standing position

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.830
so that when the beauties
are hung on the wall

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.990
then, when they return to
this vertical position,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.930
their origins in the press
really accompany them

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.070
to the wall, charge them with
what I see as a kind of air

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.610
of endurance and resistance.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.430
So in other words, they
don't just stand there.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.160
They do something more complex.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.250
They withstand.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.680
You can say the same about
innumerable other oppositions

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.280
that these prints
collapse together,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.290
so let's say destruction
and creation.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.250
Let's think about the hammering
away at these ironing boards

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.680
out in the parking lot
of Highpoint Editions

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.700
in Minneapolis.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.060
This seems like it's all about
destruction and violence.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.620
But it also echoes something
that has been important to Cole

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.890
from the outset, the ancient
histories of metal working

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.590
in multiple cultures, where
you have the hammering

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.130
of blacksmiths, the hammering of
metal and chasing and repoussé

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.950
processes in
decorative metalwork.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.390
Seen this way, the same
process of hammering

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.670
invokes then both destruction
and creation, ornament, beauty,

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.980
and even protection.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.770
So I could go on with
these collapsed binaries.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.710
We could talk about transparency
and opacity, presence

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.930
and absence, memory
and oblivion.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.230
In each case, what's
remarkable about these prints,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.600
I think, is that
they manage to effect

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.680
a constantly switching
circuit of energy and value.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.080
They created a certain
kind of reversibility

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.710
in the vectors of power
that run through them.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.590
And I want to close these
short remarks by pointing out

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.560
that this reversibility
extends very deeply

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.590
into the heart of this
project to the very role

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.630
and position of the women who
are named in these prints.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.990
We're meant to see the
Beauties as portraits of women.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.920
The names are like titles.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.160
And we see the boards as
representing the women

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.740
to whom they refer.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.650
So we might naturally
envision a print like Sapphire

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.520
here on the left as a picture
of a woman, perhaps a woman

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.710
like the woman on the
right, who was captured

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.680
at the turn of the 20th century
in a documentary photograph

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.510
from the Hampton
School where she was

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.880
being trained as a domestic.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.780
But does this board really
represent Sapphire, picture

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.880
her, stand in for her?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.530
I think not only, not
entirely, and not necessarily.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.870
Let's imagine the
following scenario.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.460
Sapphire is ironing
a dress shirt

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.750
for the white man for whom she
goes on to work as a domestic.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.860
She places the wrinkled shirt
on the board and begins.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.610
At this point, whom does
that ironing board represent?

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.560
Here in the actual
scene of pressing,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.570
for whom does that
ironing board stand?

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.672
Of course, then it doesn't
stand for Sapphire.

00:12:10.672 --> 00:12:12.630
It doesn't stand for her
body, but for the body

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.480
of her employer, the body
that will wear that shirt.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.600
In this case, he comes
from the Nordstrom website.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.670
The board's neck stands for
his neck or arms or shoulders,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.950
its back for his back
or chest or side.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.650
From this perspective, Sapphire
is not the ironing board.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.620
She's more like the artist
working upon the board,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.630
wielding the creative
and dangerous powers

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.950
of heat and pressure.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.280
And in fact, her work with the
iron is a lot like printmaking.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.470
She transforms material
through pressure,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.045
moving fluidly between
two and three dimensions.

00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:45.420
As she folds the shirt, turns
it inside out, and presses,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.850
she develops a really
keen understanding

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.700
of reversal and
inversion, symmetry.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.065
All of these are very typical
as well of printmaking.

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:56.940
So Sapphire's name at
the bottom of her print

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.130
may seem to function as a title.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.330
But it is also, I
think, a signature.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.500
Sapphire is not just the
printed, but the printer;

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.410
not just a figure, but
a figurative artist.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.540
These prints, I think,
represent not just

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.210
the sufferance of these women,
but also their knowledge

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.980
and their creativity
and their power.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.410
If I've done
anything here, I hope

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.840
it is to suggest that
these prints ultimately

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.770
refuse any kind of single
or simple interpretations.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.700
They require a lot of time.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.640
And they also require a whole
community of interpreters.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.710
And this is what we've set out
to enable in this exhibition

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.890
here at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.920
The Radcliffe Institute is an
institute for advanced study.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.650
But I also like to think of it
as an institute for advancing

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.260
study, for opening
up discussion,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.980
for raising questions that
have not yet been answered,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.590
and especially for seeding new
kinds of questions and research

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.180
among students and community
members at Harvard and beyond.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.070
We do this in several
different ways.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.690
And several of them are
going to be active here

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.960
through the next couple of
months in this exhibition.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.780
First of all, we have
what we call a gallery

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.280
series for which
we invite faculty,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.770
staff, and students to
produce performances,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.930
lectures, readings in the
gallery responding to the work

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.710
from all of their many
different disciplinary angles.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.320
We'll have nearly one of
these events every week

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.110
for the next few months.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.810
And there is somewhere--

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.380
I have a list of these events.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.030
You can check in the gallery.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.680
We will have this list.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.300
It's also on the gallery
website, OnViewAtRadcliffe.org.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.580
And you can get a sense of
the different events that

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.330
will be happening.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.160
We'll have everything
from a discussion

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.350
with a South African artist
to a dance performance

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.060
by HipHopEx director,
Aysha Upchurch.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.600
So again, see the site for the
many different gallery events

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.690
that we'll be having.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.890
We also encourage extensive
curricular engagement

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.180
with the work.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.080
We have several classes
coming through the gallery.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.590
If you are a professor
or a teacher locally

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.202
and you'd like to bring your
class, please let us know.

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:21.910
We are very eager to
have as many classes

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.860
come through this
gallery as possible.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.640
We've also created a
resource that we're

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.630
happy to distribute to anyone
who's interested that includes

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.260
a set of primary
sources, materials

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.810
here at Harvard and the
various different collections

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.600
that students might
use in their research,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.540
so everything from a book
at the Schlesinger Library

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.190
titled A Man's Shirt is a
Woman's Problem to African art

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.120
objects at the Peabody
Museum, prints and drawings

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.860
at the Harvard Art Museums.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.200
So please contact us
if you are interested.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.810
And you can go, again,
to OnViewAtRadcliffe.org.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.290
Also, we have our booklet
which is available for free

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.520
in the gallery.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.710
You'll all be getting one
by the end of the evening.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.350
And this includes
an essay that goes

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.190
into a great deal of detail
about how the prints were made.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.720
OK, so now let me
get to the good part.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.140
Let me introduce our guests.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.410
Of course, in a sense I've
already introduced Willie Cole.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.740
But here is some further
information about him.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.220
He is, of course, a world
renowned print maker, but also

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.800
a sculptor.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.250
He studied here in
these parts originally

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.037
at the Boston University
College of Fine Arts.

00:16:40.037 --> 00:16:41.870
He also studied at the
School of Visual Arts

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.940
in New York and the Art
Students League of New York.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.150
His honors include the
David C. Driskell Prize,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.870
the Saint-Gaudens Fellowship, a
Joan Mitchell Foundation grant,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.950
and an artist residency at
the Studio Museum in Harlem.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.740
His work has been
exhibited and collected

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.580
by institutions
around the world,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.730
including the British
Museum, the Museum of Modern

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.770
Art, the Newark Museum,
the St. Louis Art

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.900
Museum, and many more.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.720
And he lives and works
in Mine Hill, New Jersey.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.730
I'm also very happy
to welcome tonight

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.540
Cole Rogers, who is the
artistic director and master

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.510
printer at Highpoint
Editions in Minneapolis.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.420
He invited Willie Cole to
produce work at the studio

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.720
and collaborated with him on
the conception and development

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.280
of the Beauties.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.130
He spent many years as the print
shop director and printmaking

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.610
coordinator at the Minneapolis
College of Art and Design

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.890
where he taught and
shaped curriculum.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.420
Previously, he was
a senior printer

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.450
at the legendary Tamarind
Institute in New Mexico.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.230
He earned his BFA in printmaking
from the University of Alabama

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.710
at Birmingham, an MFA in
printmaking from Ohio State

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.520
University, and a Master Printer
Certificate from the Tamarind

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.460
Institute in Albuquerque.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.190
Please join me in welcoming
Willie Cole and Cole

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.330
Rogers to the stage.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.560
Welcome.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.080
- Don't look.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.130
- OK, so let's get the
complicated question

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.960
of names out of the way.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.570
We have Willie Cole
and Cole Rogers.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.180
So I'm just going to stick--

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.182
we're going to do this
on a first name basis,

00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:28.390
if that's all right with you.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.270
So you'll be Willie
and you'll be Cole.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.790
- Actually, my first
name is Willis.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.690
- Is it really?

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.030
- Yes.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.700
- Really?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.780
- Cole is my middle name.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.860
- OK, let's not even.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:43.250
Let's not even get there.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.570
So I'm really happy to have
both of you here this evening,

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.090
because I think it's really
important that we think

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.570
about the Beauties as prints.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.490
I think it's very
important to recognize

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.430
the importance of the print
making process to this project.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.220
And I've been thinking, would
these work in any other medium?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.140
Would they work as
photographs or painting

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.170
or even as ready made
battered ironing boards?

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.920
And I don't think that they
would, because in so many ways,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.110
the making of these works,
this application of pressure

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.860
really ties into all of these
cognates around pressure

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.180
and oppression that are so
much part of this project.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.270
So it's really a thrill to
have you both here so that we

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.300
can focus on these questions.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.130
I want to begin with a
question first for you, Willie,

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.230
having to do with the
naming of the prints.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.800
And I'm just going to
read the names of all 28

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.880
of these prints--

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.710
Anna Mae, Bertha Mae, Bessie,
Calpurnia, Carolina, Clara

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.930
Esther, Dot, Emma, Eva Mae,
Fannie Mae, Ida Mae, Jane,

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.460
Jesse Mae, Jonny Mae, Lily,
Lucy, Lulabelle, Mammy, Matti

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.440
Lee, Pearl, Queen, Rose, Ruth,
Sapphire, Sarah, Savannah,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.230
Willy Mae, and Zetty.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:07.490
Can you talk us through
the naming of these prints,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.090
what these names
mean to you, and why

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.270
you felt that they should
be attached to these prints?

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.810
- Yes.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:20.200
Upon viewing these boards,
when you look at a work of art,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.060
it talks to you.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.060
You don't want to think
you know everything when

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.050
you're making a work of art.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.560
So the boards told me
what they were about.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.340
And one thing that stood
out in our conversation

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.230
was that they were about
women who have labored,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.960
women who have suffered,
women in my family.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.660
So I went through.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.740
I've known my family--

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.180
in my lifetime, I
have experienced

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.350
five or six generations.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.500
I knew my great grandmother
and my great-great grandmother

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.390
and of course all their friends.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.252
So the names come from
that group of women.

00:20:57.252 --> 00:21:00.160
The second part of
the question was--

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.410
- That was the whole question.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.610
Yeah, I mean, I have
some other parts to it.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.610
Did you look at the
prints and then name them

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.170
based on some qualities
of the prints or--

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:11.670
- No.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.300
- --was it more--

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.630
- I didn't.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.255
- --accidental?

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:16.590
- I didn't, because
I'm very into jazz

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.972
and just you know the song.

00:21:18.972 --> 00:21:20.430
But when your solo
comes, you don't

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.398
want to play the melody again.

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:26.280
So I just mixed it
all up and had faith

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.530
that it was going to work out.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.155
- Great, great.

00:21:28.155 --> 00:21:30.950
And some of them are names
of people in your family.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.930
But as I understand,
some are actually

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.130
not necessarily associated
with specific people.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:35.960
- Right.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.240
Most are family or
friends of family.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.820
But there's some that
are just of that era,

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.440
of the era of my
great grandmother

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.202
where everybody had those
names with Mae on the end

00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:51.380
or some had Bible names,
like Ruth, et cetera.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.720
- And some named
after places, right?

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.525
- Yeah, so you know a lot.

00:21:55.525 --> 00:21:57.310
Two are places.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.547
The two places would
be my mother's family

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:00.380
being from Georgia--

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.150
Savannah, Georgia--
and my father's family

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.070
being from North Carolina.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.480
So one board is Carolina.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.252
Another one is Savannah.

00:22:08.252 --> 00:22:09.960
- Cole, maybe you
could talk a little bit

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.710
about what it took to get
the names on the paper,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.380
because they weren't
printed at the same time,

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.420
as I understand
it, as the boards.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.630
- That was a fairly
simple process.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.070
But I think-- it was just what's
called relief printing where

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.750
we basically printed some type
that was printed at the end

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.890
after the printing process.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:36.900
But I think it was a
little bit more interesting

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.730
trying to figure
out how to do it

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.630
as far as what technique,
because we do use the four

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.480
different media and whether or
not it was going to be a screen

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.450
print that sat on top or whether
or not it was going to be

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.260
pressed into the paper the same
way that the rest of the image

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.930
was or how that
would be printed.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.080
And after playing around
a little bit, which

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.110
is pretty much so what we
did even at the beginning

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.140
before the boards
were started-- we

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.300
were playing with some
different processes.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.510
And we came up with using type.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.640
And anybody that
does letter press

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.540
is familiar with the idea of
the kiss impression, which

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:22.140
is a very light impression,
which just touches the paper.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.690
And it reads fully,
but it doesn't indent.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.650
It doesn't go into the
paper in the same way

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.630
that the rest of the image did.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.300
And it was just-- it seemed
like a very poetic way

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:39.410
of naming these women
after the intaglio section.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.930
The rest of the section was kind
of their rough life and kind

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.980
of the weathered
bit of the intaglio.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.440
- No, I think it's
especially interesting

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.520
the way the prints come into
the studio violently in essence,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.250
but they leave with
this kiss impression.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.000
And the name sits
lightly on the paper.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.980
Can you both, I wonder,
talk a little bit

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:12.660
about your
collaborative process?

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.920
How were these made?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.000
How did you collaborate?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.620
How did you see your
individual roles?

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.340
Many people may not be fully
familiar with how important

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.160
the process of collaboration
is in creating a print

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.170
project like this.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.410
- Well, I'm not a master
of print making techniques.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.290
I always feel honored when
people say I'm a print maker.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.778
I had a chance to be a keynote
speaker at a print conference.

00:24:38.778 --> 00:24:41.070
And the only way I could do
that and feel good about it

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.900
was to acknowledge all the
print makers who helped me out

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.880
over the years.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.650
And this is actually my
favorite print maker.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.850
So the collaboration is
an act of submission.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.080
Let the ego go.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.180
Don't think you know everything.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:03.090
And be eager to learn, to
witness, and to assist.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:10.310
So I was a big fan of the shop
and just glad to be there.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:15.950
My history included the iron
as an icon or as an image.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:22.220
So that's what I brought
to the collaboration.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.080
If I remember correctly,
Cole's what he called play

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.390
with the ironing board helped
to reveal what was possible.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.048
And from there, we just
tried to stay in the mix.

00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:37.465
And of course, you
don't know what

00:25:37.465 --> 00:25:39.048
it's going to look
like until the end,

00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:40.430
even though you think you do.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.880
Once we saw that,
I felt and I knew--

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.570
had a better sense of
where we were going.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.990
But it wasn't until I
saw them all on the wall

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.120
that they really
began to talk to me.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.580
And even today they've
revealed things

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.867
to me they didn't reveal before,
like really emotional stuff

00:25:57.867 --> 00:25:59.200
that I hadn't touched on before.

00:26:01.973 --> 00:26:02.890
- How about you, Cole?

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:07.480
- I think the role of a
really good collaborator

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.725
in my position who's basically
a technician is to stay out

00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:18.010
of the way, to know when
to get in there and guide,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.880
but also that the reins need to
be in the hands of the artist,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.650
that you hand off things.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:28.270
It needs to be very much
so the artist experience

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.060
with the materials that
leads you to the end,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.450
that you can start out
with too rigid of an idea

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.260
or you have a printer
who's very rigid

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.780
and wants to limit
the artist and wants

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.130
to make everything easy.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.930
And they're trying to figure
out things really early.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:54.250
And you really need to kind of
let things blow up at first.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.660
If everything that
you try is a success,

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.980
you're not trying hard enough.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.190
Your research is not really
pushing the envelope.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.520
And so it's pretty much
though getting in there

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.505
and giving your artist
options, seeing what develops,

00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:12.880
and trying to stay
out of the way

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.470
and letting the project
develop along its own line.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.800
We tried etching
lithography, wood cut,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.690
screen printing at the beginning
just to get our feet wet.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:30.250
And the project revealed
itself on its own.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.820
- Can you take us into a little
bit more detail about some

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.660
of the blow-ups or failures?

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.910
What were you imagining
you would do when you--

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.720
- Well, it was--

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.330
- --arrived?

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:49.540
- --a compositional evolution,
because I had done a scorch--

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.700
not a scorch, but an
ironing board previously.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.940
They've represented
exclusively a ship.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.890
My concept coming
into the studio

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.880
was to make the port where
all the ships had come in.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.930
- Oh wow.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.763
So it really was a--

00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:05.430
- So it evolved.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.680
- --ship project at first.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.187
- Yes, yes.

00:28:07.187 --> 00:28:07.770
- Interesting.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.530
And so how did it turn from
ships to all the things

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.280
that they are now?

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.800
- Seeing a single image
by itself was enough.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.690
You didn't need to have,
like, 40 ships docked

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:24.340
in a pool of water.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.410
That's illustration.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.690
To me, that's the big
challenge in fine art today

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:33.305
is I know it's changed a bit.

00:28:33.305 --> 00:28:35.430
But I still make a distinction
between illustration

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.930
in fine art.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.350
But a lot of fine art nowadays
is illustration to me.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.440
So this became fine
art at the moment

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.630
that we were to
isolate, take them out

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:50.760
of the imagined scenario,
come up with a story.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.622
But that's like coming
in and closing the door.

00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:56.830
You want to walk in the room
and leave the door open.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.830
Let other stuff come in.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.506
Let some breeze blow
and all that stuff.

00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:02.430
That's what it was for me.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.150
- Well, the initial
attempts at printing off

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.180
of an ironing board, really
didn't know if it would work.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.880
And it was pretty beautiful.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.840
So we went out and
sourced as many as we

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.260
could find from the Goodwill
and other secondhand stores.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.840
And we were only able
to find a handful.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.730
And Willie ran out of time.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.890
We'd tried the lithograph and
wood cut and other things.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.435
And so we sourced
more, flattened them.

00:29:25.435 --> 00:29:30.230
And so when Willie came
back and saw the individuals

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.100
lining the studio for him
to choose which ones to use,

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.080
it just developed on its own.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.930
All of a sudden,
the initial idea,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.830
while wonderful and may
return to it one day,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.290
was kind of secondary.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.970
- Yeah, yeah.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.240
You had mentioned when we
were talking back in November

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.660
that originally you'd gone
to Home Depot or something

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.560
to get the boards there and
found that all ironing boards

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.100
that you can buy today now
have the same exact structure

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.830
and patterns of the
steam holes and so forth.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.280
And so it was actually a
huge project going around

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.520
to thrift shops
and Craigslist just

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.825
to get a set of
vintage ironing boards.

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:14.450
So that's something
to think about too,

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.180
that all of these
prints come from ironing

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.040
boards that have already a
long history of domestic work.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.500
Someone has ironed
on these boards.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:30.200
So there's all of that memory
in the metal as well, I think.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.400
And one of the
interesting things

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.220
that I find about print
residencies like this

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.820
is that you don't always
fly out to Minneapolis

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.145
and stay there for two
weeks and then finish

00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:45.020
everything and leave.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.580
In this case, you
went three times?

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.080
Twice?

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.780
- Yeah, that's--

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.280
- Think so.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.322
- He remembers it better.

00:30:52.322 --> 00:30:55.040
- So there's a rhythm
where you're working

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.768
and then you have a long
period away from the studio.

00:30:59.768 --> 00:31:00.560
What was that like?

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.863
Were you able-- were you
thinking about the process

00:31:03.863 --> 00:31:05.030
while doing your other work?

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.850
Did you feel that
this on and off moment

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.440
for work and contemplation
affected your project?

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.480
- Well, I think that walking
away from a work of art--

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.030
and you know, I'm
on two tracks now.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.572
Like, I'm at a point
in my life where

00:31:18.572 --> 00:31:20.220
nothing makes sense anymore.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:26.060
I'm redefining--
maybe I am re-creating

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.150
the future I imagined
for myself as an artist.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.100
But I'm expected to be in
the present that was my past.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.190
So it's kind of a confusing
place that I'm in right now.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.830
But walking away
from these pieces

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.490
and coming back weeks
later was a good thing,

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:48.740
because it took me away
from my projected narrative

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.175
and allowed me what they call
fresh eyes to see it new.

00:31:53.175 --> 00:31:55.970
Most of the time-- like, I have
some paintings in my studio

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.110
now that I started.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.180
And then I had to
go away for a month.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.430
When I came back, it was
like starting all over again.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.847
I hadn't been able to finish
them, so just start them over

00:32:03.847 --> 00:32:04.476
again.

00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:07.190
But fortunately in
this case, the fire

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.250
was still turned up, even
though I wasn't in the kitchen.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.340
So they just kept cooking.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.885
And they made it.

00:32:13.885 --> 00:32:14.510
- That's right.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.960
And what are you doing when
Willie's not in the studio?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.570
- Well, we usually have
three to four artists a year

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.450
that come in.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.240
And so we juggle a lot
of different projects.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:30.290
And ours is not a residency
that's a set length of time.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.750
Early on, I became really
frustrated with a lot

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.450
of the studios I was working
in that had set residencies.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.390
So to invite an artist
out for two weeks--

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.410
all your artists, two weeks--

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.730
is an artificial limitation
from the beginning.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.290
And what if one more week is
going to turn a project around?

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.110
Or maybe the artist only
needs a certain amount

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.540
of time working
and then to go back

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.450
and there could be
a gestation period

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.970
and then come back
and bring that.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.943
And the idea of having
these set residencies

00:33:02.943 --> 00:33:04.110
doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:09.710
So I think it's problematic
for us scheduling.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.340
Our calendar is
constantly in turmoil.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.620
But I think it's really
important that an artist does

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.920
get a chance to back away,
that there's not this two weeks

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.440
and you've got to be
signing the [? BET, ?]

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.180
which is very
common in most shops

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.620
that you have to have this
set, or maybe it's not cooked

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.020
or maybe it needs
to be thrown away.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.820
Maybe it needs to
be started again.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.230
So I think it's helpful
when an artist gets a chance

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.830
to look at it.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.870
And we go back to
other projects.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.090
And we're printing and
doing other editioning

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.190
while we're waiting for
Willie to come back.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.230
And we've gotten a
little bit of distance.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.380
All of a sudden, we can
come back to a piece.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.400
And we weren't under
a time constraint.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.140
And we say, we could
do this differently

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.190
or we could do this better.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.560
And so I think it's really
helpful to have those breaks.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.390
- And that approach gave
me a lot of freedom,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:06.100
not just physical but
emotional and spiritual,

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.650
because this is all about women.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.889
I was raised to be polite
and not to take too much.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:15.159
So it's like, you mean
if the first one didn't

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.860
work we could try it again?

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.610
So that was all beautiful.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.115
That took a lot of
pressure off me as a human.

00:34:24.115 --> 00:34:25.600
- That's terrific.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.520
So these have-- really,
this is the first time

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.375
that the set of Beauties
have been shown together

00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:33.250
since they were made.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.860
They were made in 2012.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.219
And they were shown in
the gallery at Highpoint

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.310
in Minneapolis at that
time of their making.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.810
But this is the first time
they've all been back together.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.719
It's the first time
you've seen them

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.429
on the walls since that moment.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.350
And I just wonder--

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.590
you mentioned that you're
seeing new things in them,

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.062
that you're responding
differently to them now.

00:34:56.062 --> 00:34:57.520
I wonder if maybe
both of you could

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.940
talk a little bit about how
they've changed since 2012.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.990
A lot of things have
happened since 2012.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.510
On my part, I felt that
it was important to bring

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.480
these particular
prints together now.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.380
They seem incredibly present
and urgent at the moment,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.730
perhaps prescient in 2012.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.470
- I hate to begin sentences
with I think and I feel,

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.880
because those are not facts.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.620
Those are feelings.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.000
But I can't help it right now
and say that in the first round

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.030
when they were
exhibited at Highpoint,

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.740
because I had the history of
connecting Africa to irons

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.700
and ironing boards.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:48.050
And it was-- all of my feelings
and thoughts were outside

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.430
of my personal experience.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.520
I had already been branded
Willie the Scorch in the art

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.500
world.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.710
So it was just me
doing my thing.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.630
But I guess as years went on
and maybe I became more open

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.710
in myself, I began to make
more personal associations

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.250
that I didn't make initially.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.800
And I don't know if--

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.240
everybody-- you
process information

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.610
through your own filters.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:22.520
But I think I just became
more open to my own filters

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.160
and have been able to
see them in a much more

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.322
emotional and visceral
way than I did initially.

00:36:28.322 --> 00:36:29.780
And they hit me
hard the first time

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.880
I saw them when we
first created them.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:39.263
But today you all are lucky
I'm not sitting here crying.

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:39.930
Maybe I'm lucky.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.070
- It's OK to cry in the gallery.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.780
I'll just say that.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.520
It's already happened
today a few times.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.640
So-- how about you, Cole?

00:36:54.118 --> 00:36:55.660
- The first time
that we showed them,

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.390
we showed them in a
very different context

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.920
and a very different lighting.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.100
And I just thought that
they were the greatest

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.090
things in the world.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.820
And then I see them here and
there as we've sold them.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.310
And we've shown five at
a time here and there.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.900
But all of a sudden
seeing them again,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.100
it was like a family reunion.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:24.160
It was like-- there's something
different about the context,

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.140
being able to see all of
them and reconnecting.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.850
It's kind of--
sounds sappy, but it

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:33.800
is much like family,
somebody that you're

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.230
very close to that you
don't see for a long time

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:42.192
and then you see in the context
of a group or a community.

00:37:42.192 --> 00:37:43.400
It's great to see them again.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.470
- Just seeing, as
an artist, work

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.090
from the past, even
the recent past,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.370
is kind of like reconnecting
with your children

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.405
or your family.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:58.140
I often feel removed from
the work once it's gone.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.720
So it's a big reunion, as he
stated, when you see it again.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.365
You don't know if the work has
matured or you have matured.

00:38:07.365 --> 00:38:11.040
But you see it and feel it
differently, at least I do.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.040
- I think it's very interesting
the way the word family

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.290
is being used to
refer to these prints,

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.740
because you wouldn't normally
think about printmaking, which

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.340
is understood usually as this
simple process of copying

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.000
or reproduction or
seriality, as being something

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.090
that has quite such a sense of
personality and individuality.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.820
But these, I think, really
mediate between their role

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.517
as parts of a set,
parts of a series.

00:38:41.517 --> 00:38:42.600
You walk into the gallery.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.817
It's all ironing boards.

00:38:43.817 --> 00:38:45.150
They're all about the same size.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.370
They're all made pretty
much the same way.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.240
So you have a very strong sense
of their serial production.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.890
And yet each is profoundly
individualized and

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:56.600
individuated.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.850
And so I think the family is--

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.240
- Just like us.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.060
We're all the same.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.410
- Yeah, I mean the family,
I think, makes sense.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.327
- But we're uniquely--

00:39:01.327 --> 00:39:04.620
- It's a series of
individuals that are related.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.930
But yet we actually are only
able to show 24 of the 28

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.720
in the gallery, because
that's all the room we had.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.420
So I went out to
Minneapolis in November

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.080
and had to decide which four
would not be in the show.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.830
And it felt like cutting
people from a team.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.450
It felt deeply personal.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:30.720
So there are four that are not
actually in the exhibition.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.570
But you get a good
sense of the seriality

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.810
and the full set of these
prints when you walk in there.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.900
And I should also mention that
after this exhibition closes

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.370
in June, you'll still be able
to see some of the prints

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:47.640
on the Harvard campus, because
the Harvard Art Museums owns

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.100
five of the prints.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.370
So you can always
reconnect with them,

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.623
study them, work with them even
beyond the run of this show

00:39:56.623 --> 00:39:58.290
just by going to the
Harvard Art Museums

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.040
and asking to see them
in the study center.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.300
So they will remain available.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.820
I just have one more
question and then

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.240
we can move to the gallery,
and that is, Willie,

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.580
you've talked about
your previous work

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:19.170
and looking back on work that
you're not actively involved

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.070
in at the moment.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:24.990
At the moment, you have been
working very intensively

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.960
around ecological
concerns and questions.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.890
You've done a lot of work
with plastic water bottles,

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.540
the ubiquitous environmental
scourge of our age

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.450
where you're transforming them
in much the same way you've

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.060
transformed these prints.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.960
And I wonder if you
see any connection

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.490
between your previous
work around ironing

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.970
and this new work that has
to do with the flow of water

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.470
and the different
kinds of elements.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.970
- Yes.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.200
Well, my interests
or my habit is

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.870
to work with objects that
have had intimate contact

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.510
with human beings.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.040
I believe those
things that Einstein

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.980
said about wherever you go,
you leave yourself there,

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.670
because 99% of dust
in your house is you.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:22.810
And you're not a stagnant
collection of particles.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.440
You're a living
collection of particles.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.640
So the things you touch
hold onto part of you.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.360
So my interest then is
to extract or reveal

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.780
the spirit in any object I use.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.270
And there's no technique
for that other than--

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:43.210
I guess actually the technique
for that is a desire to do it.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.770
And the desire to do it
informs you when it's done,

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.900
because you see it.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.830
So the water bottle
to me is even

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:57.810
a more obvious vehicle of human
energy, like say the bottle

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.500
itself is like--

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.790
a water bottle is
basically life in a coffin.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.020
It's like the
thing that gives us

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.150
life is being transported to
us in the thing that gives us

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.270
death.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.700
- Right.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.362
So right off the bat, there's
this kind of similarity

00:42:17.362 --> 00:42:18.570
in the way the binaries work.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.070
Exactly.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.510
- But they have this
spiritual connection to me.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.700
- Yes, that's great.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.480
All right, I think we
should let everyone get in

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.310
to see the works themselves.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.400
Remind you, we're not going
to do question and answer now.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.037
We're not going to be
doing any milling about.

00:42:35.037 --> 00:42:37.620
We're going to try to have this
be a transition where everyone

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.670
can get over to the gallery.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:45.600
And then you'll be able to ask
any further questions of Cole

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.740
and Willie when we get there.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.160
But for now, please
join me in thanking them

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.210
for this discussion.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.860
[APPLAUSE]
