where we're specifically gonna be
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770
where we're specifically gonna be
forgetting things but it's the end of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
forgetting things but it's the end of
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.490
forgetting things but it's the end of
the barbecue so hopefully we'll actually

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
the barbecue so hopefully we'll actually
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.380
the barbecue so hopefully we'll actually
learn a few new techniques which will

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
learn a few new techniques which will
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.660
learn a few new techniques which will
just replace that knowledge rather than

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
just replace that knowledge rather than
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670
just replace that knowledge rather than
totally void it out we'll save that one

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
totally void it out we'll save that one
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.939
totally void it out we'll save that one
for later but really trying to reduce

for later but really trying to reduce
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800

when we actually need the storage

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
when we actually need the storage
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540

permission so this would be write and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
android framework in android support
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.450

library and will be kind of talking

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
library and will be kind of talking
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.350
library and will be kind of talking
about lot of those things today

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360
about lot of those things today
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.399
about lot of those things today
so we're gonna be forgetting things

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409
so we're gonna be forgetting things
 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.289
so we're gonna be forgetting things
we're gonna forget the storage

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
we're gonna forget the storage
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.630
we're gonna forget the storage
permission but to really forget it we

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
permission but to really forget it we
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190
permission but to really forget it we
need to know kind of what was it giving

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
need to know kind of what was it giving
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160
need to know kind of what was it giving
us in the first place so let's start at

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
us in the first place so let's start at
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810
us in the first place so let's start at
the beginning kind of where can we

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
the beginning kind of where can we
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.160
the beginning kind of where can we
actually store data so first there's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
actually store data so first there's
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.679
actually store data so first there's
this concept of app specific storage

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
this concept of app specific storage
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.319
this concept of app specific storage
space so as you'd expect these are

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
space so as you'd expect these are
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.530
space so as you'd expect these are
directories which are specific to your

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
directories which are specific to your
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.550
directories which are specific to your
app and to each user now one important

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
app and to each user now one important
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.780
app and to each user now one important
thing about all of these directories

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
thing about all of these directories
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.619
thing about all of these directories
that will be covered here is that

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629
that will be covered here is that
 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.630
that will be covered here is that
they're all completely emptied and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
they're all completely emptied and
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550
they're all completely emptied and
destroyed when your app is uninstalled

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
destroyed when your app is uninstalled
 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.149
destroyed when your app is uninstalled
so it's really easy to say okay well I

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159
so it's really easy to say okay well I
 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.800
so it's really easy to say okay well I
have now completely uninstalled the app

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
have now completely uninstalled the app
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.920
have now completely uninstalled the app
and now data associated with it isn't

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
and now data associated with it isn't
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.489
and now data associated with it isn't
left lingering on my device there's kind

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:29.499
left lingering on my device there's kind
 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.500
left lingering on my device there's kind
of two main types of these directories

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510
of two main types of these directories
 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.349
of two main types of these directories
there's private directories stored on

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359
there's private directories stored on
 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.050
there's private directories stored on
internal storage so these are accessible

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
internal storage so these are accessible
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.770
internal storage so these are accessible
via get filed ER and get caster so as

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
via get filed ER and get caster so as
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.979
via get filed ER and get caster so as
you can imagine get filed or for kind of

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
you can imagine get filed or for kind of
 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.369
you can imagine get filed or for kind of
actual real files user data well get

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379
actual real files user data well get
 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.399
actual real files user data well get
cached or is more for caching files say

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409
cached or is more for caching files say
 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.199
cached or is more for caching files say
if you were to download large images

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209
if you were to download large images
 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.059
if you were to download large images
from the internet this would be a good

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069
from the internet this would be a good
 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.670
from the internet this would be a good
place to store them because when you run

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
place to store them because when you run
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.640
place to store them because when you run
low on memory this space can be cleared

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
low on memory this space can be cleared
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.069
low on memory this space can be cleared
without actually harming users data now

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079
without actually harming users data now
 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.959
without actually harming users data now
the other side of things are these

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969
the other side of things are these
 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.559
the other side of things are these
concept of external directories and I'll

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569
concept of external directories and I'll
 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.729
concept of external directories and I'll
use air quotes because they're not

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
use air quotes because they're not
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.539
use air quotes because they're not
actually external on many devices like

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
actually external on many devices like
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.550
actually external on many devices like
Nexus devices they're actually on the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
Nexus devices they're actually on the
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.219
Nexus devices they're actually on the
same flash drive as the internal storage

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229
same flash drive as the internal storage
 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.689
same flash drive as the internal storage
it's simply just a different partition

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699
it's simply just a different partition
 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.890
it's simply just a different partition
of the same space but in all cases it's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
of the same space but in all cases it's
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.679
of the same space but in all cases it's
actually that those external directories

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689
actually that those external directories
 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.719
actually that those external directories
are the ones that are readable by all

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:33.729
are the ones that are readable by all
 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.149
are the ones that are readable by all
apps that have these storage permissions

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159
apps that have these storage permissions
 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.539
apps that have these storage permissions
so no necessarily want to put sensitive

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549
so no necessarily want to put sensitive
 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.159
so no necessarily want to put sensitive
information in those folders because

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169
information in those folders because
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.879
information in those folders because
they are world readable however for our

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889
they are world readable however for our
 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.699
they are world readable however for our
cases you can't actually do a little bit

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709
cases you can't actually do a little bit
 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.420
cases you can't actually do a little bit
more with them so these come in the face

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430
more with them so these come in the face
 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.839
more with them so these come in the face
of external files directory which is

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849
of external files directory which is
 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.369
of external files directory which is
very similar to our file directory for

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379
very similar to our file directory for
 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.259
very similar to our file directory for
user data on this external partition and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
user data on this external partition and
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.740
user data on this external partition and
in KitKat

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750
in KitKat
 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.229
in KitKat
we actually introduced the ability to

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
we actually introduced the ability to
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.629
we actually introduced the ability to
have multiple external files directories

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639
have multiple external files directories
 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.369
have multiple external files directories
so in this case you could have one

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379
so in this case you could have one
 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.619
so in this case you could have one
external file on that internal slash

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629
external file on that internal slash
 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.199

external storage and another on like

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209
external storage and another on like
 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.839
external storage and another on like
your SD card so this will be returned by

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849
your SD card so this will be returned by
 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.009
your SD card so this will be returned by
the pluralized form of the method

similarly for cache directories same

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
similarly for cache directories same
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.170

type of thing and that also in lollipop

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
type of thing and that also in lollipop
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.420
type of thing and that also in lollipop
we added external media directory

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430
we added external media directory
 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.730
we added external media directory
these are directories where you can

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740
these are directories where you can
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.870
these are directories where you can
write files too that are then read by

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
write files too that are then read by
 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.879
write files too that are then read by
the media scanner so this is what allows

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889
the media scanner so this is what allows
 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.640
the media scanner so this is what allows
other apps to get all of the images and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650
other apps to get all of the images and
 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.070
other apps to get all of the images and
videos and pictures that are in that

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080
videos and pictures that are in that
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.140
videos and pictures that are in that
folder and then make them available to

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
folder and then make them available to
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.650
folder and then make them available to
other apps via the media store API now

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660
other apps via the media store API now
 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.680
other apps via the media store API now
the best part about all of these

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690
the best part about all of these
 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.360
the best part about all of these
directories is that they don't actually

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
directories is that they don't actually
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.279
directories is that they don't actually
require permissions on newer devices so

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289
require permissions on newer devices so
 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.350
require permissions on newer devices so
the other directory which I really want

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360
the other directory which I really want
 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.270
the other directory which I really want
to mention also for game developers

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280
to mention also for game developers
 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.089
to mention also for game developers
especially far as the extension file

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099
especially far as the extension file
 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.909

files these are actually shared across
 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.510
files these are actually shared across
all users so if you have a huge large

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520

installed multiple times so the other

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919
installed multiple times so the other
 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.950

part of this right those were app

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960
part of this right those were app
 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.749

specific directories the next part is

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759
specific directories the next part is
 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.899
specific directories the next part is
public storage so these are the

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909
public storage so these are the
 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.350
public storage so these are the
permanent files that survive your app

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360

being uninstalled now for many users
 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.379
being uninstalled now for many users
this actually means that those files are

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389
this actually means that those files are
 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.420
this actually means that those files are
never going to be touched never going to

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430

many more users are just using the apps

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880
many more users are just using the apps
 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.189
many more users are just using the apps
on their phone and don't actually

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199
on their phone and don't actually
 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.170
on their phone and don't actually
realize that this public storage exists

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180
realize that this public storage exists
 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.140
realize that this public storage exists
now from that perspective again this is

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150
now from that perspective again this is
 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.480
now from that perspective again this is
stored I'm kind of that external but

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490
stored I'm kind of that external but
 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.999
stored I'm kind of that external but
maybe not external space it's called

by get external storage directory right
 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.460
by get external storage directory right
but you probably shouldn't actually

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470
but you probably shouldn't actually
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.770
but you probably shouldn't actually
write files to that root directory right

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780
write files to that root directory right
 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.320
write files to that root directory right
it's like writing to C colon slash or

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330
it's like writing to C colon slash or
 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.909
it's like writing to C colon slash or

maybe not the best idea you can do it
 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.219
maybe not the best idea you can do it
but we'd much rather if you were writing

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229
but we'd much rather if you were writing
 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.040

separate from your private data so we
talked about kind of what all these

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340
talked about kind of what all these
 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.740
talked about kind of what all these

those directories so if you were
 

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.620
those directories so if you were
targeting pre KitKat you actually needed

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:12.630
targeting pre KitKat you actually needed
 

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.270
targeting pre KitKat you actually needed
those permissions even though they were

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280
those permissions even though they were
 

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.910
those permissions even though they were
app specific directories and we've

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:16.920
app specific directories and we've
 

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.490
app specific directories and we've
lifted that restriction as of KitKat so

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500
lifted that restriction as of KitKat so
 

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.740
lifted that restriction as of KitKat so
now you no longer need that awesome

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:21.750
now you no longer need that awesome
 

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.210
now you no longer need that awesome
now that external user storage that

are not actually attributed to that user
right if a user goes in and says clear

going to be cleaned up
 

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.710
going to be cleaned up
and from a user's perspective they might

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720
and from a user's perspective they might
 

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.019
and from a user's perspective they might
not know which files go to which app or

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:03.029
not know which files go to which app or
 

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:07.100
not know which files go to which app or
which ones they can delete now the

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.110
which ones they can delete now the
 

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.329
which ones they can delete now the

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339
storage permission is even more
 

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:11.000
storage permission is even more
important in marshmallow because in

model the storage permission is
 

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.540
model the storage permission is
considered a dangerous permission that

considered a dangerous permission that
 

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.579
considered a dangerous permission that
means if you're targeting marshmallow

00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:19.589

and running on a 6.0 device you'll
 

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.010
and running on a 6.0 device you'll
actually need to request access to the

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420
storage permissions at runtime get this
 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.519
storage permissions at runtime get this
nice mildly scary-looking dialogue that

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:31.529
nice mildly scary-looking dialogue that
 

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.800
nice mildly scary-looking dialogue that

public external storage but you have to

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940
public external storage but you have to
 

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.730
public external storage but you have to

that's actually the right choice now if

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000
that's actually the right choice now if
 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.150
that's actually the right choice now if
you're saying well I only write to those

good there's actually a super easy way

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240
good there's actually a super easy way
 

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.660
good there's actually a super easy way
to remove storage permissions you have

00:09:59.660 --> 00:09:59.670
to remove storage permissions you have
 

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.680
to remove storage permissions you have
you can use Mac's SDK version max SDK

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:03.690
you can use Mac's SDK version max SDK
 

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.780
you can use Mac's SDK version max SDK
version just says I want to use this

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:05.790
version just says I want to use this
 

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.519
version just says I want to use this
permission but as of KitKat I don't need

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:10.529
permission but as of KitKat I don't need
 

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:13.490
permission but as of KitKat I don't need
it anymore I can safely remove it from

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500
it anymore I can safely remove it from
 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.620
it anymore I can safely remove it from
my manifest users won't be bothered by

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.630
my manifest users won't be bothered by
 

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.750
my manifest users won't be bothered by
it at install time I don't need to worry

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760
it at install time I don't need to worry
 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.780
it at install time I don't need to worry
about it for runtime permissions you do

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:20.790
about it for runtime permissions you do
 

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.090
about it for runtime permissions you do
this just by setting the max SDK version

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100
this just by setting the max SDK version
 

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.519
this just by setting the max SDK version
in your users permission in the manifest

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:25.529
in your users permission in the manifest
 

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:28.519
in your users permission in the manifest
and that's all you need to do to remove

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:28.529
and that's all you need to do to remove
 

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.650
and that's all you need to do to remove
the storage permission but still keep it

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660
the storage permission but still keep it
 

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.150
the storage permission but still keep it
around for those cases where you're

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160
around for those cases where you're
 

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.310
around for those cases where you're
running on an older device but you know

your life more difficult but really to
just make it so that you can balance

really understand what kinds of stories
 

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.260
really understand what kinds of stories
there are like if you asked a typical

there are like if you asked a typical
 

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.820
there are like if you asked a typical

that's a little bit harder than just a

that's a little bit harder than just a
yes-or-no kind of an answer now the one

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
yes-or-no kind of an answer now the one
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.360
yes-or-no kind of an answer now the one
thing is is that you really want to

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
thing is is that you really want to
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.680
thing is is that you really want to
avoid this right that's the whole reason

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:05.690
avoid this right that's the whole reason
 

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.920
avoid this right that's the whole reason
we're here so let's talk through some of

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:08.930
we're here so let's talk through some of
 

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.180
we're here so let's talk through some of
the ways where we can really actually

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.190
the ways where we can really actually
 

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.520
the ways where we can really actually
get a lot of this functionality right a

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:12.530
get a lot of this functionality right a
 

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.590
get a lot of this functionality right a
lot of that communication between apps

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600
lot of that communication between apps
 

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.120
lot of that communication between apps
without actually needing these

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.130
without actually needing these
 

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:21.460
without actually needing these
permissions so what what is this better

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.470
permissions so what what is this better
 

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.280
permissions so what what is this better
way is there a different thing to do and

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.290
way is there a different thing to do and
 

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.620
way is there a different thing to do and
it turns out that we have a whole

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:26.630
it turns out that we have a whole
 

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.250
it turns out that we have a whole
permissions model just for sharing

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:29.260
permissions model just for sharing
 

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.750
permissions model just for sharing
individual files via you our eyes now

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760
individual files via you our eyes now
 

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.390
individual files via you our eyes now
URI you might think of it as kind of

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.400
URI you might think of it as kind of
 

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.370
URI you might think of it as kind of
like a file path but it's actually a

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.380
like a file path but it's actually a
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.200
like a file path but it's actually a
little bit different because you can

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.210
little bit different because you can
 

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:46.000
little bit different because you can
apply URI based permissions to it now it

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.010
apply URI based permissions to it now it
 

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.590
apply URI based permissions to it now it
really kind of started back in the

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600
really kind of started back in the
 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.300
really kind of started back in the
beginning of Android with our intent

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:49.310
beginning of Android with our intent
 

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.250
beginning of Android with our intent
system that's the way of sending

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.260
system that's the way of sending
 

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.510
system that's the way of sending
information or

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:53.520
information or
 

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.060
information or
between different apps right you may say

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.070
between different apps right you may say
 

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.970
between different apps right you may say
like a start activity and passing an

00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980
like a start activity and passing an
 

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.710
like a start activity and passing an
intent and that's how you would then

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720
intent and that's how you would then
 

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.780
intent and that's how you would then
trigger another app to do things

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:02.790
trigger another app to do things
 

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.600
trigger another app to do things
these URI based permissions are attached

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:05.610
these URI based permissions are attached
 

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.900
these URI based permissions are attached
to that same infrastructure allowing one

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:08.910
to that same infrastructure allowing one
 

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.180
to that same infrastructure allowing one
app that does have the permission to

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.190
app that does have the permission to
 

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.360
app that does have the permission to
access some file or resource the ability

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.370
access some file or resource the ability
 

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.870
access some file or resource the ability
to then kind of forward grant a

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880
to then kind of forward grant a
 

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.750
to then kind of forward grant a
permission to another app that doesn't

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760
permission to another app that doesn't
 

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.570
permission to another app that doesn't
have permission by itself but via that

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:23.580
have permission by itself but via that
 

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.100
have permission by itself but via that
intent system they're able to then

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.110
intent system they're able to then
 

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.290
intent system they're able to then
suddenly get permission to just that

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300
suddenly get permission to just that
 

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.500
suddenly get permission to just that
specific file so this sounds like

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:30.510
specific file so this sounds like
 

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.630
specific file so this sounds like
exactly what we need to do many of the

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:32.640
exactly what we need to do many of the
 

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.300
exactly what we need to do many of the
operations between files say sharing or

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.310
operations between files say sharing or
 

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.190
operations between files say sharing or
something else that we'd normally use

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200
something else that we'd normally use
 

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.269
something else that we'd normally use
files for so there's actually two

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279
files for so there's actually two
 

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.010
files for so there's actually two
different ways of using ura based

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.020
different ways of using ura based
 

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.010
different ways of using ura based
permissions one is just adding a simple

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.020
permissions one is just adding a simple
 

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.920
permissions one is just adding a simple
flag to your start activity or start

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:48.930
flag to your start activity or start
 

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.010
flag to your start activity or start
service intent and these flags just say

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.020
service intent and these flags just say
 

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.250
service intent and these flags just say
yeah any URI that's attached to this can

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260
yeah any URI that's attached to this can
 

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.920
yeah any URI that's attached to this can
actually be read by the receiving app or

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:57.930
actually be read by the receiving app or
 

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:03.639
actually be read by the receiving app or
even written to by the receiving app so

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:03.649
even written to by the receiving app so
 

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:06.110
even written to by the receiving app so
this could be something for example like

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120
this could be something for example like
 

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.030
this could be something for example like
you include a image your URI as well as

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040
you include a image your URI as well as
 

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.769
you include a image your URI as well as
the read permission now all of a sudden

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779
the read permission now all of a sudden
 

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.410
the read permission now all of a sudden
the other app can then read that image

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420
the other app can then read that image
 

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.870
the other app can then read that image
without actually requiring access to

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880
without actually requiring access to
 

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.519
without actually requiring access to
wherever that file is actually stored in

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:21.529
wherever that file is actually stored in
 

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.350
wherever that file is actually stored in
addition you can actually

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360
addition you can actually
 

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.000
addition you can actually
programmatically grant and revoke these

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.010
programmatically grant and revoke these
 

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.400
programmatically grant and revoke these
permissions you can call grant URI

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:28.410
permissions you can call grant URI
 

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.069
permissions you can call grant URI
permission with a specific package and

00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079
permission with a specific package and
 

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.500
permission with a specific package and
say this package is always good to read

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:33.510
say this package is always good to read
 

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.850
say this package is always good to read
any URI that's included similarly you

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860
any URI that's included similarly you
 

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.490
any URI that's included similarly you
can actually revoke a URI permission so

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500
can actually revoke a URI permission so
 

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.769
can actually revoke a URI permission so
this would be useful if like you're

00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:41.779
this would be useful if like you're
 

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:44.510
this would be useful if like you're
deleting an internal file and other apps

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:44.520
deleting an internal file and other apps
 

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.840
deleting an internal file and other apps
have a URI to it you may want to revoke

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:47.850
have a URI to it you may want to revoke
 

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.480
have a URI to it you may want to revoke
all your I permissions to that file just

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.490
all your I permissions to that file just
 

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.560
all your I permissions to that file just
so then it doesn't linger on so let's

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.570
so then it doesn't linger on so let's
 

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.269
so then it doesn't linger on so let's
look at kind of one of those common

00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279
look at kind of one of those common
 

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:58.699
look at kind of one of those common
examples right the share button you've

00:14:58.699 --> 00:14:58.709
examples right the share button you've
 

00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:01.220
examples right the share button you've
seen hopefully in many apps the actual

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.230
seen hopefully in many apps the actual
 

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.860
seen hopefully in many apps the actual
share button not some fake share button

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:04.870
share button not some fake share button
 

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.570
share button not some fake share button
and you know this is very common for

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:06.580
and you know this is very common for
 

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.850
and you know this is very common for
using say sharing an image from your

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:08.860
using say sharing an image from your
 

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.660
using say sharing an image from your
camera app to say a social media app now

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:12.670
camera app to say a social media app now
 

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.330
camera app to say a social media app now
if we were able to use external storage

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.340
if we were able to use external storage
 

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.570
if we were able to use external storage
right the sending app might write it to

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:18.580
right the sending app might write it to
 

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.350
right the sending app might write it to
someplace in a public directory and then

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360
someplace in a public directory and then
 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.300
someplace in a public directory and then
the reading app would then need to have

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:24.310
the reading app would then need to have
 

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.490
the reading app would then need to have
the read storage permission to then read

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:26.500
the read storage permission to then read
 

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.920
the read storage permission to then read
the app and of course this will never

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:28.930
the app and of course this will never
 

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.110
the app and of course this will never
work in android for work scenarios where

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120
work in android for work scenarios where
 

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.390
work in android for work scenarios where
the actual receiving app and the sending

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.400
the actual receiving app and the sending
 

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.519
the actual receiving app and the sending
app are on two different users so maybe

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:38.529
app are on two different users so maybe
 

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:40.260
app are on two different users so maybe
we can use something else to actually

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.270
we can use something else to actually
 

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.710
we can use something else to actually
get this across and you'd think maybe oh

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720
get this across and you'd think maybe oh
 

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.070
get this across and you'd think maybe oh
we just pass in our grant flag and we

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:47.080
we just pass in our grant flag and we
 

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.980
we just pass in our grant flag and we
pass in our file URI and we're golden

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:48.990
pass in our file URI and we're golden
 

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.640
pass in our file URI and we're golden
it's one problem follow your eyes don't

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:53.650
it's one problem follow your eyes don't
 

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.940
it's one problem follow your eyes don't
work with URI based permissions file

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:56.950
work with URI based permissions file
 

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.950
work with URI based permissions file
your eyes are always protected by the

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:58.960
your eyes are always protected by the
 

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.040
your eyes are always protected by the
underlying storage permissions you're

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.050
underlying storage permissions you're
 

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.829
underlying storage permissions you're
directly accessing a file and therefore

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839
directly accessing a file and therefore
 

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.420
directly accessing a file and therefore
you're going through that filesystem

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:06.430
you're going through that filesystem
 

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.220
you're going through that filesystem
which is the storage permission so

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:10.230
which is the storage permission so
 

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.660
which is the storage permission so
instead we need to add just a little bit

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:12.670
instead we need to add just a little bit
 

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.870
instead we need to add just a little bit
of indirection between our files and the

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880
of indirection between our files and the
 

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.940
of indirection between our files and the
other apps and we can do that via a

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:17.950
other apps and we can do that via a
 

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.730
other apps and we can do that via a
support v4 library class called

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:20.740
support v4 library class called
 

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.570
support v4 library class called
file provider well this is built on top

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:24.580
file provider well this is built on top
 

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.420
file provider well this is built on top
of content provider which you may have

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.430
of content provider which you may have
 

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.720
of content provider which you may have
heard of and dislike or like in some

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:30.730
heard of and dislike or like in some
 

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.150
heard of and dislike or like in some
cases you don't actually need to write

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160
cases you don't actually need to write
 

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.090
cases you don't actually need to write
any content provider code which is great

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:36.100
any content provider code which is great
 

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.130
any content provider code which is great
there's actually very little code to

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:38.140
there's actually very little code to
 

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.670
there's actually very little code to
actually write in the file provider what

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680
actually write in the file provider what
 

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.620
actually write in the file provider what
this allows you to do is actually give

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:43.630
this allows you to do is actually give
 

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.430
this allows you to do is actually give
apps access to files in your get files

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440
apps access to files in your get files
 

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.890
apps access to files in your get files
directory your get cache directory or

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:49.900
directory your get cache directory or
 

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.160
directory your get cache directory or
any of the get external directories so

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.170
any of the get external directories so
 

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.220
any of the get external directories so
use there be places where you can write

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.230
use there be places where you can write
 

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.500
use there be places where you can write
without the storage permission right

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:58.510
without the storage permission right
 

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.490
without the storage permission right
especially on KitKat and above but

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500
especially on KitKat and above but
 

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.100
especially on KitKat and above but
through file provider now other apps can

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.110
through file provider now other apps can
 

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.160
through file provider now other apps can
read those files that breaks the need

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.170
read those files that breaks the need
 

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.760
read those files that breaks the need
for any of the storage permission

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:10.770
for any of the storage permission
 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.780
for any of the storage permission
because what we are sending is a URI and

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:15.790
because what we are sending is a URI and
 

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.300
because what we are sending is a URI and
not a direct file

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:17.310
not a direct file
 

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.880
not a direct file
and that allows us to use your I based

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:19.890
and that allows us to use your I based
 

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.320
and that allows us to use your I based
permissions now there is some setup for

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:24.330
permissions now there is some setup for
 

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.380
permissions now there is some setup for
file provider specifically every one of

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:27.390
file provider specifically every one of
 

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.110
file provider specifically every one of
those file provider URIs has kind of a

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120
those file provider URIs has kind of a
 

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.180
those file provider URIs has kind of a
unique prefix which we'll call the

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:32.190
unique prefix which we'll call the
 

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.450
unique prefix which we'll call the
authority now you can just define it as

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460
authority now you can just define it as
 

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.140
authority now you can just define it as
a static string somewhere but I like to

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.150
a static string somewhere but I like to
 

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.970
a static string somewhere but I like to
be a little bit more fancy this is the

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:40.980
be a little bit more fancy this is the
 

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.990
be a little bit more fancy this is the
limit of my Gradle knowledge and

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000
limit of my Gradle knowledge and
 

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.670
limit of my Gradle knowledge and
actually define it in our Gradle file

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:46.680
actually define it in our Gradle file
 

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.830
actually define it in our Gradle file
based on our application ID so this

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840
based on our application ID so this
 

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.330
based on our application ID so this
would be kind of the package name in

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340
would be kind of the package name in
 

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.430
would be kind of the package name in
your app and we can actually define it

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440
your app and we can actually define it
 

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.430
your app and we can actually define it
as a manifest placeholder so now we can

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440
as a manifest placeholder so now we can
 

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.020
as a manifest placeholder so now we can
actually use it in our manifest file

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.030
actually use it in our manifest file
 

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.940
actually use it in our manifest file
without having to reference the actual

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:58.950
without having to reference the actual
 

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.190
without having to reference the actual
string and we can reference it in our

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200
string and we can reference it in our
 

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.680
string and we can reference it in our
build config directories in any of our

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:03.690
build config directories in any of our
 

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.830
build config directories in any of our
Java classes and now it's always in sync

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
Java classes and now it's always in sync
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.840
Java classes and now it's always in sync
we only have one place to change it and

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:08.850
we only have one place to change it and
 

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.930
we only have one place to change it and
if we have multiple versions and build

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940
if we have multiple versions and build
 

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.040
if we have multiple versions and build
configs it just works so our manifest

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.050
configs it just works so our manifest
 

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.820
configs it just works so our manifest
entry just defines our file provider

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:18.830
entry just defines our file provider
 

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.950
entry just defines our file provider
we're not writing any code so far it's

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960
we're not writing any code so far it's
 

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.570
we're not writing any code so far it's
just a little bit of XML that you can

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.580
just a little bit of XML that you can
 

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.660
just a little bit of XML that you can
paste right in because all of the

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:26.670
paste right in because all of the
 

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.390
paste right in because all of the
configuration is actually done by the

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400
configuration is actually done by the
 

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.770
configuration is actually done by the
file providers path metadata so this

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780
file providers path metadata so this
 

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.840
file providers path metadata so this
metadata is just a really simple XML

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:35.850
metadata is just a really simple XML
 

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.170
metadata is just a really simple XML
file that you put in your resume that

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:39.180
file that you put in your resume that
 

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.690
file that you put in your resume that
just says what directories you're

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700
just says what directories you're
 

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.450
just says what directories you're
actually providing through file provider

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460
actually providing through file provider
 

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.270
actually providing through file provider
right what we don't want is we don't

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280
right what we don't want is we don't
 

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.130
right what we don't want is we don't
want every app to be able to read every

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140
want every app to be able to read every
 

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.640
want every app to be able to read every
file in get files directory and get

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:52.650
file in get files directory and get
 

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.140
file in get files directory and get
cache directory you may want to just

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.150
cache directory you may want to just
 

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.600
cache directory you may want to just
have one directory that you make or in

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:56.610
have one directory that you make or in
 

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.970
have one directory that you make or in
this case three directories you can have

00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980
this case three directories you can have
 

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.860
this case three directories you can have
it read from to get file directory using

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:00.870
it read from to get file directory using
 

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.320
it read from to get file directory using
the files path get cache directory via

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.330
the files path get cache directory via
 

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.350
the files path get cache directory via
cache path and any of the get external

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360
cache path and any of the get external
 

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.170
cache path and any of the get external
directory via external path then the

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:09.180
directory via external path then the
 

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.930
directory via external path then the
path is kind of that unique substring or

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940
path is kind of that unique substring or
 

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.430
path is kind of that unique substring or
subfolder within those directories so

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440
subfolder within those directories so
 

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.170
subfolder within those directories so
that's all the one-time setup you only

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:18.180
that's all the one-time setup you only
 

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.210
that's all the one-time setup you only
need to do that once and then never

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220
need to do that once and then never
 

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.100
need to do that once and then never
touch it again no matter how many share

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.110
touch it again no matter how many share
 

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.150
touch it again no matter how many share
buttons you have throughout your app now

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160
buttons you have throughout your app now
 

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.310
buttons you have throughout your app now
we can actually share a file so just

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320
we can actually share a file so just
 

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.410
we can actually share a file so just
like before we'll have a file that we

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:30.420
like before we'll have a file that we
 

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:30.830
like before we'll have a file that we
want to

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840
want to
 

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.289
want to
and then we can just use one method from

00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299
and then we can just use one method from
 

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:35.720
and then we can just use one method from
fileprovider our debt uri for file

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:35.730
fileprovider our debt uri for file
 

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.029
fileprovider our debt uri for file
method and this takes in our build

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039
method and this takes in our build
 

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:41.330
method and this takes in our build
config and the file and then spits out a

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340
config and the file and then spits out a
 

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.230
config and the file and then spits out a
special content URI we construct our

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240
special content URI we construct our
 

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.570
special content URI we construct our
share intent and then actually provide

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580
share intent and then actually provide
 

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.509
share intent and then actually provide
read access by calling set data with our

00:19:50.509 --> 00:19:50.519
read access by calling set data with our
 

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:52.789
read access by calling set data with our
content URI and then adding the read

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799
content URI and then adding the read
 

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:55.789
content URI and then adding the read
flag now the important thing to note

00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799
flag now the important thing to note
 

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:59.619
flag now the important thing to note
here is that that add flag of grant read

00:19:59.619 --> 00:19:59.629
here is that that add flag of grant read
 

00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:04.009
here is that that add flag of grant read
only applies in this case to your eyes

00:20:04.009 --> 00:20:04.019
only applies in this case to your eyes
 

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:06.889
only applies in this case to your eyes
we've set in set data so if we leave out

00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:06.899
we've set in set data so if we leave out
 

00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:09.710
we've set in set data so if we leave out
that line our grant flag won't actually

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720
that line our grant flag won't actually
 

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.919
that line our grant flag won't actually
apply to any you our eyes so it's really

00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:12.929
apply to any you our eyes so it's really
 

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:14.720
apply to any you our eyes so it's really
important that those things kind of go

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:14.730
important that those things kind of go
 

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.859
important that those things kind of go
together in almost all cases on the

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:18.869
together in almost all cases on the
 

00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:22.190
together in almost all cases on the
receiving side we can extract the URI

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200
receiving side we can extract the URI
 

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.129
receiving side we can extract the URI
and then getting out the actual data out

00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:25.139
and then getting out the actual data out
 

00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:28.879
and then getting out the actual data out
of that URI has a very simple method get

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:28.889
of that URI has a very simple method get
 

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:32.570
of that URI has a very simple method get
content resolver open input stream now

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580
content resolver open input stream now
 

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.100
content resolver open input stream now
the nice part about open input stream is

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.110
the nice part about open input stream is
 

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.499
the nice part about open input stream is
it works for practically any URI you

00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:36.509
it works for practically any URI you
 

00:20:36.509 --> 00:20:38.810
it works for practically any URI you
pass it whether it's 1 of our file

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820
pass it whether it's 1 of our file
 

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.840
pass it whether it's 1 of our file
provider your eyes a file URI or an

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:41.850
provider your eyes a file URI or an
 

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.480
provider your eyes a file URI or an

same code from your receivers
 

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.769
same code from your receivers
perspective it shouldn't matter how the

because you can parse it all in the same

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:53.789
because you can parse it all in the same

so I here we just use bitmap factory to

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840
so I here we just use bitmap factory to
 

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.970
so I here we just use bitmap factory to
extract a bitmap from it now the other

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980
extract a bitmap from it now the other
 

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.289

thing that's nice about this is that

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299
thing that's nice about this is that
 

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:06.609
thing that's nice about this is that
that you can actually daisy chain those

00:21:06.609 --> 00:21:06.619
that you can actually daisy chain those
 

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:09.259
that you can actually daisy chain those

across you can call the same set data

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:17.519

that definitely pushes the requirement

that's doing it wrong please fix it
because that's breaking everyone else

right say you're running on marshmallow

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059
right say you're running on marshmallow

and using runtime permissions now that

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419
and using runtime permissions now that
 

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.180
and using runtime permissions now that
works it would get the number of shares

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:23.190
works it would get the number of shares
 

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.909
works it would get the number of shares
up to a higher percentage because you

up to a higher percentage because you

it a few more minutes so that's one way
 

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.260
it a few more minutes so that's one way
to do it but unfortunately that means

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:45.270
to do it but unfortunately that means
 

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.720
to do it but unfortunately that means
that your app that appears is using

that your app that appears is using

that your app that appears is using

you need to have a second dialog that

you need to have a second dialog that
pops

for other apps but this app is saying

so you kind of have to deal with that

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:13.710
so you kind of have to deal with that
 

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.070
so you kind of have to deal with that
different privacy model where maybe it

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080
different privacy model where maybe it
 

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.710
different privacy model where maybe it
makes more sense to say I don't want the

makes more sense to say I don't want the

makes more sense to say I don't want the

there's probably a different app on your

there's probably a different app on your

where you can use different technique

where you can use different technique
 

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.850
where you can use different technique
which actually reverses the situation

and that's action get content I get

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.030
and that's action get content I get
 

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.180

contents kind of the reverse where we're

the URI again it's not a returning thing

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:42.250
the URI again it's not a returning thing
 

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.070
the URI again it's not a returning thing
the file is gone right that's the whole

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080
the file is gone right that's the whole
 

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.000
the file is gone right that's the whole
reason behind the URI thing but in many

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.010
reason behind the URI thing but in many
 

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:50.130
reason behind the URI thing but in many
cases that's exactly what you want right

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:50.140
cases that's exactly what you want right
 

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.260

deleted this from my gallery but there's

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080
deleted this from my gallery but there's
 

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.230
deleted this from my gallery but there's
still that app that has a copy of it and

still that app that has a copy of it and
 

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.390
still that app that has a copy of it and
that out there's another copy of it and

that out there's another copy of it and
 

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.550
that out there's another copy of it and
then that second app doesn't even have a

then that second app doesn't even have a
 

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.240
then that second app doesn't even have a
delete button or anything so now I have

delete button or anything so now I have
 

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.130

even need to go back into the gallery
 

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.720
even need to go back into the gallery
and delete the app if you're using open

we actually need this file now you will
 

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.870
we actually need this file now you will
probably want to check to make sure you

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880
probably want to check to make sure you

trying to just delete users files it may
 

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.080
trying to just delete users files it may
not always be the case but there's one

not always be the case but there's one
 

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.940
not always be the case but there's one
thing to be sure open documents just

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:41.950
thing to be sure open documents just
 

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.930

we've talked about and frankly a lot

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740
we've talked about and frankly a lot
 

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.300
we've talked about and frankly a lot
more functionality so when you call open

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:56.310
more functionality so when you call open
 

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.280
more functionality so when you call open
document you're only going to get apps

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:58.290
document you're only going to get apps
 

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.890
document you're only going to get apps
that's support action open document

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:00.900
that's support action open document
 

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.380
that's support action open document
right that have a document provider the

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.390
right that have a document provider the
 

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.660
right that have a document provider the
class that they would need on their side

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:05.670
class that they would need on their side
 

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.000
class that they would need on their side
now this means that you may get a more

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.010
now this means that you may get a more
 

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.890
now this means that you may get a more
limited number of apps but obviously

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:09.900
limited number of apps but obviously
 

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.720
limited number of apps but obviously
when you're using open document maybe

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:11.730
when you're using open document maybe
 

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.550
when you're using open document maybe
you're expecting that persistence or

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:13.560
you're expecting that persistence or
 

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.200
you're expecting that persistence or
those new api's however if you're on

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:18.210
those new api's however if you're on
 

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.060
those new api's however if you're on
KitKat and above and you call get

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:20.070
KitKat and above and you call get
 

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.570
KitKat and above and you call get
content you'll actually get both you get

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580
content you'll actually get both you get
 

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.500
content you'll actually get both you get
all the apps that support get content as

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:26.510
all the apps that support get content as
 

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.930
all the apps that support get content as
well as all the apps that support open

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940
well as all the apps that support open
 

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.510
well as all the apps that support open
document because anything you could do

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:32.520
document because anything you could do
 

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.020
document because anything you could do
with get content can also be done on a

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:36.030
with get content can also be done on a
 

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.510
with get content can also be done on a
document URI that you've retrieved yeah

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:38.520
document URI that you've retrieved yeah
 

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.000
document URI that you've retrieved yeah
open document the same opening the same

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.010
open document the same opening the same
 

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.840
open document the same opening the same
checking things on either one now this

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:44.850
checking things on either one now this
 

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.970
checking things on either one now this
does allow us to do some optionally cool

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980
does allow us to do some optionally cool
 

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.890
does allow us to do some optionally cool
things there's actually a document

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:48.900
things there's actually a document
 

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.040
things there's actually a document
contract is document URI so you can

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.050
contract is document URI so you can
 

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.870
contract is document URI so you can
check to see if your return result is

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880
check to see if your return result is
 

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.970
check to see if your return result is
actually a document URI and then you can

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980
actually a document URI and then you can
 

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.280
actually a document URI and then you can
use those new api's and if they've

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:58.290
use those new api's and if they've
 

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.350
use those new api's and if they've
selected something from a Content app

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360
selected something from a Content app
 

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.780
selected something from a Content app
then you can just use just the default

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:02.790
then you can just use just the default
 

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.470
then you can just use just the default
functionality now the nice part is is

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480
functionality now the nice part is is
 

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.180
functionality now the nice part is is
that even though you're getting these

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:08.190
that even though you're getting these
 

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.080
that even though you're getting these
URIs you can use a document file class

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:12.090
URIs you can use a document file class
 

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.670
URIs you can use a document file class
which is part of the android support

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:13.680
which is part of the android support
 

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.890
which is part of the android support
library v4 which kind of gives you a

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:15.900
library v4 which kind of gives you a
 

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.030
library v4 which kind of gives you a
very similar API to a file for document

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040
very similar API to a file for document
 

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.190
very similar API to a file for document
your eyes so you can check you know do I

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200

your eyes which is really nice very
handy now that does mean that if you're

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.360
handy now that does mean that if you're
 

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.760
handy now that does mean that if you're
an app that supports get content and you

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:43.770
an app that supports get content and you
 

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.100
an app that supports get content and you
support open document you need to

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.110
support open document you need to
 

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.640
support open document you need to
disable your get content on API 19 and

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:49.650
disable your get content on API 19 and
 

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.760
disable your get content on API 19 and
above otherwise users will see content

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:52.770
above otherwise users will see content
 

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.390
above otherwise users will see content
one in the list and your storage

00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:56.400
one in the list and your storage
 

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.360
one in the list and your storage
provider in the same list so you disable

00:34:59.360 --> 00:34:59.370
provider in the same list so you disable
 

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.520
provider in the same list so you disable
one and say well open document can do

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:01.530
one and say well open document can do
 

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.920
one and say well open document can do
things that content does so I'll just

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:03.930
things that content does so I'll just
 

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.360
things that content does so I'll just
have that appear in the list

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:05.370
have that appear in the list
 

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.490
have that appear in the list
you no longer need get content if you're

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500
you no longer need get content if you're
 

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.170
you no longer need get content if you're
using open document so what is accessing

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180
using open document so what is accessing
 

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.060
using open document so what is accessing
the storage access framework look like

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.070
the storage access framework look like
 

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.420
the storage access framework look like
from a user's perspective so from their

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:17.430
from a user's perspective so from their
 

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.420
from a user's perspective so from their
perspective they're in an app say our

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:20.430
perspective they're in an app say our
 

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.780
perspective they're in an app say our
photo editor and they hit the button

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:23.790
photo editor and they hit the button
 

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.320
photo editor and they hit the button
saying get me a file well I'm like get

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:27.330
saying get me a file well I'm like get
 

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.840
saying get me a file well I'm like get
content where they have to pick an app

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:29.850
content where they have to pick an app
 

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.630
content where they have to pick an app
and then go into that app and have some

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640
and then go into that app and have some
 

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.970
and then go into that app and have some
custom UI where they select things and

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980
custom UI where they select things and
 

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.440
custom UI where they select things and
then that app doesn't support multi

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:36.450
then that app doesn't support multi
 

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.840
then that app doesn't support multi
select and then they're clicking on one

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:38.850
select and then they're clicking on one
 

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.700
select and then they're clicking on one
and hitting load and click and a second

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:40.710
and hitting load and click and a second
 

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.790
and hitting load and click and a second
one hit load all of the UI for storage

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800
one hit load all of the UI for storage
 

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.080
one hit load all of the UI for storage
access framework is done by the system

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:47.090
access framework is done by the system
 

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.940
access framework is done by the system
you don't need to write any UI to

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:49.950
you don't need to write any UI to
 

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.120
you don't need to write any UI to
support the storage access framework you

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.130
support the storage access framework you
 

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.990
support the storage access framework you
can just do just the data part of things

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000
can just do just the data part of things
 

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.820
can just do just the data part of things
so this is really nice because then when

00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:58.830
so this is really nice because then when
 

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.410
so this is really nice because then when
a new version Android comes out you get

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420
a new version Android comes out you get
 

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.710
a new version Android comes out you get
even more functionality for free you

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720
even more functionality for free you
 

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.330
even more functionality for free you
don't have to say oh I'm going to

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.340
don't have to say oh I'm going to
 

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.330
don't have to say oh I'm going to
support this new stuff as much because

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:08.340
support this new stuff as much because
 

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.940
support this new stuff as much because
what's happening is the system is the

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:10.950
what's happening is the system is the
 

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.130
what's happening is the system is the
one who's reading from the document

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140
one who's reading from the document
 

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.010
one who's reading from the document
providers and giving new functionality

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020
providers and giving new functionality
 

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.490
providers and giving new functionality
so for example in KitKat and above

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:21.500
so for example in KitKat and above
 

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.290
so for example in KitKat and above
coming with the system you get internal

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300
coming with the system you get internal
 

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.410
coming with the system you get internal
storage a document provider provided by

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420
storage a document provider provided by
 

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.950
storage a document provider provided by
the system as well as if you plugged in

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960
the system as well as if you plugged in
 

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.830

an a removable hard drive or something

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:33.840
an a removable hard drive or something
 

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.050
an a removable hard drive or something
you'd actually get a document provider

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060
you'd actually get a document provider
 

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.570
you'd actually get a document provider
for that removable hard drive

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:37.580
for that removable hard drive
 

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.980
for that removable hard drive
automatically as soon as you unplugged

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:39.990
automatically as soon as you unplugged
 

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.840
automatically as soon as you unplugged
it that document provider would

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:41.850
it that document provider would
 

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.210
it that document provider would
disappear that's great how people can

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220
disappear that's great how people can
 

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.580
disappear that's great how people can
select those files in marshmallow we've

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:46.590
select those files in marshmallow we've
 

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.040

extended that so now when you have an SD

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.050
extended that so now when you have an SD
 

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.440
extended that so now when you have an SD
card you can do the same thing and the

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:51.450
card you can do the same thing and the
 

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.330
card you can do the same thing and the
storage probably will just simply appear

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:53.340
storage probably will just simply appear
 

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.910
storage probably will just simply appear
for the SD card so now all of a sudden

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920

because from the readings app

00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:30.479
because from the readings app
 

00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:32.479
because from the readings app
perspective all you're getting is an

input stream or a file descriptor but
 

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:36.709
input stream or a file descriptor but
then you can stream the contents from

00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:36.719
then you can stream the contents from
 

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:38.539
then you can stream the contents from
and all the metadata is handled

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:38.549
and all the metadata is handled
 

00:37:38.549 --> 00:37:42.709
and all the metadata is handled
separately so you'll also get some other

and I'd rather it be the lowest one in
 

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.809
and I'd rather it be the lowest one in
count because really that means that

all those files probably don't actually

all those files probably don't actually
 

00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:09.650
all those files probably don't actually
need access to all of them so we've

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660
need access to all of them so we've
 

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.690
need access to all of them so we've
actually done a lot of work on that even

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700
actually done a lot of work on that even
 

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.509
actually done a lot of work on that even

inside of Google as well so for example
