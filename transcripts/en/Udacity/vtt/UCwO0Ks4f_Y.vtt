00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.320
Alright, so I'm going to make some attendees, and

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm going to go here, and then hit New.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, what should our attendee be called? Johnny Concert.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.530
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.080
&gt;&gt; he bought, Johnny Concert bought his ticket from

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200
a third party vendor, and he bought his ticket today.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.720
Is Johnny a VIP or General Admission kind of guy?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.320
&gt;&gt; He sounds pretty VIP to me.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.270
&gt;&gt; All right, so, and then I'll just

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.030
do this for another one, and maybe a festival?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.400
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.870
&gt;&gt; Cool.
