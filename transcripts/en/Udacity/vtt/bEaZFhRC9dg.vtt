00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.300
Any time you want to operate on a bunch
of files that have similar names,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.020
you can use a glob pattern to do it.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.570
I am not making up this name.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.830
Globbing is the real,
actual, technical term for

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.670
matching files by name
in the Unix shell.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.690
Seriously, globbing.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.275
If you don't believe me you
can look it up, man glob.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.880
Globbing is a kind of pattern
matching for file names.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.010
When you write a glob pattern in
a shell command, the shell turns

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.800
that pattern into a list of file names
that exist to match the pattern.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.750
For instance,
a star matches any string of characters.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.160
You can use a star at the beginning or
at the end of a pattern.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.940
Patterns can be all sorts
of different lengths.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.990
You can use two stars
in the same pattern.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.040
For instance, here, matching every
file whose name contains pp.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.470
A star can appear in
the middle of a pattern.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.000
Matching all the files that
start with B and end with png.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.700
There are other patterns
you can use as well.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.960
For instance,
to match files that end in either CSS or

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.006
HTML, a list of strings in curly braces
will match any of the alternatives.

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.524
A single question mark
matches any one character.

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:16.060
So BEA question mark dot
png matches both bean and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.540
bear, but it doesn't match beer or bees.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.200
Two question marks matches
two characters, and so on.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.874
List of characters inside square
brackets matches any one of

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:33.280
the characters inside those brackets,
so be and then square brackets

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.795
A-E-I-O-U R dot png will match bear and
beer, but not bean or bees.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.715
Something to watch out for
is that file names in Linux are always

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:44.870
case sensitive, and
that applies to globbing too.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.030
For instance, if you have files
that end in jpg in capitals and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.300
files that end in jpg in lower case,
you have to specify which one you want.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.170
If you want both,
you could use the curly braces.
