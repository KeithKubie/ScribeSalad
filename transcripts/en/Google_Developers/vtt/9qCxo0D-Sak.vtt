[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.500
ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.390
Welcome back to the
Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.240
Today is all about Firebase,
Google's mobile platform that

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.270
helps you quickly develop
high quality apps,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.430
grow your user base,
and earn money.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.504
If you watch the
keynote from I/O 16,

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:13.920
you heard that
Firebase now offers

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.080
a whole bunch of new services
and that AdMob is one of them.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.850
So in this episode, with the
help of Gary the Graphics Guy,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.890
we're going to cover how
Firebase and AdMob work

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.940
together, what the benefits
are, and then we'll

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.260
have screencasts showing how to
import the Mobile Ads SDK along

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.300
with the Firebase SDK.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.800
But first, let me
step into my app

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.710
so I can welcome our
first ever guest star,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.555
noted Firebase expert and star
of the Firecast series, David

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:39.055
East.

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:40.039
[FANFARE]

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.414
DAVID EAST: What's
up, everybody?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.590
ANDREW BROGDON: What?

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.650
We have company.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.370
Now then, David, maybe
you could tell our viewers

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.472
about what Firebase is.

00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:55.180
DAVID EAST: Sure.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.680
Yeah.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.030
Firebase is a unified app
platform for Android, iOS,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.800
and web development with
tools to help develop faster,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.680
improve app quality, acquire
and engage users, and monetize

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.482
apps.

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:08.940
ANDREW BROGDON: So what kind
of tools are we talking about?

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.314
DAVID EAST: Man,
there's a bunch,

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:13.460
like my favorite, the real-time
database, notifications,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.700
crash reporting, analytics,
and, of course, probably

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.520
your favorite, AdMob.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.712
ANDREW BROGDON: So part
of the platform is AdMob?

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:20.420
DAVID EAST: Yeah.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.157
Firebase is designed
to help developers

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:23.490
at every stage of the lifecycle.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.020
So you can actually get a
lot out of the Firebase tools

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.740
at no charge like analytics,
remote config, push

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.030
notifications, and then AdMob
will actually go and pay you.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.530
No.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.029
It is true.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.427
I'm actually not that
good of a salesman.

00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:41.635
ANDREW BROGDON: Firebase
and AdMob are friends, Gary.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.610
OK.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.651
So that's why someone
would want to use Firebase.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.760
But what about how?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.176
If an AdMob publisher wants
to get on board with Firebase,

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.010
how do they do that?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.468
DAVID EAST: Well,
they can actually

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:57.360
link AdMob apps to
Firebase projects

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.809
right from the AdMob website.

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:01.225
And then, mainly, it's a matter
of getting the config file

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.120
and importing the SDKs.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.030
ANDREW BROGDON: Cool.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.610
So around here, I
like to list the steps

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.693
before we do a screencast.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.070
So let's break it
down for Android.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.830
So to get an Android
app up and running

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.230
with AdMob and
Firebase, you just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.610
need to link the app
with a Firebase project,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.110
download the
Firebase config file

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.370
and include it, configure the
Google services Gradle plugin,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.812
and then add
individual services.

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:22.520
DAVID EAST: Yeah.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.780
I can't see anything.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.360
ANDREW BROGDON:
Gary, unblock him.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.330
David's a nice guy.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.480
Haven't you seen Firecast?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.271
What's the problem?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.510
Is that what this is about?

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.820
It's still you and me buddy.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.080
AdMob's not going anywhere.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.580
You don't have to use Firebase
with it if you don't want to.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.380
The API isn't changing.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.690
The SDK still works
the way it always has.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.490
If publishers don't have to
make big changes, neither do we.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.150
Absolutely.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.030
We can still catch a
ball game together.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.738
DAVID EAST: Yeah.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:53.890
I have season tickets.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.390
See?

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.294
It's a win-win.

00:02:56.294 --> 00:02:57.960
ANDREW BROGDON: Now
that that's settled,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.751
let's get to our
screencast and take a look

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:05.000
at how to use Firebase and AdMob
together in an Android app.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.760
So here are the four
steps for Android.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.259
We're going to begin
with the first,

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.135
linking an AdMob app
to a Firebase project.

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:13.010
I'll include a guide at
the end of this video

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.770
with more info on how
this linking works,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.894
but for now, one of the
easiest ways to get started

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.800
is just to go to the
Analytics tab in AdMob console

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.560
and click this nice Get
Started With Firebase button.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.890
When I click that, I get
to a list of my AdMob apps.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.400
And I can click the
Link to Firebase button

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.310
to link one to Firebase.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.060
That gets me a prompt
for my app's package

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.101
name, which is needed for
the configuration stuff

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:35.255
to work later.

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:36.880
And depending on
whether you've already

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.606
created a Firebase
project or not,

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:40.480
you may have some choices
on the next screen.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.350
This is what you get if you've
never created a Firebase base

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.500
project before.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.270
Clicking continue will take
you to the next screen--

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.770
one that looks like
this telling you

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.890
that you now have a linked app.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.830
And so that's step one.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.660
Step two is to download the
google-services.json config

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.790
file, which is really easy
because the screen I just

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.080
showed you has a link
to it right there.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.000
Just click that link.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.791
And you'll be sent to
the Firebase console.

00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:08.240
And the download will
start automatically.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.430
Once it's downloaded, I can go
into an Android Studio project

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.440
and drag it right into the
source tree, like that.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.920
It goes in the root
folder of the app source.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.490
And it'll be used later by
the Google services plug-in.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.380
Cool.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.880
So step one and two down.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.080
On to step three, configuring
the Gradle plugin.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.820
So here, I'm back
in Android Studio.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.401
And I'm looking at the project
level build.gradle file.

00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:34.400
That's the one that applies
not just to the app,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.800
but everything in the
project's source tree.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.360
And so I'm just going to
add a little class path here

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.740
for the Google services
plug-in, which is new.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.280
And we're doing a Gradle sync.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.020
There we go.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.930
With that done, I can head
into the apps build.gradle

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.440
and add a line at the
bottom to apply that plugin.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.580
There we go.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.110
This plugin uses the
google-services.json file

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.740
to inject configuration data
into the app when it builds.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.370
And it also does
some other Firebase-y

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.880
set up kind of stuff.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.870
So that's the plugin.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.320
Now, it's time
for the last step,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.790
adding individual services.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.510
I can do that the same
way I always have,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.340
through Gradle dependencies.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.472
So for AdMob with Firebase,
the Gradle artifact

00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:16.430
is called firebase-ads.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.840
There we go.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.111
There are, by the way, a ton
of these artifacts available.

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:27.610
Here's a list of the services
along with Gradle dependencies

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.610
that go with them, which you
can find in the Firebase Android

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.500
Setup Guide.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.458
And you see there's a
bunch in here-- real time

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.600
database, authentication,
everything you might want.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.220
So that's all four
steps finished,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.855
which means I can come back
into my activity file now

00:05:42.855 --> 00:05:46.800
and start messing around with
AdMob classes, like AdView.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.850
And you can see, the
type is resolving.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.310
So you know the SDK has
been properly imported.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.414
So what did you think?

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:54.830
DAVID EAST: Looks
all right to me.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.913
ANDREW BROGDON: Excellent.

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:57.090
So up next is iOS.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.580
Let's take a look
at the steps there.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.340
Gary, hello.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.130
And we're back to the
pudgy redhead jokes.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.850
All is right with the world.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.157
David, do you mind?

00:06:07.157 --> 00:06:07.865
DAVID EAST: Nope.

00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:11.450
To get an iOS up and running
with AdMob and Firebase,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.040
first, you link the app
to a Firebase project.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.070
Then you download a
configuration plist file.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.780
Next, you update your pod file
to reference the Firebase pods.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.570
And then initialize
Firebase in your app.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.070
Thanks.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.979
I'll let you do the
screencast though.

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:28.770
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.420
So here are the
four steps for iOS.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.086
And we're going to
begin with the first,

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:34.182
linking an AdMob app
to a Firebase project.

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:36.140
There's a bunch of ways
to get started on this.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.970
And I'll include a guide
at the end of this video.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.940
But for now, I'm just going
to go to the Analytics tab

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.080
in the AdMob console, where
the front-end team has

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.399
this nice, Get Started
With Firebase button.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:47.440
When I click that, I get
a list of my AdMob apps.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.390
And I can click Link to
Firebase, right here,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.252
to link my app.

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:53.960
That gets me a prompt
for my app's bundle

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.190
ID, which is needed for
the configuration stuff

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.975
to work later.

00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.600
And depending on
whether you've already

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.210
created a Firebase
project or not,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.800
you may have some choices
on the next screen.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.174
Here, you can
either link the app

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.220
to one of your existing
Firebase projects

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.904
or create a brand new one.

00:07:07.904 --> 00:07:09.820
Either way, once you're
done with this screen,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.450
you get one that looks like this
telling you the app is linked.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.890
So that's step one.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.790
Step two is to download
the plist file that

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.350
contains your
Firebase configuration

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.510
information, which is crazy
easy because the screen

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.880
I just showed you has
a link right to it.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.670
Right there.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.590
That'll take you to
the Firebase console

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.170
and start the download
automatically.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.670
Cool.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.120
So that's steps one and two.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.070
Let's take a look at
step three, updating

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.710
the project's CocoaPods.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.490
So I'll head into Xcode.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.770
And here's my very
basic iOS app.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.220
And I'm going to use CocoaPods
to get the Firebase SDK

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.020
and the Mobile Ads SDK into it.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.400
So the first thing I need to
do, actually, is close Xcode

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.270
and create a pod
file using pod init.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.290
There we go.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.200
So I got a pod file, which
I'm going to edit using Vim

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.900
so everybody out there
thinks I'm smart.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.690
Cool.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.030
Inside the pod file, I just
need to add two dependencies

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.650
to my target.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.060
First is the Firebase
pod, which gives me

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.450
access to basic Firebase
stuff, like the Firebase app

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.820
class, which you'll see
in a second, plus Firebase

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.850
Analytics.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.480
And then a second pod for AdMob.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.320
There are, by the way,
a ton of these pods.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.320
Here's a list of the
available Firebase services

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.680
and the pods that
go with them, which

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.770
you can find in the
setup guide I'll

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.220
actually link you to later.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.740
But as you can see,
there's a whole bunch.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.580
Cool.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.740
So now, I do a pod install to
get all my new dependencies.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.700
There we go.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.360
And now, I'll open
the workspace file

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.830
that CocoaPods made for
me to get back into Xcode.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.720
So that's steps
one through three.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.510
The last step is to
initialize Firebase.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.710
To start, I'm going to
grab that plist file

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.870
that we downloaded earlier.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.880
And I'm going to drag it into
the root of my source tree.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.970
Firebase uses this config file
to store a bunch of keys and ID

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.110
kind of things.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.860
That's what the file's for.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.010
There we go.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.690
Next, in my
AppDelegate I'm going

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.180
to import the Firebase framework
provided to me by the pods

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.770
and then call the configure
method in the Firebase app

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.520
class.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.470
There we go.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.350
That configures my app
at launch and makes

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.849
sure that all the
installed Firebase

00:09:07.849 --> 00:09:10.830
components are ready to go.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.410
So that's it.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.618
I'm done with all four steps.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.361
And AdMob with Firebase
is ready to go.

00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:17.860
That means I can come into the
view controller, for example,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.820
import the Firebase
framework, and start

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.550
playing with AdMob classes.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.170
Here's a GADBannerView.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.330
And you can see the type
resolving, right there.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.199
So you know the SDK has
properly been imported.

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:30.240
One thing I do want to
note is that the dedicated

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.150
Google Mobile Ads SDK, CocoaPod,
the one that everybody's

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.920
been used to using
up until now--

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.374
that has not been deprecated.

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:38.290
So if you're not interested
in using Firebase,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.748
but you do still
want to use AdMob,

00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:40.970
that's an option for you.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.270
It's not going away.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.162
Also, if you don't
want to use CocoaPods,

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:46.120
you can also download
these frameworks directly

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.369
from the Firebase developer
site, firebase.google.com.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.094
So that's iOS.

00:09:52.094 --> 00:09:54.301
I'm going to put up some
resource links for you guys.

00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:56.230
But first, thanks to
David for stopping by.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.412
DAVID EAST: My pleasure.

00:09:57.412 --> 00:09:59.620
By the way, if you want to
learn more about Firebase,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.330
you can check out Firecast,
where we cover everything

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.390
you need to know about Firebase
for Android, iOS, and web

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.872
with step-by-step screencast.

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:09.080
ANDREW BROGDON: Sounds great.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.580
Thanks.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.160
DAVID EAST: Thanks
for having me.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.430
So that's one good resource.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.680
You might also be interested
in the AdMob quick starts

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.640
for Android and iOS, which we've
updated to include Firebase.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.154
We've also updated
our AdMob samples

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:21.320
to show the use of Firebase.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.582
So you can check
those out on Github.

00:10:23.582 --> 00:10:25.040
And we've got a
help center article

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.456
that covers how
to link your AdMob

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.300
apps with Firebase projects.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.750
And the Firebase support page
has a number of good options

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.846
if you have questions.

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:34.470
As always, if you have technical
questions about the Mobile Ads

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.370
SDK, stop by our support forum.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.310
And Gary and I will
see you next time.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.060
