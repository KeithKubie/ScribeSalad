00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.560
Find the point B on segment AC,
such that the ratio of AB to BC

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.420
is 3 to 1.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.230
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.480
and try this on your own.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.560
So let's think about
what they're asking.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.130
So if that's point
C-- I'm just going

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.490
to redraw this line segment
just to conceptualize

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.800
what they're asking for.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.110
And that's point A. They're
asking us to find some point

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.010
B that the distance
between C and B,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.820
so that's this distance
right over here.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.550
So if this distance is x, then
the distance between B and A

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.090
is going to be 3 times that.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.900
So this will be 3x.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.894
That the ratio of
AB to BC is 3 to 1.

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.060
So that would be the ratio--
let me write this down.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:55.020
It would be AB-- that looks like
an HB-- it would be AB to BC

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.300
is going to be equal
to 3x to x, which

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.250
is the same thing as 3 to
1, if we wanted to write it

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.220
a slightly different way.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.680
So how can we think about it?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.965
You might be tempted
to say, oh, well,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.381
you could use the
distance formula

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.010
to find the distance,
which by itself isn't

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.590
completely uncomplicated.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.166
And then this will
be 1/4 of the way.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.290
Because if you think about
it, this entire distance

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.070
is going to be 4x.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.620
Let me draw that a
little bit neater.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.570
This entire distance, if
you have an x plus a 3x,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.880
is going to be 4x.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.460
So you'd say, well, this is 1
out of the 4 x's along the way.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.990
This is going to be 1/4 of
the distance between the two

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.492
points.

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:38.450
Let me write that down.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.020
This is 1/4 of the
way between C and B,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.007
going from C to A. B is
going to be 1/4 of the way.

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.590
So maybe you try to
find the distance.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.190
And you say, well, what
are all the points that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.010
are 1/4 of the way?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.892
But it has to be 1/4
of that distance away.

00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:58.350
But then it has to
be on that line.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.510
But that makes it
complicated, because this line

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.340
is at an incline.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.780
It's not just horizontal.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.200
It's not just vertical.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.030
What we can do, however,
is break this problem down

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.270
into the vertical
change between A and C,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.150
and the horizontal
change between A and C.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.930
So for example, the horizontal
change between A and C,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.990
A is at 9 right over here,
and C is at negative 7.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.510
So this distance right over
here is 9 minus negative 7,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.164
which is equal to 9 plus
7, which is equal to 16.

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:39.080
And you see that here.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.910
9 plus 7, this total
distance is 16.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.050
That's the horizontal distance
change going from A to C,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.890
or going from C to A.
And the vertical change,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.070
and you could even just count
that, that's going to be 4.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.140
C is at 1.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.030
A is at 5.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.550
Going from 1 to 5, you've
changed vertically 4.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.620
So what we can say, going
from C to B in each direction,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.670
in the vertical direction
and the horizontal direction,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.170
we're going to go
1/4 of the way.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.980
So if we go 1/4 in the
vertical direction,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.150
we're going to end up
at y is equal to 2.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.040
So I'm just going, starting
at C, 1/4 of the way.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440
1/4 of 4 is 1.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.980
So I've just moved up 1.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.680
So our y is going
to be equal to 2.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.040
And if we go 1/4 in the
horizontal direction, 1/4 of 16

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.540
is 4.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.030
So we go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.840
So we end up right over here.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.750
Our x is negative 3.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.990
So we end up at that
point right over there.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.090
We end up at this point.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.629
This is the point
negative 3 comma 2.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.670
And if you were really
careful with your drawing,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.090
you could have actually
just drawn-- well,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.120
actually you don't have
to be that careful,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.510
since this is graph paper.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.630
You actually could
have just said, hey,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.870
we're going to go 1/4 this way.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.050
Where does that
intersect the line?

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.570
Hey, it intersects the
line right over there.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.861
Or you could have said, we're
going to go 1/4 this way.

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:08.380
Where does that
intersect the line?

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.190
And that would have let you
figure it out either way.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.365
So this point right
over here is B.

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:17.730
It is 1/4 of the
way between C and A.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.390
Or another way of thinking about
the distance between C and B,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.959
which we haven't
even figured out.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.860
We could do that using
the distance formula

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.840
or the Pythagorean theorem,
which it really is.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.130
This distance, the distance
CB, is 1/3 the distance BA.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.276
The ratio of AB to BC is 3 to 1.
