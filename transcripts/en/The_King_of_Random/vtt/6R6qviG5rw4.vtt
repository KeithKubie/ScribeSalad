00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.800
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.440
I got this box in the mail, I can't wait to show you what's inside.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.380
But honestly...The contents even make me feel a little bit nervous and queasy.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.420
It's 5 pounds and from a biology corporation,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.640
if that gives you any ideas.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.480
And we'll be attacking this in a future video

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.280
This video here is all about you!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.240
Congratulations, guys!

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.760
We are 7,500,000 subscribers strong!

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.720
In the month of December alone we grew by nearly 800,000.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.140
So to all of you new subscribers who just hopped on: welcome aboard.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.100
Its great to have you and this is getting to be a crazy adventure.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.880
Now to express just a small token to my appreciation,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.260
I went down to the store and picked up an Xbox One S that I'll be giving to one of you.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.420
And I'll tell you how to qualify for that in just a second.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.400
Now before we move on, there's some very misguided people in this world

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.120
that are creating fake accounts to mimic big YouTubers.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.240
And when the real YouTuber posts their next video they'll come in

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.840
and post a comment with a link to a supposed "giveaway".

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.840
You do not want to click those fake links

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.660
because its most likely a fishing scam or malware designed to infect your computer.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.480
There's two ways you can tell if the comment is real or fake:

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.860
Number 1, if the comment was actually posted by the channel there will be a check mark next to their name.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.080
That means the channel has been verified by YouTube and confirmed to be legitimate.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.140
Number 2, if you hover over the channel name it will pop up the subscriber count.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.560
If they have zero subscribers its probably not the channel you want to be clicking.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.420
So that's how you can tell.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.600
Before you click any links in the description look for the verified channel check mark and you'll stay safe.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.560
Alright, moving right along.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.800
A quick reminder that every new video I post now has a giveaway attached,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.720
you just have to show up in the first 12 hours, click the "secret" link in the top of the comments,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.720
and that'll qualify you to enter the prize of the day.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.960
If you haven't been getting notifications of when my videos release,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.540
then make sure you have subscribed to my channel, rung the YouTube bell

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.860
And selected to be notified when my new videos post.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.940
So that's how you show up in the first 12 hours,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.240
that's how you sign up to win a prize,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.140
and it's one of the best ways you can support me as a YouTuber in building my channel.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.140
By the way, you only need to ring the bell once.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.920
If its already ringing, leave it ringing.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.700
Don't turn it off.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.600
So here's another thing that I just decided to start doing:

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.840
I'm gonna show my appreciation for your comments.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
Every time I use one of your comments or suggestions, I'm gonna clip it out, use it in the video, and then

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.560
send you $25 to give back and say thank you.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.640
And if you win a prize or I use your comment, I'll also post your name in the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640
Winner Wall Of Fame, which you can find right here.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.260
I've also made a commitment to you that every time I hit a new 500,000 subscriber milestone,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.980
I'm gonna give away big prizes like:

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.040
Phones, laptops, video cameras, drones, GoPros, and all kinds of cool tech like that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.540
So I hopped in my car, drove down to Best Buy, and after a bit of looking I found this thing.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.840
This is an Xbox One, 500GB (500 gigabytes), and it's the Minecraft Edition.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.740
That means it comes with Minecraft for free, but you don't have to play Minecraft.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.920
It'll work with any Xbox game; clearly.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.020
Listen closely, 'cause here's how to win:

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.640
Pieces of a secret code will be hidden for the next 7 days on my daily instagram stories.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.560
If you're following me on instagram you will find the stories in the top bar of the instagram app,

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.660
and they only last for 24 hours. So what you need

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.340
to do is follow me on instagram and then

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.019
check that every day for the next piece

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.700
of the clue. At the end of seven days

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.200
i'll post a link where you can submit the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.599
entire code and qualified win the xbox one

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.459
the link to my Instagram is in the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.959
description now if you don't have an

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.370
instagram account we just don't feel

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.260
like to wait that long you can pick out

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.819
the pieces because by doing a treasure

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.049
hunt through this playlist

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.569
it only works on desktop random videos

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.819
at random times will have random pieces

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.560
of the puzzle so theoretically you could

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.209
collect all the puzzle pieces today and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.319
submit them using the link in the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.910
description if you're feeling ambitious

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.920
i'm running these contests for you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.239
you're helping me with my dreams and

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.650
this is my way of saying thanks and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.660
giving back. And I am making a little bit

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.220
difficult to qualify because I don't

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.109
want to just give these prizes to anyone. I want

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.609
to give them to viewers like you that

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.840
aren't afraid to work for them.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.310
We're seven-and-a-half million strong now

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.139
Let's blast through 10 million and never

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:26.889
look back.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.420
And now that we're such a large community we

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.919
really should have some kind of a name for

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.090
ourselves so what do you want to be

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.010
called? Random nation, random

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.110
army, the kingdom of random... Leave your

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.400

because I'm really curious to know what

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.909
you think. So just a recap, remember

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.590
