00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.000
Changing weather patterns around the world are 
having a massive effect

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
on the lives of vulnerable communities.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.080
Historic monsoon rains are flooding South Asia,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.840
East Africa is reeling from drought

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.880
and the Caribbean is being buffeted 
by violent hurricane

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.880
after violent hurricane.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.560
And indigenous people, who ironically 
contribute the least

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.400
to greenhouse gas emissions, 
are suffering the most.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.200
It’s estimated that 24% of the land on earth

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.280
is occupied by 370 million 
indigenous people.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.320
And these territories contain 80% 
of the world’s biodiversity.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.640
Off the coast of Panama, we discovered an 
indigenous island community

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.160
that's already losing its home to the rising sea.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.920
And it's not just their ancestral land that's at risk,
but also their traditional ways of life.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.520
But one island isn't going down without a fight,
and has come up with a plan

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.720
to save their community.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.040
Gardi Sugdup is one of the 365 islands

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040
that make up the Guna Yala archipelago.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.760
The Guna tribe has controlled the region 
for the past 200 years.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.640
Today, more than 50,000 indigenous 
Gunas inhabit the islands.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.360
But now they're being forced 
to uproot their lives

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080
and move to “La Barriada” – 42 acres 
of Panamanian jungle

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.160
that they’ve set aside for a new community.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.320
In the last 30 years, the sea levels 
around the islands

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.640
have risen over 2.4 millimeters. It may 
not seem like much,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.000
but it has led to over 50,000 
square feet of land loss.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.720
And as the island shrinks away, 
the population booms.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.520
Over 1,000 people live on an
area of only .3 square miles.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.400
For years, the islanders mined coral reef

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.240
and used it to try to extend their island.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.360
But that only made matters worse.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.840
Now, the community sees a 
move back to the mainland

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.160
as the only viable option.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.640
But moving has been complicated.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.520
The Guna already owned the land 
for their relocation,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.840
but clearing the thick jungle

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.600
and building proper infrastructure is costly.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.880
In 2010, they received funds from the government

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.720
to build a new school and hospital, 
but progress has been slow.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.960
There are also mixed feelings 
about moving the community.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.360
Some fear it could mean a 
loss of independence.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.200
On the islands, the Guna have been 
able to preserve their traditions,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.600
like making these colorful dresses 
called molas.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.440
By 2050, an estimated 50 to 200 
million people could be displaced

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.240
due to climate change.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.080
Gardi Sugdup is hoping to serve not only 
as a model for their own community,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120
but also for other island communities 
around the world.
