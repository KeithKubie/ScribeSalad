00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's get started by asking
Sergey Brin the co-founder of Google

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.510
what the most important thing
is in building a search engine.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.130
&gt;&gt; So let's get a take how to decision.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.200
We've been here before right.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.050
&gt;&gt; I think the most important thing if
you're going to build a search engine

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.819
is to have really good fun
corpus to start out with.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.178
In our case, we use the world wide web,

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:24.680
which at the time was significantly
smaller than it was today.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.010
But it was also very new and exciting,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.020
there were all sorts of
unexpected things there.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.740
There are lots of other really
interesting corpuses of information.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.516
And, of course, we've worked on one for
books and one for

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:45.210
people's, for your email, individually.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.230
There are many, many interesting
corpuses out there and I think you

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.600
should pick the right one that you will
be excited about searching yourself.
