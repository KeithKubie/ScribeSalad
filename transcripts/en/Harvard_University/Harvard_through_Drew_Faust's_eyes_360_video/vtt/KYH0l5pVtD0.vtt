00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.580
When I became
president, I thought

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.550
about how we lacked
convening spaces

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.630
for the university as a whole
and places where people could

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.000
come together, and
exchange ideas, and learn

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.470
from one another, as they should
in a residential university

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.530
setting.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.320
And as I appointed a task
force on common spaces,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.800
the financial crisis emerged
almost at the same time.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250
And so some of the
grandiose designs

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.090
that the task force
was envisioning

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.890
were somewhat scaled down.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.570
And we began to
think, what could we

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.290
do right away that could make
a difference without having

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.780
to have a huge
investment of resources?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840
And so the task force
made a recommendation

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.070
that I think has changed
Harvard fundamentally.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.430
They pointed out that
in old Harvard Yard,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.020
people raced through.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.110
They always felt they ought
to be going somewhere.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.750
And they ought to look like they
needed to be going somewhere

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.720
and had something of
importance to accomplish rather

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.930
than to linger, or
have a conversation,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.740
or find a place in
which to interact.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.500
And in fact, there were
no benches or places

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.720
to sit in Harvard Yard.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120
And so the task force
recommended that we

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.910
install chairs in Harvard Yard.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.410
They're chairs of
the sort that you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.710
find in the garden of
the Tuileries in Paris,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.530
though we have them in
multi-colors rather than just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.330
pale green.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.850
And so the chairs appeared.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.600
And I've had such a wonderful
time over the last decade or so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590
since they did appear
watching how people use them.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.790
They pull them together.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.600
They put their feet on one and
their laptops on their knees.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.800
They bring their babies and
rock them in their strollers

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.150
next to the little grouping of
chairs where the mothers are

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.010
having a conversation.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.240
Students sit down.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.820
And someone just comes up
and sits down next to them,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.220
and a new friendship is born.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.449
So it's changed the
attitude, I think,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.430
of people towards the Yard.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.850
Because it makes
possible the opportunity

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.360
to sit, to stay, to linger,
to talk, to think, to have

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.770
a meeting.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.460
And so they have taken
an old space, the Yard,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.270
a beautiful, iconic
space, and remade it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.170
in a way that is both
respectful of its past

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.720
and embodies the
spirit of the present

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.550
and some important uses for
the creation of connections

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.820
and interactions among our
students, faculty, staff,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.390
and friends.
