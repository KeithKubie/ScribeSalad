00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
I've dealt with lots of people who have anxiety disorders. You know...

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:05.555
And one thing about people who have anxiety disorders is

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.520
they are not mysterious to me.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.880
I understand ...

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.280
It's

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.295
it's no problem for me to understand why people have anxiety disorders

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.620
or why they are depressed

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.840
or why they have substance use problems.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.760
The mystery to me is always why

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.380
people don't have all of those things at once.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.920
Because everybody has a reason to be anxious.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.055
In fact we have the ultimate reason to be anxious,  because

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.600
we know that we are vulnerable and we know that we are going to die.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.800
And how you could not be anxious under those circumstances is a great mystery.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.080
It's a massive mystery.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.380
And the same thing applies with regards to depression.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.160
And then the same thing applies to some degree with regards to drugs and alcohol abuse.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.520
As I said last week, there's plenty of reasons to drown your consciousness in alcohol.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.680
That's for sure.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.420
We could refer to the aforementioned anxiety and depression not least.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.985
And so ...

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.635
And the sorts of drugs that people are prone to take

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.480
are chemicals that take the affective edge off the tragedy of life...

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700
so

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:03.645
so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800
Back to the issue of fear.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.760
I mean... Abraham is self-conscious

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.600
because that's what this commentary says

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.460
But the thing is... is he moves forward despite that.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.900
He's self-conscious and he knows the danger, but he moves forward despite that.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.740
And that's actually the appropriate response in the face of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.220
actual non-naive understanding of what constitutes life.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
Like if you're naive and you move forward, it's like well what the hell do you know.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.720
You know... There is no courage in naivety, because you don't know what there is to stop you.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.000
You don't know what dangers you might apprehend.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.395
But to be aware of

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.660
what it is that your problem is - so to be alert existentially, let's say,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.420
or to be fully self-conscious means that you're perfectly aware of your limitations or how you might be hurt

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.540
and then to make the decision to move forward into the unknown and the land of the of the stranger anyway...

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.780
That's the... I would say that's one of the secrets to a good life

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.120
And I can say that really without...

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.640
fear of contradiction I would say, because

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.120
the clinical literature on this is very, very clear.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.380
What you do with people who are afraid

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.315
and to some degree depressed, but certainly anxious, is...

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:12.055
You lay out what they're anxious about, first of all.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080
In detail. What is it that your're afraid of. What might happen.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.940
And then you decompose it into small problems, hypothetically manageable problems.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.480
And then you have the person expose themselves to the thing that they're afraid of.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.700
And what happens isn't that they get less afraid. That isn't what the clinical literature...

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.240
...indicates, exactly.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.600
What happens instead is they get braver.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.020
And that's not the same thing, right? Because if you get less afraid, it's like:

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.480
"Well the world isn't as dangerous as i thought it was", you know, "silly me..."

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.320
If you get braver, that's not what happens. What happens is "Yeah, the damn world is just as dangerous as I thought...

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.600
...or maybe it's even more dangerous than I thought, but it turns out that there is something in me, that responds

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.420
to taking that on as a voluntary challenge and grows and thrives as a consequence."

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.600
And there's no doubt about this. Even the psychophysiological findings are quite clear

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.800
If you...

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.780
If you...

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.640
If you impose a stressor on two groups of people and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.900
on one group the stressor is imposed involuntarily

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.960
and in the other group the stressor is picked up voluntarily

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.240
The people who pick up the stressor voluntarily use a whole different psychophysiological system to deal with it.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.440
They use the system that's associated with approach and challenge.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.240
And not the system that's associated with defensive aggression and withdrawal.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.040
And the system that's associated with challenge is much more associated with positive emotion

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.540
and much less associated with negative emotion.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.860
It's also much less hard on, you because the defensive posturing system (the pray animal system)

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.360
man, when that thing kicks in, it's all systems are go for you. You know...

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.300
The gas is pushed down to the... or the pedal is pushed down to the metal and the breaks are on

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.820
You're using future resources that you could be storing for future time right now in the present to ready yourself for emergency.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.440
There's nothing simple or trivial at all about the idea of being called to move forthrightly forward

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.720
into the strange and unknown.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.740
And there's real adventure that's associated with that. Right?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.140
So that's an exciting thing, which is part of the reason why people travel.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.240
And then also to see yourself as the sort of creature that can do that - is willing to do that on a habitual basis

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.640
is also the right kind of tonic for - I hate this word - for your self-esteem.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.715
You know. Because the self-esteem has nothing to do with feeling good about yourself.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.340
As I already mentioned.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.100
There isn't necessarily a reason why apriori you should just feel good about yourself. But

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.220
if you can view yourself acting in a courageous and forthright manner

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.335
and encountering the world and trying to improve your lot

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.440
and taking risks - you know - in a non-naive way, well then you have something that you can

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.580
comfort yourself with at night, when you're wondering what the whole damn point  is of your futile and miserable life.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.860
And so... And that's necessary, because

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.760
it's often the case that you wake up at four in the morning

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.920
or at least sometimes the case that you wake up at four in the morning when things haven't been going that well

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.540
and wonder just what the hell the point is of your futile and miserable life.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.820
You have to have something real to set against that. It can't be just rationalizations about

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.680
how, you know, you are a valuable person among others. Even though that's true, that's not good enough.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.200
You need something that's more realistic to set against that.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.080
And observing courage in yourself is definitely one of the things that....

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.060
that can help you sleep soundly at night, when things are destabilized a little bit around you.
