thought especially in light of the
 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.190
thought especially in light of the
earlier panels that we heard I would

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200
earlier panels that we heard I would
 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.080
earlier panels that we heard I would
start by saying what I think is not sure

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090
start by saying what I think is not sure
 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.980
start by saying what I think is not sure
but short-termism is not about and it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990
but short-termism is not about and it
 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.280
but short-termism is not about and it
will help me set the stage for what I

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
will help me set the stage for what I
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.319
will help me set the stage for what I
would like to say in terms of solutions

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329
would like to say in terms of solutions
 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.880
would like to say in terms of solutions
to bring to short-termism so the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890
to bring to short-termism so the
 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.410
to bring to short-termism so the
difficulty that we face as those of us

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420
difficulty that we face as those of us
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.090

who are engaging in the short-termism

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100
who are engaging in the short-termism
 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.620
who are engaging in the short-termism
debate is that we're dealing with an

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630
debate is that we're dealing with an
 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.969
debate is that we're dealing with an
institution the stock market which is a

expectations of what's coming in the
 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.000
expectations of what's coming in the
future of earnings cash flows etc that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010
future of earnings cash flows etc that
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.670
future of earnings cash flows etc that
that are going to be realized in the

that are going to be realized in the
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.850
that are going to be realized in the
future so it's a forward-looking

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860
future so it's a forward-looking
 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.640
future so it's a forward-looking
institution we're looking at and then

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650
institution we're looking at and then
 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.539
institution we're looking at and then
it's hard to square that with the idea

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549
it's hard to square that with the idea
 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.320
it's hard to square that with the idea
that somehow it's not for looking the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330
that somehow it's not for looking the
 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.880
that somehow it's not for looking the
right way or not forward-looking enough

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890
right way or not forward-looking enough
 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.830
right way or not forward-looking enough
anyway so that's the problem potentially

difficult conceptual problem we're

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580
difficult conceptual problem we're
 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.260
difficult conceptual problem we're
facing one important point I want to

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270
facing one important point I want to

form of myopia so sometimes the debate

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239
form of myopia so sometimes the debate
 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.259
form of myopia so sometimes the debate
gets narrowed down to the activists or

to the market so the point is there is a

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:31.640
to the market so the point is there is a
 

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.810
to the market so the point is there is a
lot of evidence out there or shorter

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:34.820

here to propose a new idea actually it's

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:42.860
here to propose a new idea actually it's
 

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.670
here to propose a new idea actually it's
not so new it's a been

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680
not so new it's a been
 

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.760
not so new it's a been
out for a few years and that's the idea

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:47.770
out for a few years and that's the idea
 

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.480
out for a few years and that's the idea
of loyalty shares and I thought I would

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.490
of loyalty shares and I thought I would
 

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.610
of loyalty shares and I thought I would
just quickly describe the main idea and

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620
 
 

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.260
 
not go into too much detail about this

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.270
not go into too much detail about this
 

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.900
not go into too much detail about this
about the design specifics I think this

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:00.910
about the design specifics I think this
 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.139
about the design specifics I think this
is not the right time and and then maybe

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:04.149
is not the right time and and then maybe
 

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:06.240
is not the right time and and then maybe
it just conclude so here's the basic

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.250
it just conclude so here's the basic
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.030
it just conclude so here's the basic
idea you have a loyalty period that's

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040
idea you have a loyalty period that's
 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.949
idea you have a loyalty period that's
basically a period that a stock needs to

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959
basically a period that a stock needs to
 

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:17.490
basically a period that a stock needs to
be held to be considered a loyal

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:17.500
be held to be considered a loyal
 

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.750
be held to be considered a loyal
shareholder and then you grant

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760
shareholder and then you grant
 

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.120
shareholder and then you grant
shareholders loyalty warrants which they

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.130
shareholders loyalty warrants which they
 

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.210
shareholders loyalty warrants which they
can exercise after the loyalty period

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:27.220
can exercise after the loyalty period
 

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.260
can exercise after the loyalty period
and then you can have a loyalty exercise

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.270
and then you can have a loyalty exercise
 

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.210
and then you can have a loyalty exercise
period after following the loyalty

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:33.220
period after following the loyalty
 

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.040
period after following the loyalty
period and the big point is that if

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.050
period and the big point is that if
 

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.050
period and the big point is that if
you're buying whole investor for three

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.060

years you get the warrant if you're not
a ban hold investor you don't get the

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:43.930
a ban hold investor you don't get the
 

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.340
a ban hold investor you don't get the
warrant and however whether you're going

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
warrant and however whether you're going
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.630
warrant and however whether you're going
to get the warrant or not is purely

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:48.640
to get the warrant or not is purely
 

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.360
to get the warrant or not is purely
driven by investor behavior and this can

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.370
driven by investor behavior and this can
 

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.460
driven by investor behavior and this can
be you know this is a tool that can be

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:56.470
be you know this is a tool that can be
 

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.430
be you know this is a tool that can be
used to reward costly monitoring

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440
used to reward costly monitoring

not a design that we're favoring we're

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:46.640
not a design that we're favoring we're
 

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.970

that's the first point I wanted to make

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:55.550
that's the first point I wanted to make
 

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.770
that's the first point I wanted to make
the second point is that the you can

00:13:59.770 --> 00:13:59.780
the second point is that the you can
 

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.520
the second point is that the you can
design the loyalty we share in a way

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:03.530

during the loyalty period so this is not
 

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.610
during the loyalty period so this is not
an entrenchment device this the reason

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:18.620
an entrenchment device this the reason
