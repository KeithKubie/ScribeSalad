00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.320
While I’m a big fan of summer, I’m not
such a fan of the sun.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.520
I get burned in like 2 seconds, but what about
wild animals?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.660
Do they get as sunburned as I do?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.930
Hey sunshine, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.029
Animals live in some pretty extreme places,
like the sahara where the sun scorches the

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.029
desert.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.039
But it’s not like they go inside and turn
on the AC and call it good.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.130
How do these animals beat the heat?

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.720
It’s in the hairs’ shape.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:51.340
if you were to cut it in half, a cross section
would show it looks like a triangle.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.150
This shape is really good at reflecting energy
in the visible and near-infrared end of the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.150
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.829
But because of their unique shape the hair
also is really good at letting the ants cool

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.829
off.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.760
They’re “highly emissive in the mid-infrared
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum”.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.460
This way the ants can release some of their
excess body heat.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.750
These hairs appear silvery in bright sunlight
hence their name, the researchers described

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.380
the ants appearance as looking “ like droplets
of mercury on the desert surface”

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.050
Speaking of weird droplets.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.690
Apparently back in the day circuses used to
advertise hippos that sweat blood!

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.940
Turns out, it’s not blood.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.970
It’s sunscreen according to a study published
in the journal Nature.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.890
That’s right, HIPPOS MAKE THEIR OWN SUNSCREEN
TOO.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.820
Which is also helpful when you live in sub
saharan Africa.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.080
When hippos get overheated they excrete two
sticky substances.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.530
One red, one orange.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.729
Both act as really good sunscreens by absorbing
UV light.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.170
But the red pigment also acts as an antibiotic!

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.100
So hippos rarely get wounds.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.380
Another study published in the journal Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society A found

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.990
that the sweat also acts as a sunscreen because
it’s reflective.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.110
The sweat contains microscopic liquid crystalline
structures that scatters light.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.020
The structures look like concentric rings
that occur at intervals similar to the wavelengths

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
of visible light.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.270
But hippos aren’t alone in their ability
to make their own sunscreen.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.950
Recent research published in the journal eLife
found other animals like Zebrafish can make

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.450
their own sunscreen too.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.560
Zebrafish produce a chemical called gadusol
that protects against UV radiation.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.470
Previously this chemical was found in stuff
like fungi or bacteria, and researchers thought

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.220
that the fish got the chemical by eating those
things.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.950
Turns out they can make it themselves.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.170
The researchers were investigating compounds
similar to gadusol in fungi and bacteria.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.320
And they found that fish also possess the
genes that code for an enzyme, EVVS, which

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.030
reacts with other compounds to produce gadusol.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.480
They also found that some birds and reptiles,
like chickens and alligators have the gene

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480
too.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.800
Since it’s commonly found in algae, the
researchers think it’s an ancient trait.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.490
That trait was passed on to vertebrates and
remained useful for millions of years.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.060
So maybe these species have been making sunscreen
for millions of years or the researchers suggest

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.370
that gadusol could be beneficial for other
processes like as an antioxidant, or in stress

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.940
response, or embryonic development.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.490
As for us, we do have some natural protection
from the sun and heat.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.340
We’ve got melanin in our skin, which absorbs
both UVA and UVB types of light and might

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.430
have other protective properties.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.380
So the more freckles I get, the more protected
I am from sun damage.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.040
But freckles don’t always cut it, so thank
goodness for sun screen.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.580
And for your own protection, do you know what
SPF means?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.319
Basically SPF 30 means you can stay outside
30X longer without burning than if you didn’t

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.380
have sunscreen on.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.690
SPF 30 usually protects against 97% of UVB
rays but not against UVA rays, for that you’d

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.489
need “broad spectrum sunscreen”.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.660
But the only way to be 100% protected is to
stay inside and be on your laptop all day.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.070
but if you have to go outside, be sure to
lather up.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.070
You’re no hippo.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.280
Whales on the other hand, not so lucky.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280
Whales get sunburned too!

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:50.670

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:59.849
So are you a sun bather or do you prefer to
sit alone in a dark room watching youtube

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.879
all summer?
