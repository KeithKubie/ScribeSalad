MING: Well, good
afternoon, my friends.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.770
My name is Ming.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.060
I'm the Jolly Good Fellow
of Google for one more

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.310
week, because next week
I'm retiring from Google.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.239
And this is the very last
guest I am hosting at Google,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.445
and very fittingly, it
is Professor Bob Thurman.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:24.610
Bob is a wonderful human being.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.310
Behind his back, we
call him Buddha Bob.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.060
He's sort of like--
I think he should

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
be more like Bob the Buddha,
sort of like Bob the Builder,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.162
except with better karma.

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:41.930
Bob the Buddha is considered
the leading American expert

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.070
on Tibetan Buddhism.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.970
In 1962, Bob became
the first American

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.070
to wear the robes of a
Tibetan Buddhist monk

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.965
outside of Halloween.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.770
Eventually, he left his job,
and he became a professor

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.740
at American University,
and right now, he

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.420
is a Jey Tsong Khapa professor
of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.270
studies at Columbia University.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.322
He's also the president
of the Tibet House, which

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.780
he founded with this guy called
Richard Gere, which you may

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.732
or may have heard of, and
also Philip Glass, which you

00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:21.940
may or may not have heard of.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.564
He's also the president
of the American

00:01:23.564 --> 00:01:25.870
Institute of Buddhist Studies.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.890
He was see considered one of
25 most influential Americans

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.444
in the 1997.

00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:35.360
And in 1998, he didn't
do anything after that.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550
He has been profiled in "The
New York Times," in "People"

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.780
magazine, in "Time," he has
appeared on CNN, "The News

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.970
Hour," Larry King, Oprah.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.330
He is close personal
friends with the Dalai Lama.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.890
He knows all the dirt,
so ask him later.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.550
He's also the father
of Uma Thurman,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.770
so he knows the dirt as well.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.440
Ask him too.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.970
His hobbies are carpentry,
landscaping, and saving

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.660
the world.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.710
He's here to talk
about his latest book,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.490
"Love Your Enemies."

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.945
So now that I have this
book, all I need is enemies.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.342
My friends, please welcome
our dear friend, Bob Thurman.

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:20.054
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.830
ROBERT THURMAN:
Thank you so much.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.770
Thank you, Ming.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.703
So sweet.

00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:26.582
That was very sweet.

00:02:26.582 --> 00:02:31.940
I really enjoy your introducing
me more than talking.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.270
I'm sure.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.147
And just I'm doing this, or
my wife will be mad at me if I

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:38.646
don't.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400
So great.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.180
So hi, everybody.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.470
I was asked to
talk about ethics,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.666
and I just made a slide.

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.790
I do have a lot of PowerPoint,
but for some reason,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.320
I didn't feel like
doing PowerPoint.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.350
So you probably get
PowerPoints all the time

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.930
on engineering problems and
God knows what down here,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.540
so I didn't think I would
do that while I was here.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.770
But then I decided I
would make this one slide.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.410
And my talk takes
off from a book

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.200
that His Holiness
the Dalai Lama wrote

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.262
called "Beyond Religion--
Ethics for a Whole World."

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.220
Have any of you ever seen
that book or read it?

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.340
Ming has, I'm sure,
and a few people have.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.750
And what he does there is
because His Holiness has always

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.660
been trying to
improve understanding

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.470
between different kinds of
groups of people who identify

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.800
themselves as different
from each other,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.700
and his main job there, one of
his three main jobs in life,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.320
as he puts it, is to improve
the mutual understanding

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.530
of the world religions, because
there's been so much conflict

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.340
in history between them.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.100
But one thing that he does
when he has meetings, world

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.460
religious meetings,
he always a little bit

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.590
flummoxes the other
world religious leaders

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.980
by saying that there's
another world religion which

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.790
is secularism, which are
nonbelievers, as he puts it.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.970
And he used to say-- I don't
know the statistical basis

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.930
of him saying that.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.240
I never did ask him.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.420
He used to say, if there are
4 billion people who believe

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.890
in some religion or another,
there are at least 1 billion

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.160
or 1 and 1/2 billion who don't.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.580
That was a previous
earlier count, I guess.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.970
Now we're up to seven.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.150
So I don't know how
he does it just now.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.730
And they do have a belief,
and they have a belief

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.300
of what lies beyond death.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.360
They have a belief,
and actually I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.655
think I can prove to anyone who
wants to debate it that that is

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:47.750
a faith belief actually, rather
than an evidenced belief, which

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.270
we can discuss.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.130
And so in that book,
which he originally

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.410
wanted to title "Secular
Ethics," he wanted

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.540
to show that there is a reason
and a motive for human beings

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.750
to be ethical,
because it fulfills

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.050
the aim of human beings,
which finally, of course,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.360
like all animals, the aim of
any animal is to avoid pain

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.600
and to achieve happiness.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.230
Avoid suffering and
achieve happiness.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.030
That's sort of the
basic goal of everyone.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.930
Whatever other goals
they may set themselves,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.170
no one wants to suffer.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.580
No one wants pain.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.220
Everyone wants pleasure
and/or happiness,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.640
depending on how
they define them.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.780
And then there's
mental levels of pain

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.980
and physical levels of pain.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.910
And so he wrote that
book, and in the book,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.210
basically, he used sort of
anthropological insights,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.320
pretty much, and some
biological, a little bit

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.010
of biological thinking
of secularists

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.910
or scientific
materialists to prove

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.290
that the human being as a
mammal, as a being that when

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.580
it's young is helpless for
many years, at least a decade,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.760
at least till the teenage
time, at which point

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.460
the human being thinks
they're independent.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.680
But the parents don't.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.050
The parents think they need
help right up until they're

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.030
parents themselves pretty much,
and sometimes even after that.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.820
Grandparents get sucked in on
babysitting and what have you.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.090
And I can attest to that.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.600
And so because of
that, human beings

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.720
do depend on the kindness of
strangers, not only Mae West,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.670
but everybody.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.610
After all, the mammal
conceives a new life,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.870
the more intelligent half of the
mammals, that is-- the females.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.240
They allow a total
stranger to come

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.150
and have a condo in their
belly, which is quite a thing.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.140
I think if guys think about
it, I think you'd be hesitant.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.180
I would.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.020
I don't know about you, but
suddenly, there's something

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.880
down there, and it wants
a different kind of food,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.060
and it wants this and that,
and it kicks after awhile.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.660
And then it's a
real pain more than

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.500
in the neck to get it
outside of yourself.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.650
And so that's all a bunch
of altruistic activity

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.160
of the females, and the
males have to carry along.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.660
They have to end up helping,
so mammals' basic nature

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.040
is what he's trying to say.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.440
Buddhists don't like
the idea of anything

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.610
having an absolute nature.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.060
They have a wonderful
hermeneutic principle

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.430
in Buddhist thought, in
Buddhist science, I should say,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.640
because in Buddhism,
philosophy and science are not

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.420
necessarily separated so
dramatically as it has

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.370
become in the West nowadays.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.620
But in Buddhist science,
there is a rule, a hermeneutic

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.030
or a rule of interpretation.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.760
And that is that there is
only one kind of teaching that

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.710
is considered
definitive in meaning,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.770
and that kind is the pure
negation of something of self,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.080
the negation of
substance, the negation

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.240
of any sort of a relative
absolute, you could say.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.910
It's almost simplistic
and so simple, actually.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.520
The famous concept
of emptiness--

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.700
we've all heard of
it-- selflessness--

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.230
these are famous concepts.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.010
And what these mean, they don't
mean that things don't exist.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.930
Emptiness is not nothingness.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.300
Completely different word in
any of the Buddhist languages.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.960
And what emptiness means is
that all relative things are

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.470
empty of any
non-relative element

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.870
or what they would
call intrinsic reality,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.500
intrinsic identity, any
sort of thing like that,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.530
which is really almost like
it's a definition of the words.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.190
It's almost a tautological.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.680
If something's absolute, you
can't relate, because absolute

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.390
is the opposite of relative.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.390
And so if anybody comes up
with some sort of an absolute

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.100
and says it relates as some
monotheistic teachings do,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.810
as some versions of
Buddhism do, then they

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.840
are simply misusing language,
to use a Wittgensteinian

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.210
expression.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:10.100
And so His Holiness, therefore,
is very like a scientist,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.940
and great Buddhist
philosophers are

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.750
like scientists in
that all teachings

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.200
about relative
reality are relative.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.190
That is to say more or less
valid within a context.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.530
There is no absolute truth
about relative things,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.600
if you follow me, except that
none of them are absolute.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.370
That's the only one.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.260
That's really a logical thing.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.920
But why is that it?

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.190
So it seems so simple like
why is that a big thing?

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:43.010
The reason it's a big thing
is that the human bad habit,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.750
cognitive habit, emotional
habit, instinctual habit that

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.800
causes all suffering for
human beings in Buddha's

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.800
psychological and
philosophical analysis

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.660
is the feeling that
we habitually have

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.780
that we are absolute.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.260
The person has a feeling,
the unenlightened person

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.010
has a feeling that the one thing
they are sure of-- for example,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.760
Descartes perfectly well
illustrates-- stop vibrating--

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.470
perfectly illustrated
that when he decided

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.210
that the one thing he
was absolutely sure of

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.337
was that he was worrying
about what was absolute.

00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:21.670
In other words, he was thinking.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.720
That's the famous thing.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.350
He didn't need
Buddhism for that.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.720
And everyone subconsciously or
subliminally or instinctively

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.980
feels something about themself
is absolute, and therefore,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.130
when pressed in a corner
of a life and death

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.080
thing, like my life is
the one absolute for me

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.810
type of thing people feel
that, which, of course,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.800
from Buddha's point
of view is erroneous.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.900
His teaching of selflessness
means that that's an error.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.710
That doesn't mean
that I don't exist.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.430
It means that I am a relational
being, not an absolute being.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.770
That means that other beings
are equally as real and as

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.400
important as I am, and that
little shift of not being

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.270
the absolute center
of it all yourself,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.310
of coming to this
viscerally understand

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.192
that, first intellectually
and philosophically understand

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:08.900
that, and then viscerally
understand it--

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.250
that's the whole campaign
of Buddhist teaching.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.540
Because once you do
really understand--

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.510
like I had an old
Mongolian guru who

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.700
had a couple of great sayings--
passed away a long time ago,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.580
but one of his
great sayings was,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.080
everyone goes around--
this was three or four

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.490
decades before "The Matrix."

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:34.120
He said, everyone goes around
secretly thinking, I'm the one.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.270
Therefore, I nearly fainted
when they started on

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.400
that in "The Matrix," going to
see the oracle, who's the one,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.280
you know.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.380
So everybody secretly
thinks, I'm the one.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.020
And then the second
one is, people are not

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.790
wrong to say that they are real.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.410
The problem is people
think they're really real.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.050
So all it is.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.290
A lot of people misunderstand
Buddhism and think

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.390
that the big insight is
that you don't exist,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.410
and then you're free,
and everything is cool.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.410
And actually, there are
certain modern Buddhists

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.590
who think that scientific
materialism ratifies that

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.080
by discovering that
you're just a brain

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.990
bouncing around
inside a skull box

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.750
and running around until
the brain gets tired,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.710
and you have a stroke or
collapse or something,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.700
and then you don't
exist anymore.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.790
So in a way, essentially,
you don't exist.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.520
You're just a robot
that is deluded

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.080
into thinking you exist, as
long as your heart is pumping,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.330
and your brain is registering
and convincing you

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.010
that you're there, but
you're not really there,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.640
because if you just
squash your brain,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.310
you simply cease to exist.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.570
So that's what Buddha was saying
in selflessness and emptiness,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.980
and even some translators
used to translate emptiness

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.530
as nothingness, which
is just completely very

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.010
bad, because Buddha is
very clear that emptiness

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.040
as a sort of ultimate
cosmological principle

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.700
or something like that is
a middle way, a central way

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.580
between nihilism,
nothingness, and absolutism,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.270
making some sort of
absolute out of something.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.560
Emptiness is therefore really
what it truly is is relativism,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.830
and Buddha really is the
discovery of relativity.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.220
And therefore, ethics was a
central thing for Buddhism,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.030
because ethics operates on
all levels-- physical, not

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:26.885
just physical, not just
verbal, but also mental.

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:28.240
Well, Jimmy Carter knew that.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.650
Remember, Jimmy-- most
of you are too young.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.440
Somebody remember Jimmy Carter
wrote in "Esquire" magazine

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.330
how he sinned in his mind.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.080
He lusted after some
young thing or something.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.480
And I don't know how
Rosalynn took that,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.590
but the Buddhists say you
can do that in your mind.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.250
In other words, you can commit
a negative ethical act just

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.106
with your mind, even
if you don't act on it.

00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:51.730
And that's one of
the reasons Buddhists

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.880
are so much into searching
inside themselves.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.410
I have to say it with the
right emphasis in this room.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.720
So it's a very big deal.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.480
Ethics is a very big deal.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.140
Now the problem-- so then His
Holiness does that in his book

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.580
by talking about what human
life is like and the fact

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.010
that we do love-- are
happy when we love someone,

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.530
not only when we're loved,
but also when we do love,

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.870
we become very, very happy.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.740
You know, Gene Kelly dancing
in the rain, what have you.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:32.150
And he has two pillars, he
said, of his secular ethics.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.000
And one of them is
human nature, the nature

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.040
of the human as a
social animal, which

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.500
he takes from a certain
side in anthropology,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.800
although he cites many studies.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.460
There are more and more
studies that-- actually,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.020
in the famous argument between
Ashley Montagu and Konrad

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.660
Lorenz historically in the
history of anthropology,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.190
there are many more things
supporting Ashley Montagu

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.860
that humans are really
basically gentle.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.190
They're basically kind.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.000
But they can become vicious,
worse than any animal,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.560
because the nature
of the human being

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.860
is so completely programmable,
deprogrammable, reprogrammable,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.530
which is why education is
so critically important.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:18.820
Anyway, basically among animals,
the human is a more gentle one.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.030
We don't have claws.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.460
We don't have fangs.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.670
We don't have armored skin.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.580
We're soft-skinned and so forth.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.400
And the young take
existence inside the bodies

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.510
of the female, which
is more of a connection

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.720
to the next generation
than if you just

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.550
drop an egg somewhere in the
riverbank or by the ocean

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.830
and wait for the little
turtle to crawl out.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.820
There's a little less
parenting involved

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.250
when you do it with eggs.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.964
So he uses that.

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.380
And then the second one is the
relationality of everything

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.380
and that everyone
is very interrelated

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.870
and that people
are never happier

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.450
than when they do something
successfully for someone else,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.010
and they feel really good about
that like seeing that person

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.290
smile, seeing that child happy.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.450
They really do,
and then that leads

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.920
to his slogan about
compassion that he does,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.120
where he says that if you
want someone else to be happy,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.000
be compassionate to them.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.830
And he says if you
want to be happy, be

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.180
compassionate to
someone else, which

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.120
is his favorite slogan
coming from the tradition

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.140
of Shantideva, a great, great
Indian philosopher and sage

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.890
and yogi call Shantideva,
who wrote a great book called

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.860
"Way of the Bodhisattva"
that I recommend to everyone.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.340
It's one of the great world
classics of spirituality,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.610
actually, in which he makes the
argument very, very thoroughly

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.390
that our nature
is such that when

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.620
we do something for
someone else that succeeds,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.400
it is its own reward.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.040
And they may even make the very
clever psychological argument

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.510
that when you focus on doing
things for others, then

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.740
actually, you temporarily forget
about what you need yourself.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.280
You tend to.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.569
And then that's a
key to happiness,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.569
because the one certain
way to be unhappy

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.670
is to think, how happy am I?

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.810
That's an immediate killer.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.410
The minute you think,
how good is it?

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.930
What am I getting out of here?

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.990
What's going on?

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.690
It's like, oh, no,
it's not that good.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.930
Whatever marvelous
experience it is

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.060
when you turn to evaluate
it, you're never satisfied.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.360
The Rolling Stones have
a song like that, right?

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.060
Ain't no satisfaction.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.790
So that's His Holiness's
thing on secularism,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.560
which is a beautiful
book, and it

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.390
has trainings in the back,
which is another novel

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.040
concept to Western
psychologists, which

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.760
is that you can
train yourself to be

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.930
more compassionate
and more loving,

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.120
that it isn't that a
person is just loving.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.230
Of course, there's a
set point that Buddhists

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.230
would agree from
one's upbringing

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.880
if one is traumatically
brought up,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.520
it's maybe difficult to
feel it's natural to be nice

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.010
and to be loving if you've been
guarding and defending yourself

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.760
against abuse as a child.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.520
But basically, whatever
level of lovingness one

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.710
is or has as a person can be
much more highly developed.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.050
And the negative side, the
opposite of loving-- hating,

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.470
despising, et cetera-- can
be diminished by training.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.570
And that's very important.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.880
Should be a part of
everyone's education.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.750
It actually is the final purpose
of the Search Inside Yourself

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.260
strategy, because once
you search in there,

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.380
you find the negative
reflexes and mechanisms that

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.050
have caused you trouble in
life, or you lost friends

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.980
where you annoyed and
offended people, where

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.380
this and that happened, where
you were dissatisfied also

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.530
yourself, and then
you can deconstruct,

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.670
and you can disempower those
negative mental habits,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.610
and you can reinforce and
empower the positive ones

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.840
to a huge degree.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.800
And Buddhists would not agree
with those modern psychologists

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.450
who keep insisting and
write all best-seller books

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.880
about how helpless you are,
that your unconscious is doing

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.200
everything, and you really
can't really-- what you

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.250
think is a free choice is not.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.590
And Buddhists don't agree.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.820
They do agree that a very
unenlightened person is

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.460
pretty much robotic in their
reactivity and their reaction

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.860
patterns, but the
whole path of Buddhism

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.300
is to become conscious of
your unconscious actually

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.650
and to reshape it.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.490
It's like the Hercules myth
of cleaning the Augean stables

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.310
is very perfect for the
Buddhist enterprise,

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.200
because the human being
in Buddha's analysis,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.830
the reason it is such
a valuable life form,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.030
and that every one
of you has what

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.570
they call in Buddhism
the precious jewel

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.420
of a life endowed with
liberty and opportunity.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.250
And the liberty has
to do with the fact

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.790
that you are free of
many kinds of defects.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.740
You're not born
in a species that

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.360
has no language, that has
no culture, that can't share

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360
the mind of others
because of having speech

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.860
and so forth,
literature, in our case,

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.890
and memory, and a certain
type of self-reflexiveness

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.320
is not available to lower animal
forms in the human animal form.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.610
And some humans, of course,
are less than others.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.980
And so they're not all the same.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.188
So the liberties are like
that, and the opportunities

00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:26.560
are where you can
educate yourself,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.950
because if a human being, if
a saint, or a near saint--

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.200
actually, in Buddha's view,
a complete saint can never

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.830
become a murderer,
a perfect saint,

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.430
but there are degrees of really
niceness and sainthood that

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:44.010
could become very evil by
different circumstances

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.510
and reindoctrination.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.780
And similarly, even the Buddha
had one famous disciple,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.550
Angulimala, who
was a serial killer

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.170
and became a saint,
complete saint actually

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.980
in his lifetime by
changing his behavior

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.750
and so forth, and then went to
some of the families of some

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.300
of the people he had killed.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.490
And he actually
was so genuinely--

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.760
he offered his life
to them anyway,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.367
if that would have helped.

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.950
And they actually
didn't take his life

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.520
when they realized he really
had totally changed, actually.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.200
Anyway, that's the Buddha's
analysis of the human being.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:22.350
So I presume, do all of what
is the fourfold for the four

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.190
noble truths?

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.670
Everybody know
that in this room?

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.510
Anybody doesn't know
that, Buddha's sort

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.570
of original teaching?

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.690
A few people.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.140
Well, I can quickly summarize.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.950
It's important to do,
because the people always

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.850
think, especially new people,
that Buddha's main job was

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.646
making a religion.

00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.520
Now I'm going back from
Dalai Lama to Buddha,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.210
because Buddha did the same
thing as Dalai Lama did

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.580
in the sense that he grounded
his version of ethics

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.760
in what would be considered
scientific reality of that time

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.460
and actually may well still be
considered scientific reality.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.750
But I'm not going to get
into that necessarily,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.500
unless we go into a question
period, and you want me to.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.660
So in other words, what
His Holiness Dalai Lama is

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.546
doing is same thing Buddha did.

00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:08.920
His Holiness is
doing it in terms

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.980
of secular science or
materialist science

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.670
today, which is the orthodoxy.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.030
It's not the dogmatic
orthodoxy among scientists

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.800
today, scientific
materialism, and in his day,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.330
Buddha did that as well.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.540
Shakyamuni Buddha
did that as well,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.694
which is the basis
of Buddhist ethics,

00:22:26.694 --> 00:22:28.360
and that's what I
want to talk about it.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.480
Anyway, the four noble
truths, his first Noble Truth

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.234
was that the unenlightened
person is bound to suffer.

00:22:36.234 --> 00:22:37.650
It's not really a
religious thing.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.330
It's a scientific and
psychological analysis

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.900
of the human condition, and
and also of animals, actually,

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.410
as well, at a worse
level than the human.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.830
But what it means
is that someone

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:00.190
who has a false sense
of what they are,

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.740
and this is especially
defined as it exaggerates

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.940
their identity, thinking that
that's an absolute thing,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.190
and they are
absolutely themselves,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.350
and the rest of the universe is
absolutely different from them.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.857
That person in that condition,
and that's at a visceral level.

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:20.690
They may not even have
that as a philosophy,

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.370
but that's at a visceral level.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.615
That person is doomed to suffer,
because obviously, if it's

00:23:26.615 --> 00:23:30.810
you versus the universe, you're
going to lose that struggle.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.710
No one can overdo it.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.670
And then the theisms, the
different forms of theism

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:40.300
tend to console us for that
losing experience of living

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.460
life unto death, and with being
sick and growing old and having

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.370
all kinds of things
happen to us,

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.800
and having the pleasures and
joys that we have not last.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.100
But we're consoled that there
is an absolute being outside

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.070
of the universe that somehow
put us in this situation,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.190
and as long as we pay
dues to that being

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.650
and believe in it, that
being will save us.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.000
And then we'll have
bliss after death.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
But that's just
sort of transferring

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.010
the locus of that absolute
thing into something

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.010
that is just presumed to
be outside the universe.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.870
The person who
doesn't do that, they

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.710
think that there's an essential
soul in themselves that's

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:21.520
a fixed identity that is somehow
disconnected from everything,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.130
and they try to
withdraw and retreat

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.750
into that in various ways.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.990
And actually, the
motor materialist

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.697
thinks so too, surprisingly.

00:24:30.697 --> 00:24:32.530
They may think they
don't, but they actually

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:37.260
do, because since they are
certain that by their brain

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.400
ceasing, they will become
unconscious permanently,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.790
and their mind will
cease to exist forever,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.070
including having no memory
of ever having existed,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.850
they are saying that they
carry within them an essence

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.500
of nothingness, actually.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.340
That's sort of the
existential thing.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.620
So like Jean Paul
Belmondo in Pierrot le Fou

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.170
can light his cigar
and then light

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.510
the fuse of some dynamite
sticks wrapped around his head,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.770
and then the screen goes white.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.150
And that's the idea that
they're reducing themselves

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.870
to their essence, which is
anesthetic unconsciousness.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.450
And yet, there is no evidence
that you're ever going to have

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.950
anaesthetic no
consciousness, and in fact,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.700
if anybody wants to debate the
point with me who considers

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.280
themself a secularist, I
will be delighted to do

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.450
so, because there is no evidence
that you will not exist at some

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.710
point.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.060
There can never be, right?

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.700
If it ever happened to anybody,
nobody ever found them,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.110
and they never reported back.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.090
I always tease my materialist
friends, didn't Carl Sagan

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.720
show up after his death and
announce, it's cool guys.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.840
I really don't exist.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.990
So don't worry about
those churches.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.030
Don't worry about
that reincarnation,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.190
because I'm not here.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.940
Not only did he not do that,
but he never could do that,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.280
and no one will ever find
a non-existent entity.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.890
No one will ever
discover nothingness.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.850
They'll never get a Nobel Prize
for discovering nothingness.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.810
It can never be proven,
because it isn't there,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.250
and now I think that's
by definition nothing

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.200
is not there.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.194
And therefore, it's a blind
faith belief, par excellence.

00:26:16.194 --> 00:26:17.860
There might be gods
that might be there.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.151
Maybe it wouldn't be quite
as absolute as people think,

00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:21.770
but there very well
might be some sort

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.870
of angels and gods and
things, because at least

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.880
that's something that you
might find or not find, so that

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.370
can be proven or disproven.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.210
But nothing can never be
proven, because it isn't there.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.671
We know ahead of time.

00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:35.420
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.830
I know that's a digression.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:43.430
So everyone has that feeling,
the unenlightened person,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.470
and then people also
rag on the Buddha,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.450
because they say
he was a pessimist,

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.660
and he was a depressoid, and
he was a killjoy, because he

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.850
said it's all suffering.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.391
But he never said
it's all suffering.

00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:56.340
He said unenlightened
life is suffering,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.350
is going to be frustrating.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.520
And it's not as
depressed as Socrates,

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.232
who said the unexamined
life is not worth living.

00:27:03.232 --> 00:27:05.190
Buddha never said the
unenlightened life is not

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.740
worth living.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.800
He just said it's going
to be frustrating.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.500
And then the second
Noble Truth is

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.890
the cause of that, which
I already explained.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.510
It's the distorted
sense of self,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.470
the deepest cause--
then craving and hatred

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.300
and these mental things
that arise from you thinking

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.440
you're separate from others,
and therefore, you're

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.790
against your enemies,
and you're attached

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.870
to the ones you
want to incorporate

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.490
in your group, et cetera.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:36.440
And so those are secondary to
the basic sense of absolutizing

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.214
the sense of separate identity.

00:27:38.214 --> 00:27:39.630
And that's the
second Noble Truth.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.520
The third Noble Truth
is Buddha's good news,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.530
which is the prognosis
of the diagnosis,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.870
and the prognosis is that
if you knew what reality

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.600
was, if you realized your
true nature of yourself, which

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.460
you can do, and then
you will be blissful.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.290
You will be in complete bliss,
not necessarily after you

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.030
die, and not
necessarily by dying,

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.730
but even in life, you
can be in perfect bliss.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.930
You can live in a way
like you were living

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.460
in a dream in a matrix,
but a lucid dream,

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.960
where you live a
lucid life, and you

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.600
know exactly what's
going on in that life,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.120
and therefore,
although you might

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.220
seem to be suffering
to others, you actually

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.480
don't really suffer.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.429
It's an amazing
claim, and he didn't

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:30.720
expect people to believe it
actually when he said that.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.360
The Third Noble
Truth, he said, this

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.730
is true for a noble person,
which he defined as someone

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.600
who understands that.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.880
And he said it's
only imaginable,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.560
and it's even
difficult to imagine

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.177
for an unenlightened person.

00:28:42.177 --> 00:28:44.260
So what you have to do
with this third Noble Truth

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.520
is try to imagine it.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.530
Try to imagine some
kind of perfect life

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.910
of being blissful at all times.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.670
Everyone's been
blissful here and there.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.440
I hope everybody at Google
has had a moment of bliss.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.420
I really do hope so.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.410
I'm not asking for a show of
hands, but I just hope so.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.850
So all they're saying is that
if you attain, if you understand

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.640
reality, what Buddha's discovery
is, that when you fully

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.330
understand reality, which
again, is a revolutionary claim

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.110
that a human being can
completely understand reality

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.700
themself and the world
itself fully and completely,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.870
and when they do, they realize
that that reality is bliss

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.600
and that everything is made
of the energy of bliss.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.830
That is to say nirvana
of the Four Noble Truths,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.620
only the third is really real.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.400
You know the first,
second, and fourth

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.000
are only relatively real, and
therefore, somewhat unreal.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.720
So then the fourth
Noble Truth, which

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.710
is where I'm finally
going to get to ethics,

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.060
the fourth Noble
Truth is the truth

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.890
of the path to the realization
of the nature of reality,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.250
which he said was
nirvana, and I'm still

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.830
hoping it is the case.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.410
After 50 years of pursuing
it, I've had hints,

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.640
and I think it is more strongly
than I did when I started,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.790
but I don't claim to be
certain, because you have

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.560
to be a Buddha to be certain.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.080
So anyway, that path is
an educational path, not

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.670
a religious path,
because you realize

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.450
that a person who diagnoses
reality in such a way

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.390
that salvation or liberation,
whatever you want to call it,

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.980
is accomplished not by
faith, but by understanding.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.570
That person is forced
to be an educator.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.200
They can't really
just be a preacher

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.840
like, yeah, believe what I say.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.470
Believe this, believe
that, and then

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.510
you'll be fine, because it
won't necessarily be fine.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.180
Belief is not
enough to transform

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.200
your whole visceral instinctual
structure that it is distorted,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.230
and thereby brings
you into conflict

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.030
with what you relate to, and
therefore, sooner or later

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.220
inevitably, it therefore
makes you suffer.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.490
So then there's the
educational path.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.460
The educational path has
eight branches, components,

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.490
and they have a certain order.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:12.790
And this is where I'm not
against the meditative craze,

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.910
the meditational craze.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:14.800
I'm for it.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.700
But it's not enough by itself
from the Buddhist point

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.490
of view.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.270
In traditional
Buddhist teaching,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:27.880
the meditation part comes after
one has clarified one's world

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.780
view, as they put it, what
they call developing what--

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.030
I got from Alan Wallace actually
this way of translating instead

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.860
of right view-- he's the one-- I
don't know if he originated it,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.810
but he's the one I
first read somewhere.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.730
He calls it realistic world
view versus unrealistic,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.830
and I really like that.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.500
I've always used it
ever since myself.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.440
He was my student,
but I'm not too

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.730
proud to have learned
from him, and we

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.300
do learn from our students.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.020
And realistic world
view is really

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.800
correct, because it leads to
really what Buddhism really

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.360
is is realism, because
it's based on the discovery

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.430
by someone that
reality is bliss.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.070
So ignorance can't be bliss.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.460
Well, even ignorance
is bliss on some very

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.930
super non-dualistic way, but
ignorance of that reality

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.480
causes suffering.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.340
And knowledge of that reality
then is knowledge of bliss,

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.640
that bliss is what you are
and what everything is,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.500
and therefore conveys bliss.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.045
But you have to
re-educate yourself.

00:32:26.045 --> 00:32:27.920
You have to develop the
critical intelligence

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.540
to get rid of all kinds
of half-witted ideas

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.840
and get rid of them
and see through them

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.730
through critical thinking.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.000
And then that's
rectifying your worldview

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.130
and making it more realistic.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.210
And there, again,
it isn't that you

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.210
have to believe there is
such a thing as Buddha,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.050
you have to believe in nirvana.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.450
You're not asked to do
that, because Buddha knows

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.670
that we don't believe that.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.557
If someone comes up and
says it's all bliss,

00:32:54.557 --> 00:32:56.390
we're going to think,
what are they selling?

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.690
Snake oil?

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.740
What is that?

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.000
I'm not in bliss today.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.660
And you know that bliss is
hardly legal in most societies,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.220
in fact.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.160
It's more or less illegal.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.220
So that's not what he wants.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.970
What he wants is to look
at what we do think.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.810
He's challenging us to shift
our sense that where we ascribe

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.457
and invent, what we invest
reality in to challenge it,

00:33:23.457 --> 00:33:25.290
and that's what the
realistic world view is.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.880
Realistic world view is
acceptance of causation.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.550
That's what Buddha
is truly celebrated

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.549
as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.000
That's Buddha is
the one who argued

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.860
for the existence of
causation, so what

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.460
are the causes of
things, and how do you

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.225
interfere with the causes
of negative things?

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.600
That's what the
Buddha's teaching

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.950
was, which is not all religious
teaching if you think about it.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.160
But why is acceptance of
causation the beginning

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.090
of the path of realism?

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.240
Because that self, that
precious absolute self

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.220
somewhere in there that
Descartes imagined was there,

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.720
that less philosophical people
have imagined was there,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.030
and we visually imagine
about ourselves, that

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.115
is some immune to causation.

00:34:14.115 --> 00:34:15.489
It's like that
point of awareness

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.540
you have when you remember
what happened 10 years ago, 15

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.120
years ago, and the way
you sort of remember

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.550
is that you are thinking
to yourself like,

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.699
you were the same point of
subjectivity then as now.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.449
There's like one thing
that doesn't change

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.282
is our sort of point
of subjectivity, which,

00:34:31.282 --> 00:34:34.219
of course, is what Descartes was
looking for, which he actually

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.659
failed to find if you remember
if you read Descartes.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.370
Then he just presumed that,
well, because I'm looking,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.179
that's-- I'm sure of that.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.489
But he couldn't actually
find himself, actually.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.239
He was like a Buddhist
Yogi in that sense.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.469
So the point is if you
accept causality, then even

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.570
your identity is a construct.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.730
It comes from your education,
from your language,

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.730
from your associations,
it changes all the time,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.270
and therefore, you're
a work in progress.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.830
You're a Google program.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:04.664
You can be improved.

00:35:04.664 --> 00:35:06.246
I think I read
something about Google.

00:35:06.246 --> 00:35:08.410
You're never satisfied
with the way things are.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.650
There's something of
your 10 points of Google.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.970
It's because if people
think about it in a new way,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.770
they'll find a
way to improve it.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.590
But that's just the same
as yourself is like that.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.700
If you really realize viscerally
that you're a relative self,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.610
you would be very careful
what you associate

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.190
with, what you subject yourself
to, your consciousness,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.080
and you would want to turn
it into positive things,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.470
and you would want to
develop it artistically.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.730
You'd become a work of art
in a way, your identity

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:35.390
and your self.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.410
It constantly changes.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.560
It's not actually [INAUDIBLE],
which means sameness,

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.020
because it always changes.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.140
But therefore, it can
change for the far better

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.500
is the key thing.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.960
So once you realize that you
are this relational thing,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.620
inextricably interwoven with all
other relational things, beings

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.040
and things, then you
get realistic motivation

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.390
of what to do with your
life, this precious thing

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.650
that you have of being such an
intelligent, self-reflective

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.855
self-creative or
self-destructive being,

00:36:02.855 --> 00:36:04.605
and you don't want to
be self-destructive.

00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:07.990
You want to be self-created, and
particularly because you don't

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.320
indulge in irrational
things that just

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.170
by dying you escape from
every causal consequence,

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.790
because you accept causality.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.350
Therefore, there's no first
cause or uncaused cause.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.660
Universe is beginningless.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.230
There's no final
destruction of everything.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.820
There will always be more
for effects and more effects.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.610
Therefore, everything you
do now physically, verbally,

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.540
and mentally will
have an effect,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.640
and that effect is
potentially infinite.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.370
The consequences are infinite,
which puts tremendous weight

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.780
on what you do, because
you a little bit better

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.890
and a little bit
worse can magnify over

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:49.910
an infinite canvas to
limitless proportions,

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.040
negative or positive.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.740
So then third branch of the
Eightfold Path-- now finally,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.640
we reach ethics.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:03.690
Third is realistic speech,
realistic evolutionary action,

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.310
as I translate karma, and
realistic livelihood--

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.770
those next three.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.530
They are ethics.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.480
Now in their ethics one,
here I have my slide.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.490
There is this marvelous
thing, which is called

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.840
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.870
The tenfold skillful
and unskillful

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:28.470
evolutionary action
path, which is karma.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.270
And I call it
evolutionary on purpose.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.930
Some of my translating colleague
friends get all nervous.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:35.610
Oh, no.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.730
That's the Darwin's word.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.300
You can't use that.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.530
But that's just silly.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.940
Darwin is just a British
gentleman in the 19th century,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.650
and he noticed that he had
some monkey-like qualities,

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.810
and the Galapagos
turtles-- I don't know what

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:50.819
all-- the Beagle.

00:37:50.819 --> 00:37:52.110
The Beagle was the boat, right?

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.070
Not the dog.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.030
Whatever.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.970
He did that, and he
noticed this relationship,

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.570
which was a big shock to
the other white male bearded

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.850
British gentlemen that they
might be related to something,

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.530
some fuzzy wuzzies,
some people they

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.500
were busy genociding
all over the planet

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.130
with their colonialism.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.890
And Buddha recognized
that way back, Buddhists.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.280
Buddhists were like,
not only are we related

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.330
to a bunch of chimpanzees and
dogs and cats and whatever,

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.450
we've all personally been
chimpanzees and dogs and cats,

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.010
so of course we're related.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.530
And if we're not careful,
we'll return to that,

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.770
which would not be desirable.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:34.410
You wouldn't really be able to
do a Google search very well

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.500
with a paw and a claw.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.270
We couldn't read.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.990
So what I love is this
word kushala in Sanskrit.

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.880
Kushala-- people
always translate it

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.860
as virtuous and
non-virtuous, because they

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.330
want to get into moralism.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.000
But actually the
word is skillful,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.840
and why is it skillful?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.070
Why is it skillful
to save lives and not

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.560
to kill and to take lives?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.990
Why?

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.470
Because what did you have
to realize what the goal is?

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:07.010
Buddha's definition-- when
you understand reality,

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.460
in order to understand,
reality is infinite, right?

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.990
You have to become infinite to
understand an infinite thing.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.940
Now everyone here,
not only have they

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.610
had their moment of bliss,
at least one or two,

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.530
but they've had
long time of bliss,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.710
and they've been in love.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.830
Everybody in here has
been in love, I'm sure.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.460
Some may still be-- oh,
there they are, 19 years.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.490
They're in love still.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:37.360
And when you're in love, you
identify with the other person,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.870
and you consider their feeling
as important or more important

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.900
if it's really good.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.470
When love really
lasts, each one.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.820
That's why other people get
jealous of people in love,

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.280
because they're so
deluded the two of them.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.130
Because each one thinks
the other one is so great,

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.690
and nobody else thinks
anybody's great.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.430
And so here are these two
people confirming each other.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.370
Oh, you're the greatest.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.570
Romeo and Juliet, they
kill them off, whatever.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.630
They do their best.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.420
But the point is we know
in a parent and a child,

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.444
especially mother,
but father can also

00:40:10.444 --> 00:40:12.360
identify completely with
the life of the child

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.370
and sort of feel it.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.760
And the good mother knows when
that child needs to be burped,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.020
when it needs food, whatever
it is, it can sense it.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.490
She senses it, because she
empathizes with that child.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.130
So a human being has
this-- but the guys,

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.270
they empathize with their
teammate on the football team

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.130
or their platoon in
the army, a buddy.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.910
And so we have this
ability to expand

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.410
our sense of identification.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.720
Human beings do.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.830
So Buddhahood is simply where
that sense of identification

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.740
has infinitely expanded,
where her being is completely

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.560
filled with every life is
their life, the same as them.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.840
And they identify
with all of it,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.710
and they have the
bliss energy to be

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.600
able to even feel the
sufferings of the others

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.614
without being dragged into
them, but be well enough to be

00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:05.030
able to interact
with them, to try

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.210
to help them suffer less, which
is what the Buddha's job is

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.370
like a doctor.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:14.040
So if that's your goal, if you
imagine there is such a state,

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.660
even though it might take a
million lifetimes to achieve,

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.190
but since you feel that you are
a continuity of such lifetimes

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.080
anyway, so you might as well.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.644
How many of you have
heard of a Bodhisattva?

00:41:27.644 --> 00:41:28.450
A lot of you.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.480
OK, good.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.570
So one time His Holiness
asked me to give an evening

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:38.030
talk before a bunch of people,
big 500, 800, 1,000 people

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.150
were going to take a
Bodhisattva vow, where

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.630
you say I want to
help all beings become

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.912
free of suffering.

00:41:43.912 --> 00:41:45.620
I want to save all
beings from suffering.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.140
It's like [INAUDIBLE] like that.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.720
So I did the night before, but
then my main point of my talk

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:57.730
was to urge people not to
take that vow too lightly,

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.300
because unless you
think that you have

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.500
a common sense of
reality that you

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.900
are going to have this
infinite continuum of future,

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.750
or rather that's your best
bet-- you don't really know,

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.590
but everything else in
nature has a continuity.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.760
So there's the law
of thermodynamics.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.450
So why is your consciousness
the one piece of energy

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.850
that won't have a continuity?

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.780
So the best bet is that
there will be a continuity,

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.885
and as long as you don't have
that as a common sense feeling,

00:42:26.885 --> 00:42:29.260
then it's silly to say, I'm
going to save all beings from

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.510
suffering, because you can't.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.240
There's no time.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.820
Only if you and the
beings are going

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.050
to be carrying on forever.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.380
Now imagine the opposite.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.300
Imagine where you had
a common sense feeling

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.340
that you're never going to get
out of everybody else's face,

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.110
and they're not going
to get out of your face.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.990
Instead of leaving here when
this talk is over and came back

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.710
to whatever, I'm going to
be in your face forever.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.660
Next life we'll be
back in a lecture hall.

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.330
You'll be giving the
lecture that time.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.350
I'll be listening.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.710
This will go on endlessly.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.020
It's like "Groundhog Day,"
that brilliant Bodhisattva

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.720
movie of Bill Murray,
who is one of my gurus.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:12.790
And until you get it right,
you keep repeating it.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.680
So you might as well
take a Bodhisattva vow.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.180
Why?

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.790
If you're going to be tangled
up with all beings forever,

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:23.280
then you better optimize
your tangling up with him.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.090
And what's the optimal way to
be tangled up with someone?

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.182
You love them,
and they love you.

00:43:28.182 --> 00:43:29.570
You love them.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.430
You can't force
them to love you,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.900
so you try to be
as loving as you

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.250
can yourself by becoming
a Buddha, love meaning

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.400
wanting them to be happy.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.990
And then when they really get
happy, they will love you.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.110
So then that's the best way.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.650
Buddhahood, they
have these pure lands

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.685
that they describe
where you become Buddha,

00:43:47.685 --> 00:43:49.810
and you help all the other
beings to become Buddha.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.280
And I always think of them
as John Belushi's Food Fight

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.750
Universe.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.390
Why?

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:59.100
When I have a cookie,
I want my cookie.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.200
Well, maybe I'll share it
with you if you want a cookie.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.150
And that's how we are
in the ordinary world.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.470
But in a Buddha land,
well, if I have cookies,

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.842
I want you to have the cookie.

00:44:09.842 --> 00:44:11.550
But then you want me
to have your cookie,

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.630
so we end up throwing all
the cookies at each other.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.670
And it's a much better
way when you are just

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.930
trying to grab cookies for
yourself, as a friend of mine

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.850
used to say, it's everybody's
out before himself.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.950
You have to fight over all these
people who want your cookie,

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.300
but when everybody
loves everybody else,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.326
then you don't worry
about yourself.

00:44:31.326 --> 00:44:32.950
You're willing to
give everything away,

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.860
but you get buried in cookies.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.550
So it's a much better way.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.590
So then take a Bodhisattva vow.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.330
Then I want to make
a world like that,

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.746
where everybody loves everyone,
because these beings won't

00:44:44.746 --> 00:44:45.370
be happy.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.580
I won't make them happy
unless they love each other.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.150
So if that's the goal is
to be that kind of a being,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:56.520
when you save the life of
another being, in a way

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.290
you're identifying
with their life.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.971
They become some tiny
bit one with you.

00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:04.500
They have those
things in cultures

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.916
where if you save
a life, then you

00:45:05.916 --> 00:45:07.810
are responsible for
the person you save.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.500
The person they want to serve
you and help you, et cetera.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.820
They have like these codes
of warrior, things like that,

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.930
and those are sort of
superficial forms of that.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.660
But the basic idea is the
same, whereas when you kill,

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.372
you're saying, we're not in the
same universe of that being.

00:45:23.372 --> 00:45:25.330
Of course, in the Buddhist
view, when you kill,

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:26.710
you haven't
destroyed that being.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.126
You've just taken
away their body,

00:45:28.126 --> 00:45:31.260
but you have said that
their interest is not mine.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.840
I don't identify with them.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.030
So you're making
yourself narrower

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.689
as a being, whereas
when you save a life,

00:45:37.689 --> 00:45:39.730
you're expanding as a
being, because the life you

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:41.690
saved you are connected to.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.640
It's a piece that you have
a relationship with that.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.830
Similarly, when you take others'
property, which is literally

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.020
steal, means take what
is not given to you,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.010
then you're disregarding
other beings'

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.690
sense of owning something.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.090
And you're their feeling
that they own that.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.630
It's nothing, and
therefore, it's

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:01.754
like a kind of killing
them in your mind,

00:46:01.754 --> 00:46:03.170
whereas when you
give them a gift,

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:07.150
and, oh, I'm expanding my
pleasure of this object

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.950
by them enjoying it.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.690
And so you're, again,
incorporating them.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.020
And finally, sexuality
is really important,

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.510
because that's
when the human form

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:20.790
biologically does sort of
melt into the other, ideally.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.990
I mean not always, obviously,
but ideally, it's supposed to.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.800
And it's a time when
the boundary normally

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.250
dissolves even without any
question of enlightenment,

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.080
and beings kind
of merge together.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.150
So it's a very sacred
thing, actually.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.890
So when even that time
when the human sort of

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.870
drops their identity
and allows themself

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:43.640
to melt, if they keep the
control thing where they're

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.740
doing it in some harmful and
abusive way to the object

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.100
in treating another
being as an object,

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.590
then that which is the deep
visceral lesson of expanding

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.050
their sense of identification
through love is being abused,

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:01.450
it becomes another way of
narrowing your existence

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:05.410
rather than expanding it,
whereas loving sexuality is

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.280
a way of acknowledging
and experiencing

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.590
a merger with another
being and is, therefore,

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.600
a very expanding of when
one becomes a larger

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.030
being by doing that.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.415
And similarly, when you lie,
you create a false universe

00:47:18.415 --> 00:47:19.290
for the other person.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.080
You don't include
them in your universe.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.120
When you speak to slander
people to cause them to dislike

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.950
each other, then you are
harming both of them,

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.420
whereas when you reconcile
them and make them peaceful,

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.230
then you're enjoying their being
harmonious with each other.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.770
When you use speech
violently and harshly

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.680
just to injure someone's
feelings, emotions,

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.740
whatever, then similarly,
it's like you're verbally

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.980
killing them, or
speaking sweetly,

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.830
you're inviting them
and embracing them.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.350
And finally, this is
a neat one I like.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.950
It's a little bit the equivalent
in the 10 commandments

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:56.550
of blasphemy, but it's
more specific in the sense

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.860
that speech is what gives
us a collective mind.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.540
When you speak and
someone listens,

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.004
you share minds all
imperfectly, since everyone

00:48:05.004 --> 00:48:06.670
has a little different
meaning of words,

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.253
and they don't
necessarily understand,

00:48:08.253 --> 00:48:10.856
and even the people who
speak don't necessarily

00:48:10.856 --> 00:48:12.230
know exactly what
they're saying.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:16.230
But if they're trying to speak
in a meaningful way, where

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.780
the other person has some
benefit for opening their mind

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.360
and listening, then they're
being helpful to that person,

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.820
ideally, meaningful, and
meaningful especially

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.140
tends to mean
something liberating,

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.290
something that expands their
understanding so that they then

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.510
can become bigger people and
understand their world better,

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.330
whereas meaningless
is the kind of people

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.120
who'd blab away not knowing
what they're talking about.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.010
And they're wasting
your mental space

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.510
by blabbing at you a bunch
of meaningless drivel,

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.310
and there are a few
people who do that

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:47.380
on the media and everywhere.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.290
So speech is the same way.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:55.530
Then this is really the
mental, and these three

00:48:55.530 --> 00:49:00.100
are the like the three poisons--
greed, hatred, and delusion.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.310
They're very similar to that.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.370
Your unrealistic world view,
you get back to that here

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.790
in the tenfold thing, and
then this is the anger poison,

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.600
and this is the lust and desire
and greed poison attachment

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.700
and so forth.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.800
And the opposites are generosity
and lovingness and realism.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.850
But what is powerful about it
is that those mental states are

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:26.940
considered more powerful
even than the physical ones,

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.010
because action only becomes
evolutionary in the sense of it

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.620
has an impact on you when
it relates to the motivation

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.990
that you do the action out of.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.980
So motivation is really
critically important,

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.260
and this is then why in those
countries, in countries where

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.260
Buddhism has had a long
sway, thousands of years

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.010
of experience, centuries of
delivering educational service,

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.600
whether or not someone is
Buddhist in those countries,

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.640
there is a greater
tendency for people

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:05.010
to search inside themselves,
because they realize

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.820
that your life is
good or bad depending

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:13.050
on how you react to
your situations, more

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:15.240
than the situations.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.540
We all know when we've been
very happy in a very good mood

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.550
in a difficult circumstance.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.670
We all know when we've been in
supposedly great circumstance,

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.840
and yet for some reason, we're
having a tantrum or a fight,

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.750
or we're very mentally unhappy,
and we're not enjoying it.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.050
And we've all had that
kind of experience,

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.600
because the mind is
the predominant one.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.650
That's why in Indian science,
unlike Greek science,

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.320
and unlike your early Chinese
science, in Indian science,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.810
the psychology and
philosophy science

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.770
field was considered the king
and queen of the sciences.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.749
Not physics and not
biology or anything,

00:50:51.749 --> 00:50:54.290
but they were not unimportant,
and they had their own physics

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:55.110
and things.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.820
But it was the
mind sciences that

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.310
were considered most
important by far,

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.570
because that's really what
controls the quality of life.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:03.910
And I always laugh.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.400
There's a great verse
in Shantideva's book,

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.190
and he says-- but he's talking,
of course, about patience.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.870
It's in his chapter on
patience or tolerance,

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.310
developing patience as
the antidote to anger.

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:18.330
And he says, you have two
choices when you don't want

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:22.536
to walk-- if you have to walk
barefoot, if you're barefoot,

00:51:22.536 --> 00:51:23.910
and you don't want
to walk around

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:28.270
on sharp stones and twigs
and thorns and things

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:32.080
as you walk around the
earth, you have two choices.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.482
Cover the Earth with leather,
or make yourself a parachute.

00:51:37.482 --> 00:51:39.690
Because I love that, because
to cover it with leather

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.380
is like Western culture.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.210
It's like a big
softball or something.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.980
The planet has turned
into a softball.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.580
Then everyone can walk around
barefoot, and they're happy,

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.090
but actually, at
the end of life,

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.370
I have no food or
nothing, whereas you

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.360
have a pair of sandals,
and then there,

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.450
you can allow your
crops to grow, whatever.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:00.630
Things can be-- it's much
more practical, actually.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:05.430
And this relates
to my hope, which

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.730
I have failed to achieve
in my teaching career,

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:13.660
but I'm hoping someday that the
colonial era will be reviewed,

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:18.510
and the West that conquered
the world will be seen

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.240
as inferior for having done so.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.170
And Asia and the
indigenous people

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:25.960
who didn't go out
and conquer the world

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.930
will be seen as superior
for not having done so,

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:33.240
just as if you have a bunch
of gentle people on your block

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.810
who have lovely parties, who
play Monopoly and Scrabble

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.260
and whatever, and
you google lots

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.200
of interesting
things and nice time,

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.050
and then some mafioso
bully comes on the block

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.980
and demands-- starts a
protection racket on your block

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.530
and beats a few
of you up, you're

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.310
going to be afraid
of that person,

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:53.947
and they might extract
some wealth from you,

00:52:53.947 --> 00:52:56.280
but you're not going to think
that's the superior person

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.440
on your block.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.940
You're really not
going to think so,

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.940
but now our history
is still taught

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.410
like empire, sun never set.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:04.860
It was all so great.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.250
And we're in a way still
stuck in that attitude,

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:09.780
and that's really too bad,
because that is a mistake,

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.430
whereas the Asian
people, we wrongly

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:15.180
don't know where-- we want to
reinvent the wheel of the mind

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.700
sciences, for example,
instead of realizing

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:22.450
that the search inside
yourself was well developed.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.854
So I'll say it again.

00:53:23.854 --> 00:53:24.770
It's [INAUDIBLE] path.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.950
Finally, I'm going
to stop now, almost.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:29.790
Then there's realistic
creativity or creative effort

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:32.177
after these three ethical
things, and this tenfold path

00:53:32.177 --> 00:53:33.760
of skillful and
unskillful-- oh, yeah.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.635
And why is it called
skillful and unskillful?

00:53:35.635 --> 00:53:39.630
Quickly, because you know when
you lift weights or you train

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.850
or you memorize something,
your memory improves.

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.020
Your muscles improve.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.650
When you walk or your bike,
you feel more healthy.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.460
Someone doesn't
come and award you

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.750
with improved muscles or
better memory or something

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.130
because you did something.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.600
The doing of it shapes
and changes you,

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.240
so similarly, an evolutionary
action or karmic action,

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.020
if you kill, if you live by the
sword, you die by the sword.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.230
If you become a killer,
you end up living in armor.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.010
You carry around coats of armor.

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:09.670
You become more invulnerable.

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:13.400
You become more walled off and
paranoid about other people.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.460
So the act itself changes you.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.680
It evolves you or devolves
you, one or the other.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.470
And all of these
acts are like that.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:23.290
Therefore, this
is very key if you

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:25.680
know anything about
modern ethical philosophy.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.560
Because of scientific
materialism

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.420
crushing philosophy as a key
and live and important pursuit

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.970
of human beings, replacing
it with measuring things

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:39.060
in materialistic
science-- because of that,

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:43.300
people think that ethics
is an arbitrary choice.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.850
People are ethical because
they don't want to be caught.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.840
They don't want
to be imprisoned.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.070
There's no sort of intrinsic
value of being ethical.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.520
There's no reason for it.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.920
Previously, in
theistic cultures,

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.240
God told you so, so
he would punish you

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.090
if you didn't, so that gave
it a reason to be ethical.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:05.910
Without bringing God back,
this path from ancient India,

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.500
ancient time, which
spread all over Asia,

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.600
and this path-- the reason
you want to be ethical

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.380
and you have an element of
enlightened self interest

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.100
is that these ethical
acts shape your being

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.180
in a way that is better
for you, if you follow me.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.900
Not only are they nice to the
person whose life you save

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.770
or who don't abuse sexually or
who you give things to rather

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:28.690
than taking things
from them, but you

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:30.830
yourself become a bigger being.

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:32.530
You become an improved being.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.310
You have a higher
quality of life.

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.570
You become happier.

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:38.060
And therefore, there's
a biological reason

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.070
to be ethical, which in a way,
is what His Holiness is doing

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.220
in terms of
materialistic science

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.830
without challenging that
irrational thinking of theirs

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.000
about how they're not going
to have a future life,

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.130
because he thinks that's
too much for many of them.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.020
And it probably is.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.110
And he's also not an American.

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.640
He's not a stupid
American like me.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.520
So he's being polite.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.010
But I'm after those
kind of scientists

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:06.770
who run around, because I
consider that if you think what

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.700
you do will have no consequence
to yourself ultimately,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.800
however bad it
gets, you just die

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.240
and you have permanent
anesthesia, permanent sodium

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.300
Pentothal, permanent sleep.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.300
So therefore, in a way,
it doesn't ultimately

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.244
matter whether you're
good or not good.

00:56:23.244 --> 00:56:24.160
It doesn't ultimately.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.500
Then an elite, a
planetary elite that

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.320
has the levers of power
and authority and it's

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.300
all of the societies on the
globe that believes that, acts

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.810
like that-- apres moi,
le deluge, King Louis XVI

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:40.670
said before his head was cut
off, but he didn't know it

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.950
was going to be cut off.

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:45.697
Then you're going to behave
recklessly and destructively,

00:56:45.697 --> 00:56:47.530
and you're not going
to shift the planet out

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.580
of global warming, and you're
not going to prevent wars.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:54.700
And you're going to run around
dropping bombs and doing

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.880
things, because you think worst
case, I'll just stop existing,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.340
whereas if worst case, you never
know quite how bad it can get.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.520
It can always get worse.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.550
You will become mindful
that any little thing that

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:13.890
could be a little better
is of total importance.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.290
And that's what mindfulness is.

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:18.100
Final thing,
Samadhiraja Sutra-- who

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.180
understands cause and effect,
that person will understand

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.230
emptiness and relativity,
who understands

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.120
emptiness and
relativity, will be

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.060
mindful of the
most minute details

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.200
of the relativity around them.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.300
And they will be
extremely careful to make

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.790
things better and not worse.

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.204
Thank you very much.

00:57:36.204 --> 00:57:39.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.400
Thank you.
