00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:02.090
Alright, so we've got our attendee? It's got

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.560
the email field. Let's add a bunch more.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.460
&gt;&gt; All right, what else do we want to track about the attendee?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.370
&gt;&gt; let's track the phone number.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.950
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.090
&gt;&gt; We should figure out how many tickets they bought.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.800
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800
&gt;&gt; like how they bought the tickets. You know, if it was

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.810
online or whatever. I don't know and we'll think of more. Let's.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.540
&gt;&gt; Let's start with that one.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.
