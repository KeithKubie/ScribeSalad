MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
to Talks of Google.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.530
Today with us,
Stephon Alexander.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.480
Following the great
minds that's first

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.430
drew links between music and
physics, "The Jazz of Physics,"

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.020
the book that Stephon
has in sales right now--

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.610
"The Jazz of Physics"
accompanies Stephon Alexander's

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.390
own tale from taking music
lessons as a boy in the Bronx

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.280
to studying theoretical
physics at Imperial College.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.150
Covering the universe
from its birth

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.010
through its fate, its structure
on the smallest and largest

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.350
scales, the book
will inspire anyone

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.940
interested in the mysteries
of our universe, music,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.730
and life itself.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.740
Alexander is a physics
professor at Brown.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.080
He did research here in
the neighborhood at SLAC

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.700
at Stanford.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.430
He's the winner of the 2013
American Physical Society

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.880
Bouchet Award.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.570
He's also a jazz musician
and recently recorded

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.030
his first electronic jazz
album with Erin Rioux.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.150
Upcoming album with Grammy Award
winner Will Calhoun and Melvin

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.510
Gibbs will hit the
stores in a year.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.470
So please join me in welcoming
Stephon Alexander to Google.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.177
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.060
STEPHON ALEXANDER:
Well, I would like

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.100
to say it's a great
pleasure to be here.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.849
It's actually a great
pleasure to be back.

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:28.860
I attended [INAUDIBLE]
twice in the past

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.560
and had given a previous Google
Talk of a different nature

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.140
a couple years ago.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.920
Hopefully, this time
I won't be sweating.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.100
I mean, I meant
that figuratively.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.710
So anyway.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.570
So let's begin with the talk.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.930
So I want to first talk
about why I wrote the book.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.390
I grew up in the
Bronx, New York.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630
My family immigrated
from the Caribbean,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.240
from Trinidad to the Bronx.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.680
And back in those days--
"back in those days"--

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.410
for Afro Caribbeans, a one
way to economic freedom was

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.340
to become a musician
or to play sports.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.500
So it was in a mind
of my grandmother

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.330
for me to become
a concert pianist.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.630
So I start off
with concert piano.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.800
But I was more
interested-- I realized

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.590
I was an inquisitive
kid like many of us

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.510
who grew up to
become scientists.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.280
We're just inquisitive
about the world around you.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910
And for me, I
wanted to understand

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.570
why was it that the music was
sounding interesting rather

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.420
than playing the music.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.765
So it started at that age.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:38.140
I started to realize that I
really didn't-- when I looked

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.340
at musicians around
me at that time,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.880
in the '80s in the
Bronx where rap music,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.400
hip-hop music was
being innovated,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.870
I really didn't relate to the
way they were being personified

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.120
in the media, for example.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.620
So I really didn't
fit in with that.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.520
And this has to do
with identity now.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.520
As I progressed along in high
school, De Witt Clinton High

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.100
School in the Bronx, I
discovered Mr. Kaplan,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.490
who was my physics teacher.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.130
And he was also a jazz musician,
a professional jazz musician.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.390
And he was the one that
exposed me to physics.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.560
And yet when I looked and
I saw what scientists--

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.851
I didn't really relate to that.

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:18.740
So throughout my
life and my career,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.540
it's always been this kind
of dichotomy in a sense.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.660
And my music and my physics
life were very much separate,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.770
deliberately separate
from each other.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.890
I used to play in clubs late
at night and during the daytime

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.210
the usual stuff, go and do
calculations as a post-doc.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.950
And then some things
started to ignite

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.110
more of some sort of healthy
symbiosis between my physics

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.350
and my musical life.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.010
And the book is a part of--
writing the book was part

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.320
of that reconciliation process.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.200
So in a lot of ways,
this book is really also

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.996
a personal thing in the sense
that it's about that journey.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.370
But it's also
about other things.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.330
And that's kind of what I want
to talk about as well today.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.350
So what are some
of the influences

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.370
that really influenced me as
I was growing up in the Bronx?

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.570
Well, there's this guy
Rakim who many people

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.240
deem to be the greatest
MC ever, period.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.237
Now back in those
days, Rakim belonged

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:21.570
to a group of individuals who
called themselves the Five

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.510
Percenters.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.540
And they believed in something
called supreme mathematics.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.000
So you have these
guys in the Bronx

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.720
that were talking
about alien life forms

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.320
and coming up with their own
scientific theories about how

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.750
the world worked.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.900
And Rakim was one of them.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.180
But he dropped an album called
"Eric B. is President"--

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.470
I'm sorry, "My Melody."

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.681
And here's a quote from that.

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:43.680
"That's what I'm saying.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.420
I drop science like a scientist.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.340
My melody's in a code.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.090
The very next episode has
a mic often distortin'

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.280
and ready to explode.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.921
I keep the mic in Fahrenheit
freeze MC's to make them

00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:53.420
colder.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.280
The listeners' system
is kicking like solar."

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.950
So I remember as a 12-
or 13-year-old kid,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.560
where science and the life
of the mind, in a sense,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.400
was not what society was
telling us we should become,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.260
and having the greatest MC
embracing scientific thought.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.410
And that was something
that stuck in my mind.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.290
So I thank Rakim for making
me feel like I belong

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.900
to something in this sense.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.480
So that was one person.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.095
The other person's
Albert Einstein.

00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:27.470
I discovered Albert
Einstein when

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.900
I was eight years old in the
Museum of Natural History.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.910
I got snuck off to the
side from the dinosaurs.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.930
And I saw this
picture of this guy.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.470
And I saw these equations.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.784
And I thought this was
some kind of hidden code.

00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:39.950
And I want to understand it.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.500
And that's stuck to my
mind, Albert Einstein.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.690
And then finally
one of the things

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.840
that also-- again,
we're looking at just

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.480
moments throughout my
life-- John Coltrane.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.830
And one of the main
subjects of my talk today

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.110
will be this diagram.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.340
This is a hand-drawn
diagram given-- gifted--

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.640
from John Coltrane to his
friend and mental partner--

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.950
they sort of theorized a lot
together, Dr. Yusef Lateef.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.750
And he gave this to Yusef
Lateef as a birthday present.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.650
And in 2005, I
actually had the honor

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.360
to speak to Yusef Lateef
about this diagram.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.880
And this is one
of things that got

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.460
me thinking about what this
diagram has to do with physics.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.870
And I'll get back
to tell you what

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.435
that has to do with physics.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.810
But also what the
important thing

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.962
that one of the great heroes
and icons of jazz music,

00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:43.530
and music in general,
John Coltrane,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.610
is analyzing his music
through the lens of something

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.270
that he got from
Albert Einstein.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.380
This is the book.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.930
It's about uniting
science and music-- again,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.560
because I'm not
doing anything new.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.040
Again in the sense that-- I'll
get back to the "again" part--

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.260
but how did this really happen?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.480
When did I really start
saying, OK, you know what?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.210
I'm just going to bring the
physics and the music together.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.931
It happened with
this individual.

00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:17.680
How many people recognize
this individual?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.420
How many people recognize
the people down there?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.320
There's Bono and David Bowie.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.040
And that's Brian Eno.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.280
And as Brian Eno,
as you know, he's

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.710
in the eyes of many
known to be the greatest

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.760
programmer of the DX7
frequency modulated synthesis.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.620
So when I was a postdoc at
Imperial College in London,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.630
it was a very
interesting time for me

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.060
because it was a time where,
as many of us who were postdocs

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.090
know that, you have to
do something interesting.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.880
And I was, at the
time-- it was--

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.550
the name of the game
in the year 2000

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.970
was string theory and
early universe cosmology,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.840
in this case cosmic inflation.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.430
And my main thing there was
to try to bring them together.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.880
So at the time I was
working on this project,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.030
taking a risk in terms of
trying to put these two

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.110
things together, which I
was successful at doing,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.500
by the way.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.540
But at that time I was
kind of stress out.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.510
And I was also considering
that I would actually

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.419
leave graduate-- quit physics
and maybe become a musician.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.299
And I became friends
with Brian Eno.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.600
That's a long story how I became
friends, but it's in the book.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.740
And on my way to work, I
would stop by his studio

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.480
and hang out with him on the
order of four days a week

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.380
over a period of two years.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.260
So we became-- he became
like a mentor of mine.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.770
And one day I came
into his office.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:02.720
And up to the left-hand
corner I saw, basically,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.960
him playing on a
large computer screen

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.470
with these square figures.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.230
And I thought that
he had lost it

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:13.300
because I thought he was playing
with virtual Lego or something

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.510
like that.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.940
I kept coming in day after day.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.172
And he started playing more
and more of this stuff.

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:19.630
And some point, he
stopped and told

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:26.240
me the idea at the time
of cellular automata

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.500
and the basic notion that
you have these simple rules

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.690
of your neighbors,
in this case, and you

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.460
can generate very
complex patterns

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.000
from very simple rules.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.740
And that fit very nicely
with Brian's past work

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.410
in generative music and
one of his philosophies

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.140
towards composition
that you can read about

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.940
if you get various
books on Brian Eno

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.520
or look him up on YouTube.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.080
And you're looking down
here at one of the pictures

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.400
that he can generate using
cellular automata out

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.080
of the millions of
pictures that can

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.520
occur from cellular automata.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.747
And at that time, I
said, wait a minute.

00:10:10.747 --> 00:10:11.580
This is interesting.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.950
It finally congealed that
Brian is actually freely

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.470
importing ideas in a very
creative way from science

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.770
into his art and into his music
and doing a successful job,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.877
but more importantly, not
really caring too much

00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:29.960
about what others thought.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.543
And I realized at
the time that really

00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:34.480
what I was battling against
was that caring about what

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.890
other people thought and
also the fear of risk,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.870
risk-taking in this case.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.810
So I just decided
that I was going

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.100
to just-- if I was going
to go out of physics,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.720
I was just going
to go out my way.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.440
So then I started
really bringing together

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.890
my physics and my music world,
in particular, my jazz world,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.040
together.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.390
And so some of the ways
I would do that was I

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.880
would go to jazz clubs and
bring my physics papers with me

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.420
and do my calculations there.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.100
And then interesting
things started happening.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.880
In between playing sets, I would
come back and do a calculation.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.090
But the most
interesting part was

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.720
talking to the jazz musicians.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.760
I discovered that jazz
cats are basically

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.570
uber nerds themselves.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.900
And that you start talking
about physics and the stuff

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.190
you're working on, they
find it very interesting

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.300
and they're like a
good sound board.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.130
And they have their own ideas.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.380
And that level of interaction,
even though they didn't really

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.130
know the physics I
was working on per se,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.700
they always had something
interesting to tell me.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.580
And that process of
opening up the conversation

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.390
and making my research world
inclusive to them really

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.940
helped me think differently
about my research.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.440
Vice versa, I started to realize
that when I was hanging out

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.376
with-- doing research in my
physics colleagues, especially

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:12.750
people like Chris Isham-- I
don't know if you know Chris,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.660
he's a very well-known
mathematical physicist--

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.050
that the way that we
were doing our research

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.850
was very similar to what
jazz musicians were doing.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.610
It was that we were
just improvising

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.010
with equations and concepts.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.880
We were taking
known things that we

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:36.160
had mastered-- differential
geometry, in Chris's case,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.430
Topos theory.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.140
And we were trying to create
something new with that known

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.700
stuff, just like jazz musicians
were using scales, melody,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.390
harmony, rhythm all these things
and in real time spontaneously

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.650
creating something new.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.490
So those two worlds
started to merge.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.380
And now let me get a
little bit more concrete.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.100
And now we're going to really
talk about some physics

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.890
and some music here.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.140
And for the rest
of this talk, we'll

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.780
use-- you all know this already,
but since the world is looking,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.150
I should say a few words here.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.830
If I take a vibrating string.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.800
And we're looking
up here at a string.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.655
What can I point-- can I point
from something like this?

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.430
So if I look at the top
here, we see that that's

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.070
what we call the fundamental.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.480
The string, basically, is
held up at two end points.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.030
And it's oscillating
back and forth.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.820
And that is what we call
the lowest frequency.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.860
The second, if we divide
the string in half,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.950
we find that the
string basically

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.460
has half the wavelength
of the fundamental.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:58.260
We can divide the fundamental
into a third, its length,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.770
and so on and so forth.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.934
And so if I were to play
those things started in C,

00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:05.350
the question is,
what would I get?

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.590
If I started with
the fundamental,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:16.570
if I play C,
[MUSIC NOTE] if I go up,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.340
if I double the frequency
or half the wavelength,

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.780
I get a high C, an octave.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.100
[MUSIC NOTE] Any guess what I'll
get if I divide it by a third?

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.040
[MUSIC NOTES] I would get
the G, the perfect fifth.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.140
If I did it by a quarter, I'll
get the F, a perfect fourth.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.590
[MUSIC NOTES]

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.800
And, of course, the
perfect fifth and what

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.410
we call the fundamental,
the five to the one,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.140
is a very powerful
chord progression.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.450
So that's used a lot in many
Western classical jazz music.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.260
And we'll get back to that.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.920
And so we see a
direct connection

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.380
between the harmonics,
the so-called notion

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.860
that the idea that
the vibration of waves

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.840
could come together,
basically, to make sounds--

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.280
and not just pure tones, but
even more complicated tones.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.400
So what does this have
to do with anything?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.080
The premise of my
book is the following

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.090
in terms of the
physics and where

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.930
the physics meets the music.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.130
I assert in my book
that after working

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.170
as a theoretical
physicist, looking

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.410
at things like quantum field
theory, string theory, even

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.590
loop quantum gravity, even
theories of that form,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.530
that one of the
central core ideas,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.310
regardless of what scale or
what domain of physical reality

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.240
we look at, the name of the
game is about vibration.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.070
The name of the game is about
patterns of vibration, physics

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.862
of waves, if you like it.

00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:01.070
I mean, I can't tell you
how many papers I've written

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.250
or my colleagues
have written over

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.270
last year at the end
of the day we're doing

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.300
some kind of Fourier transform.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:12.440
So that's the central
idea from which now we

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.110
can start looking at
all these different ways

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:21.890
that jazz music, in
particular, quantum mechanics,

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.400
and cosmology are connected.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.780
Again, I'm not, in this book,
saying that the universe is

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.490
a jazz improvisation.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.520
It's a new way of talking
about physics, the same way

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.310
anyone that writes a popular
science book uses analogies,

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.310
uses metaphor to
talk about that.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.500
Otherwise you just have
a full of equations.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.730
I'm just using my knowledge
as a practicing musician

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.410
as a new way, a new lens to
draw parallels between music,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:56.310
and hopefully ends up being a
fun and an enlightening read.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.310
So let's talk about
one more idea which

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:05.800
is the Fourier idea, one of the
most important concepts in all

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.230
of physics and engineering.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.829
And the basic idea is
that, at the end the day,

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.500
if we look at this very
complicated-looking wave,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.359
the idea of the Fourier
wave uses the fact

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.180
that if I drop two
rocks in a pond,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.818
I'll have two simple
waves emanating outwards.

00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:26.859
And these waves at some
point will hit each other

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.310
and create another
wave pattern due

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.910
to either constructive or
destructive interference

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.330
of those waves.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.040
So the fact that waves can add
up or subtract-- simple waves--

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.740
to give a more complicated
wave, the Fourier idea

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.850
is nothing but that idea.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.040
So the idea here is
that I can add up

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.920
simple harmonic periodic
waves that we just

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.490
spoke about that
I can understand

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.440
purely in terms of integers.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.940
The minute I specify
an integer, I

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.160
know something about the wave.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.170
So I can think of waves, these
harmonic waves, as an alphabet.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.840
Just like I have A, B, C, D,
I can think of these building

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.620
blocks as an
alphabet from which I

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.900
can combine to form complicated
sounds or complicated wave

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.090
patterns.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.450
So in this case, this
complicated wave pattern

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.900
is sum of three of these,
three harmonic waves.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.250
And it uses, basically, the idea
that waves that are in phase

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.190
can actually add up to
create bigger waves.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:37.320
And winds that are out
of phase, you can cancel.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.140
That's the basic physics.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.210
And we use this to talk
about particle annihilation,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.045
for example.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:45.420
For the physicists [? in ?]
[? the ?] [? audience, ?] you

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.480
do a Fourier decomposition
of a mode expansion

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.350
of the creation-annihilation
operator.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.100
It's basically
using the same idea,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.020
electron-positron annihilation.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.570
So this idea so powerful
that I can use it at

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.785
will throughout the book.

00:19:00.785 --> 00:19:02.410
And it brings a lot
of things together.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.560
So I said this book is about
connecting music and physics

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.750
again because I wish
someone would have told me

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.989
when I was a student who
was conflicted about being

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.530
a musician or being a physicist
or being a nobody-- whatever,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.555
you know-- I wish that someone
would have told me that

00:19:21.555 --> 00:19:26.350
at the very birth of what we
call a Western science, music

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.220
and astronomy and
mathematics and what became

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.540
physics were all unified.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.020
And it begins actually
with Pythagoras,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.450
who was the one that came up
with the Pythagorean scale

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.530
by basically looking at this
thing called a mono chord, one

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.770
string instrument
and actually moving

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.730
a bridge in these
integer relations

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.920
of the length of the string
and generating the scale.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.510
And Pythagoras really
believed in this idea

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.820
of this harmony of the spheres.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.090
And it was later on his students
like Plato and Aristotle

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.760
that sought to
geometrize this idea.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.640
So when Kepler, our very
first astrophysicist,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.000
came on the scene after 2,000
years of people being stuck--

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.740
the Ptolemaic models and
all these epicycles--

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.260
it was Kepler that really
at the end of the day

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.580
a physical cause for why
the planets were moving.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.540
And he was stuck, as we recall.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.810
He was stuck because of Mars.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.100
Mars' orbit was so elliptical.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.640
And he couldn't fit
in his Platonic model.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.250
So he returned back to
the Pythagorean thinking,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.610
after realizing that
Plato was a Pythagorean.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.210
So then he started
assigning-- this

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.940
is own handwriting--
he started to assign

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.400
to the velocity-- here we're
looking at the sun and a planet

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.460
going around in an elliptic
orbit around the sun.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:01.090
And what he did was to measure--
assigned a velocity closest

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:06.860
to the sun and furthest away
from the son of that planet.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.690
And by assigning that
velocity to a note, the ratios

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.805
of those velocities, he was able
to come up with these scales.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:22.845
And it's kind of interesting
that John Coltrane had an album

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.680
called "Interstellar Space."

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.790
And he has a song called "Mars."

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.700
If you actually study the
transcription of "Mars,"

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:36.230
you find that it has inklings
of this particular scale in it.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.730
It's just a-- again,
it's a conjecture.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.962
There's no proof in there.

00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:42.920
But it's kind of interesting
that John Coltrane

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.690
wrote this album called
"Interstellar Space."

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.280
So then from that, he
was able to come up

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.930
with his three laws of
planetary motion, the first set

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.600
of equations, really,
that we started to assign

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.030
to astrophysical phenomenon.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.930
This, of course,
then led Newton.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.860
Newton was after
the one equation

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.574
that would replace this.

00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:06.240
And that was kind of interesting
that musical thought was always

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.430
with us and, at some
point, bifurcated

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.970
into two separate
things that would then

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.410
encourage young
people like me to be

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.800
confused about where they fit.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.120
So the lesson here is
for all the other people

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:28.460
out there watching this,
the music and the science

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.700
were never really
separate from day one.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:40.450
So we should feel free to
play with both of them.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:46.180
So another thing that
I do in the book book,

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.620
I also use music as an analogy
to understand a quantum world.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.870
So I came up with a couple
of really neat analogies

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.330
that supposed to
sort of like evoke

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.340
a sense of even more wonder
in quantum mechanics,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.700
but also to maybe clarify
some conceptual difficulties

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.360
that even I had as a researcher,
feeling so comfortable writing

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.080
the equations now of a
Feynman path integral

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.680
without really stepping
back to think of, OK,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.750
what's going on
intuitively here?

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.840
So this analogy with jazz
improvisation kind of helped.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.830
And I have to get some credit
to the great jazz saxophonist

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.480
Donald Harrison for
simultaneously come up

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.890
with this idea.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.897
So the basic idea
is the following.

00:23:29.897 --> 00:23:31.730
We look at something
like an electron, which

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.870
is a quantum particle.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.670
Feynman taught us that
the electron does not

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.920
do what a macroscopic
object do, which

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.780
is that it traverses a very
deterministic and unique path

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.030
from the initial point
to the final point.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.790
Instead it does something else.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.410
And what it does
is really weird.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.570
What it does,
according to Feynman,

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.270
is that it considers all
potential paths, this one

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.240
electron, from
point A to point B.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.370
Now we would laugh at this and
say, well, this is ridiculous.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.220
There's no way
this could happen.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.550
But then there are very
precise experiments

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.380
that test the difference between
a particle going here and here.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.430
One experiment's called
[INAUDIBLE] effect.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.710
And when we study particle
interactions at the LHC,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.337
there are many different paths
that particles could take.

00:24:28.337 --> 00:24:30.670
And these things are measured
at a large Hadron collider

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.640
as well.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.690
But there's another place
where, if this didn't happen,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.710
there'd be no point for
Google to be interested.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:42.970
It's called quantum computation,
the sum of the many paths.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.210
It's just a formulation
of how qubits evolved.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.500
I mean, that's just another
aspect, except in that case,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.820
you're also looking at
entangled states as well.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.330
But this whole idea
of superposition

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.990
in quantum mechanics
is really what's

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.510
given this weird notion
that the particles traverse

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.380
in all possible paths
between the beginning

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.660
point and the endpoint.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:12.231
So that just is so
non-intuitive to me.

00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:15.590
For all the years I've worked
on quantum mechanics and field

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.870
theory and stuff, I
just still don't get it.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.780
So I have to get some kind
of other toehold on this.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.190
And it came from Sonny
Rollins and Charlie Parker.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.900
So what we're looking
at here is a line

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.300
that Sonny Rollins-- transcribed
lines that Sonny Rollins soloed

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.840
in improvisation.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.630
And what we see here is that
there's a beginning note, which

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:42.246
is a D. And it ends
on a G. And as I said,

00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:43.245
they're perfect fourths.

00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:45.670
They're harmonically
related to each other.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.930
So this idea in
jazz improvisation.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.340
There are different strategies
that improvisers could employ.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.210
And one strategy is
the idea of targeting.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.160
So the idea of targeting is that
you know what beginning note

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.600
you're going to begin with.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.190
And you have a sense
of the end note.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.180
And what happens in between
are many possible paths

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.040
that could be taken.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.590
Now this is happening
in real time.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.230
So in real time, what note
Sonny Rollins plays here,

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.640
as opposed to some
other note, is

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.240
that he would consider all
possible notes at every step.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.190
The previous note
does, of course,

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.680
inform what the
next note would be.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.220
And that's also a quantum
mechanical thing, as well.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.280
So the idea here is
that all possible notes

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.160
are being considered to traverse
how you get from the beginning

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.760
point to the end point.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.710
And that captures,
in a sense, what's

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.320
happening with the
quantum particle, which

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.910
is that you're not necessarily
traversing literally all paths,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.540
but all paths are
potential considerations

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.300
that is informed by
the previous notes,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.540
but also informed
by the end point.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.280
So I [INAUDIBLE] found to be
a very interesting analogy.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.150
The book gets into it
in far more detail.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.020
So I only have a half an
hour to talk about this.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.760
And I have more
things to talk about.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.450
The other thing I talk about,
the main thrust of my book,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.330
though, it's a book
at the end of the day

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.350
about modern cosmology.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.740
And it's a book about
structure formation.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.540
One of the biggest
questions that we

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.890
ask as cosmologists is, how
did the large-scale structure

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.790
in the universe emerge?

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.940
And could the laws of
physics known to us,

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.920
or every bit of physics that we
know, from microscopic physics

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.770
to the gravitational
physics that we think we

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.550
know, could it account
for what we see?

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.800
So what we're looking at
here is a computer simulation

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.850
that matches large-scale
structured data of networks

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.660
of galaxies.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.730
What we see here is five--
if you look at-- focus

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.800
in on this little box here--
500 million light years.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.170
And as we continue to focus in,
we see clusters of galaxies.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:16.310
And the question is, how
did 14 billion years ago,

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.510
before this network of
cosmic structure form,

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.750
how did a featureless universe
filled with radiation energy

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.760
develop into this?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:31.200
And in my book, I go through
that this has to do with sound,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.530
that this is now a picture of
the 14 billion years, the CMB

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:40.980
data of the tiny fluctuations
in the radiation of this plasma

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.180
in the early universe that
acted as primordial seeds that

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.320
grew into stars and galaxies,
that grew into the structure.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.110
So the idea here
is to sort of take

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.920
the Pythagorean idea
of music of the spheres

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.499
and bring it into
this modern context.

00:28:58.499 --> 00:29:01.040
Except the question is that the
music that we're going to get

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.660
is not necessarily
only harmonic.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.415
It might look something
a little bit more

00:29:06.415 --> 00:29:09.730
like jazz as an analogy.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:14.080
And so, yes, we do know
that the correct physics

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.740
to understand that data
is a physics of solid.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:24.060
So what we're looking
at here is hot regions

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.560
in this plasma and cold regions.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.500
And you can think of this
plasma as a density, nothing

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.030
more than a density wave,
which is what a sound wave is.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.600
And this sound wave actually
has a harmonic motion.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.160
And those regions where we
have resonance, where we have,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.530
basically, the most
energy in the wave,

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.380
are the ones that
develop eventually

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.040
whose energies energy collapse
gravitationally to form

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.154
the first stars.

00:29:52.154 --> 00:29:53.570
So it's really a
sound phenomenon.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.080
The universe did begin-- the
structure that we belong to,

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.340
this complicated network
of structure, literally

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.190
began with sound.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.920
So then I started to
push this analogy further

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:13.015
in the book to think about
what is music if you really

00:30:13.015 --> 00:30:14.560
think about what music is.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.810
Well, there are many
different definitions.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.850
And everyone has a
different-- every culture has

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.630
a different way of
thinking about music,

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.262
how music functions to them.

00:30:21.262 --> 00:30:22.720
But one you could
think about music

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.820
is that people say
it's structured sound.

00:30:27.936 --> 00:30:29.310
Well, if the
universe started off

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:35.230
as some sort of sound pattern
and developed into structure,

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.220
then I can then use this
analogy that, well, it's

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.810
a particular structure
of a sound phenomenon.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.070
And it's kind of
interesting that people

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.810
like Bach and Ligeti,
composers like that,

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.190
played with fractal music.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.890
They have self-similar
structures actually

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.370
in the music as it
unfolds in time.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:59.085
And the distribution of galaxies
does have a self-similar type

00:30:59.085 --> 00:30:59.585
of feel.

00:30:59.585 --> 00:31:00.880
It's not really a fractal.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.397
People did debate
that for a while.

00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:06.605
But it does have a structure.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.950
So in the book, I play
with that a little bit.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:17.710
So we have a way
of making analogs

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:21.040
between quantum mechanics
and jazz improvisation.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.630
We now talk about the
structured universe.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.330
And, of course, we know that
our early universe is actually,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.830
what?

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:32.240
Our early universe
is a quantum place.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.330
One of the big questions
right now right up

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:40.600
the street, your friends
up the street at Stanford,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.440
spend a lot of time
and energy thinking

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.930
into the quantum early universe
and how that universe basically

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.405
became classical.

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:50.030
And we believe it has something
to do with the phenomena called

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.530
cosmic inflation.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.950
So now I can bring
together the quantum part

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.490
of the jazz of physics with
this classical part, which

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.680
is the structure formation.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.910
And the question is
these initial sound

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.250
waves have to come
from something quantum.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.795
And so I discuss
that in the book.

00:32:08.795 --> 00:32:10.670
But I think the most
exciting part of my book

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.860
is not necessarily about
drawing analogies and talking

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.820
about known physics,
but I also use the book

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.340
as a device to say, can we
actually learn new things?

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:27.370
Can I actually use this analogy
to actually do new physics?

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.350
And so while writing the
book, as you will see,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:35.200
I developed a new theory by
drawing this analogy further

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.180
and was able to publish a very
nice paper recently in "Physics

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.880
Letters B" based on this idea
with my colleague Marcelo

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.980
Gleiser and my grad
student Sam Cormack.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.280
And this idea goes as following.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.350
And then I'm done, too.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.260
So let's go back
to this diagram.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.530
This diagram, basically,
what it reveals is cycles.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.440
Basically you see that
these clusters of notes--

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.330
I don't have time
to go into it--

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.000
but you see that what we
have is a 60-fold cycle.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.780
The system, these notes, repeat
themselves every 60 times,

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.226
just like a clock repeats
itself every 12 times.

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:14.600
And Coltrane is
basically looking

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.920
at intervalic relationships
between very interesting scales

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.510
and how they fit
into this geometry.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.820
Coltrane was a very big fan.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.960
His biggest idol
was Albert Einstein.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.260
And he got Einstein's
idea of invariance,

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.190
the idea of using
symmetry to understand

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:34.010
what remains invariant
if I change perspective.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.460
In this case, the speed of
light remains invariant.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.800
And to have that, you need a
four-dimensional space-time

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.100
structure that
related, basically,

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.090
length contraction
and time dilation

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.710
under these transformations.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.080
Coltrane tried to do the
same thing in this diagram.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.830
I don't have the
time to get into it,

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.455
but if you read the book,
I developed that fully.

00:33:55.455 --> 00:33:56.830
But the important
thing there was

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.790
the idea of using these harmonic
cycles that Coltrane employed.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.590
So, for example,
in "Giant Steps,"

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.310
you'll see he'll
have cycles that

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.360
go like-- [PLAYING SAXOPHONE]
and so on and so forth.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.980
So the idea here is to try to
take this analogy of how a jazz

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.100
improviser might improvise.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.190
So one thing that could
happen-- that happens

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.909
is that you have the
structure of the music.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.090
Let's consider the 12-bar blues.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.590
You have four beats
per bar, 12 bars.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:35.230
And that harmonic structure
repeats itself in a cycle.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.960
The rhythmic structure
also repeats itself.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.150
And the improviser gets a
solo-- gets a chance every time

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.440
around this cycle to try
A different improvisation.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.070
So one of the questions that
we were trying to understand

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.300
is the so-called how to
deal with the fine-tuning

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300
of the coupling
constants in nature.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:57.060
And one idea to resolve
this issue-- life depends.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.700
We can't have carbon-based
life if carbon

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.640
weren't formed from stars.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.800
And you can't have that if
the tuning of the forces

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.440
were within a few
percentage of each other,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.840
if those ratios of those forces.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.690
So what determines those forces,
the strength of those forces,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.230
we don't know the
answer to that.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.200
And one idea is that
there's a multiverse.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.200
And many of you have
probably heard these talks.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.230
What we came up with was
a different idea here,

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.730
using this idea of
jazz improvisation.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:34.210
And the idea, again,
is that you have now--

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.400
and actually this
is the basic cycle.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.710
It has to do with the sound
called a pentatonic scale--

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.960
if there's time.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.800
And the basic idea
now is the following,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.280
that instead of having a
multiverse-- like here,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.230
different island universes that
are causally out of contact

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.490
with each other, you have
a universe that undergoes--

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:58.240
that is cyclic in a sense
that it expands, contracts

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.350
into a big bang, expands and
contracts, and just does that

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.680
indefinitely.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.760
It does that indefinitely.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.220
But every time it actually runs
into this so-called big bang,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.330
the coupling constants of
nature of all the forces

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.200
undergo a quasi random walk.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.420
It improvises.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.210
And as you expand
out, it gets fixed.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.940
And we just happened
to live in the epoch

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.690
where the coupling constants
evolve like a genetic code,

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.060
like a genetic
mutation, to actually

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.840
have the value that we have.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.440
So what's really
cool about this?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.060
We use this analogy from
music just like Kepler did.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.740
But when we did the
equations, it worked bang on.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.820
So I invite you to
read that paper.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.820
You'll see it has-- of
course, there's the idea.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.400
But the thing that
was remarkable

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.940
was when we actually looked at
the low-energy effective action

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.730
of the heterotic
string, the equation

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.530
just presented itself
so beautifully.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:08.070
So again it just shows
that really embracing

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.110
this idea of musical
thought could

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:16.774
be very useful in research, in
my case in theoretical physics.

00:37:16.774 --> 00:37:18.190
If you guys have
a second, I would

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.360
like to maybe play
something for you.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.490
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:27.360
STEPHON ALEXANDER: So as I
said, Coltrane's-- I want to do

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.450
a quick sort of physics
thing for you, which is,

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.680
as I told you, that in the
harmonics of the waves,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.550
the most constant relationship,
aside from the octave,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.950
is a perfect fifth.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.410
And that happens purely from
the energetics of the wave.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.740
So it's purely physical.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.350
Any vibration I make
it, any vibration

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.290
will contain this
perfect fifth in it--

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.090
with a different amplitude, of
course, but it's still there.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:57.890
So for example, if played
a D-- [MUSICAL NOTE]

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:03.300
and I don't move my
fingers-- [MUSICAL NOTE]

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.500
I get the A. That A is here.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.160
[MUSICAL NOTE] So the perfect
fifth is contained in this D.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.690
So you say, OK, so what?

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:15.890
So let me continue paying
sequences of perfect fifths.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:26.870
[MUSICAL NOTES]

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.380
All right.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.890
So I just played a
bunch of perfect fifths.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.560
I'm going to reorganize
those perfect fifths

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.650
in ascending order, from
lowest note to highest note.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:59.590
[MUSICAL NOTES]

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.792
That's a pentatonic scale.

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:03.000
Now one thing that's
interesting is that that scale's

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
been used in most cultures.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.670
It's one scale.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.280
But let me do some more things
are that pentatonic scale.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:25.100
[MUSICAL NOTES]

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.970
That's a blues scale.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.160
So the point here is that one
of the most used scales in all

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.130
of our-- is just
a sophistication,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.770
a tiny sophistication over a
scale that's just generated

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.870
naturally from the
laws of physics,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.830
just from the perfect
fifth relation.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.970
And so it's no mistake
why "A Love Supreme," one

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.590
of Coltrane's greatest
works, is rooted

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.030
in this pentatonic scale.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.100
So when Coltrane told David
Amram, the great composer,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.990
that like Einstein, I am seeking
for something simple that

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.960
brings music together
from natural sources,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.600
it couldn't be nothing
but this pentatonic scale.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.360
All right.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.171
So let me just see if I
can play something fun.

00:40:06.171 --> 00:41:13.274
[PLAYING SAXOPHONE] Thank you.

00:41:13.274 --> 00:41:18.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.980
That was just made
up, by the way.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.130
There's no copyright.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.255
MALE SPEAKER: Since we're
at the cyclical universe,

00:41:23.255 --> 00:41:25.960
what was the expansion?

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.040
The type Ia supernova?

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.350
STEPHON ALEXANDER:
The expansion of what?

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.390
AUDIENCE: The type Ia
supernovae results.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.500
STEPHON ALEXANDER: Oh,
a dark energy, yes, yes.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.289
So I had nothing or
very little to say

00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:40.580
in my book about dark energy
because my book was really

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.360
focusing on the early universe,
the high energy universe.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.470
But I did recently
publish a paper

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:55.260
with some colleagues about
dark energy about a month ago.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:00.020
But it is not
related to the book.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.420
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, what's

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.144
special about physics in
terms of your analogies

00:42:05.144 --> 00:42:06.310
and you're kind of parallel?

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.485
So you talk but jazz.

00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:09.920
And jazz creates some structure.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.900
Jazz lends itself
to multiple paths.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.230
And I was thinking, well, you
could apply these analogies

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.094
and parallels to almost
anything, anything

00:42:19.094 --> 00:42:21.010
in the world that has
structure, like biology.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:25.310
Biology has-- you think of DNA
getting from a set of genes

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.130
and how they're randomly put
together to create structure,

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.924
and how plants
have cell symmetry.

00:42:30.924 --> 00:42:32.840
And while you were in
the middle of your talk,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.740
my brain just translated
physics to biology.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.920
And so what is
special about physics

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.614
other you're a physicist?

00:42:40.614 --> 00:42:42.030
STEPHON ALEXANDER:
To be honest, I

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.154
don't think there's anything
special about physics.

00:42:44.154 --> 00:42:45.740
I think that what's
special about this

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.830
is that as a physicist
and someone that's

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.160
played around a lot
with music, I just

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.670
wanted to have those two
worlds speak to each other

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.970
and found lots of
interesting parallels.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.460
But also, it helped
me do better research.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.280
So I would encourage
biologists and other people

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.280
to start seriously-- the book
was a labor of love for me.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.800
It's my first book, so
it took me quite a while

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.720
and a lot of
thought to write it.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.260
And so it was a-- the byproduct,
the after-effects of it

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.600
is someone that now has a
little bit more integrative

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.660
knowledge of these two fields.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.741
And so, maybe it was a
selfish thing for me.

00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:27.240
So I think what was
special about it

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.031
for me was just the
act of writing the book

00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:31.140
and finding these
new parallels that I

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.440
didn't know about it before.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.148
But I think that
there's nothing special.

00:43:34.148 --> 00:43:37.290
I think that in this
analogy-making game,

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.525
you can always find these
overlapping domains.

00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:41.400
And then there's something
interesting there.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.010
Because then where
they overlap and where

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.920
the analogies break down is
where something interesting

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.446
might flourish.

00:43:48.446 --> 00:43:49.820
And in the book,
I talk about-- I

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.580
go into-- it's really also
a book, for me, about doing

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.130
research.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.800
I mean, when I work with
my graduate students,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.970
the question is, how do I enable
them to be better researchers?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.870
Not to just learn
physics, but how

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.550
to do it, how to
write new papers,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.180
how to come up with new ideas.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.170
And this way of-- I realize
that all of my years

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.670
trying to be a jazz improviser
and playing spontaneously

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.570
on the spot with other
people and having them

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.880
support me, and function
with that group of people,

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.870
not being selfish--
all these things

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.190
are elements in
the research front

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.451
that I found to be
very useful with how

00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:28.950
I interact with my colleagues,
how I interact with students.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.160
I do think there's
something special.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.882
But I also think that if
you do this analogy-making

00:44:38.882 --> 00:44:41.340
with other fields, there'll be
something special and unique

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.810
there as well, too.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.740
AUDIENCE: Could you
explain that Coltrane

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.630
diagram since you didn't
have time to get--

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.320
STEPHON ALEXANDER: OK, sure.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:48.910
All right.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:54.340
So there's the
Coltrane diagram again.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.300
And going back to your thing--
so the diagram, I think,

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.672
was-- one interesting thing is
that a lot of jazz, not all,

00:45:00.672 --> 00:45:02.380
are sort of trying to
do a similar thing.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.380
They want to come up with
their own sort of system,

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.380
some kind of geometrical,
mathematical system,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:12.320
because that enables them
to think more economically

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.330
about how to improvise.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.890
Because, you know
there's many of thousands

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.155
of different scales.

00:45:18.155 --> 00:45:18.780
You're playing.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.770
What do you do?

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:26.180
So a lot of improvisers come
up with tricks of the trade.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:31.390
So this diagram I claim
was some sort of thing

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:35.180
that Coltrane was trying
to systematize relationship

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.580
between scales and
harmonic relations

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.480
that was important to him.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.800
So what you see here,
again, is a 60-sided cycle.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.200
Now in terms of math,
there's something

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.290
called cyclical groups.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.780
So the group Z12 is a
group, a [? mod ?] 12,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.930
where you go around 12 times
and you come back to yourself.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:03.430
So Z60 is our 60-fold cycle.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.793
So if you really look closely,
you have 60 notes there.

00:46:06.793 --> 00:46:08.334
And then what happens
there, you see,

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:11.670
you have clusters of those 60
notes, three clusters of notes.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.330
If you actually start with
the C and you go around--

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.110
I can't point
out-- that actually

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.870
is a very important
scale that I think

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:25.200
[INAUDIBLE] or Schoenberg,
one of those people

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.610
who did group theory, applied
group theory to music.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.530
That's now called all
intervalic tetrachord.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.050
And there are two of them.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:39.919
And that system exists
in this diagram.

00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:42.210
The other thing that I'd also
say that's very important

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.370
here is that you have
the whole tone scale.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:51.200
"Giant Steps" is basically
based on the augmented triad.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.400
But you can actually make two
whole tone scales out of that.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.400
And these are what we
call symmetric scales.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.300
These are scales that
literally look symmetric

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.670
when you geometrize
them in terms

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.530
of these cycles, these
cyclical symmetries.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:11.140
The other thing
that's important here

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.550
is something called a tritone,
which is a reflection.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.990
If I reflect along C and
I come back down here,

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:19.020
I get the tritone.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:24.870
And that maintains
itself in this diagram.

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.700
So it's not like a higher
dimensional version

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.770
of our 12-tone scale
that contains scalar

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.970
relationships in the geometry.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.600
And you can now
ask yourself, you

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.770
can think about now
relativity theory.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.266
And relativity
theory, as you know,

00:47:42.266 --> 00:47:48.730
if I-- what special
relatively tells me

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.140
is that if I have
two observers moving

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.150
at some velocity with
respect to each other,

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:57.030
length will be contracted
for the fast-moving observer

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:01.210
relative to the observer
that's not moving.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.380
And also time will
be dilated, meaning

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.130
so the rate at which a clock
will tick for that moving

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:09.260
observer will slow down
relative to the observer that's

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.950
not moving, relative to
that observer's clock.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.560
So those things are
relative concepts.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.020
Space and time intervals
are relative concepts

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.260
at the expense of
the speed of light

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.860
actually being the same in
both frames of reference.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.940
So there's something
invariant about that geometry,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.394
of those spatial,
temporal relationships.

00:48:29.394 --> 00:48:30.810
There's something
invariant there,

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.470
which is the speed
of light, which

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:38.100
basically retains the length of
the four-dimensional geometry.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.700
So the thing that's
actually invariant

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.600
is a four-dimensional
lengths measured

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.750
in the four-dimensional length.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:48.840
So Coltrane tired to-- I
believe he read everything

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.590
he could get his hands
on about Einstein--

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:55.450
he was trying to find, OK, you
know these different scalar

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.690
relationships are kind
of relative to each other

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.270
in this geometry.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:04.620
But the thing that's invariant
is the 60-fold cycle.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.920
And that's the basic idea.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.450
Now, of course, I in
the book go into-- I

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.490
try to develop the language so
that even if you know nothing

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:17.470
about music theory, by the time
you get to the end of the book,

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.030
you're like, OK, I
can use this language.

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.780
The other thing that's really
cool in this diagram-- and this

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.310
is a conjecture-- so "The New
York Times" review, basically,

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.210
tried to get at me.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:29.600
I basically tried
to riff on this

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.950
because a lot of what goes
on, too, in theory-making

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.100
and also jazz music
is that we riff.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.880
We make mistakes.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.710
If I tell someone get up
here, get on my sax, and just

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.280
improvise, and if
you go in thinking

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.170
that you want to play something
perfect, you'll freeze up.

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.940
But if you go in, and
knowing that improvisation

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.570
is about making
mistakes, and learning

00:49:54.570 --> 00:50:02.450
how to fall in real time,
then you could improvise.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.050
So it's about when you play
that wrong note-- you will--

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.980
how like an acrobat you fall.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.750
And that becomes
interesting improvisation.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.906
So I riff on this.

00:50:11.906 --> 00:50:13.280
And I said this
had this-- if you

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.700
look at this four-pointed
triangle, pentagram,

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.340
I started to say,
well, maybe this

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:26.551
led to this pentatonic scale,
this five-fold symmetry.

00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:28.676
Now here's a puzzle that
I haven't figured out yet.

00:50:28.676 --> 00:50:30.380
So maybe you guys can
help me with this.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.030
The pentagram does have a--
in terms of group theory,

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.280
it has a five-fold symmetry.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.090
If I perform discrete
transformations

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:43.620
on the edges of
this pentagram, it

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.940
remains invariant in
a five-fold manner.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.150
That's pretty cool.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.990
But if I start
coloring this diagram

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:53.090
with notes of the
pentatonic scale,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.090
it's no longer invariant.

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:56.820
All right.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.090
So the puzzle is, how
do I make it invariant?

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.320
I suspect that the
answer to that puzzle

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.850
reveals I think what Coltrane
didn't reveal to anybody else.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:11.510
I think he left us as a
puzzle to Yusef Lateef.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.610
Yusef Lateef was known to
be the guy of knowledge

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:15.930
to all the jazz musicians.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:20.020
They used to get out to Detroit.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.660
Coltrane and, I
think, Charles Mingus

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.150
and asked him theory questions.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.540
So I think they had this
kind of relationship,

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.170
just like Einstein
and Godel had.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.920
Thank you.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.961
MALE SPEAKER: Let's thank
Stephon Alexander for--

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.498
STEPHON ALEXANDER: Thank you.

00:51:34.498 --> 00:51:36.940
Thanks for having me.
