KOBI GLICK: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.812
I'm Kobi, a product
manager on Google Play.

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:05.936
MILENA NIKOLIC: And I'm
Milena, engineering manager

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:07.020
on Google Play.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.070
We work on Play Apps
Developer team in London.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.940
Today, we are here
to tell you how

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.930
you can set your app for
success using some of the tools

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.700
that we provide in Google
Play Developer Console.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.930
We'll talk about rapid
iteration and experimentation,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.680
and we'll tell you how
some developers are

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.614
using these services to
have success on Play.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.030
KOBI GLICK: The
vision of our team

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.300
is to build powerful
publishing tools, allowing

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.170
you to launch and iterate.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.580
We believe that experimentation
is the key to success.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.170
Throughout this
presentation, you'll

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.580
see a lot of developer
feedback, and we'll

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.320
start with the feedback we
have from Michael Ritter, SVP

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.100
Business Development at
SGN, about why they released

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.890
"Genies &amp; Gems" Android first.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.900
The quick publishing time
on Google Play is the key.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.490
You can make multiple
submissions in a short time,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.290
iterating on your product.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.230
Rapid iteration
and experimentation

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.210
is the key to success.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
SGN are power users of tools
like beta testing and Store

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.070
Listing Experiments.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.921
We will show you how
other developers are

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:12.295
using these tools, and we will
share some best practices.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.390
SGN use our tools, and then
they utilize their finding

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.270
across platforms.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.360
This leads to a much more
efficient soft-launch process.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.460
Soft launching is
a great way to make

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.950
sure your app or game
delivers value to users.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.080
As a result, their
worldwide launch

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.089
was much more
successful, and this

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:35.880
is exactly what we have
in mind when we are

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.380
building those tools for you.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.650
Our goal is to help
you experiment,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.622
launch, and iterate fast.

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.330
MILENA NIKOLIC: We
got a similar feedback

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.100
from Concrete
Software, developers

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.450
of "PBA Bowling Challenge."

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.300
They've told us that they
soft launch on Android first,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.810
because it allows
them to iterate faster

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.360
and to launch kind
of in a better way.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.210
This is exactly
music to our ears,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.230
exactly the feedback
we like to hear,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.320
and a practice we would
like to encourage.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.400
KOBI GLICK: So what are
we going to talk about?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.210
MILENA NIKOLIC:
OK, so we're going

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.090
to start by talking
about beta testing

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.590
and some of the improvements
we are making to this service

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.840
to make it even easier to
run large beta programs

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.520
and to get feedback
from your users.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520
Then we'll talk
about the best way

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.400
to roll out these rapid changes
in a safe and controlled

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.520
fashion.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.070
Then we'll go on to talk
about how you can understand

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.500
your users, using
user position report,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.900
and how you can optimize
your user acquisition using

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.810
Store Listing Experiments.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.420
We will also talk about the
importance of experimentation

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.440
if you're looking to go globally
and localize your app to all

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.740
the global markets.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.470
And finally, we will
also touch on how

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.020
you can keep an eye on the
performance of your app

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.370
on the go using new
Play Console mobile app.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.800
Throughout this session,
we'll mention new features

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.650
that we launched
recently or the ones

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.550
that we're launching
today or very soon.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.280
KOBI GLICK: OK, so let's
start with beta testing.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610
This is a great way to
improve your apps and games.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.690
60% of the top 1,000
apps on Google Play

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.882
are running a beta
test right now.

00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:10.090
And the goal is obviously
to test your apps and games

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.600
with testers and early adopters.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.900
It used to be challenging
in the past to join beta,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.960
so we launched closed
and open betas.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.435
With open beta, it's as
simple clicking the URL.

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.060
MILENA NIKOLIC: Did
you know that there

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.340
are many big apps that are
running very large open beta

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.880
programs?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.400
For example,
"Minecraft," Uber, Google

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.090
Search app, and many others.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.940
KOBI GLICK: Nice.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.070
So here's a great
example of a developer

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.930
that is using this platform
in a very correct way.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.960
Hopper, an app helping
travelers make better decisions,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.850
they run an internal alpha
testing and then a much larger

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.560
public beta test.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.410
And you can see
from their feedback

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.850
it cuts through testing
and rollout time by half

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.510
without adding any extra work
for them or their testers.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.800
This is exactly what we had in
mind when we built this model.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.780
We're making it even
easier for users

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.930
to discover and
join beta testing.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.680
Very soon, users will be able
to join beta tests directly

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.340
through your Store listing
page on Google Play.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.830
So if you run an open
beta, you can just

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.710
tell users, go to our page.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.540
Click it there.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.670
Join our beta, and
give us feedback.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.170
Feedback.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.350
You used to collect feedback
through various sources

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.459
and had to parse a
lot of information.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.750
From now on, users that
are part of your beta test

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.920
will be able to submit private
feedback to you directly

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.460
through Google Play.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.720
This feedback is private.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.310
You can see it in the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.370
It doesn't show to other
users, and it doesn't

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.992
impact your app's star rating.

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:39.450
Now, we believe
that apps and games

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.530
should be launching open
beta even before they go live

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.540
in production.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.750
This is why soon we
are going to introduce

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.500
a new section on Google
Play called Early Access.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.160
In this section, we will
feature exciting apps and games

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.380
that are still in
development and haven't

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.900
launched to production yet.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.060
This will allow
developers, you guys,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.620
to test your apps early on, with
early adopters and influencers

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.420
giving you private
feedback, making

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.330
sure you can find product
market fit earlier

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.839
or find tune your game's KPIs.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.380
In our first
collection, we are going

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.820
to introduce 28 apps and games.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.650
You can see them up here.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.640
Pretty cool icons.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.490
We have for example, Readfeed.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.810
It's an Android-first
online book club.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.440
Or we have Ava.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.620
The founder, whose parents
and sisters are deaf,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.400
created this app to help
deaf people and people

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.590
with hearing disabilities
to participate

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.520
in real-life conversations.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.230
Then we have LEGO, the kids'
and family power brand,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.500
with their first ever
in-house mobile game.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.770
It's a 3D LEGO set.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.310
You can touch, twist,
just like the brick

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.170
sets we all grew up with.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.940
Now, Early Access is not going
to be just for free to play.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.156
"Never Alone" a gorgeous game
developed by E-Line Media

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:53.730
and researched together
with the Alaskan natives,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.300
is coming to Google
Play on Early Access.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.910
They chose Early Access
because it's a great way

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.910
to make sure they get
feedback from their fans

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.792
and making sure the gaming
experience is a premium one.

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:08.250
We are sure those changes that
we are doing to beta testing

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.770
will help you create
larger beta tests,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.099
making your apps and
games even more awesome.

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:14.890
MILENA NIKOLIC: OK.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.780
Kobi mentioned
that users will be

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.220
able to give private
feedback on open beta apps.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.600
I know you all
know how important

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.360
it is to listen to user
feedback and to act on it.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.890
Recently, we have
launched a number

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.390
of improvements to user
reviews functionality

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.160
in Google Play
Developer Console,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.180
allowing you to, for example,
search your reviews by keyword.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.570
Or, for example, to see various
breakdowns of rating aggregates

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.070
by a number of
different dimensions,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.690
for example, device, country,
app version, and so on.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.120
In addition to that, we
made it possible to sign up

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.970
for email notifications
when users change

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.420
their review after your reply.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.860
I'm happy to announce that today
we launched Review Analysis.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.190
These are further
improvements to user reviews

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.190
functionality in Google
Play Developer Console,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.040
and they come in
several different tools.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.820
One of them is benchmarks across
a number of fixed aspects,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.029
for example, design,
stability, or speed.

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.570
So it basically
allows you to compare

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.080
how your app is doing
comparing to other similar apps

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.430
on these fixed aspects.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.330
In addition to this, we
also launched unique topics.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.470
So analyzing all of
your user reviews

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.130
and trying to extract what
are those specific topics

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.420
that users are talking
about just for your app.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.560
OK.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.470
Let's talk about release
management tools.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.150
KOBI GLICK: Sounds good.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.024
MILENA NIKOLIC: Cool.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:39.250
So you beta tested your app.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.090
You addressed a bunch
of user feedback.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.150
And now, you want to
launch to production.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.830
In this critical moment in time,
we want to be there for you.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.930
We want to give you as
much support as we can

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.050
so you can roll out in a very
safe and controlled fashion.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.330
One feature that I want
to remind everyone of

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.800
is staged rollouts.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.990
Staged rollouts allow you
to roll out gradually,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.110
keeping an eye on the
performance of your app

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.690
so that you can halt
in case of any issues.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.390
In case issues do
happen-- and we all

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.580
know that they do-- you
will be able to halt,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.320
and you will only
unhalt if you very,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.170
very specifically-- if you
do that action or upload

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.920
a new set of APKs.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.140
And here is one power tip.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.000
When you start a
staged rollout, we

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.360
select a random percentage
of users who become eligible

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.060
for this new update.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.820
If you increase the
percentage, we add more users

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.630
to the randomly selected set.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.000
If you start the
next staged rollout,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.120
we use a completely
different seed,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.990
which means it's not always
the same set of users

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.590
getting less stable
versions, so you

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.330
don't have to worry about that.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.300
For example, you can see how
developers like FTX Games

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.460
use staged rollouts
to confidently roll

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.905
out and frequently roll out
new versions of their app.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.530
KOBI GLICK: OK.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.867
So since we're talking
about release management,

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.200
I wanted to mention another
feature we launched recently

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.731
called Timed Publishing.

00:08:57.731 --> 00:08:59.730
We know that you appreciate
the quick publishing

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.021
times available on Google Play.

00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.930
But we wanted to
do better, meaning

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.850
giving you exact control on
the moment your app update goes

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.580
live.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.270
With Timed Publishing, you
can make as many changes,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.600
like APK changes, Store
listing updates, as you wish.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.140
We batch all the changes,
and they don't go live

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.590
until you click the Go Live
button in the Google Play

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.990
Developer Console.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.005
When you click it, the changes
go live within minutes.

00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:24.630
You also have a
changes log showing you

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.490
exactly what changes
are about to go

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.770
live, which is a great way
to manage your release.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.100
You can see the feedback
from Flaregames here

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.989
showing us how this feature
is super useful for them.

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:35.780
MILENA NIKOLIC: OK.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.590
Now, let's talk
about understanding

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.765
visits to your Store
listing page in Google Play.

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.390
It's very important
to understand where

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.180
your users are coming from.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.320
And sometime last year, we
launched User Acquisition

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.070
Funnel.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.310
This funnel allows you to see
how many visitors to your Store

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.150
listing are being
converted to installers

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.580
and how many of those
installers are then converting

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.040
to become in-app purchasers.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.650
In addition to this, you can
further break down this report

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.970
by, for example, user
acquisition source or channel.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.650
For example, seeing
whether users

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.410
are coming from
places organically

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.030
or from different
channels, like advertising.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.640
I'm pretty sure
that, like Trulia,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.607
so far you've found this
report to be very useful.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:20.940
And since understanding where
your users are coming from

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.740
is so important,
a couple of weeks

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.210
ago we have launched
another improvement

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.760
to this panel, which allows you
to break it down by country.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.360
This is very
important, because it

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.660
allows you to localize your
app in a more efficient way.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.700
And to take it one
step further, we're

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.640
happy to announce that very soon
we will be launching conversion

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.610
funnel benchmarks.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.190
This will allow
you to compare how

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.900
your app is doing against
other similar apps in terms

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.380
of how efficiently it's
converting users from visitors

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.860
to Store listing
page to installers.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.490
Stay tuned.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.110
This is coming very soon.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.070
And once you see who's visiting
your Store listing page,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.904
you'll want to optimize, right?

00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:04.570
KOBI GLICK: Yup.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.486
MILENA NIKOLIC: Right.

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:08.020
OK, so let's talk about
getting you some more users.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.960
To do that, we want to make sure
that your Store listing really

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.620
shows off your app in
the best possible light.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.130
And in order to get to
the best Store listing,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.430
we need to experiment.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.440
This is where Store Listing
Experiments come in.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.620
This feature has been
a very big success

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.470
with developers
in the past year.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.960
More than 70% of
our top developers

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.245
are using the feature.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:30.370
We often get feedback from
developers, for example,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.480
like this one from
Goodgame Studios,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.930
that it drives significant
uplift to their conversion

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.555
rate.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:38.689
KOBI GLICK: A big opportunity
to get more installs

00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:40.980
is optimizing the top of the
funnel, your Store listing

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.860
page.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.960
This is where users make
their install decision,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.260
regardless of whether they
found the app through Search

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.180
or via a deep link.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.680
Before we launched it, you had
to use a bunch of workarounds

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.570
and spend some budget.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.028
You can see the
feedback from Rovio

00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:54.810
here on how they had
to run icon tests.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.911
They spent budget.

00:11:55.911 --> 00:11:57.910
After we launched it, you
can see their feedback

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.520
about soft launching
first on Google Play

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.258
as it allows them to better
understand their users.

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:09.970
Store Listing Experiments have
been seeing great success.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.060
In the last year, you can
see Flaregames up here,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.220
30% increase in installs.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.980
ERepublik Labs, running
this exactly the way we

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.730
thought about it, as a rapid
iteration and experimentation

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.540
tool.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.650
Expedia, 10% increase
of installs globally.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.580
And actually, their
most successful test

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.010
was reordering screenshots.

00:12:29.267 --> 00:12:31.100
MILENA NIKOLIC: Here
are some best practices

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.530
when running Store
Listening Experiments.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.530
Create a hypothesis first.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.430
Make sure you know what
you're trying to prove.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.500
Next, test one thing at a time.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.050
Run your experiments
until they have reached

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.400
statistical significance.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.510
We'll let you know
when this has happened.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.940
Minor tweaks often
have minor impact.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.610
Consider bold
changes, especially

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.780
if you're early in
your startup's life.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.180
And finally, keep testing.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.874
The next major improvement
may be still to come.

00:12:59.874 --> 00:13:02.290
Here is some great feedback
we received from Jamie Berger,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.180
head of marketing at Scopely.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.290
We can see how this
feature encourages

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.800
testing and validation
of new and bold ideas.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.410
We were very happy to
see how they used this

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.160
as their go-to tool for market
testing and optimization.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.540
KOBI GLICK: OK, so here's
some great examples

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.670
of the best practices in
action with Instacart.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.910
We've learned that an
app description that

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.370
clearly shows your app value
to users just works better.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.840
So you can see control
versus experiment.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.750
Experiment is much clearer.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.230
Plus 14% in installs.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.940
And here's a bunch
of great examples

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.340
from Concrete Software.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.220
Sometimes, you just get lucky.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.760
They run an icon test for
"NHL Hockey Target Smash."

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.160
Plus 70% installs.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.930
Boom.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.970
It's great, right?

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.380
But sometimes, you actually
need to launch, iterate,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.929
and experiment a lot.

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:53.470
So with "PBA Bowling
Challenge," they

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.310
ran a series of experiments,
and every icon that you see here

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.640
represents a complete
series of experiments.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.020
They also iterated on their
description, screenshots,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.220
and their order, leading to
a compound effect of 63%.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.080
This is incredible.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.670
Now, let's see an example from
mixi, a leading game developer

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.850
from Japan, that will
show us how a leading game

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.580
developer thinks
about localization

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.170
and experimentation.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.245
When mixi wanted to take
their big hit "Monster

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:23.750
Strike" to the US, they ran
a series of experiments.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.490
They tested the icon, the
screenshots, the description,

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.840
and the video.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.380
In this chart, you can see
how they ran the experiments

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.710
methodically and scientifically,
leading to a compound effect

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.910
of 68% in installs.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.630
Start Listing
Experiments helped mixi

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.370
understand the difference
in taste and flavor

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.080
between users in the
US and users in Japan

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.690
and help them localized
their games much better.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.870
And here's the feedback we got
from their XFLAG Studio team.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.030
This feedback makes
us really excited,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:00.050
as our mission is to help you
test directly on our platform.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.800
MILENA NIKOLIC: We
want you to experiment,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.040
we want you to iterate, and
we want you to do this fast.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.470
This is why I'm happy to
announce that last week,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.600
we launched multiple concurrent
localized Store Listing

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.580
Experiments.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.500
We want you to go globally
faster and have better tools

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.360
to test localized versions
of your Store listing.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.430
You can now run up
to five Experiments

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.357
with different languages
at the same time.

00:15:22.357 --> 00:15:23.190
KOBI GLICK: Awesome.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.390
So you're talking about
making things faster, right?

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:25.640
MILENA NIKOLIC: Indeed.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.510
KOBI GLICK: One
thing that is not

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.635
fast today is making price
changes in the Developer

00:15:28.635 --> 00:15:29.190
Console.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.460
This really sucks, actually.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.380
Because lots of people
have the same price

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.857
point to many in-app
products or paid apps.

00:15:35.857 --> 00:15:37.440
So what are we going
to do about that?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.130
MILENA NIKOLIC: I'm very
glad you asked, Kobi.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.750
We want to make
this faster as well.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.720
We want to make
pricing faster as well.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.390
So I'm also happy to announce
that earlier this week,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.050
we have launched
Pricing Templates.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.670
With Pricing Templates,
you can define prices

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.320
across all of the markets
that Google Play supports.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.570
Did you guys know that there
are 70 such markets now?

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.920
Yeah.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.090
Once you create a
template, you can link it

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.882
to as many paid apps or
in-app products as you want.

00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:06.340
If you make a change
to a template,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.550
it gets propagated
to all of the apps.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.790
So, for example, if you're
like Toca Boca Games

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.811
and selling multiple titles
at, let's say, $2.99,

00:16:15.811 --> 00:16:18.570
you only need to make changes
to your template once,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.230
and it will be propagated
to all of your apps.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.000
If you're like Wooga,
selling in-app products

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.060
at multiple price points,
for example, $1.99, $4.99,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.350
and $9.99, you only need
to maintain three templates

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.980
instead of manually
making changes

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.390
to tens or hundreds
of individual pricing

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.860
points in multiple
different currencies.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.740
Like in this feedback
we got from Toca Boca,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.500
we hope Pricing Templates
will help you move faster

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.526
and get successful.

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:46.150
KOBI GLICK: OK.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.340
So it's important
for us you're also

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.530
able to localize
your price better.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.500
This is why we also
launched Round Pricing.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.950
With Round Pricing, we're
not, like we used to do,

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.800
just converting the price
using today's exchange rate.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.350
We also apply locally relevant,
country-specific rounding

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.980
rules.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.550
So a price like 9.73
euros becomes 9.99 euros.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.599
A price like 196
Japanese yen simply

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.250
becomes 200 Japanese yen.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.040
And 25,235 Indonesian
rupee simply

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.650
becomes 25,000 Indonesian rupee.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.369
We are sure that this change,
like the feedback you see here

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.810
from Wooga, will help you
streamline your pricing

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.250
structures and make your
businesses even better.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.940
Now, while we're helping you
make price changes faster

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.830
with templates and more
locally relevant with rounding,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.820
we're keeping your ability
to tweak the prices manually

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.877
in the Developer Console.

00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:41.460
We know that this
is important for you

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.160
when you run a
short-time promotion

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.200
or try new pricing strategies.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.890
We are sure that the new
changes we are making to pricing

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.719
will help you go
globally faster.

00:17:52.719 --> 00:17:53.510
MILENA NIKOLIC: OK.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.090
Last but not least.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.550
Finally, we have a mobile
app for Google Play Developer

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.220
Console.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.720
We have to admit,
it took us awhile.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.900
It took us much longer than
it took all of you guys,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.970
but we've made it.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.210
And we can tell you this
app stuff is pretty sweet.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.860
We really like it now.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.620
Our new app allows you to
follow your app's performance

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.460
on the go and to do
time-critical changes wherever

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.350
you are.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.840
When you're rapidly
iterating, you

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.150
need a power tool that's in
your pocket at all times,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.030
and we've built Play Console
app exactly with those use cases

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:23.940
in mind.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.080
Whether you want to quickly
reply to a user review

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.350
or show off performance of your
app to a venture capitalist,

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.250
Play Console app should
be there to support you.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.840
Regarding an
initial feature set,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.430
obviously, you can track
installs and uninstalls,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.680
and you can break them down
by a number of dimensions,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.420
like app version, country,
device, and so on.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.270
You can also track
your crash reports,

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.520
including hourly data
and full stack traces.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.130
You can also see ratings
and user reviews,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.940
and you can reply
to user reviews.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.990
You can also track the
state of your release.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.570
For example, is it
in beta testing,

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.622
is it in staged rollout,
or has it reached prod yet?

00:18:59.622 --> 00:19:00.580
Oh, and one more thing.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.560
You can obviously get
push notifications--

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.640
everyone loves
those-- when there

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.810
are certain important
changes to your app.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.130
For example, when your
app updates go live.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.810
If you haven't installed
the app yet, please do.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.370
If you're still not convinced,
please come to Play Sandbox.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.320
We would love to convince you.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.210
And if you have any
feedback, send it to us.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.950
We intend to listen and
add more functionality

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.716
in the next couple of versions.

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:25.340
KOBI GLICK: OK.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.000
So today, we spoke about
launching, experiment,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.781
and iterating on Google Play.

00:19:29.781 --> 00:19:32.280
With the new changes we're going
to introduce to beta tests,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.520
it will become easier for
users to discover and join

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.900
your beta programs
and for you to build

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.310
bigger, larger beta audiences
and improve your apps

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.710
and games.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.820
Users will be able to
send you private feedback

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.980
that only you can see in
the Developer Console.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.470
The new Early
Access section will

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:51.310
feature exciting apps and games
that are still in development.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.700
We also spoke about
better understanding users

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.700
with our new mobile app
that Milena just mentioned

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.030
and a bunch of enhancements,
such as benchmark,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.890
to the user acquisition report.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.050
Finally, we spoke about
making things faster

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.550
with multiple localized Store
Listing Experiments and price

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.090
templates, as well as
making prices more locally

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.460
relevant with rounding.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.910
We are really excited to
getting developer feedback

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.960
like the one you see here from
Scott Rubin, SVP of business

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.690
development at
ROBLOX, telling us

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.970
how features like Store
Listing Experiments

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.240
encouraged them to launch their
next major update on Android

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.610
first.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.470
We hope that the
tools we're building

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.980
will encourage you to continue
to launching and iterating

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.090
on our platform.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.880
We will continue to help
build more powerful publishing

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.150
tools, allowing
you to experiment,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.940
iterate, and make your apps
and games even more awesome.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.470
Thank you.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.410
MILENA NIKOLIC: Thank you.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:53.644
Now, I would like to invite to
the stage Larissa and Aaron.

00:20:53.644 --> 00:20:54.685
AARON ROTHMAN: Thank you.

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:00.240
LARISSA FONTAINE:
Thanks, Milena and Kobi.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.420
That was an amazing overview of
all of the cool stuff launching

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.455
in the Developer Console.

00:21:05.455 --> 00:21:08.080
You can see that Aaron and I are
really excited about this talk

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.042
today, so much so that we
decided to dress the part.

00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:12.125
How you doing there, Indy?

00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:17.330
My name's Larissa, and I
lead business development

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.490
for the Apps team
at Google Play.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.510
My team and I work
with developers

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.280
to help them build great apps
and successful businesses

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.284
on the platform.

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:27.670
AARON ROTHMAN: And I'm Aaron.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.810
I lead search and
discovery on Play.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.301
My team is focused on making
sure users find great apps.

00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.300
LARISSA FONTAINE: As much
as I love Short Round,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.290
I'm going to take the hat
off so I can see you guys.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.340
So I talk to developers
all the time,

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.090
and understanding how Store
discovery works always

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.060
comes up as an important topic.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.960
We know that it can
feel difficult to break

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.870
through the noise and to help
users find your app at exactly

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.440
the right time.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.180
More apps are being uploaded
to the Store every day,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.680
making it even harder
to break through.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.400
And studies show that more users
are using the same set of apps

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.070
over and over again instead
of downloading new ones.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.484
One theory is that app
fatigue is driving this.

00:22:11.484 --> 00:22:12.900
But what if it's
that users simply

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.690
can't find all the great
apps that are out there?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.480
And it's not only
apps that are growing.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.980
The entire Android ecosystem
is growing incredibly fast.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.060
You heard some of these
numbers this morning.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.770
The one we're going
to talk about here

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.980
is 1 billion
monthly Store users.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.960
Out of that huge
audience, we want

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.702
to help you find the
best users for your app.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.077
So that's why you're all here.

00:22:39.077 --> 00:22:40.660
Today, we're going
to walk through how

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.390
we can work together to improve
app discovery in the Play

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.479
Store.

00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:46.020
There are a lot of
important elements

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.020
that contribute to
discovery, and some of which

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.802
you've already heard about.

00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:51.510
But we're going to
touch on a few of them

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.305
again, because
they're that important

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:56.364
and because they directly
contribute to discovery.

00:22:56.364 --> 00:22:58.280
We've narrowed them down
to the most critical,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.650
and we're going to go
through each of them--

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.390
build something great,
listen to your users,

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.137
optimize your presence,
and expand your reach.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.090
And then we're going to
share some insights about how

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.970
the discovery
mechanisms in the Store

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.377
actually work, some of which
we've never shared before.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.100
AARON ROTHMAN: So as
Larissa mentioned, it all

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.380
starts with building
something great.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.860
We want users to find
the apps they will love.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.950
So a quarter of installed
apps are used only once.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.949
Wow, that's scarier
than a pit of snakes.

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:39.240
LARISSA FONTAINE: All right,
Aaron, let's turn it back.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.385
AARON ROTHMAN: Anyways,
anyways, I promise no more.

00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:42.760
So this is where
we want to start

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.130
with building something great.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:55.020
So based on some
internal analysis,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.000
we found that permissions,
footprint, and design

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.700
were all key components
when it came to a user's

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.730
perception of a great app.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.400
So starting with permissions.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.080
Excessive permissions
can actually

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.092
deter a user from installing
your app in the first place.

00:24:11.092 --> 00:24:12.800
It's important to
remember-- if you don't

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.940
need it, don't ask for it.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.800
Users may be wary
of installing apps

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.260
where the permissions don't
seem to align with the app

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.500
functionality.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.840
For example, why
does a child's game

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.080
need to access my
phone's call logs?

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.020
Second is footprint.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.360
Some users may be scared off
by the footprint of your app.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.660
These users may be on
poor internet connections

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.680
or have limited phone memory.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.720
This is especially true
in emerging markets,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.730
where there are both phone
and network limitations.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:50.070
So it's helpful to be mindful
of SDK compatibility, APK

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.550
size, and memory usage.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.480
Sometimes, less is more.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.510
Third is design.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.960
So the users installed your app.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.360
Now, you want to ensure
a great experience.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.710
So remember to limit
the cognitive load.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.820
A well-designed app is
intuitive and consistent

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.050
and does not require
a user to hunt,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.760
guess, remember,
or otherwise strain

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.330
their brains trying
to figure out

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.420
how to interact with your app.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.350
One tangible solution for
making a highly usable app

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.960
is implementing Google's design
spec, known as material design.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.550
Here are two examples of apps
that invested more in quality

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.140
by adopting material
design, which

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.390
led to the benefit of
more user engagement.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.040
It's pretty impressive,
for example,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.800
that Trello saw a 41% increase
in activity per session

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.195
by implementing material design.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.300
So you can do your best
to build a great app.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.850
But how can you be sure
it's actually great?

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.580
More than half of poor user
reviews are quality related,

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.830
and a third of those are
just about bugs and crashes.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.160
It can be difficult to get it
right in the first iteration.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.480
So we recommend following
the earlier advice of Milena

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.520
and Kobi and using beta
testing and staged rollouts

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.566
to ensure that your app
is great when it launches.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.660
So we've covered building
and launching a great app.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.740
Now, just because
your app is launched,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.450
it doesn't mean you need to
stop engaging with your users.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.880
Listening to your users
is important for continued

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.250
success, and I'm
going to explain why.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.530
You have a unique
opportunity in Android

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.690
to engage with
your users directly

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.300
by replying to the reviews
via the Developer Console

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:51.040
and building an even more
loved app as a result.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.760
One example is Aviary,
who created a dialogue

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.800
with their users by
engaging with feedback.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.330
This responsiveness
led to 50% of reviewers

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.460
revising their scores higher.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.680
It's crazy, right?

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.860
User feedback can help
make your app better,

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.020
leading to higher
ratings and a boost

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.255
in discovery opportunities.

00:27:13.482 --> 00:27:15.440
LARISSA FONTAINE: So
after building a great app

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.100
and listening to
your users, it's

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.340
important to create a
Play Store listing that

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.982
quickly and accurately reflects
what your app is about.

00:27:23.982 --> 00:27:25.940
You're all familiar with
the different elements

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.910
of your listing.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.320
These really require some
thoughtful attention.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.830
We've provided
multiple ways for you

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.840
to communicate the value of
your app, and it's up to you

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.610
to ensure they capture the
most important and interesting

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.940
information.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.010
And each of them, from the
title to the description

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.280
to the images,
provide metadata that

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.030
help us understand
what your app does

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.720
and who's most likely to use it.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.760
It sounds easy, but no one
gets it right the first time.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.380
And this is why we created Store
Listing Experiments to help you

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.520
refine each of these elements.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.260
You already heard
from Kobi and Milena

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.910
about how these have helped
developers over the last year.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.580
And the stat that
70% of top developers

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.530
are using Experiments
is really incredible.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.025
Developers of all sizes
are seeing real impact.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.780
And iteration is key for
Store Listening Experiments.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.660
In this example from
Rovio, they focused

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.720
on the icon and finding
which one would most

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.102
impact conversions.

00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:27.060
Here are 12 different
treatments they explored,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.280
with various outcomes.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.160
And they kept iterating.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.960
This is what we see
from developers who

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.870
are finding the most success.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.460
They continue to test
and refine and understand

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.940
user preferences.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.080
Ultimately, Rovio saw
significant uplift

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.680
as a result of
their Experiments.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.450
And back to discovery.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.796
Higher conversion rates from
your listing to installs

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:52.170
are an important
signal, and they

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.000
help us understand when
a user has successfully

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.602
gone from searching for
an app to finding one

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:58.810
that they think they'll love.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.280
So now, you've
built a great app,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.210
you've implemented
important feedback,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.360
and you have a strong
Play Store presence.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.036
What's next?

00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:10.410
There are different
opportunities

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.720
to expand your reach,
depending on the type of app

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.170
you have and the type of
experiences that your users

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.780
are looking for.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.460
Going global and finding
audiences in new markets

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.270
is a strategy that's
worked extremely well

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.100
for many developers,
so we're going

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.000
to explore a few tips and tools
that can help you find success

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.655
in new markets.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.782
So earlier, we talked about
the massive reach of Android.

00:29:33.782 --> 00:29:35.490
We've actually looked
at the growth rates

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.580
of apps that are
available globally

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.590
and those that are only
available in specific markets.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.730
Global apps grew 2.4 times
faster than non-global apps.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.319
Now, this makes intuitive sense.

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:50.610
If you have more markets,
you have a larger addressable

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:51.514
audience.

00:29:51.514 --> 00:29:52.930
But the data really
proves it out.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.510
There are a few specific
things to consider when you're

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.380
planning to localize your app.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.630
First, you should use
the Dev Console reports

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.110
that we talked about to
understand where new user

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:10.460
bases are growing and prioritize
localizing for those markets.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.324
Second, don't just
translate, actually localize.

00:30:14.324 --> 00:30:15.990
This means ensure
that you're culturally

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.210
aware of local
market expectations

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.810
and be ready to
support your new users.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.600
Last, always be prepared
to test and iterate.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.385
New users means new feedback.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.940
A developer who did incredibly
well with this is 1Password.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.060
They localized their Store
description, their screenshots,

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.240
the content, and the
messaging inside their app.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.560
And we looked at those
signals to understand

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.180
when the app was ready to
be shown to local users.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.740
For 1Password, the
investment really paid off.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.710
After two weeks of work,
they saw 100x install growth

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:52.990
in Korea.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.110
It was really pretty incredible.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.410
By focusing on
local market users,

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.690
they made a real difference.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.330
And in most cases,
it's worth the effort

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.760
if your plan is to grow
through market expansion.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.800
And we have powerful tools to
help, like the localization

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.610
checklist, access to
translation services,

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.526
and the new pricing
features that Kobi shared.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.460
So we've reviewed the
most important ways

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.790
that you can directly
affect the discoverability

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.400
of your app and some key actions
that you can take right away.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.950
For build something
great, limit permissions,

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.270
and focus on beautiful design.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.680
Listen to your users.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.090
Feedback is a gift.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.120
Use it to get better.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.680
Optimize your presence.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.510
Experiment your way to
improve conversions.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.860
And expand your reach.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.234
Go global and localize.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.520
We've also mentioned that
all of these impact discovery

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.890
within the Store.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.127
So let's unpack how the
Store actually works

00:31:50.127 --> 00:31:51.710
and why each of these
elements matter.

00:31:59.485 --> 00:32:00.360
AARON ROTHMAN: Uh-oh.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.765
There we go.

00:32:00.765 --> 00:32:01.265
I'm back.

00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:02.220
Great.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.560
So how are users actually
discovering apps in Play,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.814
and what matters to those
discovery mechanisms?

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.570
So let's start with
how users are actually

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.240
finding apps today.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.060
The top discovery
channels on Play

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.370
are number one, Play Search,
two, Recommendations, three,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.113
Top Charts.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.900
So starting with Search.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.910
About half of searches are
specifically for an app title.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.290
This is where it's especially
important when naming your app

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:42.280
to be unique, keep it short, and
make sure that it is not easily

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.350
confused with a
similarly named app.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.640
A well-named app
also has the benefit

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.540
of appearing within
Google Play Search

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.770
Suggest, which makes it
even easier for users

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.440
to find your app.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.250
By using Google
Play Search Suggest,

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:01.780
they don't even need to type in
the full name to find the app.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.146
Half of searches are also
by category or keyword.

00:33:05.146 --> 00:33:07.020
This is where it's
important to make sure you

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.180
select the right app category.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.160
Also, when you're writing
the description of your app,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.340
it's great and important to
be thorough and complete,

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.125
making sure to include key
functionality and features.

00:33:21.989 --> 00:33:23.530
You may have noticed
there's actually

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.930
a third way that an app can
appear within given search

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.200
results, and this is ads.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.230
Play Search ads are already
part of AdWords' app

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.260
install campaigns and provide
an additional placement

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.390
within Play Search.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.240
So Recommendations.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.440
Whether on the Home page
or right after a user

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.360
installs an app, Google Play
recommends apps personalized

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.447
for each user.

00:33:50.447 --> 00:33:52.030
Although there are
a lot of components

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.510
that go into those
smarts, I just

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.550
want to highlight a
few for you today.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:00.630
These include metadata, app
quality, user Store activity,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.528
and web knowledge.

00:34:04.797 --> 00:34:06.630
LARISSA FONTAINE: So
charts are a common way

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.739
for both new and returning users
to gain a quick understanding

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.690
of which apps are
popular in the Store

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.291
and which apps are on their
way to becoming popular.

00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:16.790
So we're going to
share some insight

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.580
into how these charts
are put together,

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.582
with specific details
on key components.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.340
Top Free and Top Paid
charts are primarily

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.510
determined by installs
within the last seven days.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.320
We've kept this
timeline fairly short,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.199
because we want the charts to
stay fresh and interesting week

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:34.760
over week.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.159
Top New Free and
Top New Paid also

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.370
look back at installs over
the previous seven days,

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.460
but they're biased
towards new apps, those

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.110
that have launched on the
Store in the previous 30 days.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.630
This is important to make sure
the charts aren't dominated

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.540
by established titles.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.451
We want to help users find new
and interesting apps wherever

00:34:57.451 --> 00:34:58.242
they look for them.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.090
Trending, on the
other hand, identifies

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.250
fast risers that
have the potential

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.290
to make it onto the top charts.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.300
Typically, this means
that their installs have

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.480
seen accelerated growth
over the previous 30 days,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.310
but their absolute
installs might not

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.534
be as large as those on
the other top charts.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.710
And finally, Top Grossing uses
the same seven-day trailing

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.210
approach but is instead
determined by spend.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.320
And of course, we're always
tuning our algorithms

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.460
to produce the best
user experience,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.260
so these are subject to change.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.240
But hopefully, you
have a better sense

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.220
of what drives placement
in the top charts

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.822
and how we look
at user preference

00:35:39.822 --> 00:35:41.280
to determine which
apps to surface.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.590
Featuring.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.450
Everybody loves featuring.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.240
So we define featuring to
mean the collections that

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.310
appear across the store,
either manually curated

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.620
or algorithmically generated.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.360
Quality is the key
driver for inclusion,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.970
and that's why we spent the
first half of this talk focused

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.660
on tools and strategies to
help drive important quality

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.200
signals.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.850
In addition to
quality, we also want

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.480
to surface trending apps
to keep the Store fresh,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.980
and we definitely
want users to find

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.480
apps that are using the
latest Android features,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.112
things that truly make their
experience and their phone

00:36:18.112 --> 00:36:18.612
special.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.940
If you meet the
necessary quality bar,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.750
your app is eligible
for appearing

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.520
in certain collections where
it makes contextual sense,

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.104
fits a category or
topic, or where users

00:36:31.104 --> 00:36:32.270
have installed similar apps.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.130
With an even higher
expectation of quality,

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.490
we have collections showcasing
new and updated apps,

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.060
so users know they're getting
great experiences that

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.210
are hot off the presses.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.660
For seasonal collections
and special promotions,

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.820
our BD and merchandising
teams work together

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.912
to identify which
apps to include.

00:36:51.912 --> 00:36:53.620
And we also use a
healthy dose of machine

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:58.446
learning to scale our efforts
across categories and markets.

00:36:58.446 --> 00:37:00.070
It's important to
note that within each

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.190
of these collections, the
Recommendations engine helps

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.320
determine which
users see which apps.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.800
The most important thing is
not that millions of users

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.610
see your app, it's that millions
of the right users see your app

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.940
and go on to install it.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.620
AARON ROTHMAN: So now that we
revealed the Holy Grail of app

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.370
discovery-- ha--

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.309
LARISSA FONTAINE: Ha.

00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:20.850
AARON ROTHMAN: --we
want to leave you

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.870
with four recommendations
that you can do right now.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.280
Number one, for
building a great app,

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.770
we recommend reviewing
Android's design principles.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.700
Does your app measure up?

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.770
Two, for listening
to your users,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:41.030
we recommend addressing user
feedback, especially when it

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.010
comes to bugs.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.040
Squash those bugs.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.380
Number three, for
optimizing your presence,

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.110
why not try a Store
Listing Experiment?

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.160
And finally, number four,
for expanding your reach,

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.320
we recommend reviewing
the market report

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.434
in the Developer Console.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.140
So that's our talk for today.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.440
We're so excited to
have you all here.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.580
We know we shared a lot
of content with you,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.020
but the great news
is that you can

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.890
find everything you need
in our new app, Playbook

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.350
by Google Play.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.900
It replaces the business
guide that some of you

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.020
have seen called "The Secrets
to App Success on Google Play."

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.390
There are a ton of great
features, but it's brand new.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.119
So we would love your feedback.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:24.660
If you get a moment, please hop
over to the Google Play Store

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.839
and try it out.

00:38:26.839 --> 00:38:29.380
And of course, we want to leave
you with a few helpful links.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.610
Thank you so much for
coming from all of us.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:37.660
