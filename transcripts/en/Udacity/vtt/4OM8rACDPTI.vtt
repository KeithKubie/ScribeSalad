00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
So let's go through the list. Definitely irrelevant requirements

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.370
cannot lead to missing functionality in the final product, because

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.730
irrelevant requirements actually refer to unneeded functionality in the system.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.030
So functionality that is put in the requirements, but it

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.120
is not really needed. So we're not going to mark

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.400
this one. Indeed, irrelevant requirements can introduce inconsistencies. So they

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.490
could be irrelevant requirements that not only are not pertinent

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.620
but they are inconsistent with some of the pertinent requirements.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.220
They can also waste project resources, because if we spend time

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.920
designing and then implementing the parts of the system that we

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.410
refer to these irrelevant requirements, of course, we are wasting project

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.570
resources. And I will not mark the last one because there's really

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.220
no correlation between any irrelevant requirements and bugs in the software

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.350
system. Of course, by implementing the part of the system that refers

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.960
to an irrelevant requirement you might introduce a bug. But that's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.020
not necessarily the case, and there really no correlation between the two.
