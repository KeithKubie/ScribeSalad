list maker so we built that called to-do
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020
list maker so we built that called to-do
list and then after that we needed

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
list and then after that we needed
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.549
list and then after that we needed
something else and so we built that so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
something else and so we built that so
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.020

products that we need and we recognize
 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.140
products that we need and we recognize
that there's probably a lot of other

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
that there's probably a lot of other
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850

people out there just like us who
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.290
people out there just like us who
probably need something just like what

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
probably need something just like what
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.260
probably need something just like what
we need not everybody but maybe there's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
we need not everybody but maybe there's
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.520
we need not everybody but maybe there's
a hundred thousand maybe there's a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
a hundred thousand maybe there's a
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.750
a hundred thousand maybe there's a
million maybe there's ten million that's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
million maybe there's ten million that's
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.010
million maybe there's ten million that's
a pretty good market for us we don't

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020
a pretty good market for us we don't
 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.690
a pretty good market for us we don't
need this like we don't need to capture

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
need this like we don't need to capture
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.780
need this like we don't need to capture
a billion people to be successful so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
a billion people to be successful so
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.770
a billion people to be successful so
that's been really helpful for us

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
that's been really helpful for us
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.449
that's been really helpful for us
because when you build something for

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
because when you build something for
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.210
because when you build something for
yourself and you use it you are a great

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220
yourself and you use it you are a great
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.650
yourself and you use it you are a great
judge of quality at that point and you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
judge of quality at that point and you
 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.630
judge of quality at that point and you
really understand it like you really

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
really understand it like you really
 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.130
really understand it like you really
truly understand it unlike when you

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
truly understand it unlike when you
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.630
truly understand it unlike when you
build something for somebody else you

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
build something for somebody else you
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.289
build something for somebody else you
don't quite get it you can learn a lot

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
don't quite get it you can learn a lot
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.000
don't quite get it you can learn a lot
about it but you don't really know it as

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
about it but you don't really know it as
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.440
about it but you don't really know it as
well as you know something that you need

well as you know something that you need
 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.600
well as you know something that you need
for yourself so and I think the great

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610
for yourself so and I think the great
 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.699
for yourself so and I think the great
companies of the world are typically run

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709
companies of the world are typically run
 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.110
companies of the world are typically run
by people who want to use their own

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
by people who want to use their own
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960
by people who want to use their own
products I mean it's so super cliche to

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
products I mean it's so super cliche to
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.520
products I mean it's so super cliche to
talk about Apple but I'll do it anyway

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
talk about Apple but I'll do it anyway
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.490
talk about Apple but I'll do it anyway
because why not if you listen closely to

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
because why not if you listen closely to
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.050
because why not if you listen closely to
what Steve Jobs says when he introduces

what Steve Jobs says when he introduces
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.120
what Steve Jobs says when he introduces

too and the idea there is that we're
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.750
too and the idea there is that we're
building it for ourselves because we

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
building it for ourselves because we
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.360
building it for ourselves because we
love this product and we think because

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370

we love it you're going to love it too
 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.949
we love it you're going to love it too
and I think most companies that build

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959
and I think most companies that build
 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.680
and I think most companies that build
great things are building them to to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
great things are building them to to
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.719
great things are building them to to
impress themselves first I mean you look

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729
impress themselves first I mean you look
 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.430
impress themselves first I mean you look
at companies like great car companies

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440
at companies like great car companies
 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560
at companies like great car companies
like Ferrari or Oddie or Porsche like

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570
like Ferrari or Oddie or Porsche like
 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.420
like Ferrari or Oddie or Porsche like

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
you just know they're doing this to
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.700
you just know they're doing this to
satisfy themselves they want to make

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
satisfy themselves they want to make
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.140
satisfy themselves they want to make
something great for themselves because

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
something great for themselves because
 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.760
something great for themselves because
that's important to them and they know

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
that's important to them and they know
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.870
that's important to them and they know
that if they make something that's great

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880
that if they make something that's great
 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.120
that if they make something that's great
for themselves other people are going to

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130
for themselves other people are going to
 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.520
for themselves other people are going to
love it unlike you maybe GM where it's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530
love it unlike you maybe GM where it's
 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.110

not really built for themselves they're

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
not really built for themselves they're
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.790
not really built for themselves they're
not really that excited about the Ford

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
not really that excited about the Ford
 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.690
not really that excited about the Ford
Focus probably or that's Ford but you

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700
Focus probably or that's Ford but you
 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.040
Focus probably or that's Ford but you
know they're sort of mildly excited

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
know they're sort of mildly excited
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.029
know they're sort of mildly excited
about it but they're probably like

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039
about it but they're probably like
 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.620
about it but they're probably like
pumped about it like Ferraris pumped

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630
pumped about it like Ferraris pumped
 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.600
pumped about it like Ferraris pumped
about building a car so we like the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610
about building a car so we like the
 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.719
about building a car so we like the
Ferrari Audie Apple those kind of

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729
Ferrari Audie Apple those kind of
 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.000
Ferrari Audie Apple those kind of
companies and even Amazon's a good

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010
companies and even Amazon's a good
 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.150
companies and even Amazon's a good
example this Amazon built this thing

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
example this Amazon built this thing
 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.529
example this Amazon built this thing
called Amazon Web Services which is

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539
called Amazon Web Services which is
 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.760
called Amazon Web Services which is
something they actually had to build

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
something they actually had to build
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.500
something they actually had to build
because they needed themselves first to

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510
because they needed themselves first to
 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.420
because they needed themselves first to
expand their own business so I think

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430
expand their own business so I think
 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.260
expand their own business so I think
companies that make things for

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270
companies that make things for
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.900
companies that make things for
themselves typically make better

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910
 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.420
