00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.870
We're now ready to
solve for A, B, and C,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.020
given these three equations
with three unknowns.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.700
So let's first start with
these top two constraints.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.930
So I have this one
right over here in blue.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.070
Let me just copy and
paste it right over here.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.070
And then let me rewrite
this constraint,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.840
but let me multiply
it by negative 2

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.140
so that I can cancel
out the C terms.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.530
So it's negative 2A
minus 2B minus 2C

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.510
is equal to negative 2.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.200
And then, if I add the left-hand
sides and the right-hand sides,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.540
on the left-hand sides, I get
6A plus 2B-- these cancel out--

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.420
is equal to 3.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.150
And then the other
constraint I could use

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.840
is this orange one
and the green to get

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.670
the C's to cancel out here.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:05.170
So I have 27A plus 9B
plus 3C is equal to 14.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.210
And here, let's see.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.710
I can multiply it
by negative 3 if I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.376
want to get the C's
to cancel out again.

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:13.240
And my whole goal is to have two
equations and two unknowns that

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.240
have leveraged these two
constraints in tandem

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.000
and these two
constraints in tandem.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.660
So now I'm going do these two.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.770
So I've multiplied this
equation times negative 3.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.490
I get negative 3A minus 3B
minus 3C is equal to negative 3.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.630
And now I can perform
the subtraction.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.450
And I get 24A plus 6B-- these
cancel-- is equal to 11.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.310
Now I have two equations
in two unknowns.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.010
And let's see.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.470
If I multiply this
equation right

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.320
over here times
negative 3, I should

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.820
get the B's to cancel out.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.290
So let's do that.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.350
So if I multiply this
times negative 3,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.250
this constraint, or this
term, 6A times negative 3,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.290
is negative 18A.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.530
2B times negative 3, minus 6B,
is equal to 3 times negative 3

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.100
is equal to negative 9.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.417
And now if we add both
sides, on the left-hand side,

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:16.250
we have-- let's see.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.610
24A minus 18A is 6A-- these
cancel-- is equal to 11 minus 9

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.750
is 2.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.910
Divide both sides by 6.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.690
We get A is equal to 2/6,
which is the same thing as 1/3.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.430
And so now we can substitute
back to solve for B.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.190
So let's see.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.360
We have 6 times 1/3.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.610
Our A is 1/3.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.860
Plus 2B is equal to 3.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.452
6 times 1/3 is 2.

00:02:53.452 --> 00:02:55.940
2 plus 2B is equal to 3.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.100
Subtract 2 from both sides.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.860
2B is equal to 1.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.720
Divide both sides by 2.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.470
B is equal to 1/2.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.910
So A is 1/3.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.000
B is 1/2.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.190
Now we just have to solve for C.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.200
So we can go back to
this original equation

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.450
right over here.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.800
So we have 1/3 plus 1/2
plus C is equal to 1.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.110
Actually, let me do that over
here so I have some space.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.940
So I have some space, let
me do it right over here.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.975
So I have 1/3 plus 1/2
plus C is equal to 1.

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:35.280
Now we find ourselves
a common denominator.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.200
So let's see.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.875
A common multiple
of 3, 2, and-- I

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:42.050
guess you could say 1-- this
is 1 over 1-- is going to be 6.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.230
So I can rewrite
this as 2/6 plus 3/6

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.340
plus C is equal to 6/6.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.440
1 is the same thing as 6/6.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.430
So this is 5/6 plus
C is equal to 6/6.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.460
Subtract 5/6 from both sides.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.040
We get C is equal to 1/6.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.290
So C is equal to 1/6.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.016
And there we are.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:08.140
We deserve a drum roll now.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.079
We've figured out a formula for
the sum of the first n squares.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.470
So we can rewrite this.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.920
This formula is now
going to be-- A is 1/3.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.020
So it's 1/3 n to the third
power plus 1/2 n squared--

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.270
let me make sure it doesn't
look like that n is a-- 1/2

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.880
n squared plus 1/6 n.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.600
So this is a pretty
handy formula.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.050
If now you wanted to find
0 squared plus 1 squared

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.640
plus 2 squared plus 3 squared,
all the way to 100 squared,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.260
instead of squaring 100 numbers
and then adding them together,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.630
you could figure out 1/3
of 100 to the third power

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.331
plus 1/2 times 100 squared
plus 1/6 times 100.

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.830
Or you could do
that for any number.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.030
So this right over here is a
pretty neat little formula.
