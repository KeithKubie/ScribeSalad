00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
You know what I hate?

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.380
When people hide their true feelings behind "jokes".

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.440
- I think that you're a repulsive, pathetic sack of joyless cowardice

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.520
who enjoys draining the life of other people to make up for the fact that you have none of your own.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.100
Jokey joke!

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.740
- Oh my god, is that how you really feel about me?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980
- Of course not! I sugar-coated it.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.200
Jokey joke.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.704
- What? You can't just say something horrible and then claim that it's--

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:26.080
- It's a jokey joke. Lighten up, you worthless idiot.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.200
Jokey joke.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.120
I believe in being straightforward.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.160
If I feel a certain way, I'll tell you.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.420
If I'm available, I'll text back immediately.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.460
I have no qualms with enthusiastically expressing the pendulum

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
of extreme emotions I oscillate between throughout the day.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.240
- Well, I was starving. And then I ate so much, I could like, die.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.180
But then I walked and I felt fine.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
- Wow. [sigh] Riveting story. Please, do tell it again.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.140
- Well, I was literally starving.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.060
We're often told that the worst thing you can be is needy.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.040
But here is my hot take.
[fire crackle]

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.480
I think that the people who turn the term "needy" derogatory

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.860
are actually emotionally unavailable jerks who don't want to deal with the reality

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.600
that we're all human beings with very valid emotional needs

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.120
and the right to express them in our relationships.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.360
[fire crackle] Sizzling hot take.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.920
We're designed to be interdependent.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.360
We're social creatures.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080
We seek the approval, attention, validation, support, and love

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.720
from the significant people in our lives.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.100
And as long as it's not taken to an unhealthy imbalance or forms into some kind of crippling codependency,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.600
I don't think there's anything wrong with being needy.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.820
We all have inherent yet unique needs.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.420
Some people need to feel safe.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240
- You know, when you walk away without a goodbye,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.060
It really makes me feel like I'm being abandoned.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.500
And so I would appreciate, if you're just gonna leave and go to another room--

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.220
Like, are you even listening to me right now?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.760
Some need appreciation.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.080
- Oh! Thank you so much for this mangled lizard!

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.100
And most of us need to feel understood.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.020
[muffled nonsense]

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.220
- Do you understand me now?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.740
Okay, do you understand?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.840
Having needs is totally normal. And expressing your needs is a vulnerable and harder thing to do.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.020
But that vulnerability makes way for connection, understanding, and a deeper relationship.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.260
Whether that's romantic or platonic.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
Now obviously, people's needs and the variations of them are different,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.580
And I think where "needy" gets a bad rep

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.120
is when you're met with this imbalance between two people.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.740
And instead of communicating in like a healthy way,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.120
one person, usually deemed the more needy one,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.340
becomes bitter or angry or insecure that the other isn't meeting their emotional needs.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
The classic example of this is:

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.880
- Why didn't you text me back?
- What? When?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.480
- Just now, when you were in the bathroom. I sent you a text and you didn't text me back.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.620
- Oh, I- I didn't know. I wasn't really on my phone.
- Really?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.480
Cuz your Instagram activity shows that you liked two cat photos while you were in there, so.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.300
Unless you have our conversation muted, you should have got the text notification.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.660
We all have to realise that our needs are not created equal.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.920
So it's easy with someone who has more needs, like myself,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.760
to make others feel suffocated or overwhelmed.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.160
And something that we, the needy, have to keep in mind

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.620
is to not take someone's response time personally,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.860
To respect the boundaries of others,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.980
and to know that this inherent imbalance may mean that we're either incompatible with certain people,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.980
Or that we're gonna have to learn to compromise.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.480
