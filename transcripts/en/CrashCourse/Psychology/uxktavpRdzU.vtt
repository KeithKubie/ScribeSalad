00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.720
It's perhaps the most stigmatized and misunderstood
psychological disorder of them all, even among

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.240
psychologists. Maybe because it's pretty rare,
affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.620
causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and
even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.160
As a result, its sufferers have often been
shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.199
many fallacies that surround the disorder
is simply what it means. The word "schizophrenia"

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.839
literally means "split mind" but contrary
to popular belief, the condition has nothing

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.190
to do with a split in personality or multiple
personalities.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.500
The term refers instead to what's sometimes
called a "split from reality." Multiple Personality

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.780
Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity
Disorder, is a totally different type of condition,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.420
a kind of dissociative disorder. And these
too, are shrouded in misconceptions, partly

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.030
because they were the subject of, probably,
the greatest psychological hoax of all time.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.260
While many of us can relate on some level
to the emotional swings, nervousness, and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.720
compulsions that come with mood and anxiety
disorders, it can be a lot harder for those

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.909
without direct experience to relate to the
symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociation.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.549
Unfortunately we tend to fear and avoid what
we don't understand in each other, whether

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.009
it's a friend of family member or just some
stranger on the bus. But thankfully part of

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.340
the psychologist's job is to demystify the
things that can happen in our heads, and as is

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.920
often the case, understanding may be the key
to compassion.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.860
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that
usually surfaces for men in their early to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.450
mid-20s, and for women in their late 20s.
For some the disorder comes on gradually,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.100
but for others it could arise more suddenly,
perhaps triggered by stress or trauma, although

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.719
no event can actually cause the disorder.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.060
Once thought of as a single discrete condition,
schizophrenia is now included in the DSM-5

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.979
as a point on a spectrum of disorders that
vary in how they're expressed and how long

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.440
they last, but they share similar symptoms.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.860
Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders are currently
thought of as characterized by disorganized

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.640
thinking; emotions and behaviors that are
often incongruent with their situations; and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.990
disturbed perceptions, including delusions
and hallucinations.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.140
They all involve a kind of loss of contact
with reality on some level. The resulting

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.690
behaviors and mental states associated with
this break from reality are generally called

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.920
"psychotic symptoms" and they usually impair
the ability to function.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.750
When someone's experiencing psychotic symptoms,
their thinking and speech can become disorganized,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.060
rambling and fragmented. This tendency to
pick up one train of thought and suddenly

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.670
switch to another and then another can make
communication painfully difficult.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.780
People exhibiting these symptoms can also
suffer a breakdown in selective attention,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.220
losing the ability to focus on one thing while
filtering others out.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.650
In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented
it becomes little more than a string of meaningless

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.780
words, a condition given a name that sounds
like its own kind of non sequitur, "word salad."

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
Classic schizophrenia is also often marked
by delusions or false beliefs not based in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.420
reality. These delusions can be rooted in
ideas of grandeur like "I'm the queen of England!"

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.230
or "I won an Olympic gold medal for the luge!"
Or they can become narratives of persecution

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.150
and paranoia, believing your thoughts and
actions are being controlled by an outside

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.570
force or that you're being spied on or followed
or that you're on the verge of a major catastrophe.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.050
And there are some complicated variations
on these delusions, like feeling that you've

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.190
died or don't exist anymore or that someone is madly in
love with you or that you're infested with parasites.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.410
Delusions of one kind of another strike as
many as four out of five people with schizophrenia.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.610
While some delusions can seem fairly logical,
they can also be severe and bizarre and frightening.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.640
Unfortunately maybe the most memorable examples
of people suffering from severe delusions

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.160
come from serial killers and yeah, while Son
of Sam did claim that he was taking orders

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.490
from his neighbor's dog, that kind of stuff
is in the tiny, tiny, tiny minority.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.890
Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett
of Pink Floyd both suffered psychotic symptoms.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.060
And then of course there's John Nash, the
Nobel Prize winning American mathematician

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.210
and subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind."

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.580
Through proper treatment, some people with
schizophrenia have not only learned to live

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.520
with their illness but also made fantastic
creative contributions to the world.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.500
Maybe people with schizophrenia also suffer
from perceptual disturbances, or sensory experiences

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.430
that come without any apparent sensory stimulation,
like hallucinations. This is when a person

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.960
sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking
the ability to understand what is real and what isn't.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.160
Auditory hallucinations, or hearing voices,
are the most common form, and these voices

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.130
are often abusive. It's as if you're inner
monologue, that conversation that you have

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.420
with yourself or the random things that float
through your head, were somehow coming from

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.530
outside of you. It's as if you couldn't sort
out whether the voices in your mind were internal

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.320
and self-generated, or external and other-generated.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.570
To me, it sounds terrifying.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.540
Other common symptoms include disorganized,
abnormal, or incongruent behavior and emotions.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.800
This could mean laughing when recalling a
loved one's death or crying while others are

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.760
laughing. Acting like a goofy child one minute, then
becoming unpredictably angry or agitated the next.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.240
Movements may become inappropriate and compulsive,
like continually rocking back and forth or

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.190
remaining motionless for hours.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.180
Broadly, most psychotic symptoms fall into
three general categories traditionally used

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.070
by psychologists: positive, negative, and
disorganized symptoms.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.669
Positive symptoms are not what they sound
like. They're the type that add something

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.410
to the experience of the patient. Like, for
example, hallucinations or inappropriate laughter

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.389
or tears or delusional thoughts.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.840
Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract
from normal behavior, like a reduced ability

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.830
to function, neglect of personal hygiene,
lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.570
face, or withdrawal from family and friends.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.419
Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles
of thought or speech that could include word

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.520
salad and other problems with attention and
organization.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.030
Symptoms like these are useful in diagnosing
a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.740
but there's a physiological component too.
Like many of the disorders we've talked about,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.610
schizophrenia has been associated with a number
of brain abnormalities.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.000
Post mortem research on schizophrenia patients
has found that many have extra receptors for

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.260
dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in emotion
regulation and the brain's pleasure and reward centers.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.860
Some researchers think that overly responsive
dopamine systems might magnify brain activity

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.639
in some way, perhaps creating hallucinations
and other so-called positive symptoms as the

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.160
brain loses its capacity to tell the difference
between internal and external stimuli.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.570
For this reason, dopamine blocking drugs are
often used as anti-psychotic medications in

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.370
treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies also
show that some people with schizophrenia have

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.130
abnormal brain activity in several different
parts of the brain.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.550
One study noted that when patients were hallucinating,
for example, there was unusually high activity

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.550
in the thalamus, which is involved in filtering
incoming sensory signals. Another study noted

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.040
that patients with paranoid symptoms showed
over-activity in the fear processing amygdala.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.350
So, schizophrenia seems to involve not just
problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.750
in several areas and their interconnections.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.290
But what might be causing these abnormalities?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.280
Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event
might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.330
time, even though it can't actually create
the disorder. Psychologists call this the

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.170
"diathesis-stress model."

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.539
This way of thinking involves a combination
of biological and genetic vulnerabilities

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:10.779
-- diathesis -- and environmental stressors
-- stress -- that both contribute to the onset

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.240
of schizophrenia. This model helps explain
why some people with genetic vulnerability

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.600
might not always develop schizophrenia and
why the rates of schizophrenia tend to be

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.030
higher with some degree of poverty or socioeconomic
stress.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.110
And it seems too that there is some kind of
genetic predisposition for the disorder. The

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.190
one-in-a-hundred odds of developing schizophrenia
jumped to nearly one in ten if you have a

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.880
parent or sibling with the disorder, with
about 50/50 odds if that sibling is an identical

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.510
twin, even if those twins were raised apart.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.940
One recent landmark seven year study looked
at genetic samples across 35 countries, examining

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.350
more than 35,000 people with schizophrenia,
and another 110,000 without the disorder.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.090
The study identified more than 100 genes that
may increase the risk of schizophrenia. As

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.979
expected, some of these genes involve dopamine
regulation, but others are related to immune

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:02.020
system functioning. Researchers continue to
tease out what is exactly going on here, but

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.460
many are hopeful that these new findings will
lead to better treatment.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.259
Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder
to live with and one that's hard for outsiders

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:15.440
to understand, but maybe even more rare and
more elusive are the dissociative disorders.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.389
These are disorders of consciousness, called
dissociative because they're marked by an

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:23.530
interruption in conscious awareness. Patients
can become separated from the thoughts or

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.940
feelings that they used to have, which can
result in a sudden loss of memory or even

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.229
change in identity.

00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:33.820
Now, we might all experience minor dissociation
at times, like maybe the sense that you're

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.469
watching yourself from above, as in a movie,
or like you're driving home and get so zoned

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:42.169
out that suddenly you find yourself in front
of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?"

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.279
Those things would generally fall into the
normal range of dissociation, but most of

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:48.580
us don't develop different personalities.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.480
Dissociative disorders come in several different
forms, but the most infamous of the bunch

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.960
is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder.
This has long been known as Multiple Personality

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.880
Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare
and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.830
two or more distinct and alternating identities
and the best known case was that of Shirley

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.750
Mason, whose story was famously rendered in
the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.170
a popular mini-series.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.360
The book was marketed as the true story of
a woman who suffered great childhood trauma

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.190
and ended up with 16 different personalities,
ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.350
to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical
Clara.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.690
The book became a craze and within a few years
reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.010
from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.580
Many believe the book was essentially
responsible for creating a new psychiatric

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.960
diagnosis. It turns out though, Sybil's story
was a big fat lie.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.860
Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one
with a troubled, traumatic past and a number

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.540
of psychological issues. As a student in New
York in the 1950s she started seeing a therapist

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.910
named Connie Wilbur and taking some heavy
medications. And somewhere in there, maybe

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.580
because she was coaxed, or maybe because she
wanted more attention, Shirley started expressing

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.680
different personalities.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.930
Dr. Wilbur built a career and a book deal
out of her star patient, even after Shirley

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.540
confessed that her split personality was a
ruse.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.170
The Sybil case is a powerful reminder that
we really don't understand dissociative disorders

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:20.300
very well or even know if they're always real.
Indeed, some people question if Dissociative

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.220
Identity Disorder is an actual disorder at
all.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.240
But some studies have shown distinct body
and brain states that seem to appear in different

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.670
identities, things like one personality being
right handed while the other is left handed,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.959
or different personalities having variations in their eye
sight that ophthalmologists could actually detect.

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:42.760
In these cases, dissociations of identity
may be in response to stress or anxiety, a

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.490
sort of extreme coping mechanism.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.600
Either way, the debate and the research continue.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.920
Today we talked about the major symptoms associated
with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.550
disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions
and behaviors, and disturbed perceptions.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.620
We also discussed brain activity associated
with these disorders and talked about their

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.360
possible origins including the diathesis stress
model.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:10.320
You also learned about dissociative disorders,
and Dissociative Identity Disorder in particular,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.360
and the scandal that was the Sybil case.
