Thank you for answering those questions. In case

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.600
you feel like you need a refresher on some

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.480
of the basic programming ideas, there are some helpful

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.950
links in the instructor notes. Now we're going to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.690
make these projects in the next lesson really soon.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.700
But before we do, I want to address an

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.790
important question, which is, what programming ideas are we

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.500
going to learn in this course? Here's the answer.
