00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:02.972
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that I've got a triangle,

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:07.584
and this side has length b,

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.045
which is equal to 12,

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:13.667
12 units or whatever units
of measurement we're using.

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:17.501
Let's say that this side right over here,

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.181
this side right over here, has length c,

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.292
and that happens to be equal to nine.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:27.511
And that we want to figure out the length

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.019
of this side, and this side has length a,

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.200
so we need to figure out what
a is going to be equal to.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.243
Now, we won't be able to figure this out

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:40.147
unless we also know the angle here,

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:44.071
because you could bring the blue side

00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:45.581
and the green side close together,

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:46.718
and then a would be small,

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:49.179
but if this angle was larger
than a would be larger.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.548
So we need to know what
this angle is as well.

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:53.777
So let's say that we know that this angle,

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:55.758
which we will call theta,

00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:59.548
is equal to 87 degrees.

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.114
So how can we figure out a?

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:04.318
I encourage you to pause this
and try this on your own.

00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:07.848
Well, lucky for us, we
have the Law of Cosines,

00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:10.378
which gives us a way for
determining a third side

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:13.885
if we know two of the sides
and the angle between them.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:18.087
The Law of Cosines tells
us that a squared is going

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:22.661
to be equal b squared plus c squared.

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.355
Now, if we were dealing
with a pure right triangle,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:28.373
if this was 90 degrees, then
a would be the hypotenuse,

00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:30.579
and we would be done, this would
be the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.344
But the Law of Cosines
gives us an adjustment

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.618
to the Pythagorean Theorem,
so that we can do this

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:36.477
for any arbitrary angle.

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:38.868
So Law of Cosines tell
us a squared is going

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:40.470
to be b squared plus c squared,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.116
minus two times bc,

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:53.031
times the cosine of theta.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.882
And this theta is the angle that opens up

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:02.273
to the side that we care about.

00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:05.199
So we can use theta because
we're looking for a.

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.847
If they gave us another
angle right over here,

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:08.450
that's not the angle that we would use.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.609
We care about the angle that opens up

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.535
into the side that we
are going to solve for.

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:14.951
So now let's solve for a,

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:17.434
because we know what bc
and theta actually are.

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:23.031
So a squared is going to
be equal to b squared...

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.512
so it's going to be equal to 144,

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:31.669
plus c squared which is 81, so plus 81,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.802
minus two times b times c.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:37.914
So, it's minus two,
I'll just write it out.

00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:42.675
Minus two times 12 times nine,

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:49.268
times the cosine of 87 degrees.

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.076
And this is going to be equal to,

00:02:56.216 --> 00:03:00.647
let's see, this is 225 minus,

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.178
let's see, 12 times nine is 108.

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.801
108 times two is 216.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.306
Minus 216 times the cosine of 87 degrees.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:13.951
Now, let's get our calculator out

00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.204
in order to approximate this.

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:16.783
And remember, this is a squared.

00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:18.270
Actually, before I get my calculator out,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.408
let's just solve for a.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.473
So a is just going to be
the square root of this.

00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:24.818
So a is going to be equal
to the square root...

00:03:26.098 --> 00:03:28.533
of all of this business, which
I can just copy and paste.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.250
It's going to be equal to
the square root of that.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.012
So let me copy and paste it.

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:36.171
So a is going to be equal
to the square root of that,

00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:39.074
which we can now use the
calculator to figure out.

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:40.770
Let me increase this radical a little bit,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.047
so that we make sure we're
taking the square root

00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:43.208
of this whole thing.

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:44.903
So let me get my calculator out.

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:49.244
So I want to find that square root of 220.

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:50.985
Actually, before I do that,
let me just make sure I'm

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:53.609
in degree mode, and I am in degree mode.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.952
Because we're evaluating a
trig function in degrees here.

00:03:58.502 --> 00:03:59.878
So that's fine, so let me exit.

00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:04.842
So it's going to be 225 minus 216,

00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:08.465
times cosine

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.015
of 87 degrees.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.511
Not 88 degrees, 87 degrees.

00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.040
And we deserve a drumroll now.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.624
This is going to be 14.61,

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:22.564
or 14.618.

00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:24.492
If, say, we wanted to
round to the nearest tenth,

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:25.769
just to get an approximation,

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.277
it would be approximately 14.6.

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:31.398
So a is approximately equal

00:04:31.398 --> 00:04:36.168
to 14.6, whatever units we're using long.
