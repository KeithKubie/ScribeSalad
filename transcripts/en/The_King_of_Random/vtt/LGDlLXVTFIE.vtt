00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
What's up guys we are casting metal PokeBalls today

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.780
So this is a true story

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.980
I was trying to find my mini metal foundry

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.980
And it just disapeared, I checked my sideshed

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.600
I checked my workspace, and it was gone.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.040
I was about to make a new one and last night it finally hit me

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.100
You know what I did with it? I stuck a plant in it

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100
And turned it back into a plant pot

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.500
And I know that's what it's original purpose in design

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.440
But it was kind of funny that I lost track of it

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
OK, so let's jump right in you remember in the last video

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.340
We took wax PokeBalls and incapsulated them with

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.320
Plaster and paras, and then I baked those in the oven

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.080
To melt the wax and leave a cavity where we could

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.080
molten aluminum. So, next item of buisness

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.620
Let's get back to the stove, pull out our plaster molds

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620
And see if we can cook up some molten aluminum

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.160
today. Woo! these things are toasty warm

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.900
And the cool thing is these are completely hollow aswell.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.280
All the wax that was in there melted and dripped out

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.160
Upside down, and I removed that wax, and I let them cook overnight

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.220
At about 325 degrees Fahrenheit, so

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.080
Most of the moisture is cooked out now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.500
And these things are nice and warm which is really good

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
But I do have a little bit of a concern though

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.320
In a previous video, I tried making a plaster mold of

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.240
Han Solo, and poured in molten copper, and the heat of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260
Was enough to vaporize materials in the plaster

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Which left bubbles and pockmarks all over

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.140
The final casting. Will it turn out with a reasonable result?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.460
I have no idea, this is entirely experimental

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.140
So, you're seeing this the first time, as I do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920
And if any of you are experienced metal workers, and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.620
Know of a better way to do this, please let me know

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.620
Cuz I'm here for the experience and education aswell

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.620
They're really warm, and starting to burn my hands

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620
So let's go whip up a batch of molten aluminum

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.760
Pour these molds and see if they actually work

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.440
Now, this is a brand new clay graphite crucible

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440
And technically you're supposed to run it through

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.440
a cycle of warming up, and cooling down, or there's

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.800
A chance it could split, but I'm not really that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Patient, so let's just throw this thing in, fire it up

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.480
And hope it survives.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.960
OK, so for aluminum scraps here I got some of my

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.800
mini metal biscuits. I've also got this old aluminum

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.980
Master sword, it's a little bit bent and wonky

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.740
So, we're gonna melt that back down, and use it to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740
To make some PokeBalls today.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740
Right on, time to fire it up

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.840
So I just got this out of the oven it's extremely hot

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.340
But, I'm still expecting the molten metal will probably

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.400
Crack the plaster, it's just what it does

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400
But it's completely cleaned out now,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
So, let's set this thing down and pour some metal in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
OK, this thing is molten

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400
Don't wanna spill it that would be very, very bad

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.720
Still lighting on fire

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.980
Ya, that plaster is still burning, I was wondering if it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.480
Gonna do that

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
So, I'm wondering if that's gonna cause imperfections

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.620
to the metal

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.620
I'm hoping that has a chance to settle down

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.620
Before it cures

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.620
Maybe we can get a little bit more in there

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.020
That was a pretty good pour, I have to say:

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.020
I'm pretty impressed with myself for not spilling

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.680
Even though I cooked these things overnight at

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.960
350 degrees, you can see the plaster is still

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.960
releasing flamable gases

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960
So, I obviously didn't cook it all off

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.960
And we're getting a nice big crack here as the metal

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.360
Starts to cool, but I do have my fingers crossed

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.900
I'm hopeful that we're gonna get something good here

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.480
Got a crack around the side of my crucible so we're

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.480
going to have to do this quickly

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Oh no I'm out of aluminum!

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.760
No! That's not good!

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Oh no it just broke in half!

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.400
You got to be kidding me! There's 40 bucks down the drain

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.340
We're just gonna salvage as much of this as we can

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.140
Another cool design of the mini metal foundry

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.140
I should have done that earlier though

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.820
That thing has cooled down to much for too long

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.820
K, so update guys, this is why you follow directions

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.380
The crucible maker told me I needed to warm it up

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.720
And cool it down, or it may crack

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720
I was expecting to have some little cracks, I wasn't

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.480
expecting it to break in half, holy heck

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.020
And that may have cost us one of my PokeBall castings

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020
So check it out guys we've let these things sit for

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020
About an hour, they should be nice and cold now

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.480
And you can see, the plaster has stopped burning

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.040
And it's left a nice black residue everywhere

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.180
And surprisingly this metal is very warm to the touch

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.880
Not so much down here, but up here is still really warm

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.920
Unfortunately, I cracked my crucible, and lost half of the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.080
Aluminum before I could get this poured

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.220
I think the mold is full but I'm actually not

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.420
Sure what to expect, I am curious to get inside this

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.220
And see how it turned out, so let's take these bad boys

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.280
Grab a hammer smash 'em open, and see what we got

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.660
It took so much work to make these plaster molds

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.660
And now we have to smash them open

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.780
They are one time use, you only get one shot

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.780
So you're seeing this for the first time as I do

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.780
This thing filled up completely with aluminum

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.260
The only way to get our medal mold out now is to smash it with a hammer

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.520
Let's get to it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.420
One shot! Check that out

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.120
Oh my goodness, you know what?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.120
That kinda worked out

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
The first thing I noticed is that the cracks and crevices

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.740
Are all full of plaster, but I'm thinking if we just took

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.100
Something like a screwdriver we could probavbly chisel those out

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.060
Even after an hour to an hour and a half of cooling down

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
This thing ss still ridiculously hot

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.440
Oh, and just as a point of interest there's a point of my hand where the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.280
Liquid nitrogen burned me 2 weeks ago,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.020
Randomly, out of nowhere it started blistering

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.020
This thing seems to be in pretty good condition

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.420
There was a little bit of shrinkage here apparently

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.420
When the aluminum cooled down, so we don't have a perfect

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.860
Sphere unfortunately, but the rest of it looks to

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.440
Be in pretty good shape

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440
We got one solid PokeBall

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.760
Now, I'm excited to see the second mold here

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.140
Either we have a solid PokeBall, or we have

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.000
Two halves that are joined together

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.460
But did they fuse together, or will they fall apart?

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.460
I guess it's time to find out

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.140
Sweet

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.760
Look at that

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480
It almost looks the the technodrome

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480
If you're a ninja turtle fan from the 80's

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480
Got like the eye on the technodrome there

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.480
This stuff is so brittle I can probably just pull it

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Apart with my hands

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.920
Well, look at that

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.020
So what did we get here?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.020
So far it's actually looking pretty good

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440
Every screw we cast, we get air bubbles trapped in the top

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.300
I'm not sure how to avoid that

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.300
So, you actually see the seem where the two medals

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.300
Join together, this first pour went up to here

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.500
And then the second pour joined in there

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500
Let's see if we can get these things cleaned up a little bit

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.000
Shall we?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
There we go, I'm gonna use a little wire brush here

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.340
Oh yeah, look at the way that just falls away

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.820
It actually looks pretty sweet

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.420
These things might cleanup relatively nice

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.680
O-ooohhh

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.740
I'm starting to see potential here guys

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.780
So here's the difference at 30 seconds of the wire brush

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.480
It's already pretty dramatic

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.160
It looks like it turned out great

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I kinda like that dirty look to it though

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Just cut off the base, round it off a little bit

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.220
Have ourselves a cool little paperweight

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080
Solid metal PokeBalls

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.740
That's awesome

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.480
So there you have it guys, I'm

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480
Actually super suprised that casting in plaster is a

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.060
viable option

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.060
And I think if we're to take our silicone molds

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.060
And our wax sculptures

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.060
And make them a little bit more perfect

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.060
I think those results would show up on our end product

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.060
What do you wanna see me cast next?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.060
Put your comments and suggestions down below

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.060
Maybe I'll pick one of 'em and uh put it to the test

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.060
In a future video.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.060
Thanks for joining me in this series, it has been

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.060
awesome hanging out with you

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.060
And I will see you in the next video, talk to you then

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.480
Cool! The world's first gummy PokeBall
