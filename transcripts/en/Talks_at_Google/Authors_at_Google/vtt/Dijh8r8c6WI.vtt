00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.435
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.060
PAULO RUFFINO: Yes, thank you.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.500
Thank you for inviting me here.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.939
So this talk is
essentially about the book,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.230
"Future of Gaming: Creative
Interventions in Video Game

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.650
Culture," which is a
summary of a long research.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.600
I started even before
joining academia.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.680
Actually, I started working
as a video journalist

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.940
before doing a PhD
in media studies.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.090
Despite what the
title might suggest,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.640
the book is about anything
but the future of video games.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.020
Actually, it's much more about
the present, or to say better,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.170
it's about how the
future of video games

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.760
is currently being
narrated and presented

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.820
by a variety of actors
and institutions,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660
from gamers, the industry,
game journalists, but also

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.740
political, financial, and
marketing institutions.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.280
If you are familiar
with video game culture,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.250
you probably know
that game culture

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.330
is almost obsessed with
narrating and talking

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.370
about its own future.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.150
Game magazines, since their
inception around the '80s,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.550
printed game
magazines were already

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.240
having a very extensive
literature about the games

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600
that are expected to be
released in the following months

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.100
or in the following year.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.130
So the previews is something
quite specific to kind

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.080
of game journalism.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940
It's usually articles
written based

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.920
on press releases by game
publishers, sometimes based

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.360
on just a few screenshots, or
sometimes purely speculations.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.520
Sometimes these games don't
really get released ever,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.820
so this is a very
extensive literature

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.890
about the future
of games, and games

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.370
that sometimes no one
really ever plays.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.880
The industry itself
is almost a frame

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.880
around this obsession with
talking about its own future.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.760
Since 1995, the
game industry has

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.580
its own trade show, the
Electronic Entertainment Expo,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.729
also known as E3, which
typically takes place

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080
around June in Los
Angeles in California.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.990
It's a context where
game publishers present

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.930
their upcoming games, the games
that are going to be released.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.810
It's a very important event
along with other trade shows

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.570
as well, because it
can make the difference

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.400
in terms of how these products
are going to be received.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.490
But it's not just
the game industry

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.030
and gamers that talk about the
future of video games nowadays.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.220
There are also sort of
social political promises

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.784
that are being made
around video games.

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:46.200
You might be familiar with the
work of Jane McGonigal, who

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.070
became famous around 2010
with a famous Ted talk

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.960
where she brought her
vision, and her vision

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.660
is that video games
can save the world.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.560
They're going to fix the world
and solve every problem that we

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.930
currently have from
global warming to the oil

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.790
crisis to anything really.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.860
Her proposal is that
if game design is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.690
so good at attracting
people and involving them

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.040
into solving complex tasks,
then if we can transform

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.540
the problems that we currently
face as on our planet

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.190
into a game, then
a lot of people

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.060
will be engaged with these games
and they will work together

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.040
to save our problems.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780
So in her vision
games are something

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.129
that is going to be important
for the future of humankind,

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.670
they're going to
frame, they're going

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.676
to shape the world
we're going to live in.

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:47.050
They're going to
make us happier.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.930
They're going to make us more
fit, more educated, and so on.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.270
Although Jane McGonigal
doesn't usually explicitly

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.630
talks about gamification, but
that's a very similar approach.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.390
I'm going to talk more explicit
about gamification later on.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.220
Gamification is a
ongoing trend, if you

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.150
like, sort of a technique mostly
by marketing consultants who

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.860
try to promote their vision
on how game design could

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.779
be used to solve
problems, to help people.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.400
So Nike fuel is an example.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.540
Nike has been
developing this app

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.250
that you can use
on your smartphone

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.860
or as a wearable
gadget, and the idea

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.340
is that by setting goals and
quantifying your movement,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.310
you can get better and
kind of improve your life.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.480
So games are seen
as things that can

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.040
make us transform us into
better people, better persons.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.150
So they're good for
our future selves.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.320
In around 2013, Barack
Obama made a series

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.980
of public presentations
where he was explicitly

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.240
talking about video
games as a potential tool

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.350
for the future of education
and the future of health.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.580
He was explicitly
addressing college students,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.510
and telling them that they
should be spending their lives

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.991
and careers into designing
games, better games that

00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:19.990
are not just about shooting
aliens and monsters,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.660
but about educating people.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.150
These presentations usually
these narratives are not just

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.370
presenting games as
something is good for us,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.290
but they also go hand in hand
with financial investments.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.950
So very often, these
narratives about how

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.180
games are going to be
useful for our culture,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.020
they usually are also presented
as good business opportunities.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.075
In the UK, we had
something similar in 2012.

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:54.270
The then British
chancellor, George Osborne,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.510
secured tax breaks
for the game industry

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.430
after a very long negotiation,
and the representative

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.210
of the trade body, TIGA, here
in the UK, Richard Wilson,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.020
reacted positively by
welcoming this announcement,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.790
and saying at the
same time that this

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.190
means that now video
games can be considered

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.310
an important cultural form
next to films and literature

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.940
and so on, and also
that this will bring

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.340
large investments,
which was at the time

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.610
estimated around
188 million pounds.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.280
In the European Union as well,
if you look at the Horizon 2020

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.120
funding scheme, there are
explicit uses of the words

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.240
games and gamification, which
are presented as solutions

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.280
for education, health, for
solving problems essentially,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.750
and also for economic benefits.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.970
Also at the same
time as techniques

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.900
that can be used to size
new business opportunities.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.980
So here games are seen
as a technology that

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.960
can lead us into the future
and also help businesses

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.290
on the same time.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.100
So as you can see, there
are not just investments

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.247
from the side of
people who are already

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:15.330
playing games and making
games, but there are also

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.690
political interests into
gaming, and political interests

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.175
that go next to financial
investments as well.

00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:28.050
We're almost presented
with a narrative where

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.240
it seems that games
need to be supported

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.550
by political and
financial institutions

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.490
in order to unleash their
potential, to become finally

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.340
fulfill what they are
expected to become.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.720
The interest from
political organizations

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.490
to our video games actually
dates much back then

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.970
what we're kind of seeing now.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.370
In a paper by Jennifer Whitson
and Bart Simon published

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:01.220
in 2014, we know the NSA,
the National Security Agency,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.470
here taken in one of the photos
by the artist, Trevor Paglen,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.520
the NSA has been
looking at video games

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.070
as instruments for
massive surveillance

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.730
and political propaganda.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.760
As I'm sure you know,
in December of 2013,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.900
Edward Snowden released
leaked documents from the NSA,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.930
and some of them revealed
that around 2007 and 2008,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.900
the NSA was explicitly
looking at video games

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.830
as technologies for
massive surveillance,

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.400
and there were explicit
directions for security

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.905
agencies on how to
look at games and how

00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:40.575
to use them for these purposes.

00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:42.200
It's quite interesting
actually to look

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.260
at how the NSA was interested
in video games at the time.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.410
Some of their conclusions are
actually surprisingly banal,

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.850
and that's I think what
makes it so interesting.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.140
So they are seen as becoming
more and more popular

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.680
thanks to these new tools of
production that are making game

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.440
design more easily accessible.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.900
They're also popular,
as they were saying,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:12.140
in the 18, 35 years
old male audience,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.610
and they're also
very easily malleable

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.930
for political propaganda.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.080
They can easily use to
influence public opinion.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.270
So from the perspective of many
of these political institutions

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.670
and the NSA in particular,
the future of gaming

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.930
does not look very playful.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.430
OK?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.560
It's actually quite
disheartening.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.700
It's filled with the same forms
of inequalities and injustice

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.850
that is currently
shaping the present.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.520
So video games are becoming
an instrumental medium.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.800
Instrumental for a specific
financial, marketing,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.380
political, and military power.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.040
The crucial aspects in the ways
in which the future of games

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.080
is currently presented
is that there

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.320
is this rhetorical gesture of
speaking the truth, of telling

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.320
the truth about what games
are, what they can do,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.390
and what they're
going to do to us,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.390
and what we can do with them.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.140
Truth is very often presented
through data, numbers, facts,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.580
evidence, statistics
that are presented

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.430
to support and justify
these true vision

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.290
of the future of gaming.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.380
Jane McGonigal, for instance,
uses numbers, a lot of numbers,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.040
to present her
vision of how games

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.250
can make us better people.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.500
She even has an estimate
of how many minutes

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.800
we should play video games
in order to save the world.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.000
The game industry produces
numbers all the time

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.530
through agencies.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.530
They usually produce
statistics and info graphics

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.140
that explain how big it
is and how important it is

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.642
and how relevant it is.

00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:06.850
They're not just saying this.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.980
They're also supporting
this vision with stats,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.730
with numbers.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.350
Now, coming from a humanities
perspective myself,

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.680
my main question when
I look at these numbers

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.660
is, I mean, who cares.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.550
I mean this in a not
rhetorical fashion.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.580
Why there is so much
interest from so many

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.790
different institutions, from
so many different contexts,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.940
and speaking so profoundly about
the potential of video games,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.280
and not just talking
about it as presenting

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.440
a personal perspective,
but presenting this

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.562
as a truthful description
of what games can do

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:50.020
and where they're
going to lead us.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.820
So in the work of
Katherine Hayles where

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.000
she writes about the
metaphors used in the studies

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.340
around artificial intelligence
and artificial life,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.990
she can posed this
quite well in saying

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.550
that even a scientific
truth when it is presented

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.600
as being the same
everywhere and whoever

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.090
says it needs to be
presented by some one,

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.980
needs to be framed by a specific
subject who is, of course,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.580
embodied.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.990
That it is not a transcendental.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.200
So truth, as always, has to
do with power and authority,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.650
and power and
authority that we grant

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.390
to those so that we believe
as being sources of truth.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.464
In this particular
case, the truth

00:12:38.464 --> 00:12:40.380
about the future of video
games is, I believe,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.250
very instrumental.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.914
So these claims about
what video games can do

00:12:44.914 --> 00:12:46.830
and what they're going
to do, they're not just

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.310
presented to be
celebrating the medium,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.480
but they are used to claim
that position of power,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.970
the position of power by a
specific institution that

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.090
claim for themselves
the authority to say

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.580
what our games are going to be.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.990
I have a problem
with that mostly

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.300
because these institutions
are also framing the present.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.400
As their visions
of the future tend

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.680
to be very repetitive
of what we're already

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.730
seeing now, and therefore,
the future of gaming

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.060
from their perspective,
it's quite boring, I think.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.420
So to address this problem,
I've come up with a solution.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:32.050
Well, it's not a solution
really, an alternative,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.205
which I've here defined as
creative game studies, which

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:40.210
is the sort of methodology that
I tried to use in this book.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.120
The creativity of this
method has nothing

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.710
to do with the creativity
of the creative industries,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.910
for instance, which are very
much interested in competition

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.230
between individuals, thus being
very consistent with the now

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.824
liberal ideology.

00:13:55.824 --> 00:13:57.240
The creativity
that the I use here

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.850
is actually in reference to
the work of Henri Bergson,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.500
and the [INAUDIBLE]
interpretation

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.200
of the work of Henri Bergson.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.070
I've presented it through
six keywords, if you like.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:14.940
So it is an approach to
the writing narratives

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.250
around games that
is intuitive rather

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.690
than just being intellectual.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.960
It tries to join in the
duration and the flow of time

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.120
and tries to participate in
the things and the world that

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.730
surround us.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.590
It would be performative
in the sense

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.280
that it acknowledges that
the things that we say

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.080
are not just descriptive
of the world,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.480
but they are world making.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.260
They make the world.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.390
They make things happen.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.790
This is very obvious if
you look, for instance,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.280
at how political and
financial institutions are

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.550
talking about video games.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.680
They're not just
describing the reality.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.400
They're describing it for
the sake of changing it,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.310
of calling for more investments
and more business opportunities

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.210
and so on.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.430
So I take this performative
potential also in my method.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.140
It is ethical in
the sense it tries

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.050
to take into
account what others,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.050
other people, other
games, other narratives,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.380
other ways of approaching video
games and playing with them.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.080
It is anti-authoritarian
in a sense

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.220
it tries to challenge given
structures of discourse,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.310
and tries to approach them
by kind of reframing that

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.040
through different differences.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.940
It is anxious, and
anxiety here is actually

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.620
a key element of this approach
to thinking and writing

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.920
about video games, because
most of these narratives

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.230
around the future of games
are very self-confident.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:43.640
They have a sort of certitude
about what is going to happen.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.130
They present it as something
very clear to them.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:55.260
So I try and get back to a much
more unstable and much more

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.280
problematic way of looking at
the many troubles and problems

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.840
that we're actually kind of
not considering when presenting

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.450
these conflicting narratives.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.480
So in a sense, it's not very
much obsessed with the truth

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.240
around video games, but it's
much more interested about

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.910
the many things that we do not
to know and maybe we cannot

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.850
possibly know about video
games and their players.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.240
So I'm going to give
you two examples that

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.710
are taken from two of a
the chapters of the book,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.295
and one of them it's actually
a very personal story,

00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:35.070
a very kind of intimate story.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.960
The story of a
failed relationship,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.072
of a time I broke up,
maybe it's something

00:16:42.072 --> 00:16:43.280
you're kind of familiar with.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.170
After a two years long
relationship, I had a breakup.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.590
My partner, at the time,
was not another person,

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.300
was my quantified other,
was my quantified self.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.700
So I've been using for a couple
of years the Nike Fuel wearable

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.839
gadget, which is a gadget that
you can wear on your wrist

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.300
and quantifies your
movement on a daily basis

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.109
and gives you indications
on how much you're moving.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.390
So therefore, giving
you encouragements

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:21.130
to move more and be more
fit and be a better person,

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.780
more generally.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.579
So this relationship that was
supposed to be about movement

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.900
was not really going anywhere.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.110
So at some point, I
decided to break up.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.550
So gamification,
Nike Fuel is seen

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.090
as an example of gamification.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.050
If you like, it kind of belongs
to the broader phenomenon

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.740
of the quantified self,
which became popular thanks

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.540
to the pages of Wired magazine.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.090
Gary Wolf, one of the
directors of Wired magazine,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:56.060
is also one of the leaders of
the quantified self movement.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.970
Here it is presented by
also Gary Wolf himself

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.700
as self-knowledge to numbers.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.230
So it's the idea that a
reader than having unreliable

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.330
personal perspectives
and feelings,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.630
we get numbers that are going
to tell us how exactly we are

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.670
and what we can be,
and what we can become.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.170
So we are kind of getting back
to these, right, so this idea

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.770
that the truth about the self
can be said and articulated

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.230
through data, through
numbers, and statistics.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.570
We are also getting back
to that, that other thing,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.600
the surveillance and
self surveillance.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.570
So very often, these
technologies, these gadgets,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.720
are also used to take data
from the individual, while not

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.830
necessarily willingly
accepting to release

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.740
this data to other companies
that are not necessarily those

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.620
that are sold the
original product.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.950
I'm sure you know what
I'm talking about.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.810
So this happens to be
presented to a game aesthetics.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:02.120
So gamification takes the
aesthetics of video games

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.870
to create, to offer
leaderboards, rankings, goals,

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:12.070
and to appropriate some of the
jargon maybe of game design

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:17.810
in order to give us incentives
to get better and improve

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.840
our health.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.080
If you look at the literature
around gamification,

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.980
for instance, the book by
Zichermann and Cunningham,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.340
"Gamification by Design,"
there is one keyword

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:37.370
that is very often used to
define that complex feeling

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.510
of getting attached to your
kind of quantified other

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.560
and that word is engagement.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.560
Now engagement in
gamification means essentially

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.880
getting attached too and
feeling a sort of affect

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.040
towards your scores, the very
idea of improving yourself,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.400
so that you want to keep
playing essentially.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.520
Engagement, as Zichermann
and Cunningham already

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.680
notice in their book, it
also means a special period

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.450
in a romantic relationship
where two people are

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:18.200
kind of promising to each
other to get married,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.560
to have a more
binding relationship.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.480
So I search the
meaning of engagement

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.980
on my favorite search engine,
AskJeeves.com, and engagement

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.760
is a very polysemic word.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.520
It can mean very
different things, right?

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.500
In general, if you
want to summarize

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.870
these different
meanings, it means

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.700
that it's a promise between
two subjects, two things,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.660
to go somewhere, to
do something together,

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.540
and that movement is
supposed to change,

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.841
to have a drastic
change at some point.

00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:57.590
So in the case of a
romantic relationship,

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.570
that would be getting married.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:05.000
In other circumstances, that
promise of a drastic change

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.040
can be different things.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.590
That's probably
the problem that we

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.490
are getting with gamification,
and it's not only me.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.540
Many people at the moment
are quitting, dropping

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.710
their wearable technologies.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.022
There are drops in
sales apparently

00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:25.480
even like Fitbit,
which is supposed

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
to be one of the major producers
of wearable technology.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.390
They're actually experiencing
less gadgets being sold.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.940
Also many users who are
buying these gadgets, usually

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.070
after six months, from what
we know from various sources,

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.440
from buyers, around
six months is the time

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.940
that people stop
using these things.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.460
I guess the problem is that
the kind of engagement that is

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.630
promised there.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.540
It's a promise to go
somewhere, to do something,

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.307
but that something
never really happens.

00:21:58.307 --> 00:22:00.640
So in a sense, it's the problem
that we are seeing here,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.410
it's similar to what
Zeno [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:08.170
more than 2000 years ago,
already conceptualized

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.380
throughout his
philosophical paradoxes.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:23.040
So Zeno, a philosopher, argued
that movement is impossible.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.370
To explain this sort of
counter-intuitive conclusion,

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.490
he was presenting a series
of fictional settings,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.170
fictional narratives to make
us imagine how and why movement

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.060
is not possible.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.910
So one of them is the
famous paradox of Achilles

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.542
and the tortoise who
are engaging in a race.

00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:44.500
Achilles is, of course,
this mythological hero.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.620
He's supposed to be very
fast, very athletic,

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.860
so he's definitely
going to win the race.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.270
But Zeno says, well, if we gave
the tortoise a certain margin

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.450
of advantage, let's
say a few meters,

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.760
by the time Achilles
will have reached

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.180
the tortoise, the tortoise will
have moved slightly farther,

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.670
of course, assuming that they're
moving at constant speeds,

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.860
different, but constant speeds.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.600
So then by the
time Achilles tries

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.100
to reach the
tortoise again, then

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.790
there is again another margin
of advantage for the tortoise,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.470
because the tortoise
keeps moving.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.220
So even though the margin of
distance keeps decreasing,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.600
it's never less than zero.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.980
So it's always
decreasing, but it

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.840
can be divided infinitely, in
infinitely smaller fragments.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.830
So Achilles will never reach
the tortoise according to Zeno.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.960
Thus, reaching the conclusion
that movement is impossible.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.980
So this paradox has been
troubling philosophers

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.920
for centuries, and
among the many solutions

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.830
to it, the one Henri
Bergson, I think

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:54.090
it's one of the most
useful for us here.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.860
So in a sense,
Bergson was saying,

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.850
well, what is Zeno
taking out of this story

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:05.070
is duration, and assuming
that space and movement, space

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.530
and time can be divided
in the same way.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.590
So if we can divide the
space separating Achilles

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.040
and the tortoise in
infinitely smaller fragments,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.620
we cannot divide the movements
that Achilles performs.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:24.714
So that is of a different
kind than the movement

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:25.380
of the tortoise.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.540
So for that reason,
Achilles will definitely

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.140
come to reach the tortoise.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.440
So if space can be divided,
motion cannot be divided

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.640
in the same way.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.700
So getting back to a more
contemporary problem,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.660
getting back to Nike and
Nike Fuel and gamification.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.130
So what happens here is
the movement is divided

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.400
in infinitely smaller fragments,
but this puts the user always

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.666
behind the goal, and
that goal is never

00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:58.790
really going to be reached.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.070
There's never going to be
a finishing line, a moment

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:07.670
of definite victory, let's
say, of radical change

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.360
of the subject.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.010
So the kind of engagement
of this [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:16.550
in gamification is necessarily
freezing the possibility

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.760
of change and movement, because
it is applying the same vision

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.820
that Zeno was
paradoxically presenting

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.360
in the race of Achilles
and the tortoise.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.950
That's why at some
point gamification

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.800
becomes very boring,
and that's why

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.920
we are getting many
people also stop

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.880
using wearable technologies.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.120
Now, of course, this does not
mean that self-tracking is

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.770
stopping, is no longer in use.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.680
Actually, it's more important
and pervasive than ever,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.560
even more than
how it was before.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.850
We know from the study of
Deborah Lupton on self-tracking

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.930
that there are very different
ways in which self-tracking

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.800
can take place, and not all of
them are necessarily voluntary.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.980
So even though maybe
we are seeing a drop

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.140
in the number of
people who decide

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.960
to buy a gadget
for self-tracking,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.410
we are seeing many more
examples of invisible forms

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.220
of self-tracking.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.710
So it's interesting
to see that Nike,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.860
Fitbit, and many other companies
are now spending their energies

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.810
into software rather
than hardware,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.899
things that can be installed
on your smartphone.

00:26:22.899 --> 00:26:24.690
Possibly you're going
to forget about them,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.860
but they were going to
still take your data,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.650
as Apple, for instance, has been
doing with the Health app that

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.440
keeps working in the
background of your iPhone

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:39.260
even though you decide to
delete it from the main screen.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.320
So in short, gamification
is another aspect

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.260
of contemporary game
culture that is often

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:51.140
presented and
advertised as leading us

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:58.300
towards a future better self,
bringing us to the future.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.450
We're told that gamification
will make players better people

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.200
and the world a
better place, but what

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.080
it is doing in the present is
actually much more problematic

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.100
and worrying.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.250
It is using games in
an instrumental fashion

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:16.240
to promote usually consultancies
through digital companies,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.150
often based on the sort
of false impression

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.300
that are applying a sort
of futuristic approach

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.662
to technologies.

00:27:23.662 --> 00:27:25.120
So from this point
of view, I think

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.320
it's Ian Bogost is correct
when he says with reference

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.470
to the philosophical
treaties of Harry Frankfurt,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:38.180
that gamification is bullshit,
because it is spreading

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.850
technologies of
self surveillance

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.690
by using this keyword,
games, in order

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.930
to kind of make it look
like more policing.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.280
But it is effectively
using these technologies

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.460
to spread technologies of
self surveillance, that

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.350
are essentially making
the future much more

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.350
similar to the present
than what we are probably

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.880
willing to accept.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.240
There is also another
event of game culture

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.560
that I write about in my
book, which it similarly

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.742
has to do with the
future, but its also a lot

00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:14.700
to do with the present.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.830
That's the unfortunate campaign
of harassment against women

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.610
in gaming that goes by
the name of Gamergate,

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:32.540
which started
around August 2014.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.180
Many commentators
have seen this to be

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.410
a possible kind of precursor of
the Brexit and Trump campaign,

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.130
because of its use
of social media

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:45.850
and social network to spread
very quickly a massive hate

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.920
campaign.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.140
So Gamergate, to kind of
summarize it in a few words,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:58.180
it's been a campaign started
mostly by male gamers trying

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.500
to attack women.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.460
The idea, because of
the idea that they

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.935
are kind of spreading a
feminist liberal agenda that

00:29:08.935 --> 00:29:12.280
is trying to manipulate
the game industry.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.860
It generated thousands
uncountable number

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:22.220
of memes and ongoing online
conversations, and, of course,

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.980
not everyone who has been
accused by the Gamergate

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.760
campaign was a woman, and most
of them were, in fact, women.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.400
That key question
around Gamergate

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.130
was who is in control
of game culture?

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:38.360
Who is able to say what
games are going to be?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.610
According to gamers, it's them.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:45.860
It's the people who
hone these thing.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.900
So there shouldn't
be other influences

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.085
coming from the outside.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.410
At the highest and
most horrible peak,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.590
Gamergate generated
also life threats

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.920
against game designer
such as Zoe Quinn,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.190
for instance, who was
accused of gaining popularity

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.580
by manipulating
game journalists.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.540
Of course, evidence
of this was not there,

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.690
but it was not needed.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.570
It was essentially
a campaign that

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.450
was using any sort of
even false evidence

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:25.390
to spread very toxic hate
against female game designers,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.930
but also commentators such
as Anita Sarkeesian who

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:33.090
has been curating a YouTube
channel, Feminist Frequency,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.480
where she explicitly
analyzes and announces

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.210
games for their
misrepresentation of women.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.030
She has also, of course, being
targeted by the Gamergate.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.770
Of course, this is
not the first time

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.380
that something similar happens,
particularly in game culture.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.980
Game culture is notoriously
in a male dominated

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:59.880
context has been very doing
its best to protect itself

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.030
from influences
from the outside.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.410
It never really happened
to such an extended level.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.330
It never happened
in a way that really

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.220
became a sort of paradigm for
similar hate campaigns that

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.560
happened immediately afterwards.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.540
At some point, it also
involved academia.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.110
That was similarly being seen
as another elite that was

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:26.240
trying to control game culture.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.760
In my research at
the time, I'd been

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.890
reading an uncountable number
of threads and comments left

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.880
on Reddit, on Twitter, and
so on around Gamergate,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.770
and one of them, at some point,
really caught my attention.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.430
It was published on the
10th of March, 2015.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.880
The thread was people are
now claiming that Gamergate

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.650
is killing gaming archiving.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.870
There was this line
that was explicitly

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.290
making a commentary about the
role of academia in relation

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.340
to game culture.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.000
It was saying academia is
like a parasite to gaming

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.620
at the moment.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.750
They produce nothing.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.840
They just try to make
money and favors,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.360
prestige off other
people's work usually

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.110
by trying to shred it through
a bias perspective that is not

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.350
real application in real life.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.090
The thing is that
I don't necessarily

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.320
disagree with this comment.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.740
So I think the tone is,
of course, something

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.410
I don't agree with, but
the concept actually I

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.980
think it's a good description
of what I do, for instance.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.340
So I don't really produce
anything tangible,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.800
if not maybe those printed
books that you are holding now.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.620
I don't really produce anything
tangible in that sense.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.450
I do definitely use
other people's ideas,

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.460
unless you believe in
the myth of originality,

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.810
there is no escape from this.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:57.510
I'm biased.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.810
If that means having an
opinion, I'm definitely biased.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.189
I don't think that my work
has evident applications

00:33:04.189 --> 00:33:04.730
in real life.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.550
Although, the work
of academics might

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.820
have applications
in real life that

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.270
might inspire other people.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.784
I don't think I really
am here to make money.

00:33:15.784 --> 00:33:17.700
I would be doing something
else, but let's say

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.570
that I kind of like this general
description of what I'm doing.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.360
I particularly like
the word parasite.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.420
I think it's an excellent
description of what I do.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.210
So probably the author of
this comment didn't know that,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.270
but the parasite is
actually a concept

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.500
that has been used
in philosophy,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.340
particularly in the philosophy
of Michel Serres, who

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:44.310
in 1982, we have the English
publication of "The Parasite,"

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:49.260
which is trying to
reevaluate this character,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.000
the parasitical organism
as a metaphor for noise

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.010
and interruptions in
communications systems.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.440
As the author of
the introduction

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.930
of the English version
says, the parasite

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.810
is a microbe, an
insidious infection

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.679
that takes without giving,
and weakens without killing,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.870
and the parasite
is also a guest who

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.110
exchanges his thought,
praise, and flattery for food.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:20.179
The parasite is also the noise
is the static in a system

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.960
or of interference in a channel.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.750
It is the outcome of evolution
in the production of change

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.280
in its relation.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.719
Now in English, we also have
the word symbiotic systems

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:33.239
where organisms
are not necessarily

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.480
exploiting the organism,
but they're actually

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.900
contributing to its life,
but if we take parasite

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.620
as a general word
to identify organism

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.670
that live in depending
on other organisms,

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.550
I think we do have
an excellent metaphor

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.350
for the academic at least.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.340
The parasite is both
host and the guest.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.585
It is at the margins.

00:35:02.585 --> 00:35:04.940
It is at the boundaries.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.370
It is never fully an
insider, but is never

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.080
completely an outsider.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.320
In a sense, everyone
is in a sense.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.390
We're not really
ever a literal kind

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.870
of closed circle of game
culture that you're either in

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.120
or you're out.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.370
They're always partly
contributing to it,

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.850
exploiting it, taking
something, and giving something.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:31.910
So the Gamergate, I think, could
be much more of interesting

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:38.000
be re-interpreted if we look
at this figure of the parasite.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.660
The ways in which Gamergate
has been denounced immediately

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:48.350
after it started, and actually
a very explicit accusations

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.970
about gamers, and I fully, of
course, agree with the ways

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.410
in which, for instance, of Dan
Golding and Leigh Alexander

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.690
in August 2014 framed
their accusation of what

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.320
was happening at the time.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.400
Their claim was essentially
that gamers are dead,

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.950
that this category of the main
game consumer is no longer.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.600
Our reality is no longer the
majority of game culture.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.740
So it's entitlement to speak
is just a reaction to it

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.110
before its completely
disappeared.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.480
Now while I do agree with
the idea of defending those

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.510
who had been attacked
by Gamergate,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:31.130
something that I find
is likely disagree

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.390
with the ways in which this
defense had been presented,

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.880
because it is essentially
re-using the same argument that

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.500
has been used in these
perspectives that

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.020
try to have a truthful
description of what game

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.400
culture it.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.370
It is not a
coincidence, I think,

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.630
that these articles were using
a lot of statistics and numbers

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.850
to explain game consumers and
how game consumers really are.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.090
So from these statistics,
we know that now women

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.346
are maybe the majority, maybe
its no longer just that 18,

00:37:06.346 --> 00:37:09.320
35 male consumers
that the NSA was

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.870
so interested in manipulating.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.920
It's more and more people
and more diverse people.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.450
I mean, fair enough, but, of
course, this is not the reason

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.630
why we should be
defending others

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.500
from being part of game culture.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.340
It's not that being
a majority or being

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.790
a minority gives you
or takes out from you

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.790
the entitlement to speak.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:42.130
So there is no need, I think,
to support this with numbers.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.760
So in a sense I think
what is the problem here

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.790
is that from
different sides there

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.560
was an approach
to this story that

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.890
was trying to speak for
the sake of being right,

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.770
to explain how
things really are.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.510
We can talk about it in
different ways, I think.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.994
So one of the kind of
dualism and categories

00:38:03.994 --> 00:38:05.410
that I've been
trying to introduce

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.080
in these stories on
Gamergate is to talk

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.400
maybe less about
people, including women,

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.140
who are in game culture,
and talking more about women

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.900
and games, or different
kinds of people

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.450
and how they approach
games in different ways

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.170
from different perspectives.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.000
So being in game culture as kind
of assumes that there is an in

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.950
and out, there is
a gatekeeper that

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.080
has the legitimacy
and the authority

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.930
to decide who is part of it
and who is not part of it.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.070
I don't think that game culture,
or any culture or subculture,

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.650
for that matter, really
works in that way

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.870
or should be
working in that way.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.600
So there should be no one
that grants for themselves

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.450
the legitimacy to say
who is entitled to speak

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.220
and who is not
entitled to speak.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.460
Unless, of course,
their speech is

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.270
trying to prevent
other people's freedom.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.790
Talking about women and
games, for instance,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.210
allows us to look from
a better perspective

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.560
at some of the things that
are currently happening.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.370
So just to mention one example,
the work of Anna Anthropy,

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.140
I think it's quite brilliant.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.340
As a woman who is working with
games and making her own games,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.560
she's also working on archival
of games and game material

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.830
that kind of presents a
different history of game

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.600
culture.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.910
She's not seeking legitimacy
to be part of the official,

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.370
so to speak, of game culture.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.380
She's writing her own history.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.630
She's doing her own games.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.940
She's playing with game
culture in her own way,

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:42.360
and approaching it as a prolific
parasite by taking and giving

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.700
and reshaping game
culture in her own way.

00:39:48.926 --> 00:39:50.300
I also agree with
the perspective

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.190
of [INAUDIBLE] who is
sort of a historian,

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.610
was looking at how women
have been presented

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.440
in the history of
games and how come

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.210
they've been so absent in
the official accounts of game

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.580
culture so far.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.650
Of course, it's not that
women were not present

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.860
and just happened at some point.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.400
This is definitely not the case.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.230
There have been moments when
they have been constructed

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:19.940
as a subject by others
mostly who have been framing

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.930
this character of the
woman in game culture

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.410
according to criteria that were
maybe not necessarily those

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.950
that these subjects really
wanted to be represented with.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:41.270
A couple of years ago, I gave
a presentation on game culture

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.470
at a conference, the DiGRA
conference in Scotland,

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.870
and then one year
later in 2017, I

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.550
found that the abstract
of my talk was on Reddit.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.480
It was presentation when I
was talking about this Reddit

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.560
comments, I was going
back into Reddit.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.674
My abstract was taken on this
social justice warrior thread

00:41:02.674 --> 00:41:04.090
by, and, of course,
they were kind

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.670
of attacking my and
accusing me of trying

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:14.050
to reshape game culture from
the perspective of an academic.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:18.100
So there is one
comment actually I

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.830
found to be quite significant.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.160
One of the Reddit
user was saying

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.030
gamers don't want to give
their biological organisms

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.200
new shapes.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.700
So they were responding to
my idea of the parasite.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.290
I think that's, again, another
effective summary of what

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.670
I was trying to say.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.700
That's precisely the problem.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.780
Biological organisms
change shape

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.790
even if they don't want to.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.820
There are always processes
of change and modification

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.040
that happen in time.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.370
Trying to freeze that
shape is precisely

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.740
the sort of
authoritarian gesture

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.920
that has been
underlying Gamergate,

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.420
but also other attempts
to truthfully describe

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.300
the future of gaming and what
it is and what is going to be.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.830
There are numerous, I
mean, there is a multitude

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.690
of parasites in game culture.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.330
There are many in betweeners
and examples of people

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:26.140
who are in between different
aspects of game culture

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.860
and reshape it in different
ways from different capacities,

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.950
even as I'm doing right
now with this talk, which

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.390
is describing game culture,
but also becoming part of it

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.820
in a sense.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.540
There are multiple attempts
from different subjects

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.480
at the moment to claim
how the future of gaming

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.930
should be and must be
like, but there are also

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.750
countless parasitical
organisms that

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:57.030
are reshaping these narratives
of temporal progression.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.540
In my book, I also look at
many other events and phenomena

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.380
of game culture, including the
hacking of Playstation network,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:09.210
the unburial of E.T. Atari's
E.T. the extra-terrestrial,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.160
and the phenomenon
of independent gaming

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.330
to look at different ways in
which gamers and non-gamers

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:20.190
relate with video games and
become passionate about games

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.260
sometimes in an
obsessive manner,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.290
how they claim for themselves
the freedom and right

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:30.270
to change video games and
game consoles, different ways

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.670
of relating to games
and game culture,

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.050
and of writing
different histories,

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:40.300
different imaginations
about the past, present,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.420
and future of video games.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.080
So in conclusion, that's
the sort of contribution

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.860
that I am trying to bring
mythological and philosophical

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:55.530
tool to look at how players
and games change in time,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:00.870
the potential of new narratives
in framing alternative visions

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.670
or what games can
do, and what we

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.450
can do with games, to look
at the many others that

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.740
are involved in these stories,
to challenge the existing

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.670
categories that are currently
framing the present of game

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.840
culture, but also to challenge
the reassuring and calm

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:28.240
narratives that give us a safe
perspective of data analysis.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.360
I try to replace these stories
with something much more

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.450
unstable and much more anxious.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.150
I think that the interesting
thing about game culture

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:41.120
and game studies is
that it is apparently

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.117
a sort of trivial medium.

00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:44.950
It is supposed to be
for mere entertainment,

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.460
but there are many
ways to play with it

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.070
and to play with game culture by
writing alternative narratives

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:55.920
and introducing new troubles
in a cultural sector

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.190
that maybe we consider
to be simply playful.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.280
There are many different
modes of playing and writing

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.410
about the past, present,
and future of gaming.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.660
In my contribution
I've been trying

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.830
to present some of them,
some possibilities.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.128
Thank you.

00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:15.548
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:19.550
SPEAKER: Thank you
very much, Paulo.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.700
That was enlightening.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.040
I think we have 13
minutes for questions.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.790
PAULO RUFFINO: OK.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.498
SPEAKER: If you'd like
to ask a question,

00:45:27.498 --> 00:45:32.680
I'll bring the mic over and
we'll get it for the recording.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.840
I've read on the
one side of a book

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.340
that at least this
series of books

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.110
is presented like alternative
to that and to that thinking.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.330
So I think I can talk to you
as a presenter of this idea

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:49.140
as well.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.230
OK, you're saying that we
need some alternative to that,

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:58.090
but first you're
presenting an example.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.340
One example from death
and second example

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.510
from a person who is speculative
by default, a politic.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.950
So you're saying that
he is speculative,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.000
but what do you expect?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.860
He is a politic.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.880
He is a president.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.180
Second, what I
actually wanted to ask,

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.850
you're saying about
engagement, engagement period

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.440
with some fitness
devices and so on,

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:29.740
and that people are not OK with
this [INAUDIBLE] and so on,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.940
but don't you connect it just
with usual attention speech,

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.370
motivation speech, because do
you see a lot of people who

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:42.390
are trying to go to
their goal six months

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:46.300
and they're all without
motivational and so on.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.970
Like, OK, I'm using this device
to achieve some of my goals,

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.480
because I'm using Nike Plus
to prepare for half marathon,

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.210
but I understand that
after run in half marathon,

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:06.100
I will drop it, because I don't
want to do it all the time.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:13.540
Why presenting it as these
all people breaking up with,

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.700
how do you say, self
quantification model and so on?

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:24.520
Why not to see maybe there
are other reasons as well?

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.250
The second question,
small question,

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.480
you presented the statistics
about women and men

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.004
on one side.

00:47:32.004 --> 00:47:32.920
PAULO RUFFINO: Mm-hmm.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.280
AUDIENCE: That was bit funny.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.460
A group of women
who are 18 and older

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.070
is bigger than the group of
men who are 18 and younger.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.720
It's a little bit
strange comparison,

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.430
because there's a
different groups

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.150
and that's pretty much,
OK, you have teenagers boy

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.700
and you have adult
women playing,

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.390
so why to compare them?

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.636
PAULO RUFFINO: OK.

00:47:58.636 --> 00:48:02.292
I mean, starting maybe from
your last question and comment.

00:48:02.292 --> 00:48:04.000
Yeah, I think that's
precisely the point.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.520
I mean, OK, I started
researching and writing

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.700
about video games
when I was a teenager,

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.160
so that was like 20 years ago.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.460
Numbers about the supposed
consumers of video games

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.190
have always been
published, always

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.250
been kind of
contradicting themselves.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.620
The thing about these
numbers is that,

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.640
as I was saying before,
I mean, who cares.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.223
I mean, I'm not
necessarily interested

00:48:30.223 --> 00:48:36.340
in what they are telling us
about the current condition

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.770
of game culture, but much more
interested in why they are

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.920
presented in the first place.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.580
So for instance, these
numbers and statistics,

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.050
they're very often used
in an instrumental way.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.080
There are many inconsistencies
that you can probably

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.860
find in these studies,
as is in all studies.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.750
I think that's not the point.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.470
I think what's interesting is
the sort of rhetorical power

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.650
that they have.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.650
So it doesn't really matter
what exactly they're saying

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.230
and how they have been made,
but why they're presented

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.910
by whom and for what purposes.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.700
That's the sort of stuff
I'm interested about.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.230
When you're mentoring about
the people not using wearable

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.240
gadgets and
self-tracking, of course,

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.810
there are uncountable
reasons, which I have no idea

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:30.310
of, but that's, again, what I'm
trying to talk about is this

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:33.610
idea that in the end, there
are so many things that we

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.250
don't know and we cannot
possibly know about gamers

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.230
and the things that
they do with games.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.130
At the same time, there are
many reassuring narratives

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.940
that tell us what
games can do to us.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.660
Gamification I think is an
excellent example of these.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.450
Promoters of gamification
usually sell their apps,

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:55.570
for instance, by giving
a very clear vision

00:49:55.570 --> 00:50:00.197
of the effects of their
technologies and their apps.

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:01.780
Of course, the effects
of these things

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.940
are unpredictable
most of the time.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.970
Sometimes they generate
completely awkward situations,

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.400
or they become
intrusive in your life.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.130
You never know.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:15.040
You also said something
at the very beginning

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.200
about what do I expect
from some of the people

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.630
I presented at the--

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.715
AUDIENCE: I mean,
how are you different

00:50:20.715 --> 00:50:23.440
from that in this case, because
you're a tech alternative.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.390
How you're different from
tech presenting examples

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:31.195
by a person who is
not like really,

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:34.186
how to say, again,
from a president who

00:50:34.186 --> 00:50:37.384
is speculative by default,
from a person who is from tech,

00:50:37.384 --> 00:50:38.852
and from your personal example.

00:50:38.852 --> 00:50:39.352
Yeah.

00:50:39.352 --> 00:50:40.310
How are they different?

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.240
PAULO RUFFINO: Yeah.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.851
Well, I don't consider them
necessarily the alternative

00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:44.350
to tech.

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.120
It's not that.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.250
I think what you
are reading there

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.310
in the presentation
of the series

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:56.290
actually is that we are trying
to, also with this book,

00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:01.840
to have a different way of
thinking about the things

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.470
that we can say
about technologies

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.480
and the technologies that
we use on an everyday basis.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.770
So if that thinking as a sort
of solution is, if you like,

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:15.620
to problems, this
is more for trouble

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.610
making rather than
problem solving.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.670
OK?

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.940
So that's the kind
of difference maybe.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.550
So if we are
presented by thinkers

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:27.850
with very reassuring
narratives about what

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.610
can be done with
technologies, and I

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.850
am trying to invent
a new troubles,

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.280
invent, well, to find
new troubles into things

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.830
that appear to be very safe.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:41.330
OK.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.080
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for the talk.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.460
I was curious.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.130
When do you think the gaming
journalism and academia

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:58.230
is going to, what's
it called, grow up?

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.750
When we talk about dance, we
don't just talk about ballet.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.220
We talk about lots of
different types of dance.

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.845
When we talk about
music, we don't just

00:52:03.845 --> 00:52:08.562
talk about R&amp;B. There's lots of
different genres of R&amp;B, music.

00:52:08.562 --> 00:52:10.770
Go on, sport is not just
football, American football,

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.490
or whatever.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.073
There's lots of
different separations.

00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:15.450
But when people talk about
gaming and journalism,

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.182
they usually assume
that everyone's

00:52:17.182 --> 00:52:19.140
talking about that piece
they're talking about,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.240
that everyone uses the
same term of gaming,

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.329
whether you are a
mobile phone gamer,

00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:24.870
whether you're a
strategy game gamer,

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.165
whether you're a console
gamer, whether you're

00:52:27.165 --> 00:52:30.420
a gamification type gamer.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:35.090
What's your opinion on that
sort of level in journalism?

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.840
PAULO RUFFINO: Yeah,
the problem with game

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.870
journalism, it's an ongoing
problem, if you like.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:44.586
To put it short is that this
sort of self-reflexive moment

00:52:44.586 --> 00:52:45.960
when game journalists
acknowledge

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.650
that much of what they write
tends to be very stupid

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.230
and tends to present
games in a very simplified

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.890
manner as commercial
products for entertainment.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.640
The question has been going
on for a long time is, is it

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.390
possible to talk about
games in a way that

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:04.140
is a bit more mature,
as some people say.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:09.920
The only thing I can say about
it is that this idea of getting

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:15.300
mature, I think it doesn't
really go lead anywhere.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.250
It's not like a
piece of cheese that

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:19.440
needs to be put
there for 30 years,

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.820
and then it becomes mature.

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:21.320
No.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.910
It needs different kinds of
people and different kinds

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.610
of way of approaching games.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.370
There is no reason why
game journalism has not

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:33.670
been looking at film criticism
in the last 20 years.

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:36.390
I mean, there is no
reason why they're not

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.610
looking at art
criticism and the sort

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.250
of concepts and ways of
writing about games that they

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:43.110
are using there.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.170
So there is no justification
from that other

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:50.250
than that they are just fine
with what we got at the moment,

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:55.540
because it works with the sort
of readership that they have.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.635
There are many people who
work on the writing of games

00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:00.980
in much more original ways.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:06.644
That might be a bit less
prominent in the game culture,

00:54:06.644 --> 00:54:07.810
but there are many examples.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.220
It is becoming much more
widespread and a bit more

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.753
interesting than how it
was until a few years ago.

00:54:21.529 --> 00:54:22.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.245
Thank you very
much for the talk.

00:54:24.245 --> 00:54:26.120
I haven't quite figured
out how to articulate

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.139
this as a coherent question,
so please bear with me.

00:54:29.139 --> 00:54:30.680
I was really interested
in your ideas

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.850
around parasitic and
symbiotic relationships

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:39.380
between, pardon me, game
development practitioners.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.300
I'm a game designer, and my
relationship with academics

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.927
and then critics and then fans.

00:54:45.927 --> 00:54:48.260
There's lots of ups and downs
in all those relationships

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.840
I suppose.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.910
In your description
of this person

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.357
criticizing the
role of academics,

00:54:55.357 --> 00:54:57.440
that hasn't been my
experience as a game designer,

00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.620
and I wanted to get some more of
your thoughts on that, I guess.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:03.950
To me, these different
academic perspectives

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.910
being generated by
folks like yourself

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.000
have been invaluable to
me as a game designer

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.700
in terms of informing my
practice and shaping it.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:15.170
So while you may not be
producing a game directly,

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.780
academic study of games
has a huge influence

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.760
on the types of games
that get produced

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.540
in my experience both directly
and other game designers.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.070
I don't think I'm
alone in that regard.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.320
Same with critics, like
Anita Sarkeesian's work

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.530
is incredibly valuable.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.320
I don't see a lot of game
designers wanting less of that.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.380
I mostly see it
coming from, quote

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.140
unquote, "gamers," game fans.

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:44.180
I was just curious as well to
hear your thoughts on that,

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.290
and the other bit that
you mentioned of somebody

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:53.090
criticizing mentioning that,
oh, we're not parasites

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:58.760
because you're trying to have
some shape on what happens with

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.860
the future of games,
whereas we aren't.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.830
I guess, I was interpreting
that as game players.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.470
Game fans aren't trying to do
that, but they clearly are,

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:07.520
right?

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.630
It's like Gamergate is.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.210
It's a conservative
movement in that they're

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:12.920
trying to do all
this gate keeping

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.980
and prevent these
other voices, but that

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.680
is an influence on
the types of they're

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.927
trying to influence
the host organism.

00:56:20.927 --> 00:56:21.510
Quote unquote.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.260
So it just seemed like
a strange argument.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.720
I was curious your thought.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.730
PAULO RUFFINO: No.

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:26.240
Absolutely.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.460
You know, actually, the
point is that everyone

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.910
is a parasite in
one way or another.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:38.300
So even gamers are parasite
in their own way in the sense

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.250
that they are not
like the insiders who

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:44.280
are deciding if the outsiders
can get in or get out,

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.560
but the parasite is
a interesting figure

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.110
because it makes us think
about the many ways in which we

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.630
are always in between.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:56.810
So it is that academics,
gamers, however you

00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:00.366
decide to identify yourself, and
of course these identifications

00:57:00.366 --> 00:57:01.490
are always going to change.

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:03.470
I'm also maybe a
gamer sometimes,

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:04.640
but I'm also an academic.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.477
I can be many different things.

00:57:07.477 --> 00:57:09.560
So looking at instead of
the many ways in which we

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:14.430
are in between different forms
of relating to game culture,

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.630
it's I think a bit
more complex maybe,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:25.310
but it's, I think, a
better way of looking

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:29.710
at how others can contribute
to game culture as well.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.340
We don't necessarily
think in terms

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:36.170
of insiders and outsiders,
or by seeking legitimacy

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:39.800
through market analysis,
market statistics, which

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.880
I don't think it's the point.

00:57:46.264 --> 00:57:48.430
SPEAKER: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.640
AUDIENCE: I actually
want to comment

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.705
as well on I hate studies when
they say we compare people who

00:58:00.705 --> 00:58:05.580
play two hours a day, like
doing gaming two hours a day

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.170
without quantifying
what the gaming is

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.480
and what exactly
they're talking about.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.360
The question is I
just wanted to ask

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.960
have you watched the series
called "Westworld," and is it

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.965
the future of gaming?

00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:18.840
PAULO RUFFINO: Sorry.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.350
"Westworld"?

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:19.975
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:19.975 --> 00:58:22.146
If you haven't seen, then
probably question is not.

00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:23.770
PAULO RUFFINO:
"Westworld," the series?

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:24.395
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:24.395 --> 00:58:25.970
The series.

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:27.470
PAULO RUFFINO: If
that's the future?

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.210
Well, I hope not.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.490
I've seen the first episode.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:34.040
Are you talking about
the television series?

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.480
It's very horrific.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.537
It's terrible.

00:58:36.537 --> 00:58:37.162
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:37.162 --> 00:58:37.830
That's what I'm asking.

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:38.830
PAULO RUFFINO: Why should
that be the future?

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:39.920
I hope is not the future.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:46.720
I hop the future is a bit
more, I mean, less dangerous.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.220
No.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.890
I have no idea what
the future of--

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:52.115
maybe I have no idea
what "Westworld" is them.

00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:52.615
No.

00:58:52.615 --> 00:58:56.330
I don't know what the future
of gaming is going to be,

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:59.550
and that's maybe precisely
what this book is about.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:04.720
SPEAKER: All right.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.410
That's all we have time for.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:06.680
Thank you very much, Paulo.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:06.980
PAULO RUFFINO: Thank you.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.880
Thank you very much.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.930
[APPLAUSE]
