00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.936
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.050
- This next panel is
going to be talking

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.420
about the role of the ocean in
climates, as a climate driver,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.860
and how it's
affected by climates.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.450
Just on a personal
note, after my trip

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.750
to the Marshall Islands,
I became obsessed

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.630
with sea surface temperatures.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.860
So once a week, I would
check the NOAA Sea Surface

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.680
Temperature Anomaly
Plot and post it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.770
onto Facebook, which earned
a lot of funny comments

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.450
from my friends.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.390
But to introduce the
topic and to moderate,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.570
we have Amala Mahadevan,
who was a Radcliffe

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.860
Fellow for a number of years.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.390
She's a senior scientist at
the Woods Hole Oceanographic

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.420
Institute.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.270
And she studies phytoplankton,
but also an interesting twist.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.190
Phytoplankton and the
hydrodynamics of the ocean.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.370
How upwellings and
gyres and vortices

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.334
can affect different organisms.

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:02.750
So it's an interesting
combination

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.930
of fluid dynamics and biology.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.923
So Amala.

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:12.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.470
- So thank you, John.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.190
So in today's panel, we're
very excited here to tell you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.290
a little bit about how the
oceans shape our climate.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.250
And since the early
history of the Earth,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.670
I would say the oceans
really have defined

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.410
the climate on this Earth.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.680
We have seen that the inception
of life, the evolution of life

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.940
happened on the ocean.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.700
But also, the oceans regulate
the atmospheric carbon dioxide

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.010
and oxygen.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.130
And the oceans contain,
for that matter,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.410
a very large percentage
of the Earth's water,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.950
97% of the Earth's
water is in the oceans.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.960
Just about 0.001% of the
water is in the atmosphere,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.820
just to give you an idea.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.500
The oceans contain 98%
of the carbon dioxide,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.520
in dissolved form, of course.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.100
So when we say that
atmospheric carbon dioxide is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.210
going up or going down,
you have to realize

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.770
that there's a lot in
the oceans and the oceans

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.670
have, in the past, regulated
the atmospheric carbon dioxide

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.000
very well.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.930
Whether they can do
that in the future

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.040
is something that
we are still asking.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.540
And the oceans-- you know,
if you think about heat,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.140
where is all the heat, most
of the heat, 90% of the heat,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.730
is in the oceans.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.280
So in many ways, the
oceans define the climate.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.510
The circulation of the
oceans defines the climate.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.550
And about half the primary
production on the Earth

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.930
takes place in the oceans.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.320
And we see that the
oceans are constantly

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.500
in a state of motion.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.610
These ocean currents,
they transport heat

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.470
across the oceans.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.860
They transport salt.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.030
And in the very
fundamental way, the oceans

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.610
are different from
the atmosphere.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.610
One is that they have
enormous heat capacity.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.330
But the atmosphere
is heated from below.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.670
And so the energy of the sun
is what drives the atmosphere.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.150
Whereas the oceans, when
you heat them by the sun,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.045
in fact, it's
stratifies the oceans,

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.890
or it creates a
density contrast,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.890
because warmer
water doesn't sink.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.470
So in fact, you
see that the winds

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.860
are what drive the
ocean to a large extent.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.390
And mixing or
overturning the oceans

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.640
is, in fact, very
difficult, because the sun

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.960
warms the oceans.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.520
So in a nutshell, that
tells you that it's

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.630
difficult to communicate
changes through the oceans.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.990
But the oceans really
support a large part

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.400
of our primary production
on this planet.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.860
And so about half that
primary production

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.360
takes place in the oceans.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.010
And that organic
matter, as we have

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.040
seen in some of the previous
talks, it sinks very gradually.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.940
Some of it get sequestered,
that carbon to the oceans.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.090
So the big perturbation
that we've made,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.750
that humankind has
made, is that we

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.810
have taken out that
organic carbon that's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.750
fossilized for millions
and millions of years.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.050
We have very abruptly brought
it out into the atmosphere.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.480
And we have created
huge changes.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.720
And I have to say that
the ocean has buffered,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.730
is buffering, a
lot of that change

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.029
that we might see because
of those abrupt changes.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.920
A third of the CO2 that we
put out in the atmosphere

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.300
has gone into the oceans.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.410
And when we talk
about global warming,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.120
and if you were to ask,
where is all that heat that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.570
has to do with
global warming, why

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.720
is it that we don't
feel very warm today,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.110
it's because 90% of that
heat is in the oceans.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.310
So I'm really excited today
to have this panel here.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.610
We have here three
oceanographers

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.550
whom I really admire,
whose work I really admire.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.050
Maureen Raymo from the
Lamont-Doherty Earth

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.720
Observatory at Columbia.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.750
And she has worked on the
past climate of the Earth.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.880
And her work has
shown how important it

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.110
is to think about past climates,
and how past climates help

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.195
us understand the changes that
we're going to go through now,

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.810
or we're going
through at present.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.660
That's because we have a very
short observational window

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.760
in these last few decades.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.410
And so understanding past
climate is really important.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.000
And then we have
Rebecca Woodgate,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.490
who is an arctic oceanographer.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.380
And she's done a lot of
observations in the Arctic.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.170
And she's really pushed
our understanding

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.090
of how sea ice and
the oceans interact.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.470
And the big changes that
are occurring in the Arctic,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.300
it's one of the most vulnerable
regions in the oceans because

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.920
of the sea ice and the
interaction with the oceans.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.320
And then we have
Lynne Talley, who

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.890
has been instrumental in
understanding the large scale

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.190
distribution of
temperature, salt,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.360
and the global
circulation of the oceans.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.740
How these things get conveyed
and transported across

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.510
the oceans, what
are the changes?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.850
And she's been
instrumental in some

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.170
of the very big ocean
observing programs

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.440
that have global and
international programs.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.850
And her understanding
of the global oceans

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.420
through those
programs has really

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.640
changed a lot of
our understanding

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.990
as oceanographers.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.526
So it gives me enormous pleasure
to have these three people here

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:09.025
today.

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:12.860
I don't want you to go away
thinking that oceanographers

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.000
are necessarily women, but some
of the best oceanographers are.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.360
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.560
- Well, thank you, Amala.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.570
And thank you for
inviting me to speak here.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.200
I'm very happy to be here.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.480
So let me just
get right into it.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.530
Hopefully, you've had
time to get the joke.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.400
I should also say that
video of the ocean swirling

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400
is one of my favorite
videos in the whole world.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.930
It's called perpetual
ocean if you

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.711
want to pull it up and
watch the whole world.

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.210
OK.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.890
So I've spent most of my career
studying past climate change.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.600
And most of the last five to 10
years studying sea level as it

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.370
relates to the past history
of the polar ice sheets.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.600
And today, there's two
major polar ice sheets.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.740
There's the one in Greenland,
which if you, hypothetically,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.120
could melt it all and
spread it in a single layer

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.080
over the ocean, sea
level would rise

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.210
by about six meters or 20 feet.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.800
And then in the
South Pole, there's

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.877
the West Antarctic
ice sheet over here,

00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:25.210
which again, is about the
same size as the Greenland ice

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.710
sheet.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.570
And then the much larger
East Antarctic ice sheet,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.240
which you have to go
back 40 million years

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.450
to find a time when that
whole ice sheet had melted.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.900
And at that time, sea level
was about 180 feet higher

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.780
than today.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.270
So the question
I'll just pose here

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.420
is, how sensitive
are these ice sheets

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.790
to a modest global warming?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.270
And by modest, I mean,
let's say one degree

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.730
Celsius warmer than today.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.320
I actually know a little
bit about a time period

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.200
that is widely
agreed to have been

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.310
two to three degrees
warmer than pre-industrial,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.780
which would be one to two
degrees warmer than today.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.570
And at that time, geochemists,
using various methods,

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.920
have reconstructed
atmospheric CO2.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.610
It is about 400 PPM,
which I know at least some

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.060
of the people in the room I
recognize know that's exactly

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.020
what it is today.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.720
It's about 401 this week, PPM.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.350
It should be 280 PPM, but
we'll come back to that.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.000
And what I'm showing
here is a site

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.600
on the north coast
of Ellesmere Island,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.380
and an artist's
reconstruction based

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.400
on the fossils, and
plants, and animals,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.909
and pollen that have been
taken out of that dig

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.159
show a reconstruction
of what the north

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.190
coast of Greenland
and Canada looked

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.980
like three million years ago.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.940
The Greenland ice
sheet did not exist.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.680
OK.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.790
So climate is
changing all the time.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.570
Even more recently, there's been
a profound change in climate.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.610
This is 21,000 years
ago, very recently.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.290
And obviously, the
Greenland ice sheet

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.290
has jumped the Davis Strait and
has expanded dramatically down

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.110
over North America
and Fennoscandia.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.330
I don't know if this is a big
Game of Thrones crowd in here,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.790
but if the people that like
it will appreciate this quote.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.260
So that is the height
of the ice sheet

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.360
over Boston at the peak
of the last ice age.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.060
OK.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.430
So that was just a blink
of time ago, obviously.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.400
So why do these changes happen?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.100
The climate system is
infinitely complicated.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.660
And there's no
scientist on our planet

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.600
that can be an expert in every
part of the climate system.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.910
But at the same time,
it's somewhat very simple.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.540
And you can go to the radiation
chapter in a freshman physics

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.590
book and see a very
simple equation

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.290
to calculate the effect of
temperature of the Earth.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.130
We don't need that, but
all you need to know

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.980
is it's very simple.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.480
And the surface
temperature of the Earth

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.140
just adds one more
variable, which

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.740
is the concentration
of greenhouse gases.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.240
And so I like to
think about it when

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.160
I talk to general
audiences, just say, look,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.020
the Earth's climate,
the temperature

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.050
of the Earth-- we're
a ball of rock.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.920
We get heated by this star
that's a distance away-- which

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.720
I don't know-- one light year?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.980
I don't know.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.210
And there's three
variables that control

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.210
the Earth's temperature.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.430
How close we are to
the sun-- and that

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.400
actually varies
subtly through time

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.890
because our orbit isn't
perfectly circular,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.010
and other large planets
perturb our orbit,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.380
like Jupiter and
Saturn, on time scales

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.530
of tens to hundreds of thousands
of years in very predictable

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.960
ways that can be calculated.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.080
And sometimes, over
billions of years,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.820
the solar output of
the sun can change.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.930
But on human time scales,
it's essentially constant,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.430
which is why we call
it solar constant.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.100
So that's one big knob
you can change that can

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.920
control Earth's temperature.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.630
The other is the Earth's
albedo or reflectivity.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.810
If you expand the snow and ice
coverage at high latitudes,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.470
you make the Earth
more reflective.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.060
And so more of the
solar radiation

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.980
is just lost to space.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.150
It's reflected to space.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.840
It's not available for heating.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.670
I'm sure we'll hear a lot more
about that in the Arctic talk.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.300
And then, finally, we have this
thing called greenhouse gases.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.850
And so we have all this
heat coming in from the sun.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.000
It's warming the
Earth's surface.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.080
The Earth's surface is
cooler than the sun,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.070
so it re-radiates outward
at longer wavelengths.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.130
And it just happens to interfere
with the molecular structure

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.840
of certain gases,
especially CO2, which

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.490
can prevent it from escaping.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.250
And then re-radiates
it back to the surface.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.810
So just like throwing more
blankets on on a cold winter

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.570
night.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.330
So these are the three knobs.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.040
And everything I know about
every climate change that

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.010
has happened in
the past-- and this

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.370
I will show you-- can
be explained by just

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.730
changing these three variables.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.158
And I'm going to
show you a model.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.790
This is the climate model with
an ice sheet embedded in it.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.890
And it's the last 400,000 years.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.020
This is a sea level scale.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.880
And this is what the climate
for the last 400 years

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.740
has looked like, just
the only variables

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.536
being our variable
orbit around the sun,

00:12:20.536 --> 00:12:21.910
changes in the
Earth's precession

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.620
and tilt of the Earth's
axis, and the CO2

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.440
changes that we know
occurred from ice cores.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.790
And it actually-- this
is a model result,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.870
but it looks remarkably like
what we know climate did.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.970
Want to see that again?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.850
- Yeah.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.990
- I could watch it all day.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.920
This is a paper we published in
Nature by Ayako Abe-Ouchi, who

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.250
is actually the only
female scientist I've ever

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.580
met in my field from Japan.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.320
So one of the things
you may notice

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.920
is that ice sheets grow
much slower than they

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.190
melt. It's very easy to
melt an ice sheet quickly.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.380
And the reason is
because, as you see,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.980
as it starts to retreat,
the ice sheet has

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.630
depressed the land under it.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.010
And so the ocean can
flow in very quickly

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.160
and destroy that ice sheet from
below as well as from above.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.470
So ice sheets can
melt very quickly

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.880
because they can become
unstable and warm ocean

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.360
can flow under them.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.640
How quickly?

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.940
This is data-- well,
this is the results

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:33.960
of a study of Tahiti
in the Western Pacific.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.990
And what the scientists
did was they went offshore

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.160
and they drilled down.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.260
And they can, with very
precise dating and drilling,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.350
determine the depth below
sea level of the coral

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.360
as it tracked the sea level rise
at the end of the last ice age.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.190
So as the ice sheets are melting
quickly, the seas are rising,

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.300
the coral is keeping up.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.420
It can do that.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.650
And they were able to
determine that as the last ice

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.350
sheet deglaciated,
sea level was rising

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.450
at rates of 40 millimeters per
year, or 12 feet per century.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.460
So keep that number in your
mind as we move forward here.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.840
Right now, sea level's
rising to three millimeters

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.420
per century-- sorry, per year.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.370
Did I say century?

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.490
I meant year.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.530
Three millimeters per year.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.550
But how high was sea
level during some

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.500
of these little periods in the
past that were just slightly

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.750
warmer than today?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.080
This is a question that's
very easy to answer

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.610
and also very
difficult to answer.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.550
It's very easy
because the evidence

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.530
for higher sea levels during the
recent past is all around you.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.820
This is me standing with my
postdoc, Nick [? O'Leary ?].

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.420
This is the modern Ningaloo reef
system in Northwest Australia.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.440
We are standing on a
stranded fossilized reef that

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.110
is probably about 400,000 years
old from a time period that

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.100
was slightly warmer than today.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.940
This is a reef.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.520
This is the fossilized coral.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.400
This is my student Mike
Sandstrom from the Cape ranges

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.740
of Western Australia.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.330
That's from the last
interglacial warm period,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.170
125,000 years ago.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.030
It's a few meters above
present day sea level.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.790
This is from a three
million year old deposit

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.370
in Pliocene, the Pliocene
warm period in Africa.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.920
No coral, but we have fossil
oysters with fossil barnacles

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.610
still on the fossil oysters.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.650
I mean, ooh, you're
at sea level.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.740
But why is it difficult?

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.010
We see this evidence for
high sea levels everywhere.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.860
The major reason
it's difficult is

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.910
because the ocean--
unfortunately, the ocean basin

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.170
is not like this tub.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.200
And you can't just look at
these as like bathtub rings

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.320
from the past.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.500
The continents, the crust of
the sea floor, and the land,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.910
they're constantly in motion.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.020
They're being loaded and
unloaded by ice sheets,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.600
by water.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.190
It's constantly moving.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.510
So it's quite a
challenging problem.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.900
And there's a fantastic
group here at Harvard

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.590
led by Jerry Mitrovica
that's been working on this.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.820
And many clever
scientists around the room

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.650
have made huge progress in
unraveling these challenges

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.700
over the last five to 10 years.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.970
So I'll jump right to
a summary slide, which

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.460
is in a paper we published
in Science last year.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.340
And so here's-- and this is
kind of a complicated slide,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.750
but it's really cool too.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.390
So here's a CO2 scale.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.120
There's pre-industrial CO2.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.050
Here's present day CO2.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.840
And here's a sea level scale.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.040
And here's today's ice volume.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.130
One degree warmer than
pre-industrial right now.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.350
Here's 125,000 years ago.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.970
The CO2 was the same
during that warm period,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.760
but we were just so
slightly closer to the sun,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.730
it was warmer.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.250
It was about one degree warmer.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.740
A smidge because of the
precession of the Earth varied.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.186
And all these different
studies as to-- the estimate

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.560
of all these
different studies is

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.710
that sea level is six to nine
meters higher than today.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.460
OK?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.010
And this is a window of time
that's 10,000 years long.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.030
400,000 years ago, it
was a little bit warmer,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.170
six to 13 meters best estimate.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.099
And then in the
Pliocene, it's been

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.890
so long, the continents
have moved so much,

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.780
we have a very hard time.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.540
Huge error bars.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.240
We don't really know.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.520
But two to three degrees warmer,
higher CO2, 400, same as today.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.120
And I wish I could tell you
more exactly what sea level was

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.740
at that time.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.411
I can't.

00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:35.910
OK.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.160
So you know, this is
6 meters, 20 feet.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.629
Let's take it back to just
four feet, which is completely

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.170
within the realm of
what could happen

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.230
by the end of this century.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.420
I'm perfectly comfortable
with this as a prediction.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.270
And I'm sure there are
others that are as well.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.810
So four feet above present.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.620
Five million people live
within four feet of sea level

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.780
in the US today.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.110
It's a huge amount in
Florida, obviously.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.170
And in terms of our national
infrastructure, energy

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.420
facilities, ports,
Naval bases, there's

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:17.510
a huge amount of real estate
that is in this zone of risk.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.920
Obviously, sea level
rise is not just

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.270
a problem of the United States.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.250
It's a global problem.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.910
And we may be hearing more about
the Marshall Islands later too.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.580
Does anyone recognize
this capital city?

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.035
It's Mali.

00:18:35.035 --> 00:18:36.410
It's the capital
of the Maldives.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.570
And so you have
over 300,000 people

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.870
living on an island that's
a meter and a half above sea

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.670
level.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.080
And this is just one of
like thousands and thousands

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.930
of inhabited islands
around the world.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.500
And when you hear the
expression climate refugees,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.610
this is what-- these
are people just like us

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.040
that you're hearing about.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.780
OK?

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.650
So I'm going to basically leave
two more possibly depressing

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.560
thoughts about sea level rise.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.650
And that is, first of all,
I think a lot of people

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.120
have this vague idea they'll
be able to deal with it,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.870
like keep it back.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.440
I don't believe that's
very realistic, just based

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.380
on my observations of
various places I love.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.610
And the other thing that's
really important, I think,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.860
for people to come to grips
with and tell themselves

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.510
is that sea level rise is
irreversible on the time

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.426
scale of centuries.

00:19:28.426 --> 00:19:31.990
You could probably cool
the Earth's atmosphere

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.390
easier than you can
regrow an ice sheet.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.270
So every year, the
increment of water

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.950
that's going in from the
melting of polar ice sheets

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.270
and the thermal expansion
of sea water, that's

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.030
an increment of sea
level rise that there,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.550
and that we're going to have
to deal with for centuries

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.690
to come.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.350
So to wrap that up,
what I know for sure,

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.020
climate is changing
naturally all the time.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.810
Small variations,
very small variations

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.460
in incoming solar radiation,
albedo, reflectivity,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.940
and greenhouse
gas concentrations

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:09.010
can lead to large and
sometimes rapid changes.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.010
The activities of
seven billion people

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.260
are capable of causing
effects of this magnitude.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.270
And here is the CO2,
carbon dioxide, record

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.050
of the last 10,000 years.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.410
The Holocene, the
warm window of time

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:29.110
within which human culture,
agriculture flourished.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.850
It was about 270
parts per million.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.950
A subtle rise starts
about 5,000 years ago.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.910
Many scientists believe this
is due to early agricultural

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.400
and deforestation.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.770
And then here, this
interval right here,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.520
blown up right here, here's
the 18th century, the beginning

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.150
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.110
And this rise is
the addition of CO2

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.170
to the atmosphere from the
combustion of fossil fuels.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.960
And obviously, this
is out of date.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.180
We're already over 400 PPM.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.350
I have another video here.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.010
There it is.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.980
So this is what that CO2 has
done in a very nice visual.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.520
We humans have cranked the knob.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.580
They've taken the
CO2 dial and they've

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.040
turned it hard to
the right, very hard.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.890
This is a surface
temperature anomaly

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.230
map based on instrumental
data from around the world.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.616
Want to see that one again?

00:21:30.616 --> 00:21:31.568
- Yeah.

00:21:31.568 --> 00:21:34.430
- Yeah?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.820
It's cool.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.760
So what you're
looking at is the mean

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.460
is defined as 1951 to 1980.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.520
And so what you're looking
at is every surface anomaly

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.820
relative to that mean.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.955
So the beginning is generally
lower than the mean.

00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:52.270
And as you see, when
you get towards the end,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.765
you're generally
hotter than the mean.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.170
In partnership with that
warming atmosphere, heat

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.630
penetrating the ice sheets,
heat penetrating the ocean,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.830
causing thermal
expansion of the oceans

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.510
and melting of the ice sheets,
sea level has been rising.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.680
These are various
different studies

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.310
based on different techniques,
including tide gauges.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.231
And they're in more disagreement
the further back in time

00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:23.730
you go.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.340
But I think what everybody
is in agreement about is

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.000
that sea level is rising and
the rate is accelerating.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.460
This is from a post-doc at
Harvard, Carling [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.660
And just to take this
time window, 1900 to 2000,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.370
and put it on a time scale of
the last 2,000 years-- right?

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.800
It's all about
perspective, right?

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.924
Here's that same curve.

00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:50.090
You would put it right here.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.390
So natural variability,
the rise in sea

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.110
level due to two
human-induced global warming.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.920
So what is the-- I'll
just wrap up here.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.600
One more slide.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.490
What is the
atmospheric CO2 and sea

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.060
level likely to do over
the coming century?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.210
And of course, it's not
just the next 100 years.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.490
It's many hundreds of
years into the future.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.270
This is not a
scientific question

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.000
that scientists can answer.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.620
This is a question that's going
to be completely dependent

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.550
on the individual and
collective actions of citizens

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.460
and their governments.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.480
But I will say that
if you look at this,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.730
here is our current
CO2 emission rates.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.800
And what this is
showing is these

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.810
are the paths that, as a planet,
we have to choose to be on.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.380
Can we turn around
global CO2 emission rates

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.930
quickly or is it
going to take longer?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.400
And the point to make here
is even if you turned it

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.340
around today, you're
still putting CO2

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.930
into the atmosphere.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.410
Much of it's going into
the ocean, but most of it

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.410
stays in the atmosphere.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.140
And it will stay there
for hundreds of years.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.090
So even if you turned
it around today,

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.870
you're committing
yourself to CO2 levels up

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.740
around 500 parts per million.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.500
Every decade you put it
off, you commit yourself

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.050
to higher and higher sea
levels down the road.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:10.810
So as someone who knows
what these changes in CO2

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:17.081
have done in the past, this
would be of great concern.

00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:17.580
OK.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.730
So I'll just thank
you for listening.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.642
And happy to take
questions later.

00:24:22.642 --> 00:24:26.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.294
- Well, good morning.

00:24:35.294 --> 00:24:36.960
I'm Rebecca Woodgate
from the University

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.990
of Washington, Seattle.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.990
And for the next
20 minutes, I would

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.080
like to take you up to
the top of the world,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.300
peer into the Arctic,
like this polar bear is

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.610
appearing into her Arctic.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.840
In her case, she sees a
submarine come at her.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.840
Something she doesn't
understand, probably.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.810
There's things about the Arctic
we do and do not understand.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.970
This word here, Uggianaqtuq--
it's an Inuit word.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.341
It means "a friend
acting strangely."

00:24:59.341 --> 00:25:01.590
And that's how the Inuit,
who have lived in the Arctic

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.455
now for around 10,000 years,
how they now view the Arctic.

00:25:05.455 --> 00:25:06.830
A system that they
know and love,

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.840
which is behaving in ways
they cannot understand.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.880
Where is the Arctic?

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.520
It falls off a lot of maps.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.140
Here it is at the
top of these maps.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.390
It turns up squashed into
a little layer at the top.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.270
But if you take a globe and you
peer down from the top of it,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.190
you can see there's a
proper ocean up there.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.400
You can twist this map
round because it is usual

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.900
when you're talking
about the Arctic

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.660
to put the country you're
talking in at the bottom.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.850
Lots of countries here.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.560
Lots of countries vying
for owning the Arctic.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.210
This picture-- anyone
know this picture?

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.210
This is the Russians
putting their flag

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.240
at the North Pole, three miles
down under the ocean, in 2007,

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.284
saying it's theirs.

00:25:46.284 --> 00:25:47.700
We're not going
to go there today,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.887
but there's interesting
debates about that.

00:25:50.887 --> 00:25:53.220
Give you an idea of scale,
this is relative to something

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.600
I hope you recognize.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.050
It's bigger than the US.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.180
If you want some numbers,
here's some numbers on it.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.510
It's the smallest of the
world's five major oceans.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.590
But it's famous in
many, many ways,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.550
even before the changes of
recent days, for frozen ships,

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:12.380
for passageways, for the hunt
for the North Pole, et cetera.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.410
Perhaps of the most poignant
is the Northwest Passage,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.850
which is this route between
the Atlantic Ocean, which

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.080
is down here, and the Arctic.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.940
The search for the
Northwest Passage.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.960
And let's start there.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.810
Let's start with some
recent Arctic ships.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:29.877
Can anyone tell me what this is?

00:26:29.877 --> 00:26:33.012
This is the wreck
of the HMS Terror.

00:26:33.012 --> 00:26:37.400
This was a ship which set
sail from England in 1850,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.780
1845, looking for the
Northwest Passage.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.820
The Franklin Expedition, the
lost Franklin Expedition.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.080
It's not a happy story.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.720
They overwintered three
years in the archipelago

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.470
trying to find a way through.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.600
After more than one and a
half years struck in the ice,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.180
they left the ship trying to
walk South and none of them

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.266
survived.

00:26:57.266 --> 00:26:59.390
And since then, we've been
looking for those ships.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.750
We found those ships
in the last year.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.560
I say we-- this is Parks Canada.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.510
The Canadians put a lot
of effort into doing this.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.010
This is the ship
on happier days.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.010
Some years before this, 1836,
getting stuck in the sea ice

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.910
was an occupational
hazard of being an Arctic

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.580
explorer in those days.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.470
So another ship in
the news this summer.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.170
Anyone know this one?

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.280
This is the Crystal Serenity,
a luxury cruise liner,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.930
1,000 passengers, 700
crew, which had just

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.300
gone through the same fabled
Northwest Passage in three

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.840
weeks, stopping
in villages which

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.950
have a population
less than a third

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.800
of the number of
people on the ship.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.990
Contrast these, the
Franklin's Expedition.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.670
Here they are.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.947
This is as far as they got.

00:27:43.947 --> 00:27:46.030
This is where, basically,
the whole crew perished.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.560
Nobody came home.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.130
And the Crystal
Serenity, which has

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.370
gone through in a nice
planned trip for three weeks,

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.860
come out in New York.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.000
What's the difference?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.030
The difference
between this is ice.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.960
Let's talk about ice.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.690
So if I take sea
water and freeze it,

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.190
I start to get very
little crystals.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.010
They float up to the
surface of the ocean.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.620
They form a kind
of an oily layer

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.590
on the top of the ocean, which
gradually pushes together

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.931
to form a sheet of ice.

00:28:13.931 --> 00:28:14.430
OK.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.927
This has some resilience.

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:17.510
I wouldn't walk on
this at this stage,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.676
but it will push together
and you can see the edges.

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:22.960
You can see here the
striations of the layers

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.960
push against each other.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.090
Let it go a bit further
and these layers

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.400
form into more sheets.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.150
If you're a penguin,
you can walk on this.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.530
No, there are no
penguins in the Arctic.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.080
As these sheets come together,
we call this pancake ice.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.670
People at sea will think
of a lot of things.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.450
And they get thicker and come
together over a period a few

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.520
more days to make
into ice floes.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.080
Ice floes can be several yards
to a mile to several miles

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.580
across.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.621
I don't know how you got
here, but this gives you

00:28:51.621 --> 00:28:52.820
an idea of scale.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.430
This is the first time that
I would walk on this stuff.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.090
This is about one
to two meters thick.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.230
So here to here thick.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.837
This is first year ice,
will form over season.

00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:04.420
Here's a ship plowing
through the ice.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.440
As it goes through, it
pushes the ice up on edge

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.871
so you can see how thick the
ice is from here to here.

00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:13.120
This is not how we get the
thickest ice in the Arctic.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.520
If you just let it grow
over more than one year,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.030
it would grow to three
meters, not quite reach that.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.095
Nine feet tall.

00:29:20.095 --> 00:29:22.470
But what makes it really thick
is as those pieces of ice,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.010
those floes of ice push
together, they ridge,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.910
just like a mountain
range will ridge.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.180
And this is what makes our
thickest pieces of ice.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.030
I've put here a picture from
one of the pretty buildings

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.590
from my university.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.080
90 feet tall is this tower.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.550
And that is a not atypical
height for a ridge

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.570
that you'd get in the Arctic.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:44.340
Just like an iceberg, there's
more below than above.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.720
So if we have this chap
standing here beside the ice,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.790
and we measure how far
above the water he would be

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.380
and how far below
the keel, you're

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.970
looking about an ice keel about
the height of that building.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.370
So these are common
sizes of thicknesses

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.890
of ice in the Arctic.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.730
Now, while this is
pushing together here,

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.637
it's coming apart
somewhere else.

00:30:03.637 --> 00:30:05.220
And this gives us
what is called leads

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.330
in the ice, cracks in the ice
which can appear overnight.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.190
Very, very quickly.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.770
Sometimes in
inconvenient places.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.324
This is a current hazard
of Arctic exploration,

00:30:14.324 --> 00:30:16.240
as you might get a lead
come through your camp

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.330
in the middle of the night,
with interesting consequences.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.500
Didn't fall in, we
don't really mind.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.437
I prefer to work off
ships for that reason.

00:30:25.437 --> 00:30:26.770
And you can see some ships here.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.540
Here the ship is giving
the scale of the ice floes.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.544
As the summer carries
on, the sun melts,

00:30:32.544 --> 00:30:34.210
the snow on the top
of the ice gives you

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.530
melt ponds in the top of the
ice, which will eventually

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.060
decay the ice away.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.560
It is a habitat
for life, is ice.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.730
We have our
charismatic megafauna.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.810
And we have our, perhaps, not
so charismatic tiny fauna.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.140
This little brown striations
you see here, that's not mud

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.810
and that's not
paint off the ship.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.800
That is actually little
microbial community plankton

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.659
which are growing in
the channels of ice.

00:30:57.659 --> 00:30:58.700
You can do this yourself.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.690
Go home, take some salty
water, chuck it in the freezer.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.076
And tomorrow morning, put
drops of food coloring in it

00:31:04.076 --> 00:31:05.450
and you can see
the channels that

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.560
go through the sea ice
which are channels for life.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.330
It's also home for people.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.040
The Inuit have
made their history

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.500
in the Arctic for 10,000 years.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.112
And to them, ice
is not a hindrance.

00:31:17.112 --> 00:31:18.570
Ice is their way
of getting around.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.370
Ice is their highway.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.140
So where are we today?

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.200
This is almost
today's sea ice there.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.320
This is a satellite image.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.880
Greenland's here.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.960
The colors give you
the ice concentration.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.590
These dark areas are water.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.510
You can see the sea
ice now building up

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.700
from it's expanding as
the winter has started

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.070
in the North, expanding
back out to the coasts

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.530
and down into the
lower latitudes.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.260
That's a snapshot of today.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.610
It's a large seasonal
cycle in the sea ice.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.540
This again, satellite data.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.430
We're over here,
again, now showing

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.180
the maximum extent in winter and
the minimum extent in summer.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.390
Occur March and
September respectively.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.780
Large seasonal
change, of course,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.926
because the sun comes
up and melts the ice.

00:32:01.926 --> 00:32:04.090
Well, how does this year
compare with the past?

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.960
We have this satellite
data back to 1979.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.840
And I pulled out
the years which have

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.140
the maximums in the seasons and
the minimums in the seasons.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.800
And to make it a
bit easier to see,

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.120
I'm going to change it
now to sea ice extent.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.170
And this pink line
in both of these maps

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.030
shows the monthly median
edge from '81 to 2010.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.820
So what we thought was standard
for most of our satellite

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.010
record.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.340
So in the winters, you know,
we're kind of close to that.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.540
Getting a few changes.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.230
But the summers, we're seeing
this very dramatic loss

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.930
of sea ice.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.740
Let's put those on time scales.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.080
Here we have the whole
time series we have,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.752
and the trend line through that.

00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:42.710
And it's not very much.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.880
It's a few percent per decade.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.030
This is the winter.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.470
But in the summer, we're getting
a very much greater change,

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.450
13% per decade.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:51.950
OK.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.415
That's we're losing--
13% of the ice per decade

00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:55.540
we're losing in the Arctic.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.295
To look at where we're
losing it, in the winter,

00:33:01.295 --> 00:33:02.670
we're losing it
around the edges.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.560
In the summer, we're
losing it in the middle.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.510
We'll come back to these
patterns in a moment.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.090
So we're losing ice area?

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.030
Oh, yeah.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.030
The area that we've lost
so far is about a third

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.190
of the area of the US.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.620
And we've probably
lost about 50%

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.850
of the old summer sea ice
extent, from about the 1980s.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.350
It's not just that
that we've lost.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.880
We've also thinned the ice.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.380
So it's harder to
put this together.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.530
We put together from submarines
and satellite images.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.920
But this gives you an
idea, in the 1980s--

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.250
this is winter and summer-- we
had about three meters of ice.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.711
And now, in more recent era,
we're down to about half that.

00:33:38.711 --> 00:33:41.210
This satellite picture's showing
you how that's distributed.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.474
There's lots of statistics
that have to go into this.

00:33:43.474 --> 00:33:44.890
But this is confirmed
by everybody

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.764
who goes up there, the
people who live there,

00:33:46.764 --> 00:33:48.640
who talk about--
saying we no longer get

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.740
the strong, thick
ice we used to have.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.700
We only have feeble,
weak, young ice.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.180
So you can say sea ice is thin
from very roughly about 50%.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.020
Put that together, we've
lost extent, we've thinned.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.580
We end up with a loss of volume.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.038
This is our best estimate to
try and put that all together,

00:34:06.038 --> 00:34:11.130
which is a model, and which
says we have lost basically 30%.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.350
No, we've not lost 30%,
we only have 30% left

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.460
of the summer ice
that used to have.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:16.960
OK?

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.340
Some people will say
this is a quarter,

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.631
but it's around that magnitude.

00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:21.980
So there's a huge change
we've seen in the Arctic

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.969
in the last decades.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.559
How did we get here?

00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:27.214
Polar bear.

00:34:27.214 --> 00:34:28.880
We're always going
to have a polar bear.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.570
How did he get there either?

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.350
So we got there in many ways.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.582
Things that we understand
and things that we don't.

00:34:36.582 --> 00:34:40.370
We understand now how
well the ice moves.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:45.100
So if we put a pole in
the ice at the North Pole,

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.139
the floe drifts around
and the ice moves with it.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.790
To be more useful
in that, we can

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.870
put in a set of
instruments which

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.739
will tell you their position.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.320
So dates rolling
in the corner here.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.940
White is the satellite
sea ice extent

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.704
going from the
summer to the winter

00:35:02.704 --> 00:35:03.870
to the summer to the winter.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.810
And the little red
dots are buoys that

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.110
have been put on the ice
and register their position.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.500
You see they go around in a
kind of circle around here.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.990
Some of them run down the
edge of Greenland like this.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.406
This is how the
sea ice is moving.

00:35:14.406 --> 00:35:16.697
They're just sat on the sea ice.

00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:18.530
They jiggle around
together because the wind

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.750
is forcing them.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.010
And we can see this pattern
of a circulation there,

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.290
and then ice coming around here
and coming out down this way.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.380
And as we come to the 2000s,
we see the summer extent

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.280
getting less every year.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.620
And we can see this melting
back to this incredible ice

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.690
melt in 2007, which really was
something that nobody expected

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.270
or saw coming.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.940
So from that data, we can
go on and say, well, we

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.400
can see how this is moving.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.590
We can tell how old the ice is.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.510
And this is a similar movie
where the colors are now

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.190
the age of the ice.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.130
So white is now
greater than 10 years,

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.170
and these bluer colors are more
recent, younger ice than that.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.130
It's the same buoys
as you saw before.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.400
We're seeing here in the
1980s, most of the Arctic

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.710
was covered by old ice.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.886
But changes in the
wind have changed that.

00:36:06.886 --> 00:36:08.260
We've taken all
this area of ice,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.070
then managed to flush
it out down here

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.820
through to the Atlantic Ocean.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.030
And over this time period,
we're losing the older ice

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.840
in the Arctic and
coming back to just

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.190
having a very much younger,
newer ice in the Arctic Ocean.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.410
We've flushed the
old stuff all away.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.044
To see the before and after, if
you like, here is the before.

00:36:26.044 --> 00:36:26.710
Lots of old ice.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.070
And here is the new with
very little ice left.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.560
In doing that,
we've flushed away

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.570
the old, thick, resilient ice.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.912
It now moves faster
and it's thinner.

00:36:37.912 --> 00:36:39.370
The other thing
that goes with that

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.840
is that it can also melt easier.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.160
If we look at how
things have changed,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.940
is it just due to this motion?

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.080
No, it's not.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:54.070
This is a movie of 2000, again
looking at ice and clouds now.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.870
So here's Greenland again.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.280
And you see here the coast of
Alaska around these points.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.760
The big things that
swell past are clouds.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.260
But mostly, what
you see underneath,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.700
this is the ice moving.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.150
Sometimes the wind blows.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.500
You'll see black open up here.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.150
That's open water opening up
along the coast you see here.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.667
You see-- if you
watch this bit, you

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.250
can kind of sense
the motion, which is

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.710
the same motion we saw before.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.270
You see these
massive cracks coming

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.380
across the whole of the Arctic.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.046
Those are the leads
that we talked about

00:37:24.046 --> 00:37:26.920
as the ice pulls apart
driven by winds and currents.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.510
In summer here, the ice starts
to pull back from the coast.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.477
And you can see here the retreat
of the edge, which is faster

00:37:32.477 --> 00:37:33.560
than the speed of the ice.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.351
Basically, as we watch
those through August

00:37:35.351 --> 00:37:39.760
and through September, that
ice just entirely melts away.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.230
OK.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.880
So what causes it to melt?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.530
The main thing is this idea
of an ice albedo feedback.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.390
This is the reflectivity that
was talked about a second ago.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.520
Quite simply, the ice is
shiny and the water is not.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.300
So if sunlight beats on the
ice, it reflects that heat back

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:00.840
to space.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.200
If it beats on open water,
that heat is absorbed

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.790
and we get a feedback.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.370
Let's say we start
with more ocean water.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.410
That water can absorb more heat.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.270
That means it will
get warmer, which

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.560
means it will melt
some more ice, which

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.640
means we have more open
water, which means we

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.210
go round and round this circle.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.770
It's a vicious circle.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.190
A vicious circle of
demise of sea ice.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.870
The technical physical term for
that is a positive feedback.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.610
And so once we can set
this off, the only thing

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.180
that's going to stop this
is by turning off the light.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.060
Winter coming is the only thing
that will stop this feedback.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.350
But we have to set this off.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.472
And to set this
off, what can we do?

00:38:39.472 --> 00:38:40.930
We can blow the
wind off the coast.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.971
But there's a further role
which is bringing heat

00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:45.200
into the Arctic, and
that is the oceans.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.900
This is now a map of the
bathymetry of the Arctic Ocean.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.880
Deep bits of blue about the
size of our local volcano

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.380
in Seattle.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.992
The shallow red bits
are more shallow.

00:38:54.992 --> 00:38:56.450
And there's other
things there that

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.970
give you some idea of scales.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.970
We have an entrance here
to the Atlantic Ocean,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.303
an entrance here to the Pacific.

00:39:01.303 --> 00:39:04.870
And waters flow from both of
those oceans into the Arctic.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.820
Here's the Atlantic water which
comes in, the deep current.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.080
And it likes to put its
hand on the right hand wall

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.330
like a good current should
in the Northern hemisphere,

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.650
because the Earth is spinning.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.650
And it goes around
following slopes and ridges.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:21.100
It goes around very slowly,
a few centimeters per second.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.890
So it'll take eight
hours to go one mile.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.512
So if we send some
water in here,

00:39:24.512 --> 00:39:26.470
depending whether it
takes the short route back

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.570
through here or the longer
loops back through here,

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:33.610
it can take 10, 20, or 30
years to get back out again.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.550
So we send a heat
signal into the Arctic,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.870
that the time it's going to
go around and then come back.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.249
On the other side, the water
comes from the Pacific.

00:39:41.249 --> 00:39:42.790
That's higher up in
the water column.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:43.950
It's also a lot fresher.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.030
It tends to stay with
the top of the ocean.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.200
And it's more driven by
the ice and by the winds.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.060
It moves a lot faster.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.830
It actually covers about
half of the Arctic Ocean

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.800
here, then comes out through
the Canadian archipelago.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.060
So it will only take about
10 years to cross the Arctic.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.990
What both these currents
have in common is

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.682
they bring in heat
to the Arctic Ocean.

00:40:05.682 --> 00:40:07.390
Here's some pictures
off the Fram Strait,

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.200
seeing the heat from the ocean
coming up and melting the ice.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.170
If we look at that
Atlantic layer, [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.110
that we had for that, and
we look at the ice edge,

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.760
we can see here these
tongues of hot water coming

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.910
across Greenland
and the Bering Sea

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.330
here, melting back the ice edge.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.712
Very suggestive
from the patterns

00:40:25.712 --> 00:40:27.670
that the oceans are
bringing in the heat, which

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.570
is melting off the ice.

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.489
And I show you
that as a pattern,

00:40:31.489 --> 00:40:32.530
that we can do the maths.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.730
We've had measurements
in these channels

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.910
at great expense for many years.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.340
We can see that
over these decades,

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.800
the temperature of the
waters have warmed as we

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.049
go through the channel there.

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:45.090
And you can do the maths,
so you can work it out.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.610
But we're just about right
for the numbers, the amount

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.840
of winter ice that we're
losing in this area, which

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.220
is 10% per decade in
this particular area,

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.600
is likely caused by an ocean
warming of 0.3% per decade.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.480
It corresponds to
that map we had

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.210
of where we saw the ice
going away in winter.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.150
We flip over to the
other side of the Arctic,

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.115
the Pacific, here
the water's coming in

00:41:07.115 --> 00:41:08.380
and only warm in the summer.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.080
But we see the same pattern.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.490
We have here the same,
the tongues of water,

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.220
again driven by the topography,
melt back tongues in the ice.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.990
And this is now.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.420
We've got the sun up here.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.350
We can set this off.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.420
And now the ice albedo feedback
can take over and melt back

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.189
the ice.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.730
The other thing that
this water does,

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.727
it ends up deeper
in the Arctic Ocean

00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:28.310
and it can add to
the gradual thinning

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.520
to the ice that is there.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.697
Yet another nail in the coffin
of the poor Arctic sea ice.

00:41:32.697 --> 00:41:34.780
Again, we've had measurements
here for many years.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.490
We can see this heat
flow increasing.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.520
And we can do the
maths, and we can say,

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.680
this is the effect
of these heat flows.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.640
We've got warmer waters
coming in from both sides.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.530
So what is our causes of
recent sea ice retreat?

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.760
The increased heat
from the Pacific,

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.830
increased heat
from the Atlantic.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.860
Warmer atmospheres I
haven't talked about,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.720
but that's coming into this too.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.500
Added on to a
preconditioning, where

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.950
we have flushed this older
ice out of the Arctic.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.550
So all of these
things are conspiring

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.641
to give the Arctic
a really bad day.

00:42:05.641 --> 00:42:06.140
Right?

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.110
We've all had bad
days like this.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:11.080
This is the Arctic's bad day.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.080
Quite how these interplays,
things that we still

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.180
have to put together.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.900
We have so far not
managed to predict

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.640
any of these extreme ice
melt years that we have had.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.830
So what sort of
a hole are we in?

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.630
This guy-- this is how we used
to do Arctic oceanography.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.680
This is one of our technicians
who has chiseled his way down

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.140
through a bit of sea ice.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.690
OK, this is a good
bit of sea ice.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:35.790
Chiseling down so he can
get to the ocean below.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:36.320
OK?

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.420
Digging himself a hole.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.180
The ice albedo feedback is kind
of a killer in all of this.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.200
It comes with the idea
of polar amplification.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.419
We saw that in an earlier
video, though you may not

00:42:48.419 --> 00:42:49.460
have been looking for it.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.900
The poles are going to warm
first, especially the Arctic,

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.760
because we are
losing the albedo.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.620
We're losing the
shininess of the Earth,

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.610
and we're allowing
all that energy

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.150
to absorb into the ocean.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.880
Quite how that is going to play
out as we push those Arctic

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.250
waters into the
rest of the world,

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.280
we haven't quite worked out.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.370
That's more Lynne's
field than mine.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.490
What also comes with
this is a change

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.040
in the atmospheric circulation.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.450
There is a cap of
cold air which sits

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.450
over the Arctic which basically
can get extra wobbles on it.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.820
And those wobbles are thought
to be driven by changes

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.970
in the sea ice extent.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.985
And that gives us the
cold air outbreaks

00:43:26.985 --> 00:43:29.860
and the dumping of snow onto
the East Coast that we've

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.830
seen in recent years.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.400
This is how the Arctic
extends its fingers down

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.610
into mid-latitude weather.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.040
There is also the
impact in the Arctic

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.300
of where the warming
that we're having,

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.112
permafrost thawing, loss of
ice protection from erosion.

00:43:45.112 --> 00:43:46.820
If the ice pulls back
earlier, the storms

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.190
can affect things more.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.150
And we have whole villages
falling into the sea.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.850
Loss of infrastructure
in terms of roads,

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.300
buildings that are
built on permafrost.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.870
Also within the permafrost,
we have a large store

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.310
of methane hydrates.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.690
These are frozen
methane under the sea.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.250
Currently stable,
but as we warm,

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:09.290
we could release that with
potentially huge consequences.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.960
We don't quite know how that
one will play out either.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.780
We also have with
this the opportunities

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.600
which are coming from this--
exploitation of resources

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.380
and Arctic shipping,
which can now talk

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.000
about going across the pole.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.667
And in all of this too,
we think about the peoples

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:26.500
and the governments.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.230
There are people
who live up there,

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.650
who this is their way of life.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.150
And there are the governments
of the world who are clamoring

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.416
to own that piece of the ocean.

00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:36.540
So what have we seen in
our trip around the Arctic?

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.440
We've changed the seasonal
ice extent, how it changes.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.555
How we've thinned the ice.

00:44:40.555 --> 00:44:42.820
If you take just that one
number, take away this.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.690
We're only left
with 30% of the ice

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.260
that we used to have in the
summer just a few decades ago.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.710
We've looked at why that
things might be causing that.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.200
And we've looked at the possible
implications of all of this.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.160
It's a field which, because
of the ramifications,

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.080
these broad ramifications, and
the way the thing interacts,

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.990
we really need not just an
interdisciplinary, but also

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:06.880
a cross-cultural
approach to have

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.170
a responsible and coherent
way of going forward

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.150
into the future.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.990
Thank you.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.050
- OK.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.959
Now for some more good news.

00:45:25.959 --> 00:45:28.713
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:30.501 --> 00:45:31.000
Here we go.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.899
Well, I live in--
I'm from Scripps.

00:45:33.899 --> 00:45:35.440
This is what it
looks like every day.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.212
So up here, I have
to put on a jacket.

00:45:39.935 --> 00:45:44.010
I thought I would go ahead and
put my cartoon, my favorite one

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.220
out in front,
because we've lived

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.560
in kind of a politicized
environment the last two years

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.490
as climate scientists.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.281
And I think it's
ameliorating a little bit.

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:53.370
We're going back to some sanity.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.430
But this is one I've had
in there a long time.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.130
And I'm going to
talk a bit about how

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.600
we get from oceans
to drought, or what

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.980
we can learn about the
water cycle of the planet

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.870
from what we measure
in the ocean.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:12.320
And I actually have a very
brief set of definitions,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.416
because we have-- actually,
speaking from a place of-- I'm

00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:17.800
going to show a lot of results
from the Intergovernmental

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.220
Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.090
I had the great privilege
to be part of it

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.960
the last two reports we put
together the first time.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.860
It had an oceans
chapter two times ago.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.650
And we continued
that with this one.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.108
So I'm going to
show a lot of stuff

00:46:32.108 --> 00:46:36.220
from a particular slant
in the IPCC of how

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.920
the oceans are
changing and how they

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.332
contribute to climate change.

00:46:39.332 --> 00:46:41.540
But first, you want to know
what we're talking about.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.390
So there's climate.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:44.820
And there's climate variability.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.800
We have a lot of that.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.550
And there's El Nino.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.740
Some years are stormy, some
years are not, et cetera.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.880
That's natural.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.340
And we have major natural
climate variability

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.610
on the planet.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.140
And that can be affected
by climate change, which

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.480
is what we drive through
anthropogenic forcing.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.480
And so we're seeing all
kinds of records now.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.810
So I just want to get those
two definitions in place.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.310
It's kind of, well,
[INAUDIBLE] such

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.010
that we have a framework there.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:20.220
These are four major overarching
conclusions from the IPCC.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.580
This is not the oceans part.

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.270
This is the whole thing.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.980
Number one, which Susan Solomon
put forward in the 2007 IPCC

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.700
as the head of the
working Group 1,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.490
warming of the climate
system is unequivocal.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.010
We came home from that
with buttons to wear.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.500
Warming is unequivocal.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.850
Global warming does
not cause ice ages.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.690
That was the second
part of that.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.030
Number two, human influence
on the climate is clear.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:48.390
Number three, continued
greenhouse gas emissions

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.900
will cause further warming.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.340
And number four,
limiting climate change

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.110
requires substantial sustained
reductions of emissions.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.750
So let's look at the Earth.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.000
Is it warming?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.290
We've already seen
this in video.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.950
This is the trend since
1901 up through 2012.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.040
Where it's white is where
there's not enough data.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.570
Mostly it's warming.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:09.530
There it is.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.120
And it's mostly
warming over land,

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.473
but it's warming over the
sea, and that's important.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.947
This is from this wonderful
NASA website, climate.nasa.gov.

00:48:19.947 --> 00:48:22.530
Go on there if you want to put
something on your Facebook page

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.820
there every day from there.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.980
It's great.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.690
There is our graph.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.710
And when you go online,
actually, that red

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.370
dot at the end animates.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:32.330
Boom, boom, boom.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:36.570
It's the hottest ever
measured with direct records

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.700
this past year.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.130
And this year, 2016, was higher.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.710
So there we are.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.640
We're getting warmer.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.580
And they give you a nice number
for how much warmer we are.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.800
It's almost one degree warmer.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.270
It's projected to get warmer.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.650
And there's-- the IPCC has
different ways of going about

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.560
that with business as usual, or
some reductions, or whatever.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.200
So you get from
moderate to extreme.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.910
The one on the left is--
the right, your right,

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.380
is obviously more extreme.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.930
But that's where we're going
if you just burn it all.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.960
And you see the
polar amplification

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:17.360
that Maureen and Rebecca were
talking about due to the ice

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.760
changes in the North.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.774
And you see the ocean in the
South is not doing a lot.

00:49:21.774 --> 00:49:23.190
There's a lot of
ocean down there.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.780
Water has a lot
of heat capacity.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.240
What's creating climate change?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.080
Greenhouse gases mainly.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.640
This is the big
elephant in the room.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.980
And they are the dominant
cause of observed warming.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.520
There's other ways--
very complicated subject,

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.750
but this is the big part of it.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:43.730
And the largest
contribution is CO2.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.487
And this is the Keeling
curve last night, 401.

00:49:47.487 --> 00:49:49.070
We're actually at
the low for the year

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.190
because we're at the end of
the northern hemisphere summer.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.420
This is measured at
the top of Mauna Loa.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.020
Dave Keeling set this
up in the International

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.660
Geophysical Year, 1957.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.110
And with dogged
persistence, kept it going.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.070
And now it's recognized as
our really amazing record.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.060
You see the planet
breathing, and the summertime

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.980
and wintertime,
summertime and wintertime.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.660
And relentlessly going up.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.570
And that's the tail at
the end of the curve

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.310
that Maureen showed.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.130
What happens with
the greenhouse gases?

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.430
We get lots of stuff
happening, bad stuff.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.695
Well, different stuff.

00:50:24.695 --> 00:50:27.040
It depends on whether
it's good or bad.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.220
Warming-- atmosphere and ocean.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.110
We melt the ice.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.680
We melt the ice sheets.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.480
We raise sea level.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.880
We do change the
hydrological cycle.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.850
We're going to change the
patterns of drought and floods.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.330
Not the patterns, but the
strength of drought and floods.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.000
We have more extreme events.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.770
You can't attribute any given
storm to global warming,

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:52.090
but you can attribute years
of changes in extreme events.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:55.900
Ocean acidification is another
important one for the ocean.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.080
So looking at the ocean,
how does the ocean

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.330
participate in each
of these parts of it?

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:04.640
In carbon-- just
one or two slides--

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.870
heat, and ice, just a
little bit, sea level rise,

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.910
and the water cycle.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.010
So a statement from
the IPCC-- the ocean

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:17.920
has absorbed about 30% of the
emitted anthropogenic carbon

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.180
dioxide.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.890
OK, that's an important number.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.810
You put a certain amount of
carbon up in the-- you burn it.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.000
It's coming from fossil--
it's fossil fuel burning.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.040
8% land, 92%
percent fossil fuel.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.370
Fossil fuel burning
into the atmosphere.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:39.400
A third stays up there, a third
goes into fertilizing the land,

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.030
and a third goes into the ocean.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.180
And the ocean is not going
to sit there and soak up

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.830
the next 40%, 50%, 60%.

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.780
This is an equilibrated
sort of system.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.980
And once it's there, it's there.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.720
Maureen showed a nice
graph showing that we're

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.100
in a commitment phase.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.070
You put the CO2
in the atmosphere.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.420
It's not going anywhere.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.120
A third goes into the ocean
of the part that goes up.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.240
How do you get it out?

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.790
Well, you have to stop
burning it to keep it flat.

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:11.170
And then maybe you need
to start removing it.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.910
Here's the other CO2 problem.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:16.230
The ocean is 70% of
the Earth's surface.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.460
That CO2, 30% that
goes into the ocean,

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.890
it's not a garbage dump that
you just put in the backyard.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:25.290
It goes in and it
affects the marine life.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:26.570
So you get acidification.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.006
Carbonic acid is formed when
you dissolve CO2 into water.

00:52:31.006 --> 00:52:33.190
A little bit changes the pH.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:37.410
And that excess acid has
important impacts on organisms.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.770
And there's a pteropod.

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:39.971
They're kind of in danger.

00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:41.470
They have beautiful
movies of them--

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:43.840
I didn't bring any
animations-- flittering around.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.870
The poor pteropods.

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:47.730
Anyway, coral reefs,
et cetera, you

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.820
may read about all these things.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.800
And this is going on now.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.770
And so there are projections
of how the surface

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.690
pH will change in
the ocean, and also

00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:01.340
how the undersaturation,
how much acidification

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.830
is impacting the organisms.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.170
That's it for carbon.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.510
That's an important second
part of the carbon problem,

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.690
if you haven't been kind of
cued into it before though,

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:15.280
that the oceans are affected
by the extra carbon as well.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.910
Now we go to heat.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:17.710
OK.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.420
So you've heard
this number already,

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:26.840
that the excess energy in the
system due to anthropogenic

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.520
forcing.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.790
So this is the excess.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:33.280
Not just the heat, but the
excess is more than 90%

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.180
of what's in there.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.220
So yay, the ocean is
really helping us out.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.530
If that were in the atmosphere,
think of how warm we would be.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.990
And I'll show a graph.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.630
How do we know these things?

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:48.110
So this is where we
get to what I do.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.146
We go out to sea and
make measurements.

00:53:50.146 --> 00:53:51.520
How do we know
where the heat is?

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.710
We measure it.

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.370
This is the latest--
yesterday's, maybe today,

00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:01.790
yesterday-- map of where we
have had ocean temperature

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.510
and salinity profiles
over the last month.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.330
So we have a global network now.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.650
It's been a
phenomenal community,

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.080
international effort.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.810
Technology was invented
at Scripps by Russ Davis.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.640
Dean Roemmich at
Scripps has been

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.900
instrumental in taking
this to the world.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.750
Taking the instruments
to the world.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.140
This is our network
for the ocean.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.770
It's the upper 2,000
meters of the ocean.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:26.700
That is a picture
of a float that we

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.920
were putting out off of a ship
in the Indian Ocean last year.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.400
Here's what you get from it.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.160
Is the ocean
temperature changing?

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.270
Yeah, it is.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.880
This is the change
in heat content

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.240
in the upper part of the
ocean-- 700 meters times three,

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.160
2,000 feet-- since 1950.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.430
Mostly red.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:48.380
Oh, OK.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.120
And then there's a lot of really
interesting structure to it

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.230
that we could spend days
and months discussing.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:55.360
But it's mostly red.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.870
It's pretty patchy,
because we're

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.190
using measurements since 1950.

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.120
So it's ship measurements
in addition to these floats.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.730
And then-- I'm in the middle
of that one-- we go out to sea

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:10.480
and we measure to get the rest
of the ocean to the bottom,

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.580
to see how it's changing
over the decades.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.350
And we make extremely
accurate measurements.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:20.100
And here's a map from Sarah
Purkey and Greg Johnson.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.900
How to make your thesis
become a classic--

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.050
you get 10,000 citations.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.200
This is the map.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.590
This is using our very precise--
very accurate-- not precise

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:34.900
but very accurate
deep measurements

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.120
to look at where the warming is
happening below 4,000 meters.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.950
And you see it's a
very different pattern.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:41.500
This is a big eye opener.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.130
It's very much in the South.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.170
And this is where a deep
water forms around Antarctica

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:47.530
and goes to the bottom.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:49.160
And the balance is changing.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.480
And essentially, the deep water
is changing in properties.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.120
There's less of it.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.950
And that makes the
deep ocean warm.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.800
So we have a lot of
interesting observations,

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.060
a lot of interesting
things to think about.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.500
This is our take home
graph on warming.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.870
There's the title, "Global
warming is ocean warming."

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.262
And there is our-- let's
see, is there a pointer here?

00:56:12.262 --> 00:56:13.220
Yes, there's a pointer.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.820
I'm going to show this.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.410
Here we go.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:21.780
OK, this is the total heat in
the whole system, everything.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.330
So this is not
just anthropogenic.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.550
This is it.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.680
There's some funny units
over here, zettajoules.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.490
This is years since we've had
enough measurements to do this.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.330
There's the total.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:38.310
OK, down here, there's a
little tiny purple line.

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:40.686
That's the atmosphere.

00:56:40.686 --> 00:56:42.310
That's how much the
atmosphere is warm.

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:47.700
So there was huge press
[INAUDIBLE] about the hiatus.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.110
Anybody heard of the
hiatus out there?

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:51.750
There's a lot of skepticism.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.890
Well, the skeptics could say,
oh, the climate's not changing,

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:57.370
because look, it's flat
for the last 10 years.

00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.380
Well, that was flat in
this curve down here.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.100
Is it flat in that one?

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.720
Oh, no.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.750
What is this?

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.400
This is the upper ocean, the
upper 700 meters of the ocean.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.240
This is the deep ocean,
below 700 meters.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.930
You see, this is the
93% we're talking about.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.210
There's bumps and wiggles.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.750
Yes, there's
climate variability,

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:21.050
but there's a relentless
upward swing there.

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.590
And most of the heat is in
the ocean, thank goodness.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:26.550
But it also means
that's what's happening.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.740
When we have these bumps
and wiggles in our surface

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.800
temperature, hiatus, et
cetera, what's happening

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.414
is there's an exchange between
the ocean and the atmosphere.

00:57:35.414 --> 00:57:37.330
And the ocean is sitting
there going, yeah OK,

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.500
let's have a mode.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.750
And let's take up some heat
and change the temperature

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:41.830
at the surface.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:46.260
But the heat in the
whole system is going up.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.720
What's this doing?

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.900
Overall, the heating
of the whole system.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.910
There's the ice.

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:53.490
The Greenland and Antarctic
ice sheets are losing mass.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:55.580
Glaciers are continuing
to shrink worldwide.

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.120
That's not the ocean
so I'm not showing it.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.330
Arctic sea ice, et cetera.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.650
And the Antarctic sea
ice has expanded, which

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.150
is very interesting topic.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.300
And there's workshops
going on about that.

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:10.430
That's attributable
to-- the largest

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.510
extent is in the winter when
there's no ice albedo feedback.

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:15.150
It's dark down there.

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.200
And the wind is blowing stronger
because of global warming.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.730
And the wind pushes the ice out.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:21.900
So the cover is going up.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.180
We've already seen these great
pictures of the Arctic ice.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.910
Here's the ice sheet warming.

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:32.920
This is Greenland, where
it's warming and losing mass.

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.480
There's the mass loss.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.210
This is Antarctica
where it's warming.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:37.294
Here's the mass loss.

00:58:37.294 --> 00:58:38.710
You note it's not
the whole thing.

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.050
So yeah, we're going to be
kind of happy with only--

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:43.840
how many meters was that?

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.340
- Six.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:49.590
- Six meters, as opposed to 180.

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:51.670
Six meters of ice loss.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:53.670
As an oceanographer,
we're interested in this.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:57.470
You've already seen from
Rebecca and from Maureen

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:02.290
how the ocean affects
the ice balance.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:04.510
This is in the Antarctic.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.850
This is the Antarctic ice sheet.

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:11.520
This is the increased ice loss
from the Antarctic ice shelves.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.230
And the ocean is a
part of the culprit.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.300
It's not just the
atmospheric temperature,

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.190
but the ocean is wrapping
warm water coming out

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.140
of the North Atlantic.

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.590
It's spiraling upwards
towards Antarctica.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.370
Guess where it hits
x marks the spot?

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:27.630
Over here.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.840
So this is where it spirals
in very close to Antarctica.

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.710
And we're working
hard on quantifying

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:37.470
that in models, how
much of this ice loss

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:41.230
is due to accelerations of
this pathway of warm water

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:42.410
to the surface.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.240
So you don't see the
third dimension here.

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.810
It's going from 3,000 meters
deep up to 200 meters.

00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:49.970
This is the mean state.

00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.350
This is the way the
ocean is set up.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.360
So this is the
incursion of warm water.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.280
And changes in that,
probably due to winds,

00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.140
may increase this
mass loss over here.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.510
Are the seas rising?

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:04.890
Yes, you've already
seen that they are.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.986
Here's the IPCC summary.

01:00:06.986 --> 01:00:09.360
Rate of sea level rise has
been larger than the mean rate

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.500
during the previous
two millennia.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.050
It's gone up 20 centimeters.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.415
Well, 20 centimeters,
oh, that's not very much.

01:00:17.415 --> 01:00:22.740
You go oh, go home, sleep well.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.060
Who cares?

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.660
Oh, well, with that
20 centimeters also

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.820
comes an increase in the-- and
the more storminess-- storm

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.310
surges go up.

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:33.950
There's a change--
there's actually

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.960
different rates for
different parts of the tide.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.980
That aside, well, let's say--
well, the most important thing

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.630
about that 20 centimeters
is that it's relentless.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.780
So I'll show you
a graph and to--

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.050
First, I want to just
give you a little pedagogy

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.740
here on why sea level goes up.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.730
It goes up for three reasons.

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:57.140
Number one, the ocean
warms so it expands.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.220
OK, that's all that heat there.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.570
Number two, ice sheets,
land-based ice melt.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.580
Not sea ice.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.530
Sea ice is like ice
cubes in your iced tea.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.750
When it melts, your iced
tea doesn't overflow.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.630
But when the ice sheet
melts, it does fill up.

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:15.050
So you're adding water to the
ocean from glaciers and ice

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:15.870
sheets.

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:17.900
So the sea ice melt
doesn't change it,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.320
but the ice sheet
melt, the shelf melting

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.120
and ice sheet melting does.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.360
Those are two big factors.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.630
The third big factor in
the change in sea level

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.760
is rebound over
thousands of years.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.890
You can go on this
wonderful NOAA website

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:34.630
and find information
from all the long tide

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:37.250
gauges around the coastlines.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:41.610
And you'd see a pattern,
mostly up arrows.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.437
And these are from
the tide gauges,

01:01:44.437 --> 01:01:45.520
some of our favorite ones.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.240
The down ones may
be the rebound.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.220
OK, La Jolla.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.510
We just celebrated 100
years of La Jolla records.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:55.980
It's out at the end
of the pier there.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.780
People are out there
every single day

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.270
making manual measurements
of temperature and salinity.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.140
There is an automated
tide gauge out there.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.510
100 years-- is 100
years enough was

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:05.710
the question that was posed.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:07.220
Well, yeah.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.370
Should we stop?

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.300
No.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.460
Don't stop, because
here's the record.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.910
You fit a line through it.

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.150
Relentlessly going up.

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.130
Lots of bumps and wiggles.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.980
And if you only have 20 years,
or you stop, what do you know?

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.610
You've got to keep measuring it.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.950
So this tide gauge goes.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.260
And let's move over to Boston.

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.134
What's going on here?

01:02:26.134 --> 01:02:29.160
Ooh, same answer.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.520
1921, out there in
the Boston Harbor,

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.680
in this kind of very
picturesque corner,

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.350
is the Boston tide gauge
that's been there since 1921,

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:42.910
maintained by the Coast Guard.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:45.890
And the same kind of picture,
bumps and wiggles, and a line

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:48.980
fit through it going
up relentlessly.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.030
You can make a map.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.710
This map doesn't look like
it's going up relentlessly.

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.890
There's places where it's
blue, it's going down.

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:57.230
This is only since 1993.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:00.410
If you went back to these
things and started in 1993,

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.510
you might see sea
level going down.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.500
So you're seeing natural modes
of variability superimposed

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.720
on relentless sea level rise.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.710
So the idea is that
it keeps going up.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.460
Here's the projections.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.840
It should be up by
at least a meter

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.480
by the end of the century.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:16.980
OK.

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:27.760
So last but not least, that sea
level is just going to come up.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.420
What about our rain?

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.240
What about our drought?

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.160
What about the things that
matter to agriculture?

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.720
What about the
things that matter

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.190
to populations in arid areas?

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.690
OK.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.440
So what we're going
to be able to see here

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.260
is that the ocean salinity
is acting as a global rain

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.840
gauge, which is great.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.520
We can actually learn a
lot from ocean measurements

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.490
that we can't from just
rain gauges on land.

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:59.700
What we've found, to summarize
and then go through why,

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.730
is that since the
'50s, where the surface

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:06.880
waters are saltiest,
they've gotten saltier.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.240
Where they're fresher,
they've gotten fresher.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.550
That means we've changed
the amount of evaporation

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.510
and precipitation.

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:16.270
It's doing more of both.

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.810
So places that are evaporating
are evaporating more.

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.500
Places that are raining
are raining more.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.420
And that means that if you
extrapolate that over to land,

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.220
where you have arid regions,
they become more arid.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.280
Where you have wet regions,
they become wetter.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.600
So we have seen over
the ocean enhancement

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.600
of the pattern of evaporation
minus precipitation.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.580
This is some graphs
from land which

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.240
are showing this pattern,
that will show it

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.160
big time with the ocean, that
the dry areas are getting

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.340
drier, the wet areas
are getting wetter.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.512
This is rich get richer, poor
get poorer in terms of water.

01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:57.220
They can only measure
that over the land.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.620
What we do with the ocean,
these are the mean state

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.180
of the ocean.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:03.300
The top plot is the
surface salinity.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.320
Maybe something you've never
looked or thought about before.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.180
Where it's orange, it's high.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.210
Where it's blue, it's low.

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.280
You can see the patterns.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.490
And this bottom plot
is showing evaporation

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:15.000
minus precipitation.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.380
Where it's red is where
there's more evaporation.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.230
Where it's blue is
where there's more rain.

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:22.720
And that matches up pretty
well with the surface salinity

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.250
pattern.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.140
So they're very closely
related to each other.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.620
So the way you
change salinity is

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.020
you add water or
you subtract water,

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.190
because the salt is out there.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:33.260
It's the dilution.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.870
You put in more water,
it will get fresher.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:38.960
You take out the
water, it gets saltier.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.890
So we can stack some plots.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.570
That plot of the evaporation
precipitation is here.

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.480
This is a world
map in the middle.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.610
This is a world map of the
salinity at the sea surface.

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:56.090
And above them-- well, I'll
do the once on top first.

01:05:56.090 --> 01:06:00.790
The one at the top is showing
you the trend in the water

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.564
vapor in the atmosphere.

01:06:02.564 --> 01:06:04.980
OK, the whole thing that drives
all this is the atmosphere

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.770
is warmer, so it can get wetter.

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:09.810
So it's holding more moisture.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:11.860
So it's cranking more
through, because it

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.250
doesn't hold a lot of water.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.720
Most of the water
is in the ocean.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.303
That means it's just picking it
up and dumping it out, picking

01:06:17.303 --> 01:06:18.760
it up and dumping it out.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.929
So the trend in water vapor
globally is to be more.

01:06:21.929 --> 01:06:23.470
There are some places
that are drier.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.320
Mostly it's wetter.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.820
This map that's noisy, because
our data is kind of noisy,

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.340
is the trend in
surface salinity.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.760
And it maps pretty nicely
onto the actual map

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.640
of surface salinity.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.100
So that's when we're saying
that the salty areas are

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.700
getting saltier, the fresh
areas are getting fresher.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.150
In this sort of noi-- we
have uncertainty measurements

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:46.120
on that, this noisy sense.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.100
So surface salinity is
suggesting that globally we're

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.140
having this change
in the pattern.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.340
And then we can
make projections up

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:59.090
to the end of the century using
all these climate models, which

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:02.700
show this pattern of change
in evaporation precipitation.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.740
So the trends look a lot
like the actual situation.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.150
The actual mean state.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:11.125
So where it is evaporative,
it becomes more evaporative.

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.600
So you get dry.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.811
And where it's wet,
you get more floods.

01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:20.310
OK.

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:21.970
So I am behind.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:26.610
I'm going to skip that, just
to summarize and finalize.

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.360
Climate change in the ocean.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.590
Earth is warming now.

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.710
93% of the heat has
gone into the ocean.

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:36.110
Hydrological balance
is shifting now.

01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:38.210
It's strengthening now.

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:40.100
Oceans are acidifying now.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:43.330
Ice sheets are breaking up and
sea level rise is going on.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.840
All of these are
projected to strengthen.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.510
So there is strong evidence
for climate change.

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:51.710
And I think that's all.

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.263
I'll stop there.

01:07:53.263 --> 01:07:56.161
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:04.280
- I would like to
thank the speakers.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.890
And I'll start off with a
few questions to the panel.

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.370
And in the meantime,
we'll have a mic set up,

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:15.010
so if you want to ask
questions, we'll go until 12:15.

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:21.710
So let me start off by asking,
maybe Lynne and Rebecca,

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.640
there's big differences
between the two poles

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.470
and how they work in making
the Earth's climate what it is.

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:33.180
And well, one big difference
is the Arctic is in the ocean

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.910
and Antarctica is a land mass.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:38.790
But there is a circulation
around Antarctica.

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:40.760
Maybe you could throw
some light for us

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.290
as to why the Antarctic
ice sheet is not

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:47.910
melting at the rate
that sea ice is melting.

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:53.010
And during the glacial
interglacial fluctuations,

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:56.130
there was a huge
change in ice volume

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:57.750
in the Northern hemisphere.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:00.620
I believe not as much in
the Southern hemisphere.

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.630
So what are the big
differences there?

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.050
- I think you already said it.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:07.120
It's inside out.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.479
So one is ocean
surrounded by land

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.350
and the other is land
surrounded by ocean.

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:14.460
And that just completely
changes the way

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.649
they respond to the winds.

01:09:15.649 --> 01:09:17.960
Both of them have wind patterns.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.600
The Antarctic sea ice area is
out in the westerly wind bands.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.970
That's like where you live
right here up through Greenland.

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.850
Whereas the Arctic is
the other direction.

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:31.380
There's a lot of pieces of this.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.689
I don't know where to start.

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:40.199
So there's a lot of ocean
in the Southern hemisphere.

01:09:40.199 --> 01:09:42.240
There's a lot of land in
the Northern hemisphere.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.180
That makes it a
different response.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:50.189
There are easterly winds
ringing around the Arctic.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:52.240
And the easterly winds
in the Antarctica

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.390
are right along the coast.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:56.690
And they're really important for
pushing water into the coast.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.930
But the main wind
pushes the ice out

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:02.200
from Antarctica
towards where it melts.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.060
So you have this-- what we're
doing with global warming is

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.330
spinning up those winds.

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:08.960
They're getting stronger because
the contrast in temperature

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.680
are bigger.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.090
There's bigger winds, and
that's pushing ice out farther.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:17.990
So even if the volume and so
forth is a little different,

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:20.240
the extent is getting bigger.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:26.070
There's more-- I think that's
the biggest one on the sea ice.

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:28.300
And the Arctic is just warming.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.310
The Antarctic is only warming
in the west Antarctic area.

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:34.280
- Yes, I'd agree
with that, basically.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.504
I mean, you've got just a
very different geography,

01:10:36.504 --> 01:10:38.170
which allows different
things to happen.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.356
So around Antarctica, we
have the strongest current

01:10:40.356 --> 01:10:41.980
in the world, the
Antarctic circumpolar

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.960
current, which manages
to isolate things down

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.954
into Antarctica.

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:47.370
In the Arctic, we
don't have that.

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:50.710
We have an ocean we can flow
waters into from either side.

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:53.260
The ice in the Arctic is
generally-- it's sea ice.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:53.990
It's thin ice.

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.540
It's some meters thick.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.720
And the Antarctic's a dirty,
great big chunk of land ice

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.300
which is kilometers thick.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.660
So you have a
different whole climate

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.422
associated with those things.

01:11:05.422 --> 01:11:06.880
It's nice to have
two poles, right?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.260
- During the glacial, was
the Antarctic ice sheet

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.340
much thicker?

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.180
- So in North America, the
ice that was over Boston

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.130
was flowing from central
Canada down to here.

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:23.200
In Antarctica, the ice
expanded, but it was only

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.320
able to expand out to the end
of the Arctic ice shelf, which

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.640
was more exposed because of
the sea level drop because

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.340
of the Northern
hemisphere ice sheet.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.720
But then it just falls off
the continent and flows away.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.820
So it really is--
there's no land for it

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.830
to move northward onto.

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:41.200
It's limited by the size
of the Antarctic continent.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.290
- So I have another
question about what

01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:47.250
oceanographers call the
meridional overturning

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.210
circulation.

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:52.110
So the oceans transport heat
from the tropics to the poles.

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.970
And there's been a
lot of papers that

01:11:55.970 --> 01:12:00.070
came out about the strength of
this overturning circulation.

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:03.880
From the paleo literature,
we know that in the past,

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.720
the strength of the
circulation has changed.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.760
And so what is our
current thinking?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.090
If we melt sea ice and we put
all this fresh water up there

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:16.650
at the poles, do we
think that's going

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.490
to change the rate of
deep water formation

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.400
and the overturning rate?

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.340
Do we have any clues
from the past that--

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.150
- Well, you could probably
better speak to the future.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:28.850
- I could speculate.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:30.433
- It's certainly
happened in the past.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:31.440
- That it shutdown?

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.410
- Yeah, major reorganization
of ocean currents.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:35.880
- So maybe you can
tell us what you

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.060
think is happening, or
might happen in the future.

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.360
And then Maureen can tell us--

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.260
- And then somebody
else out there

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.190
can come up with a
very different answer.

01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:45.740
This is pure
speculation in a sense.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.490
Three sides there.

01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:48.910
What really regulates-- OK,
what we're talking about here

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:50.670
is the overturning circulation.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:53.410
You saw that warm water
on Rebecca's slides going

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.350
all the way up into the Arctic.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.470
That is part of the
overturning circulation.

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.320
That water is going
all the way up there,

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.890
and it's getting cold and
sinking, and coming out.

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:05.795
So that's the North Atlantic
part of the overturn.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.960
That progression of
warm water up there

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.690
is important in
keeping passages open.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:20.220
It's part of the Western
European warming.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.630
That part-- OK, that's one part.

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:24.900
And the Southern Ocean
is the other cold part

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:29.530
of the world, is isolated
by the circumpolar current.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.040
And we have a lot
of ice formation

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040
right around Antarctica.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.340
It makes very dense water
that goes to the bottom.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.870
So we have these two sources.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:39.140
We have one northern
hemisphere, high latitude source

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.130
that does not make deep water,
which is the Pacific Ocean.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:47.830
And it's our current experiment
in how salt, or lack of salt,

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:49.960
shuts down overturn.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.050
So the contrast between the
Pacific and the Atlantic

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:56.730
is the Pacific has a lot
of rain and is very fresh,

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.760
and the Atlantic has a lot
of evaporation so it's salty.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.850
So you put these two things
at both ends of your table

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:05.880
and you say, which one wins if
you cool them both to freezing?

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.830
Oh, the salty water will get
dense and the fresh water

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:11.940
will just float on
that salty dense water.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.120
So that's the simple
picture set up

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.810
by [? Stommel ?] and
earlier, a long time ago,

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:18.390
we have these two ends.

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:22.720
And that balance
only changes overall

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.620
when you move the continents.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.740
That's tectonics.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.250
So then the question is,
what's the vigor of those two

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.990
overturns?

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:36.030
The Pacific one is
weak, it's shallow.

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.750
The Atlantic one is
10 times stronger

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.000
and goes to the ocean bottom.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.320
The question is if you
add a lot of fresh water

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.610
from all this melting ice on
top of the North Atlantic,

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:49.220
does it shut that
circulation down, and then

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.660
change the amount of
warm water moving north?

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.390
And so we had hints that
all this fresh water

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:59.900
was starting to weaken
things a decade or two ago.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:03.080
The Northern North Atlantic
was relentlessly freshening.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.680
But it turned around.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.450
And some of us went, ha ha.

01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:08.590
The circulation
finally caught up.

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:12.080
All that extra evaporation
down off of here,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.190
off of the Gulf Stream
over to Europe and Africa,

01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:17.880
the extra evaporation
makes salty water

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.420
that got pulled north and
helped keep that cranking.

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:27.140
So my speculation is that,
yeah, the whole thing warms up.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.220
It becomes more stratified.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.880
You're dumping more
fresh water in the north,

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.120
but you're also pushing
all this salty water in.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.540
So you've got to have a balance.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.123
And I don't know
which way the balance

01:15:38.123 --> 01:15:40.480
will go in the next 100 years.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.000
You need to run a lot
of models to do that.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.684
Maybe some of you have
done that already.

01:15:45.684 --> 01:15:46.350
- OK, thank you.

01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:47.530
I'm going to pass
it to the audience,

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:48.840
because we have
quite some questions.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.830
So please say your name
and introduce yourself.

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:54.815
- My name's John Wigglesworth
and I'm a secondary school

01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:56.490
Earth science teacher.

01:15:56.490 --> 01:16:00.580
And I spent a semester teaching
about oceans and climate.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.360
And I wondered if
you had any thoughts

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.550
on how to give your
message in a way that

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.640
gives young kids some hope.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.660
It's something that I deal
with all the time working

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.940
with eighth graders and
juniors in high school.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.690
And it's a pretty
sobering message.

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:24.620
And how do you do it that
gives people a sense of hope?

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.600
- I'm happy to try
to answer that.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.800
So I'm actually
extremely optimistic,

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.690
even though it's a very
pessimistic message,

01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:35.190
just because I firmly believe
that the limits of-- there

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:41.070
is no limit to human creativity
and our ability to engineer

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:44.050
our way out of this.

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.520
But it has to start
with the acknowledgement

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.570
of the problem and an effort
to reduce CO2 emissions.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:55.600
So I'm not sure,
but I think people

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600
have to be empowered by
knowledge of the problem

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.980
and want to solve it.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.320
- So I would add to that--
I struggle with this too.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.010
I teach a class on the Arctic.

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:06.440
And you come to the end,
you think, how can I

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.130
end on some positive note?

01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:12.500
And I think it's to remember
in that that we do have

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.460
the ability to change this.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:14.960
Right?

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.760
If we go out there
and see, we're

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.384
going to throw all
the money that we're

01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:20.800
putting into making ourselves
rich into solving this problem,

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.010
we can do it.

01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.490
Perhaps the most positive thing
I saw in this was somebody

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.780
said, right, I know
seven technologies that

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.730
could chip away at a
seventh of this problem,

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:31.630
of the CO2 problem.

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:35.362
But we have to teach the
people that this is happening,

01:17:35.362 --> 01:17:37.945
that we have to face up to it,
like we teach people to face up

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:39.084
to problems in life.

01:17:39.084 --> 01:17:40.750
And go in and do it,
and find on the way

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.420
some way of predicting
and mitigating it.

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.370
So it's their future.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:48.930
And I hope we can get them
to grasp it and do something

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:49.430
about it.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:51.650
And not just blame
it all on our watch.

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.290
- And I think
something we can add

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.880
is that there have been other
problems for which there was

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.420
no political will in
the past, but when

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.530
public opinion changed,
political will came about.

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:05.210
So I think there's
hope for that too.

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:06.520
- So take the CFC ban.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.840
We managed to ban CFCs, because
that was a science problem.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.530
So we can do it.

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:15.021
We just have to team
together and actually do it.

01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:15.520
- OK.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.750
So the next question.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.875
We're going to have to be
a little quick because we

01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:19.640
have five minutes.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.020
- I'm Christina Hernandez.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.680
I'm a graduate student
in the MIT/WHOI Joint

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.440
Program in Oceanography.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.610
And I had a question for Rebecca
about sort of ice edge blooms

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:33.390
and the effect of melt
ponds on under ice blooms.

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:37.130
And so I was wondering
if ocean color changes,

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.350
whether those blooms happen
under the ice during melt ponds

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:43.070
or at the edges,
if that contributes

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.840
at all to these positive
feedbacks that melt the ice.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.930
Like do you know anything
about [INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:49.320
- So this is really cool.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.570
So the idea is if you're
going to have a phytoplankton

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:54.410
bloom in the ocean, you need to
have nutrients, stratification,

01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:55.470
and light.

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.530
If we get melt
ponds in the ice, we

01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:00.680
get windows in the ocean
which are allowing light

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.250
to come into under the ice
regions, which we always

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:07.200
thought were devoid of life
until the ice had melted.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.990
We're finding there are
those blooms in some places.

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.932
Quite why, we don't know.

01:19:11.932 --> 01:19:13.390
We think because
of the melt ponds,

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:15.020
have they always been there?

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:15.770
We don't know.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:18.380
What is the feedback then
from that phytoplankton

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.120
trapping more energy
into the ocean?

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.401
Some-- don't quite know.

01:19:23.401 --> 01:19:24.650
We're kind of working on that.

01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.140
Amala and I are working
on that at the minute.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.140
So we can talk off line.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.390
That's really exciting.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.290
- My name is Tim Johnson
and I'm a software engineer.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:35.030
And I have one, I
guess, a futuristic kind

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.600
of question, in that it
sounds like we're heading

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.840
for sort of an alien world.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.380
We don't have to travel
to another planet

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.240
to find an alien world.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.680
We're going to get
one right here.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.340
I met that somebody
was from Kuwait,

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.680
and he said it's 140
degrees Fahrenheit there

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.140
and it's getting hotter.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.900
And to me, that
seems pretty alien.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.270
And it seems to me
that we almost can't

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:54.500
stop what you're describing.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.310
Even if we became much
more politically active

01:19:57.310 --> 01:20:00.181
and the Republicans suddenly
became totally different,

01:20:00.181 --> 01:20:01.930
we're still not going
to change very fast.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:05.040
Even if they changed it
tomorrow, passing legislation,

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.030
changing things.

01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:08.530
And so it seems to me we
have almost a whole new area

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.410
of science of how to
deal with the fact

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:13.320
when the world is going to
change over the next century,

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.120
because it really is.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.290
Is this sort of something
people are thinking about,

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.415
like most businesses are
looking how to make money?

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.010
Like you can have
tours taking you

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:23.720
through the Northwest Passage
which didn't exist before.

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.247
But it seems like a
sort of a big area.

01:20:26.247 --> 01:20:28.455
I suppose it's a way to make
a lot of money for some.

01:20:28.455 --> 01:20:31.460
That may encourage some
Republicans to do it.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.830
- There is a big burgeoning
of renewable energy.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.420
And you can see it
around the world.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:40.600
And Europe is just
going bonk-- it's great.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.470
It's the future.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:45.230
And the US is going that
direction too, slowly.

01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:50.410
There's a whole area of
adaptation and engineering

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:52.570
that is very active.

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:56.430
So encourage your students
to go and work in that.

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:58.440
But don't eliminate
the basic science,

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.170
as the Australian government
did for a brief period

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.280
the last year.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.060
They said oh, we
know the answer.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.010
Climate is changing.

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.460
We don't need you guys anymore.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:10.200
Let's put all our money
into making some money

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.010
on adaptation and engineering.

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:15.700
And there was a big kerfuffle,
because when you have cancer

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.385
you don't stop taking
your temperature

01:21:17.385 --> 01:21:18.760
because you know
you have cancer.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.860
So we have to have
both legs of that.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.510
We don't represent
that end here,

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:28.100
but maybe some other
people can speak to that.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.300
It's very active.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.910
There are some
geoengineering ideas out

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:35.355
there-- scrubbing the
atmosphere, clean up your mess.

01:21:35.355 --> 01:21:36.730
- So if I could
just add to that.

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:40.060
Portugal, I think, ran
entirely on renewable energy

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.590
for a period of time
this last summer.

01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:43.290
OK?

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:44.920
So it can be done.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.600
We just have to decide
we don't just want money,

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.280
we want a world for our
children, as they say.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.462
- OK, thank you very much.

01:21:51.462 --> 01:21:52.670
Thank you all for being here.

01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:53.503
And of course, John.

01:21:53.503 --> 01:21:54.660
- Thanks to the panel.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.139
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:05.290
And I'd also like to take the
opportunity to thank Amala.

01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:08.225
She helped consult as we
were developing this program,

01:22:08.225 --> 01:22:10.450
and was extremely
helpful to shape it.

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:13.750
So you deserve a lot
of credit for this.

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:17.100
