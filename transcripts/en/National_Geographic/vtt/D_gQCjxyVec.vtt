00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.567
NARRATOR: Working out of the
University of Pennsylvania,

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.633
Dr. June has been
developing a new technology

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.000
to leverage the immune
system's T-cells to fight

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.934
and kill leukemia in mice.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:14.799
[squeaking]

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:22.100
CARL JUNE: Yeah.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.300
I have been through
a long journey.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.667
So I was a physician.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.567
And then gradually, I
came to the conclusion

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.500
that I could probably
help more people

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.467
through my scientific
laboratory efforts

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.667
than actually seeing people
one at a time in a clinic.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:40.633
And I tell my family now that
my MD stands for mouse doctor.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.767
NARRATOR: The immune
system protects

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:44.967
you from outside invasion.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.934
If a virus, bacteria, or
fungus slips into your body,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.733
the immune system responds
with a coordinated attack that

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:57.133
kills the invader,
and only the invader,

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.200
leaving your body intact.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.467
[chittering]

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.867
This is a T-cell.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:06.033
This immune cell's job
is to kill infected cells

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.800
before they cause more damage.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.866
In theory, T-cells
can be extraordinarily

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:12.967
potent against leukemia.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.367
But there's one problem.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.133
Since cancer is effectively
part of your own body,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.899
the immune system
sometimes ignores

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.066
these rogue cells, allowing
the cancer to spread unchecked.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.100
June and his team
have worked tirelessly

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.366
to find a way to get
the immune system

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:34.500
to recognize and destroy all of
the cancer cells in the body.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.100
CARL JUNE: The therapy
we're developing

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.366
is multidisciplinary.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.333
It involves leukemia
specialists.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.033
David Porter is known
around the world

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.700
for his treating various
kinds of leukemia.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.500
It involves immunology
expertise, viral vector design

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.233
expertise, and then the cell
culture expertise that Bruce

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:58.066
Levine knows more about
than anyone in the world,

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.700
I'm quite sure.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.433
OK.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:05.232
I'm a professor in
cancer gene therapy.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:08.133
And I direct the
Clinical Cell and Vaccine

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.834
Production Facility.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:14.633
And what we do is to develop,
manufacture, and test

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:18.934
cell and gene therapies to
fight cancer using the patient's

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:23.966
own immune cells that have been
genetically targeted to cancer.

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:24.767
[humming]

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.700
A CAR T-cell is a T-cell
that is genetically

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.433
modified in a way
that allows it to see

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.733
and recognize a cancer cell.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.600
A "CAR" stands for
chimeric antigen receptor.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.367
It's a molecule
that is synthetic.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.033
We can put it into
an immune cell

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:47.899
and genetically
change the immune cell

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.100
to express the CAR molecule.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.000
That function of binding
activates the T-cell.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.734
And it allows it
to become active,

00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:59.967
to become a killer cell,
and to kill the leukemia.

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:01.633
[explosions]

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:02.367
[yelp]

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:04.200
[belch]

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:05.934
