JENNA TAYLOR: We
are obviously super

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.856
excited to have chef J.
Kenji Lopez-Alt with us.

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:14.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.210
Many of you know chef
Lopez-Alt as the managing

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.480
culinary director
of Serious Eats,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.350
or maybe from his
James Beard award

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.920
nominated column "The Food Lab."

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.800
He's an MIT grad.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.750
He's restaurant trained chef.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.460
He is a husband of a Googler.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.380
Good job, us.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.650
And now he is the author of the
new book "The Food Lab Better

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.710
Home Cooking Through Science."

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.050
So Chef-- oh, sorry, Kenji,
my close personal friend.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.410
Welcome to Google.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.900
J. KENJI LOPEZ ALT: Everybody's
lose personal friend.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.400
Thank you.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.310
Thank you.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.570
It's really amazing to be here.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.420
Everybody here is
way smarter than me,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.972
which is really
intimidating, but hopefully I

00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:02.930
think I'm better at
cooking eggs than everybody

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.980
here so that makes me
feel a little better.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.920
JENNA TAYLOR: And you
also have your wife--

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.000
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: And
my wife is here, yeah.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.030
JENNA TAYLOR: You
guys are combined.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.160
J. KENJI LOPEZ
ALT: Moral support.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.390
Yeah.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.240
JENNA TAYLOR: Super smart.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.970
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Yes, she's here.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.700
And she pays my
health insurance, too.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.368
Or Google pays my
health insurance.

00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:15.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.480
JENNA TAYLOR: You're welcome.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.260
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Although, I just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.960
realized if it weren't
for my health insurance,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.320
I would never have
gone to my doctor

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.819
and I would not have found out
that I have high cholesterol.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.850
So basically everybody
here is responsible for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.800
my high cholesterol, I think.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.330
Anyhow, my wife told
me that-- last night I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.360
did an event also the San
Francisco cooking school.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.610
And she told me that the big
mistake I made last night

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.776
was not telling everybody
at the very beginning what

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:42.394
I'm going to be doing for
the rest of the time, rest

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.060
of presentation.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.476
So I'm going to tell everybody
what I'm going to be doing,

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:46.920
which is cooking eggs.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.003
And showing you all the
different things that eggs

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:50.090
can do, not all the
different things,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.173
but some of the different
things that eggs can do,

00:01:52.173 --> 00:01:53.660
because they're amazing.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.867
They come out of
chickens or other birds.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.200
These ones come out of chickens.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.202
Most eggs that we eat
come out of chickens.

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.660
And you can eat
them, but they also

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.820
have these really
unique chemical

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.180
and physical properties that
help us sort of manipulate

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.503
other foods into neat things.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.919
So what we're going
to do today is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.400
I'm going to show you
unique method of poaching

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.830
eggs that will make
you the star of brunch.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.470
And then I'm going
to show you how

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.750
you can use eggs to make a
really foolproof mayonnaise

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.000
and a really fool proof
hollandaise, which will also

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.840
make you a star of brunch.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.240
And then we're going to talk
a little bit about salads,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.782
because well the
poached eggs we have

00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:33.656
are going to go into a
brussels sprouts salad

00:02:33.656 --> 00:02:35.510
that the kitchen is
preparing, which I think

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.435
everybody can eat afterwards.

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:36.990
Is that right?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.370
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
I think, so, yeah.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.828
So we're going to
talk a little bit

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:41.100
about salads and vinaigrettes.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.520
So eggs, then
emulsions with eggs,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.560
and then emulsions without eggs.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.930
And that's what we're doing.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.290
So the first one is poached egg.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.330
So I don't know how
many of you have

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.160
tried poaching an egg before.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.862
It's not extremely easy,
even in a restaurant.

00:02:56.862 --> 00:02:58.570
I used to work in a
restaurant in Boston,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.190
where I was in
charge of breakfast.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.070
And so there were
days of the week when

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.611
I had to go in at
6:00 in the morning

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:08.260
and start poaching eggs
for breakfast service.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.010
And I would say for my
first month there, at least,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.414
I probably had like
a 30% success rate.

00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:16.330
We ended up eating a lot
eggs for family meal,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.650
because the eggs
break, they fall apart,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.685
the egg whites turn
all wispy in there,

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.060
and it's really,
really difficult

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.729
to get a nice
perfectly poached eggs.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.770
And you'll find that
there's people that tell you

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.870
many different ways to do it.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.520
What I was taught was that you
take the pot, you have water,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.770
you salt the water.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.930
Actually I am going to salt
the water for a little bit.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.610
You salt the water.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.390
And then I was told to
put vinegar in the water,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.090
because it helps the egg white
settle a little bit faster.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.280
And then I was taught to stir
a vortex into it like this,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.500
break my eggs into a
separate little container,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.820
and then pour it gently into
the middle of that vortex.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.090
And supposedly the
vortex is supposed

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.220
to help you maintain like a
nice sort of for torpedo shape.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.360
The idea is that as it
falls into that vortex,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.521
it swirls around like this.

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.270
And because the egg
white and the egg yolk

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.604
have a different density it
kind of leaves like a trail,

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.020
kind of like a
comet going around.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.490
So the yolk will
go in the front,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.850
the white will trail behind it.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.460
And that's supposed to give
it a really nice shape.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.589
But in reality, what
happens is you end up

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.589
breaking half your eggs.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.047
They swirl around
in there and then

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:21.262
you end up with egg drop soup
and you have to start over.

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:21.970
And it's not fun.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.800
It's not fun.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.020
Any line cookers who had
to poach a lot of eggs

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.320
can tell you it's not easy.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.720
So what we're actually
going to do instead

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.340
is we're going to take our eggs.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.047
These are eggs.

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:34.422
I already showed
you eggs before,

00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.515
didn't I. Now the one
thing you want to do,

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:37.890
you want to make
sure when you're

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.780
poaching eggs is that your
eggs are really, really fresh.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.887
You want them to be like
within a couple weeks of having

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:44.970
coming out of the chicken.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.504
If you can get them like the
day of, that's even better.

00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:49.420
But what happens is--
let me break open an egg

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.586
and show you something here.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.040
So when you break open an
egg, immediately what you see

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.090
is obviously two things.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.000
There is the white and the yolk.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.730
But actually there are really
three phases in an egg.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.270
So there is the yolk, which
is inside its own little sack,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.072
its own membrane.

00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:13.280
There's the white, which is
also in its own membrane.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.610
But then there's also
all this loose white,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.470
which is not within
that same little sack

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.010
as the main part of the white.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.030
And that excess loose
weight, that's the problem.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.162
That's what makes your
eggs fall apart in there.

00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:29.620
JENNA TAYLOR: That's what gets
all wispy and flying around.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.030
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Exactly.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.154
That's what gets all wispy.

00:05:31.154 --> 00:05:34.690
And the thing is the
older your egg is,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.292
the weaker the membranes
in there are going to be.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:38.750
So the higher the
chance it's going

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.350
to be that you're going to
break your eggs when it falls

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.808
into the water or that there's
going to be too much of that

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:43.500
lose white.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.070
So what you really
want to do when

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.270
you're going to poach eggs is
find the freshest eggs you can.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.570
There's a couple ways you
can tell how fresh an egg is.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.540
The first one is
just look at the box,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.550
because they all
have a sell by date.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.480
The sell by date by law has
to be within 30 days at a time

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.980
that the egg was
packed into the carton.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.030
But it can be anywhere
within that 30 day range.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.650
So the real number
you're looking for

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.400
is what's called the
Julian date and it'll

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.790
be a three digit number on the
carton right next to the sell

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.290
by date.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.310
And that three digit
number is the day

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.660
that the eggs were packed on.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.990
It goes one to 365, obviously.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.980
And as I just
found out, when you

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.534
search for what is the
252nd day of the year,

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:23.450
Google doesn't immediately
give you an answer.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.034
You have to go to a chart.

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:26.450
So maybe somebody
can get on that.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.890
If you really have
no idea, another way

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:37.710
you can tell your eggs is
by you get a cup of water

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.720
and-- I don't know how many of
you've really closely looked

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.330
at a hard boiled egg.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.755
I'm sure most of you here
have eaten a hard boiled egg.

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.880
When you peel a hard boiled
egg along this fat end,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.379
you sometimes see
this little divot,

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:52.990
this little bubble in there.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.531
And that bubble is
in there naturally

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:56.390
and it always
forms on this side.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.210
As the egg gets
older and older--

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.490
the shell is slightly porous so
it will actually lose moisture

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.860
and particularly in the
US, because eggs in the US

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.530
are washed before packing.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.220
So when it comes
out of the chicken,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.690
there's this kind of
natural waxy cuticle on it

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.730
that is also a weather barrier.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.590
So European eggs--
you might notice

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.000
if you go to Europe, eggs are
stored at room temperature,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.810
whereas in the US they're
stored in the fridge.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.470
And the reason for that
is because in Europe they

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.720
don't wash the eggs after
they come out of the chicken

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.170
so that waxy cuticle is intact.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.780
So it actually helps protect
the egg from losing moisture.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.060
It also helps protect it
from bacterial infection

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.907
from the outside.

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:35.240
In the US, they wash them first.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.031
So they start out
cleaner, but they're also

00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:38.425
more vulnerable to other things.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.550
But anyhow, what happens
is the moisture comes out.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.675
And as the moisture comes
out, that bubble in there

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:43.700
gets bigger and bigger.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.690
So a very, very
fresh egg-- and we're

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.350
going to see how
fresh this one is.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.020
So there you go.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.960
A very, very fresh egg will
lay on its side like that.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.100
As the egg gets older
and older, you're

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.397
going to see that it's
going to start floating.

00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:59.730
Well, initially it'll start
standing up with its fat end

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.390
up.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.350
And eventually if it
gets really, really old

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.300
it's going to actually float.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.758
And at that point,
you don't really

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:10.055
want to do anything other
than throw it at people.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.680
So these are fresh
eggs, which is good.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.800
But as I pointed out,
even with a very fresh egg

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.190
there's still a good amount
of that really liquidy white

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.160
and that's your enemy.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.620
So the secret to getting rid of
that is you just use a strainer

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.260
and you just pour your
egg right in there

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.320
and you can see all the
liquid white drips off.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.820
And that's all stuff
that would have

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.857
gone into your pot of water
and clotted it up and made

00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:38.940
those little wispy things.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.049
And once you have your basically
clean, tight white and tight

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.360
yolk in there, you
can very gently

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.310
lower it into the water like
this and just kind roll it out.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.575
And is there a way for
people to see in there?

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:58.950
I don't know if there's a way
for people to see in there.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.825
But it looks awesome.

00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:02.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.614
And then once it's in there you
give it a couple little stirs.

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:08.030
One thing you don't
want to happen

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.540
is for that egg to
stick on the bottom,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.604
because even though
you're in a pot of water

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:16.020
the metal on the
bottom of the pot

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.820
is going to conduct
heat into the egg

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.780
obviously faster
than the water is.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.460
So you want to make sure
this is moving a little bit.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.890
And this is just going to take
about maybe 30, 45 seconds

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.360
to a minute.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.090
And once you have
an egg in there

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.520
you can do any number of them.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.680
It gets pretty easy once
you get going at this.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.141
Egg whites come out
and egg goes in.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.170
And I think that first one is
nearly done already, actually.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.510
So I'm just going to
grab a slotted spoon here

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.380
and fish it out.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.530
And there.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.800
So you can see it's like
a perfectly tight white.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.230
There's nothing-- no like
wispy bits coming out.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.690
This is a picture
perfect poached egg,

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.760
that's what you're looking for.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.900
Thank you.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.110
Now even though that's
really easy and pretty much

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.754
foolproof, but actually I
use the word fool resistant.

00:10:30.754 --> 00:10:32.170
There's a lot of
engineers in here

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.540
and I'm sure that you
know-- every time you

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.160
make something foolproof then
a bigger fool comes around.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.695
So it's a fool resistant method.

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:42.320
I'm sure someone's
going to mess it up.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.550
But even though it's
pretty foolproof,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.210
it's still a bit of
effort to do while you're

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.800
trying to-- say you have six or
eight friends over for brunch,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.570
and you want to make eggs
benedict for everybody;

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.815
that's like a dozen
eggs you have to poach.

00:10:56.815 --> 00:10:59.190
So that's going to tie you up
in the kitchen for a while.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.980
So a much easier way to do it is
to actually poach your eggs off

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.690
the day before or
even up to few days

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:13.010
before, and then transfer them
to a bowl of water, cold water.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.080
You can take this bowl
and put it in your fridge

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.290
and leave it for three days.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.420
And the eggs are just going
to stay perfectly poached,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.294
they're not going to
cook anymore, obviously.

00:11:20.294 --> 00:11:22.070
And they're not going
to lose any quality.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.434
And the day that you
want to serve your brunch

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.600
you take your poached egg
and just put it right back

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.720
in the hot water for
about 15, 30 seconds

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.800
and then you have a
nice hot poached egg.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.580
And you do 12 of them,
dump them in a pot of water

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.170
and that's like
brunch for everyone

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.461
within a couple minutes,
which is really nice, I think.

00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:42.770
JENNA TAYLOR: My life
just changed forever.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.460
Unbelievable.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.710
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: All right.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.310
So this is poached eggs.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.900
And it's a lot of
poached eggs, actually.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.469
All right, so now we're
going to talk about-- now

00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:58.010
I'm going to dump
this out, actually.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.030
And then I'm going to get some
butter melting, because we're

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.050
going to make some hollandaise
to go with that poached egg.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.950
This is a lot of butter.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.850
It's a pound, I think.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.265
Pound of unsalted butter.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.320
I don't know how
these things work.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.570
It says 1,000.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.692
What does 1,000 mean?

00:12:25.692 --> 00:12:26.192
OK.

00:12:26.192 --> 00:12:29.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.550
I want 1,001.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.600
No, OK.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.240
1,000 is good.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.948
Maybe it's watts?

00:12:32.948 --> 00:12:33.600
I don't know.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.100
All right.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.450
So one of the other
cool properties of eggs,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.740
in particularly egg yolks is
that they contain lecithin.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.810
Lecithin is an emulsifier.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.300
And I don't know how many of
you are familiar with what

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.216
an emulsion is, but an
emulsion is essentially

00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:55.560
when you take two liquids
that are immiscible

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.600
and force them to mix.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.640
In cooking it's almost
always a water-based liquid

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.900
and a fat-based liquid.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.830
So like a traditional
vinaigrette,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.420
which we'll make it a bit.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.980
A butter is an emulsion.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.480
There's water in there, there's
about-- off the top of my head

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.780
if I'm right, I think it's like
15% water and about 80% fat

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.799
and a few other
percents of protein.

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:24.340
And then what we're
going to make now

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.540
is mayonnaise and hollandaise
which are both emulsions.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.780
They're both fat
in water emotions.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.380
Now in order to get
things to emulsify,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.170
what you need is a lot of
mechanical stirring first

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.070
of all, and then
also an emulsifier.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.340
An emulsifier is
any sort of agent

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.670
that has one hydrophobic
end and one hydrophilic end.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.190
So essentially what
you're doing is

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.240
you're taking your
tiny droplets of fat

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.670
or your tiny droplets
of water surrounding it

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.710
on all sides with emulsifiers.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:01.760
So if you think of them as like
little sperm going into an egg,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.090
they got their heads
jammed in there.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.610
So if you have a fat molecule
all the hydrophilic ends

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.300
are jammed into the
fat molecule, which

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.060
leaves the exterior hydrophobic,
which makes it-- or did

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.160
I reverse that?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.070
I reversed it.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.350
Anyhow, you know what I mean.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.475
So it makes it so that
those fat molecules can then

00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:20.520
be evenly distributed in water.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.780
The way you traditionally
would make a mayonnaise

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.512
is kind of a pain in the butt.

00:14:33.512 --> 00:14:35.470
I'm going to do it right
here and it's probably

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.150
going to fail because I
haven't done it in so long.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:47.474
So what you do is you take
your egg, just the yolk.

00:14:47.474 --> 00:14:49.390
We're going to do a
little bit of lemon juice.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.880
A little bit of water--
I think this is water.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.940
We'll see.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.740
And then a little
bit of mustard.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.285
Mustard also is a
pretty good emulsifier.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.842
For this one let's do a
little bit of garlic, too.

00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:14.550
I like to use a
microplane for my garlic,

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.200
although some people, I think,
Anthony Bourdain and Alton

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.810
Brown hate garlic presses.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.561
I don't mind garlic presses,
I think they work fine.

00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:24.686
But I generally use a
microplane, because I have it

00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:25.186
around.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.960
All right, so to make a classic
mayonnaise you start out

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.190
with an egg yolk,
mustard, lemon juice.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.240
And the real trick to
making a mayonnaise

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.240
is that you have to add the
oil really, really slowly.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.990
Oh, actually-- someone
in the kitchen there,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.640
can someone grab me like
a court of canola oil?

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.560
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.480
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Yeah.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.938
We'll start this
one with olive oil

00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:48.277
just because I have it here.

00:15:48.277 --> 00:15:50.360
The trick is to add the
oil really, really slowly.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.620
And the idea there is
that by adding it slowly

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.360
you're able to break down the
droplets into very, very, very

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.490
fine droplets.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.574
And that's what you need
because if they're too large

00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:01.990
they end up
attracting each other.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.470
And I like to
think of it sort of

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.480
as like a high school dance,
where the water's the boys

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.950
and the oil's the girls, or
maybe the other way around.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.130
Oh, thank you.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.595
And then once the boys start
forming a little clump,

00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:18.220
all the other boys
are like, oh there's

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.320
boys I'm going to go over there.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.980
And then they glom onto
them and then you end up

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.460
with people on separate
sides of the dance floor

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.510
and that's not what you want.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.676
You really want to maybe
give them a little alcohol.

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:29.364
Lecithin is like the the
alcohol of the mayonnaise party.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.780
Give them a little
bit of alcohol,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.988
help them mixed together,
and they keep it separated.

00:16:35.822 --> 00:16:36.905
Very little bit at a time.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.810
Whisk very furiously.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.930
JENNA TAYLOR:
Cardiovascular for the day.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.890
Maybe you didn't want
to do arms at the gym.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.730
You just make mayonnaise.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.099
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
OK, I'm not going

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.800
to bore you making
this fully, but you

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.750
can see it starts to form
this nice creamy sauce.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.080
And as you add more
and more oil it's

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.829
actually going to get
thicker and thicker.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.050
And that's one of the
interesting properties

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.790
of an emulsion is
that an emulsion

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.180
is thicker than either of the
two ingredients on their own,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:25.680
always.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.096
And that's just
because of the way

00:17:27.096 --> 00:17:29.750
they rub together when they're
trying to move around in there.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.440
So that's how you make
a traditional mayo.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.740
It's definitely not foolproof
and it takes some practice.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.296
So what we're going to do
is make a foolproof mayo.

00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:39.920
Fool resistant.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.910
JENNA TAYLOR: Fool resistant.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.576
J. KENJI LOPEZ ALT:
Fool resistant mayo.

00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:44.730
Actually, could we get
even a little more oil?

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.090
One more little bottle?

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.170
Because this is a
pretty big container.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.920
JENNA TAYLOR: You can
have all of our oil.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.170
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: All right.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.310
JENNA TAYLOR: We'll
line it up for you.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.890
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So I'm
going to put an egg in there.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.640
This time I'm
actually just going

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.806
to leave the white in there.

00:17:57.806 --> 00:17:59.686
You can leave the
white in if you want.

00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:02.060
And I'll just leave out the
water, because egg whites are

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.800
mostly water anyway.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.400
Egg white, lemon juice,
some of my garlic.

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:16.605
Thank you.

00:18:16.605 --> 00:18:17.313
Oh, there you go.

00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:18.349
JENNA TAYLOR: Bam.

00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:19.640
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Value size.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.870
This is the Costco container.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.332
Mustard.

00:18:25.332 --> 00:18:26.540
All right.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.770
And now remember I told you that
you have to add the oil really

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.200
slowly to mayonnaise.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.110
JENNA TAYLOR: Uh-oh,
what's happening?

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.985
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So
what we're going to do

00:18:35.985 --> 00:18:38.400
is we're just going
to dump this in.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.065
All the way.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.660
And that's what happens if you
add oil too fast to mayonnaise.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.260
Obviously, it doesn't mix.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.290
But if you have
one of these guys,

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.300
an immersion
blender-- So the idea

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.010
here is that if you can see it
all of the water-based liquid

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.240
is at the bottom.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.230
All the oils at the top.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.380
And now this guy is
going to create a vortex

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.890
and that vortex is going to
very slowly draw the oil down

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.870
into the water.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.170
So by sticking this all
the way to the bottom

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.480
and turning it on, we're
going to basically do

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.869
what we were doing before
very, very slowly add the oil

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:19.910
phase to the water phase.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.280
And unless I've suddenly
become a bigger fool,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.120
this will hopefully work.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.268
I think it will work.

00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:27.768
Ready?

00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:46.654
It is working.

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:54.240
JENNA TAYLOR: Seriously,
where have you

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.902
been all of my culinary life?

00:19:56.902 --> 00:19:57.907
Look at this.

00:19:57.907 --> 00:19:59.490
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
And then season it

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.204
with a little salt, pepper.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.559
And that's mayonnaise, see?

00:20:19.377 --> 00:20:20.543
I don't know how this works.

00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:22.550
AUDIENCE: What exactly
was that device again?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:22.850
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
an immersion blender.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.130
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: This
is an immersion blender.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.130
Yeah, yeah, you can
get them for about,

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.970
I mean I think like
Cuisinart makes them--

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.336
JENNA TAYLOR: $30.

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:30.336
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: $35.

00:20:30.336 --> 00:20:31.130
Yeah.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.330
JENNA TAYLOR: Target, anywhere.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.840
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: This will
be way better than anything

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.810
you ever get out of a jar.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.270
Yeah, tastes like mayonnaise.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:41.222 --> 00:20:43.734
AUDIENCE: How long would
that keep in the fridge?

00:20:43.734 --> 00:20:45.900
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: I put
the garlic and lemon juice

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.230
in there.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.605
So those are the things that
are really going to kill it.

00:20:48.605 --> 00:20:50.120
If you did it with
like no garlic

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.328
and did it with just like
vinegar instead lemon juice

00:20:52.328 --> 00:20:53.890
it will last weeks.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.347
I mean as long as as
commercial mayo did basically.

00:20:58.347 --> 00:20:59.930
With the garlic and
lemon juice you'll

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.776
start to taste maybe some
funny off flavors after one

00:21:03.776 --> 00:21:05.690
and a half weeks or so.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.856
AUDIENCE: So the lemon juice
is for flavor more than

00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:08.840
for the acid?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.191
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Yeah, well, for both.

00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:13.440
It's for flavor, it's for
acidity, I mean, brightness,

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.840
because you can make mayonnaise
with just water and oil,

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.481
but it tastes greasy and gross.

00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:19.980
Yeah.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.710
You want acid in there to
really give a brightness.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.540
I usually put quite a
bit of acid in there.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.180
This one is less acid
than I normally would.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.540
The one thing you want to
make sure, a lot of people

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.154
make mayonnaise with olive oil.

00:21:34.154 --> 00:21:35.570
The one thing you
don't want to do

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.810
is do exactly what I just
did with just pure olive oil.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.670
And the reason is that
olive oil, it'll oxidize.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.790
If it comes into contact
with them too much air

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.730
and if you mix it
too violently, it

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.060
has aromatic compounds in
there that sheer and oxidize.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.019
And it'll developed some
really bitter flavors.

00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:55.518
So I don't know if
you've ever tried

00:21:55.518 --> 00:21:58.110
putting olive oil in the blender
and tasting it afterwards.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.235
Just that action, just like
putting it in a blender

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:03.150
and blending it for 10 seconds
it makes it taste disgusting.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.300
So if you want to make a really
like olive oily mayonnaise,

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.770
start with about half
the amount of canola oil

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.350
or a vegetable oil, some
kind of neutral oil.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.789
Start with about
half the amount,

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:15.080
get your mayonnaise stable,
then transfer it to a bowl,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.538
add your olive oil
and whisk it in.

00:22:16.538 --> 00:22:18.460
And once you have a
really nice stable base,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.940
it's actually pretty easy to
add, whisk more oil into it,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.690
it's not going to break.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.400
So there we have mayonnaise.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.480
Now the question is how
do you make hollandaise.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.771
And hollandaise-- once you
know how to make mayonnaise,

00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:30.630
hollandaise is like--
I mean it's basically

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.120
the exact same thing.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.190
The only difference is
that instead of oil you're

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.640
using butter, another fat.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.230
Hollandaise is one
of these sauces

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.280
that is, again, like the bane
of a lot of brunch cooks'

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.089
existence.

00:22:45.089 --> 00:22:46.880
It has all the difficulties
of a mayonnaise

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.380
getting proper emulsion
to form, all of that.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.900
Plus it's also very
temperature sensitive.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.830
If it gets too cool-- butter is
a highly saturated fat, which

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.880
means that-- I
don't know if you're

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.070
familiar with the shape
of a fat molecule,

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.600
but it basically
looks like an e.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.794
Like it's got one-- what is it?

00:23:06.794 --> 00:23:08.210
Three fatty acids
and a glyceride.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.700
It's got a glyceride chain and
fatty acids sticking out of it.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.750
Those fatty acids they
have kinks in them

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.690
based on how saturated or
unsaturated that the fat is.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.230
So when it's fully
saturated that

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.910
means that every single
location on that fatty acid

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.108
has a carbon.

00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:26.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:26.112 --> 00:23:27.320
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Hydrogen?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.615
Hydrogen. Yes, thank you.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:32.120
It has hydrogen on it, which
makes the legs straight.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.890
When it is missing
some of those hydrogens

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.510
those legs end up kinking.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.580
So when you have a non
fully saturated fat

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.330
it has kinked legs,
which means that it

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.840
doesn't stack very easily.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.540
The molecules don't
pack very tightly.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.850
So highly saturated
fats like butter--

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.180
tend to come from animals--
butter, beef fat, pork fat,

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.980
duck fat-- you'll find that
because they stack so nicely

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.480
they are solids at
room temperature.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.440
So obviously you can't make
mayonnaise out of a solid.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.740
So hollandaise is difficult,
because if the butter fat gets

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.130
too cool, it becomes a solid.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.910
It breaks out of its emulsion.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.142
But if it gets too hot, you
end up cooking the egg yolks.

00:24:12.142 --> 00:24:13.600
So it's really this
balancing game,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.940
but when you use this method it
solves a lot of those problems,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.070
again.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.410
Can I grab some more eggs, too?

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.814
Just a couple more.

00:24:25.814 --> 00:24:27.230
Probably won't
actually need them.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.180
We'll see.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.810
With the hollandaise, it's a
little bit more of an egg sauce

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.430
than a mayonnaise is.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:42.430
So I like to use about 4 to
6 eggs per pound of butter.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.150
Egg yolks again.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.985
One, two, three.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.055
Anybody know any good
jokes about eggs?

00:24:55.055 --> 00:24:58.396
AUDIENCE: What do you
do with your egg whites?

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.680
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: You
make souffles out of them

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.930
or make meringues out of them.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.087
Or yeah, any one
of those things.

00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:05.670
JENNA TAYLOR: Once
you separate them--

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.340
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Or
make egg white omelettes.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.060
JENNA TAYLOR: How long
can you keep them?

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.690
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Oh, a long time.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.959
And you can freeze them.

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:11.500
Put them in a
container, freeze them.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.924
They freeze really well.

00:25:12.924 --> 00:25:13.892
Yeah.

00:25:13.892 --> 00:25:14.392
Yeah.

00:25:14.392 --> 00:25:16.350
AUDIENCE: If you don't
like to blend olive oil,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.740
does that mean you don't like
to make pesto in a blender?

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.450
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Well, so a you

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.500
don't want to make
pesto in the blender,

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.333
because it's not the
best way to get flavor.

00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:26.940
You want to make pesto it
in a mortar and pestle.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.850
You rupture a lot more.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.950
So a blender is
actually too violent.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.480
And it's too sharp.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.780
So it'll separate plant
cells at their walls.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.790
So you actually don't extract
as much flavor-- thank you--

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.281
when you blend like basil.

00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.030
You don't extract as
much flavor out of it

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.814
as you do when you really grind
it in a mortar and pestle.

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:46.230
When you make your
pesto, you want

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.316
to get a nice granite
mortar and pestle.

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:51.940
And this is one of
the rare cases where

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.481
the really old
fashioned way actually

00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:55.262
is the best way to do it.

00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.970
You want a grand and
mortar pestle, salt,

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.386
which is also an
abrasive and will

00:25:58.386 --> 00:25:59.700
help you break it down more.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.450
And that'll make
it better pesto.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.962
But to answer your
initial question,

00:26:02.962 --> 00:26:05.420
if you are going to make your
pesto in a blender and a food

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.410
processor, it's
actually relatively OK

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.610
to put olive oil in there.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.782
And it's because all
that solid matter really

00:26:13.782 --> 00:26:15.240
protects the olive
oil from getting

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.722
sheared by the blades spinning.

00:26:16.722 --> 00:26:19.180
So you don't notice the effect
nearly as much when you have

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.640
a lot of solid matter in there.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.808
This is always my favorite part.

00:26:34.084 --> 00:26:34.584
OK.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.050
So again, I'm a little
nervous at this point.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.010
When you do things live
they never work the way

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.220
they're supposed to.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:46.720
We'll see.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.303
JENNA TAYLOR: Just
launch and iterate.

00:26:48.303 --> 00:26:49.700
We just launch and iterate.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.950
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: All right.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:56.730
Same thing here-- eggs,
little lemon juice,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.934
then we got hot butter here.

00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:01.100
I'm using a thermometer
that I borrowed from someone

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.080
over there.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.770
Let's see.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:11.720
Right now it's like
close to 200 degrees,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.350
which is maybe a little hotter
than I want it but will do.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.807
Hopefully won't scramble
the eggs before we're done.

00:27:17.807 --> 00:27:19.140
What did I do with that blender?

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.850
So the process is pretty
much exactly the same.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.716
The only difference
is in this case

00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:30.310
you can't pour
the butter on top,

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.690
because if all that hot
butter sits on top of eggs

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.010
it ends up cooking the eggs.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.600
So this one you do
have to double fist it

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.256
and do one hand
here, one hand here.

00:27:43.256 --> 00:27:45.150
OK, we got this going.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.090
Ready?

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.970
Hold your breath.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.780
And as the butter goes in
it's going to emulsify,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.650
but it's also going
to slightly cook

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.010
those egg yolks,
which is kind of what

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.495
you want in a hollandaise.

00:27:57.495 --> 00:27:59.448
It'll make it really
nice and thick.

00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:23.200
And what you want
to do is pour off

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.294
all of this sort of
clear yellow fat.

00:28:25.294 --> 00:28:27.210
And I don't know if you
can see into this pot,

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.501
but there's a bunch of white
liquid left at the bottom.

00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:31.190
And that's basically
the water phase

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.450
of the butter that's
left down there along

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.794
with some dissolved proteins.

00:28:37.794 --> 00:28:39.600
Really all you want
is the fat in here.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.141
If it ends up too thick you can
add some of that water phase.

00:28:42.141 --> 00:28:45.540
But this one looks
like it's pretty good.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.180
And we'll season
it with salt again.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.020
Some people like the
cayenne in there.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:29:03.090
I'll do just some salt. That
tastes like hollandaise.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.190
And wait, let me show
you how cool this looks.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.515
Let's get some of
those eggs from before.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.040
Let me grab a paper towel.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:23.037
So these eggs are a little cold,
but imagine that they're warm.

00:29:23.037 --> 00:29:24.870
You don't have to
imagine, because you can't

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.695
taste-- these eggs are warm.

00:29:27.695 --> 00:29:28.570
JENNA TAYLOR: Steamy.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.015
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Perfect
serving temperature.

00:29:31.015 --> 00:29:32.390
JENNA TAYLOR: How
long in advance

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.494
can you make hollandaise?

00:29:33.494 --> 00:29:34.410
How long will it stay?

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.250
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: That one
you do have to kind of make--

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.210
JENNA TAYLOR: Kind
of a la minute, yeah.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.700
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: A la minute.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.200
Yeah.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.580
So if you have a really nice
heavy, heavy pot-- even this

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.800
will do with a
tightly sealing lid.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.260
You can put a lid
on it and let it

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.190
keep under it's own-- put in a
kind of warm spot on your oven.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.460
And it'll last.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.649
You might find that depending
on if it gets slightly too warm,

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:54.940
it's going to start to thicken.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.890
And egg proteins even at
the same temperature, like

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.914
say you're holding
them at 160 degrees,

00:30:00.914 --> 00:30:02.580
even if you're holding
at a 160 degrees,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.246
over time they'll
thicken more and more.

00:30:04.246 --> 00:30:07.909
So if you hold your
hollandaise for 45 minutes,

00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:09.200
it's going to get pretty thick.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.440
If you hold it for two hours
it'll probably get solid.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.161
It's rescuable.

00:30:13.161 --> 00:30:15.660
You can always whisk in a little
bit more liquid to save it,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.330
but it's never going to be
quite the same as when you first

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.050
made it.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.466
So it is one of
the things I would

00:30:19.466 --> 00:30:22.590
recommend making a la minute.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.530
I broke that egg.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.134
I spent too long talking to you.

00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:25.634
All right.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.010
So I poached the egg
perfectly and then

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.026
I broke it when I
started plating.

00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:36.400
JENNA TAYLOR:
Nobody saw, but me.

00:30:39.112 --> 00:30:40.741
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
And this is what

00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:42.865
is going to get your friends
to love you on brunch.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.120
There and that's
hollandaise for you.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.942
What time are we at now?

00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:00.400
Do I have time to
go into another--

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:00.650
JENNA TAYLOR: Five minutes.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.520
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: I
have five minutes left.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.839
And does that include
questions and answers?

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:05.880
AUDIENCE: Additional
questions and answers after.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.740
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
After this, OK.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.230
All right.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.390
We're going to do
one last thing.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.390
JENNA TAYLOR: But we did
start five minutes late

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.195
so do we get an
extra five minutes?

00:31:12.195 --> 00:31:13.010
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: We're good.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.343
So I'm not going to bother
cooking the brussels sprouts,

00:31:15.343 --> 00:31:17.670
because that's going
to take too long.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.680
But we are going to talk
quickly about vinaigrettes.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.720
So a vinaigrette is also an
emulsion, also a oil and water

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.120
emulsion.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.840
Generally, the
water-based element

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.910
is an acid, like lemon
juice or vinegar.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.784
Can I grab a-- I need
some more lemons, too.

00:31:36.784 --> 00:31:37.700
AUDIENCE: More lemons.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.450
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: I
used up all my lemons.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.870
So again, making a vinaigrette
the traditional way

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.040
is actually very similar
to making a mayonnaise.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.490
You start with your acid, maybe
a little bit of mustard, maybe

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.890
a shallot or two in a bowl.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.440
Start whisking it and then
slowly drizzle in your oil.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.970
And you end up with an emulsion.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.940
Because there's no
lecithin in there

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.500
the emulsion is not quite as
strong as it is in mayonnaise.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.090
And that's why mayonnaise
is so thick and gloppy,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.960
whereas a vinaigrette
is loose and creamy.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:13.050
So people sometimes ask why do
you need to make a vinaigrette?

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.240
Why can't I just put oil
and vinegar on my salad?

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.410
They're like, they do it
the Italian restaurants,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.080
they come around with like the
little caddy of-- thank you.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.209
Oil and vinegar.

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:22.750
And the question is why can't
you just put them on separately

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.400
and toss it all together.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.100
And so I want to
quickly demonstrate

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.570
what happens if you do that.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.140
So I have this bowl here.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.122
This first bowl we're going
to put some salad greens.

00:32:36.122 --> 00:32:37.830
And imagine that I'm
measuring everything

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.500
here really precisely.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.020
We're going to put
some salad greens

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.630
and we're going to
do just oil in it,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.900
about a tablespoon of oil.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.720
OK?

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.800
I'm going to toss
this together and then

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.410
I'm going to put them
in this strainer.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.010
And I grab a clean
bowl, excuse me.

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:07.400
Can you still hear me from here?

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.858
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
like "Top Chef."

00:33:08.858 --> 00:33:11.790
We're going to make him run all
over the place, set the timer--

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.740
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: All right.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.020
So we're going to put
it in a clean bowl

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.590
and we're going to watch
what happens there.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.860
Then the next one,
we're going to take

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.920
about the same amount
of greens and we're

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:36.180
going to add some lemon juice
to them; also about a tablespoon

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.260
or so of lemon juice.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:48.160
Toss them and then we're
going to put them here.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.352
And then the final bowl we're
going to make a vinaigrette.

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.810
I'm going to do it in a jar
instead of the traditional way.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.280
No, I'll do it the
traditional way.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:18.414
So lemon juice, a little
mustard, and my whisk

00:34:18.414 --> 00:34:22.441
went-- I wonder
where my whisk went.

00:34:22.441 --> 00:34:25.557
I'll grab another one.

00:34:25.557 --> 00:34:26.515
JENNA TAYLOR: Run, run!

00:34:31.415 --> 00:34:32.790
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
I don't know.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.190
Are those all set up
for someone after?

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.065
I don't know if I'm
stealing someone else's--

00:34:36.065 --> 00:34:39.102
JENNA TAYLOR: You're welcome
to use any of our tools.

00:34:39.102 --> 00:34:42.006
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So basically
same as the mayonnaise.

00:34:42.006 --> 00:34:46.533
We're going to drizzle in
some olive oil pretty slowly.

00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:48.949
For a vinaigrette I usually
like to go by the three to one

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:55.096
ratio of oil to
water-based liquid.

00:34:55.096 --> 00:34:56.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.590
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Say again?

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.680
JENNA TAYLOR: What's
the emulsifier?

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.030
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Mustard.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.430
Mustard.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.870
Yeah.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.370
Yeah.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.300
But mustard is not as
strong as lecithin,

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:08.367
which is why it doesn't really
hold the emulsion as well.

00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:10.075
You know, and even
without an emulsifier,

00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:13.670
it's possible to get like a
relatively loose emulsion.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.290
But it'll eventually separate.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.020
But this one you see,
it's pretty creamy.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.770
So this one we're going to
also throw some salad greens.

00:35:36.438 --> 00:35:38.422
I'm adding a couple
tablespoons of this.

00:35:43.382 --> 00:35:45.000
Toss them all together.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.760
And where did I put
that clean bowl?

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.255
Did I lose my last clean bowl?

00:35:56.255 --> 00:35:57.722
Let's go with this bowl.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.590
OK.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.540
OK.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.960
There we go.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.960
And hopefully this is
actually going to work out

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.120
the way it's supposed to.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.210
Sometimes it does.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.080
All right, so this
one is tossed with oil

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.500
and you can see like basically
nothing drips into the bowl.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.654
And that's because leaves
have this kind of natural waxy

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.820
coating on them so that
when they're out in the rain

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.660
the rain just rolls off of them
instead of soaking into them.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.690
So oil actually binds
really well to salad greens

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.190
and to leaves of all kinds.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.310
And actually if you've seen your
salad green start to go limp,

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.910
it's the oil that's doing it.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:47.730
It's not the acid.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.450
It's not the water.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:48.991
It's the oil.

00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:51.440
So you can see like here it's
already starting to go limp

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.648
and that's because the oil
is soaking into the leaves

00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.180
and saturating the cells.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.880
So no dripping from oil.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.987
So it's good because the
oil sticks to the leaves

00:36:58.987 --> 00:37:00.820
and that's where you
want it, because that's

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.403
where you get the
flavor, but it's bad

00:37:02.403 --> 00:37:05.140
because it ruins your greens.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.550
Now we go to the
one with the acid

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.460
and this is the one
that I hope worked.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.444
And imagine that the bowl has
a lot of stuff down there.

00:37:14.444 --> 00:37:15.860
JENNA TAYLOR: Tons,
tons of stuff.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.193
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: If we had
it sit a little bit longer

00:37:18.193 --> 00:37:20.264
you would have probably seen it.

00:37:20.264 --> 00:37:21.930
Or if this thing had
bigger holes in it.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.179
Oh, yeah, it's all pulling
at the bottom of the thing.

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:28.260
Anyhow, your acid basically
it just runs off the leaves,

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.830
it doesn't really stick to them.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:33.060
And that's bad, because you
need that bright acidity to make

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.860
your salad taste good.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.670
So the point of a vinaigrette
is that you get your acid in oil

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.290
to play nicely together.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.161
And then here again no drippage.

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:45.410
It coats the leaves nicely,
but now coating the leaves

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.752
is oil plus acid.

00:37:46.752 --> 00:37:48.460
So you get the flavor
from the olive oil,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.510
you also get the
flavor from the acid.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.180
The leaves are protected
from the effects of the oil,

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.181
because of that
water-based element.

00:37:56.181 --> 00:37:58.430
And so that's the reason why
you want to actually form

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.440
a really nice tight vinaigrette
and not just haphazardly throw

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.460
things on your salad.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.835
And it's also why
it doesn't work

00:38:03.835 --> 00:38:06.570
to just kind of add extra
vinegar at the table

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:07.120
or whatever.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.870
You need to really
make a nice vinaigrette

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.380
if you want a nice salad.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.940
Actually I had a really nice
salad out here for lunch.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.356
I'm pretty sure
they did it right.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.040
Anyhow I think that's it.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.755
That's emulsions
and oil and eggs.

00:38:23.755 --> 00:38:24.255
Yeah.

00:38:32.427 --> 00:38:33.760
JENNA TAYLOR: Thank you so much.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.300
I think we do, Victoria,
have time to take questions.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.130
Yes?

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.220
So forgive me, super
dorky, I'm going

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.870
to repeat your question so that
those people who are watching

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.610
the video later can
hear it, otherwise

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.235
they're just going
to hear the answers.

00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:46.940
So bear with me.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.920
Chef in the front, did
you have a question?

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.140
So does the whisking taint
the flavor of the olive oil

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.995
the same way you spoke about
the blender shearing it.

00:38:54.995 --> 00:38:56.370
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
I mean I wish

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.828
that my hands are as powerful
as blenders, but they're not.

00:38:58.828 --> 00:39:00.996
So no, it's because
I'm much more gentle.

00:39:00.996 --> 00:39:01.496
Yeah.

00:39:01.496 --> 00:39:02.810
Yeah.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.960
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you
design experiments varying

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.794
ingredients?

00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:08.740
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Well, it's a lot

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.160
like any kind of experiment.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.300
So the way you design an
experiment a lot of it

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.050
comes down to sort of intuition
and experience in the field.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.331
So I have a good idea of
what is likely to work.

00:39:19.331 --> 00:39:21.830
And I think that's the case in
any sort of scientific field,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.480
the difference between
a good scientist

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.229
and a bad scientist
it comes down to a lot

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:27.120
to intuition and sort
of general background

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.550
knowledge of the field.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.550
So yeah, a lot of what I decide
to test comes down to that.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.600
And then when I'm doing
the actual experiments

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.080
it really is fifth
grade science stuff.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.439
Isolate the variable,
have a control,

00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:43.480
make sure you eliminate
bias as much as possible.

00:39:47.396 --> 00:39:49.520
I do different types of
recipes and different types

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.160
of experiments.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.040
So for ones where you can very
easily empirically measure

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.900
things like how well does
mustard emulsify versus an egg

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.430
yolk?

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.846
That one's pretty easy to do,
because it doesn't come down

00:40:02.846 --> 00:40:03.990
to subjective taste.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.320
A lot of experiments do end up
coming down to subjective case

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.394
and so for those often
it's just my own palate.

00:40:11.394 --> 00:40:13.560
And I think that's one of
the differences between me

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.460
and my former employer
at Cooks Illustrated.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.480
What we did there was we would
have big panels of people

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.750
tasting-- this one has a half
a teaspoon of lemon juice,

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.540
that one has a teaspoon of lemon
juice, which one do you prefer?

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.670
And so there you end
up with a recipe that

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.560
sort of pleases a lot
of people, but I also

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.700
think lacks personality.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.740
So what I do is I do the
one that pleases me most

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.460
and explain to you
why it pleases me.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.907
But if you like less
lemon juice in you thing--

00:40:39.907 --> 00:40:41.490
the idea is that I'm
trying to arm you

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.234
with enough sort
of basic cooking

00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:44.650
technique and
scientific knowledge

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.160
to be able to modify
the ingredient,

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.850
modify the recipe
to your own taste

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.220
and still be sure that
it's going to work.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.540
JENNA TAYLOR: Excellent.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.343
Yes?

00:40:53.343 --> 00:40:54.718
AUDIENCE: In the
first part where

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:57.134
you were poaching the eggs,
was the water at a mild simmer

00:40:57.134 --> 00:40:57.870
at the lowest--

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.670
JENNA TAYLOR: What's the
temp of the eggs or the water

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:01.990
when you're poaching the eggs?

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.200
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
It was below a simmer.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.670
So the main reason I like
to keep it below a simmer

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.160
is actually just a physical one.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.493
I don't want the bubbles
coming up there and interfering

00:41:09.493 --> 00:41:11.630
with the eggs and jostling
them around too much.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.170
Partly I also don't
want the metal

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.590
at the bottom of the
pan to be too hot.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.250
So ideally when I
poach eggs what I do

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.710
is I get like a
rather large pot.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.745
I'll bring it to a boil
then I'll shut it off.

00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:22.120
And then I'll add
the eggs to it.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.510
So the water
temperature is probably

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.940
above 180 degrees, below 200
degrees, around that range.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.330
JENNA TAYLOR: What temp
should the eggs themselves be?

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.960
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So,
OK, that's a good question.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.350
So I actually like to use
fridge cold eggs for poaching.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.950
And the main reason is
that those tight whites

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.360
and tight yolks are actually
more viscous when they're

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.110
cold from the fridge
so it makes it easier

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.780
to do that straining step.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.782
If they come all the
way to room temperature,

00:41:51.782 --> 00:41:53.240
especially with
slightly older eggs

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.730
there's a small
chance that doing

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.010
that step you're going
to end up breaking

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.070
the shell, the membrane
around the white

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.944
and you definitely don't
want that to happen.

00:42:00.944 --> 00:42:03.980
So I like to use fridge
cold eggs for poaching.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.170
JENNA TAYLOR: What got you
interested in food science?

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.503
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: What's
got me interested in science?

00:42:09.503 --> 00:42:11.434
Well, I can tell you
Don Herbert, Mr. Wizard.

00:42:11.434 --> 00:42:12.600
If you grew up in the '80s--

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:12.950
JENNA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.075
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: --or
in the '50s, you knew him.

00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:17.110
He got me interested in science.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.320
I mean I come from a
family with many scientists

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.310
so I was always
interested in science.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.479
I got interested
in food basically

00:42:24.479 --> 00:42:26.770
because it was the summer
after my sophomore in college

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:30.180
and I wanted to take a
summer off of academic work.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.966
So I went around looking
for a job as a waiter.

00:42:32.966 --> 00:42:34.590
And I walked into a
restaurant and they

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.256
said we don't have
any waiter positions,

00:42:36.256 --> 00:42:38.580
but we have a prep cook who
didn't show up this morning

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.455
so as long as you know
how to hold the knife,

00:42:40.455 --> 00:42:42.231
we'll give you a
job in the kitchen.

00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:44.230
And I lied and I said I
know how to hold a knife

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.270
and I got a job
working in a kitchen.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.700
And sort of faked my way
through it for several years,

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.220
but as soon as I
went into a kitchen

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.079
I was like this is
the life for me.

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.370
I loved working at restaurants.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.711
So the way I got
interested in food science

00:42:57.711 --> 00:42:59.210
is that I got
interested in science,

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.509
then I got interested in food.

00:43:00.509 --> 00:43:02.550
And then I was like, oh
here are these two things

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.160
I can put together.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.945
Worked out.

00:43:04.945 --> 00:43:05.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.570
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Yeah, well vinaigrette

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.880
is a very good example of that.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.250
I use one part
water-based liquid,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:16.150
so that could be lemon juice,
vinegar, and then three parts

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.190
oil.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.765
And then about maybe up to
one part in addition to that.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.140
The liquids you
can do by volume,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.120
but one part by weight
of additional aromatic.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.470
So it can be garlic,
it can be shallots,

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.742
it can be some kind of
barbecue spice blend,

00:43:32.742 --> 00:43:34.700
powdered ranch dressing
mix, whatever you want.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.900
But yeah a vinaigrette you want
a three to one ratio of oil

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.520
to water.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.490
That's a good one.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.780
I would actually recommend
getting Michael Ruhlman's book.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.490
Michael Ruhlman's one of my
idols, a great, great food

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.045
writer.

00:43:46.045 --> 00:43:48.170
He has a book called "Ratio,"
which is specifically

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.794
about that question.

00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:52.210
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you go
about adding vinegar to your--

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:52.670
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
How do you feel

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.650
about-- I think you said, how
do you feel about adding vinegar

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.960
to your poaching
liquid for eggs?

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Vinegar
to the poaching liquid?

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.620
How do you feel about it?

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.120
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So adding
vinegar to the poaching liquid

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.660
the idea there is that
the acidic water is

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:08.274
going to help the egg white
to set a little bit faster.

00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:10.690
If I was going to poach eggs
using the traditional method,

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.550
I would add vinegar
to the water,

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.720
because you run such a big risk
of the egg white spreading out

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.250
too fast.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.300
And it does help the egg
whites set a little bit faster.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.240
But I also find that it
makes like a very sort

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.000
of thin kind of
almost chalky texture

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.090
along the exterior of the egg.

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.244
So using this method you don't
need to worry about the whites.

00:44:28.244 --> 00:44:30.410
So I don't add vinegar,
because I prefer the texture

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.577
without the vinegar.

00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:33.910
JENNA TAYLOR: What kind of a
chef's knife are you using?

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.170
Funny, you can read all
about it on Serious Eats.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.180
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Yeah,
so this chef's knife

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.000
I'm using right now is from
this company called Misen.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.294
They just launched their
Kickstarter this morning.

00:44:42.294 --> 00:44:43.960
They sent me this
knife about a week ago

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.830
and it's become one of
my new favorite knives.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.960
It's high carbon steel, it's
got a polycarbonate handle,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.090
it's like a super high
quality, really well

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.480
balanced chef's knife.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.690
I collect knives.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.190
I have tons of knives and this
is one of my favorite knives.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.310
And the best part is it's
$65, which most knives are

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.844
like in a $130, $180 range.

00:45:07.844 --> 00:45:10.260
Yeah, I would highly recommend
backing them on Kickstarter

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.809
getting this knife in March.

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:14.100
JENNA TAYLOR: What's your
favorite recipe in your book?

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:14.870
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: That
didn't make it in the book?

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:15.730
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, that
didn't make it in the book?

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.101
J. KENJI LOPEZ ALT:
My favorite recipe

00:45:16.101 --> 00:45:16.580
that didn't make it in the book.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.230
JENNA TAYLOR: I
want to know what's

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.688
your favorite one
in the book, too.

00:45:18.688 --> 00:45:19.720
Both.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.094
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Well, I
was in the fortunate position

00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:23.650
where-- so originally
I was supposed

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.130
to write a 300 page book,
that's what was in my contract.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.270
And it was supposed to
take a year to write.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.320
It was going to come out
in like 2011 or 2012.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.990
And then by the time 2012 rolled
around I was up to 800 pages.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.940
And I gave it to my
editor and I thought

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.315
she was going to
kill me and then

00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:42.230
she was like, this is good can
you give me another 800 pages.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.330
And I was like, OK.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.120
So I took another year
and another 800 pages.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.210
So I was in a fortunate
position where I really

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.040
didn't have to cut anything.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.190
So by the time
that rolled around,

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.760
that was like the end of 2013.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.300
I was at 1,600 pages.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.820
We were going to release
a two volume box set.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.960
And then it turns
out that booksellers

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.320
don't want to sell a $100
book from a first time author.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.720
So we're like, OK we can
cut it down to one book.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.920
So we cut it down
to 1,000 pages.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.170
So there's 600 pages worth
of recipes and things

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:14.962
that I really like.

00:46:14.962 --> 00:46:17.211
Fortunately they're going
to come out in another book.

00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:18.780
So I'm adding to
that and there's

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.090
going to be another
probably 1,000 page

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.160
book that's coming out in maybe
two years, maybe one year.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.050
We'll see.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.470
So the recipes
that I really liked

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.845
that got cut from this book
are going to be in that book.

00:46:28.845 --> 00:46:32.540
But out of those recipes I
would say-- the hardest things

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.560
to cover, probably
pizza and I have a lot

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.739
of thoughts on nachos, too.

00:46:37.739 --> 00:46:39.030
There's no nachos in this book.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.960
JENNA TAYLOR: Don't we all?

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.320
What's your favorite
thing in the book?

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.250
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
Oh, that's also hard.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:48.090
JENNA TAYLOR: It's not your
children, they won't know.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:48.970
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: No,
it's because I forgot.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.345
I wrote this book
like years ago.

00:46:50.345 --> 00:46:52.360
I forgot them all.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.496
All right, so the
first recipe you're

00:46:54.496 --> 00:46:56.370
going to make out of
there, I would recommend

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.110
making the stove top
macaroni and cheese,

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.277
because it's literally takes
the same amount of time

00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:03.610
as it does to open up like a
box of Kraft mac and cheese

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.300
and make it.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.820
But it's so, so much better.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.970
And it has that same
sort of gooey, creamy,

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.867
cheesiness that-- yeah,
it's one of my favorites

00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:12.950
recipes in there, I'd say.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.410
Easy, delicious,
really bad for you,

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.240
a change from the
Google food for you.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.280
JENNA TAYLOR: We like
everything in moderation.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.202
How could you adapt the mac and
cheese recipe for backpacking?

00:47:28.202 --> 00:47:30.410
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Well,
it's actually almost custom

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.610
made for backpacking.

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.120
So in the recipe
the only element

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.700
that I think you have
to leave out is the egg.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.576
But it has a variety
of emulsifiers in there

00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:44.950
that help that
sauce stay creamy.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.533
So there's condensed
milk, which comes

00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:48.450
in a can; perfect
for backpacking.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.200
There's cornstarch.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.220
And then there's a small amount
of American cheese, which

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.790
contains sodium
citrate, chemical

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:00.140
salts that help cheeses
melt and stay emulsified.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.950
And then a large amount
of cheddar cheese.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.740
So cheeses are good
for backpacking.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.280
Everything except for the
egg, and then the pasta's dry.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.030
So and then it all
cooks in one pot.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.240
You cook the pasta,
you drain it,

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.860
then you throw everything
else in there, and that's it.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.700
It's pretty easy for
backpacking, actually.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Unusual tips
for egg-based desserts.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:26.610
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: So
desserts are not my forte.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:30.140
They're not my strong suit.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.444
There are actually no
desserts in this book.

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:36.610
Something that I say right
in the introduction like,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.660
I just don't like
desserts so I don't do it.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.262
JENNA TAYLOR: Woah, woah,
woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

00:48:41.262 --> 00:48:43.470
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Because
I made a deal with myself

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.140
about five years ago that
I'm not going to do things

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.110
that I don't like anymore.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:47.484
Which I think is
a deal everybody

00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:48.940
should make with themselves.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.490
And so I was like, all right
I'm not doing desserts.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.781
JENNA TAYLOR: What is your
favorite Bay area restaurant

00:48:53.781 --> 00:48:55.429
and what is the
best Google cafe?

00:48:55.429 --> 00:48:57.720
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: To be
100% honest, I don't actually

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.220
get out to eat in
the Bay area much,

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.180
because I cook so much at home.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.090
So we live in San Mateo.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.320
I've had some really
great meals at 31st Union.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.650
I like Santa Ramen down there
and Dojo Ramen is pretty nice.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:19.490
I had some good pizza at
Doppio Zero in Mountain View.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.766
In San Francisco I
would say, I've always

00:49:21.766 --> 00:49:22.890
loved Mission Chinese food.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.740
Everybody loves that.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.930
Pal's Take Away,
it's a sandwich shop.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.030
It's great, it's in the
back of Tony's market.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:31.613
It's not a full restaurant, it's
just a guy making sandwiches,

00:49:31.613 --> 00:49:32.950
but they're the best.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.430
And prune?

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.030
Not prune, no.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.840
I had great prunes.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.140
Francis.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.090
Francis in the Castro and Kin
Khao, really like Kin Khao,

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.752
Thai restaurant
in the Tenderloin.

00:49:45.752 --> 00:49:50.720
Oh and favorite cafe, I
don't remember the names.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.700
Does anyone who
work on this one--

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.064
this is my favorite one, right?

00:49:54.064 --> 00:49:54.930
Yeah.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:58.050
JENNA TAYLOR: Kitchen
Sync for the win.

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.970
How would you do in a
cooking competition?

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:01.930
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Kick ass.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:04.445
JENNA TAYLOR: Obviously.

00:50:04.445 --> 00:50:05.820
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
I don't know.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.450
I mean I used to
work in restaurants,

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.908
but I haven't worked
in restaurants

00:50:08.908 --> 00:50:11.720
now for seven or eight
years, I think, maybe longer.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.450
So I think probably
my speed has suffered.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.140
But I think I'm a
pretty good cook.

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:20.800
I don't know.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.340
That's a hard
question to answer.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.140
MALE SPEAKER 1: Do you
miss the restaurant?

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:24.700
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: I do.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.199
I do.

00:50:25.199 --> 00:50:29.990
I mean, I miss the adrenaline
and I miss the rush of service.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.824
And I miss the camaraderie of
the kitchen is really nice.

00:50:32.824 --> 00:50:34.240
I definitely don't
miss the hours,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.300
I don't miss not
having holidays.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.490
I don't miss not
having weekends.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.050
So some elements
I definitely miss,

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:43.114
but overall it's a good change
to get out of restaurants.

00:50:43.114 --> 00:50:45.280
JENNA TAYLOR: How are home
cooks wasting their time?

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.202
They can be doing
something more efficient?

00:50:47.202 --> 00:50:49.410
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: I think
mostly it just comes down

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.740
to kitchen organization.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.470
Particularly, I think,
people waste a lot

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.450
of time becoming cluttered.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.200
A lot of people will
cook and they'll just

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.570
throw their dirty things as
soon as they're done with them

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:02.360
they'll leave them
on a cutting board.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.320
And then you have a
nice big cutting board

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.180
and then you end up with
chopped herbs over here,

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.970
and I have a chopped
onion over here,

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.320
and some pepper skins over here.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.610
And then you're trying
to work in like a space

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.340
this big and that's
not efficient.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.697
So I think the number
one way to make yourself

00:51:15.697 --> 00:51:18.030
more efficient in the kitchen
is really clean as you go,

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:23.550
stay organized, and also think
of yourself as a production

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:24.051
line.

00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:25.966
Maybe it's not fun way
to think about cooking,

00:51:25.966 --> 00:51:27.880
but I think it makes
it more fun in the end.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.620
So if you're chopping up five
pounds of onions for an onion

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.474
soup, rather than working
one onion at a time

00:51:34.474 --> 00:51:37.140
and getting it all chopped, I'll
do actually one step at a time.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.111
So I'll take every onion
and I'll cut off the ends

00:51:40.111 --> 00:51:42.360
and then I'll take every
onion and split them in half.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.530
Then I'll take every
onion and peel them.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.070
And that's way you have
less extraneous movements,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.800
less cleaning up, and it's
much more organized and faster.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.970
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you
feel about egg politics?

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:52.550
Cage-free.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.050
Organic.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:53.430
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
So all right, there's

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.360
two sides to that question.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.470
There's a flavor side and then
there's the politics side.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.200
As far as the politics
side go, I think,

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.411
you buy it from best chickens,
the most nicely treated

00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:03.910
chickens.

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:07.180
I mean, the commercial egg
industry and the dairy industry

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.720
are two of the worst industries
in the world; way, way,

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.970
worse than the meat industries.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:17.030
Battery chicken hens are treated
really, really, really poorly.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.450
So I would recommend
buying cage-free

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:21.490
if you have a local
farmer even better.

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.800
I would definitely do that
for political reasons.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.265
As far as flavor reasons
go, a lot of people

00:52:27.265 --> 00:52:28.640
say they can taste
the difference

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.510
between a cage-free egg or a
commercial egg or something

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:33.284
from their neighbor's yard.

00:52:33.284 --> 00:52:34.950
Every test I've ever
seen and everything

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.280
I've ever done side
by side blind taste

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.820
test you can't tell
the difference.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.470
They cook the same way.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:43.680
They'll have differences
in appearance.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.740
And this is a test I've done
with large crowds before.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.530
You can show people two
pictures exactly same egg,

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.194
just photoshop the egg in one of
them a little bit more orange.

00:52:55.194 --> 00:52:57.110
The orange egg is going
to be more appetizing.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.590
And similarly, if
you're making scramble--

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.280
this is another
brunch tip-- if you

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.720
want your friends to have the
best tasting scrambled eggs

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.390
they've ever had
in their life, just

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.340
add a few drops of orange
food coloring to the eggs

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.550
while you're scrambling them.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.050
And they'll be like,
oh my god these

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.635
are-- tell them you got them
from your neighbor-- they'll

00:53:12.635 --> 00:53:15.070
be like, oh my god these are
the most flavorful eggs ever.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:17.360
And really it's all
just psychosomatic.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.910
But at the same time, it really
does taste better to them.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.390
So I think that's a good thing.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.474
So if can buy better eggs and
knowing the fact that those

00:53:26.474 --> 00:53:28.640
eggs are came from happier
chickens and they're more

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.405
orange, if that actually really
makes it taste better to you

00:53:30.405 --> 00:53:32.720
then it's like, then who cares
if in a blind taste test they

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.010
don't.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:33.640
Right?

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.530
That's not what's
important, what's

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.863
important is what's in your
mouth, what's in your brain,

00:53:36.863 --> 00:53:39.300
not what a blind
taste test shows you.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Does
size matter of eggs?

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.360
Only for eggs, clearly.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.390
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Yeah, well,
certainly in a baking recipe

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:50.390
it matters, because yeah
if you use different size

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:53.260
eggs it's going to throw off
the ratio of baking recipes.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.220
MALE SPEAKER 2:
What's the right size?

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.280
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: Most recipes
are written for large eggs.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.240
I like to sometimes
get like jumbo eggs

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.406
if I'm going to poach them
or fry them, because it's

00:54:00.406 --> 00:54:02.240
nice to have a nice big yolk.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.850
My mom used to go
to a store that

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.053
would sell the double
yolked eggs for fried eggs

00:54:07.053 --> 00:54:08.760
and she really liked those.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.970
But in general, no.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:15.200
As far as flavor and basic
chemical profile goes,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.070
it doesn't really matter.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.430
JENNA TAYLOR: The hardest
thing about writing a recipe.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.820
J. KENJI LOPEZ
ALT: Foolproofing.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.220
Yeah, it's trying to
figure out everything

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.390
that an end user might do wrong
and guarding against that.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.660
So when you look at
recipes in this book

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.590
or on Serious Eats or
any place where's there's

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:38.680
really well written,
well tested recipes,

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.285
you'll find that-- I
always try and offer

00:54:42.285 --> 00:54:44.660
like several different queues
for when something is done.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.243
So I start with a
visual cues, so I'll

00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:49.140
say cook it until the onions
are translucent and then

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.490
after that I also offer
like a basic timing cue.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.680
So a poorly written
recipe would be,

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.090
cooked the onions for five
minutes over medium heat.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.610
And that's poorly written,
because a you don't

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:04.572
know how much power-- this
one was cooking at 1,000,

00:55:04.572 --> 00:55:05.780
I don't know what that means.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.320
Is that medium?

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:06.703
Is that medium?

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:07.470
I don't know.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.280
And most people at
home, their gas ranges

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.840
vary so much, so you don't
know what medium heat means.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.724
Secondly, you don't
know what kind of pan

00:55:15.724 --> 00:55:16.640
they're going to have.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.050
Are they going to
have an aluminum pan?

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.510
Are they going to have a
really thin nonstick pan?

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.690
Are they going to have
a stainless steel pan?

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.050
So you can specify
all those things,

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.300
but even within the range
of like stainless steel pans

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.550
there's a broad range.

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.390
So it's always much better
to give a visual cue

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:31.530
and say like, cook the
onions while you're stirring

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.613
until they're translucent.

00:55:32.613 --> 00:55:34.635
This will take about
three to five minutes,

00:55:34.635 --> 00:55:35.760
maybe, something like that.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.843
That way you're making
sure that people are really

00:55:37.843 --> 00:55:40.120
using their ears and
their eyes and that's

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.030
how you should be cooking.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.410
Use a timer, use a
thermometer, but always

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.220
time things first with
your eyes, and your ears,

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.819
and your nose, and your fingers.

00:55:49.819 --> 00:55:51.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Who eats
all of the leftovers

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.470
from your experiments?

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.590
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT:
So sometimes my wife.

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:59.300
It depends on if it's a
recipe she likes or not.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.430
And if it's a recipe she
likes, by the end of it

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.100
it's a recipe she
hates, because she'll

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.570
eat boiled eggs for
three weeks straight.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.450
Sometimes it's my wife.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.570
When I lived in New York,
I lived near my family

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.950
so I would give it away to
my mom, or my grandfather,

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.030
I would take it into the office,
my neighbors, my doorman.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.490
Now we live in San Mateo
next to a family that

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.550
has three kids, two kids, and
so they get a lot of our food.

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.720
The dogs get a lot of food, too.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.480
The dogs had wagyu steak for
breakfast couple weeks ago.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.554
Lucky.

00:56:30.554 --> 00:56:32.220
JENNA TAYLOR: What's
your favorite thing

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.550
to order when you eat out?

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.841
J. KENJI LOPEZ-ALT: It depends
what kind of restaurant.

00:56:36.841 --> 00:56:40.180
So if it's like your
typical California cuisine--

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.280
I mean, vegetables.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.860
I order vegetables and
fish when I eat out.

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.490
I think, if you're going to
a really high end restaurant

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:50.990
or even like a really
nice mid range restaurant,

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:54.120
I think the two best dishes
to judge a restaurant on

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.970
are actually generally
the most boring,

00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:00.110
so I think it's a
salad and the chicken.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.470
And those two things if
they can do it right,

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.240
those things are oftentimes
they're almost afterthoughts.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.340
They're things like oh we have
to have a salad and a chicken.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.280
But if they show care and
attention when they're

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.410
doing that, and perfectly
cooked chicken, I think,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:13.360
could be amazingly tasty.

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.220
And a really perfectly
dressed salad

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.111
with a properly made
vinaigrette, well

00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:19.610
balanced ingredients, that can
also be really, really tasty.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:21.660
So if a restaurant does
those two things right

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.431
then I'm pretty sure that they
care about everything else.

00:57:25.431 --> 00:57:26.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Wonderful.

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:28.270
Thank you so much.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:31.920
