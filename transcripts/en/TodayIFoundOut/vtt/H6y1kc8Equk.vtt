00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.950
Tom Waits’ raspy, almost growl-like singing
voice has become synonymous with the singer

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.740
and has been variously described by critics
as sounding like it was “soaked in whiskey”

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.520
or alternatively like it was “hit by a car”.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.909
This distinctly recognisable sound combined
with Waits’ vast back catalogue of hits

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.919
has seen the artist approached numerous times
over the years by various advertising agencies,

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.550
all of whom he has rapidly rebuffed.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.329
When once asked about why he had reservations
about his music being used for product promotion,

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.370
Waits very matter-of-factly summed up his
position: “Commercials are an unnatural

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.370
use of my work…

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.760
It’s like having a cow’s udder sewn to
the side of my face.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.590
Painful and humiliating.”

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.750
Or even more bluntly,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.890
I get it all the time, and they offer… a
whole lot of money.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
Unfortunately I don’t want to get on the
bandwagon.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.249
You know, when a guy is singing to me about
toilet paper – you may need the money but,

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.239
I mean, rob a 7-11!

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.450
Do something with dignity and save us all
the trouble of peeing on your grave.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.430
That said, while Waits has never given permission
to have his music used in an advert, he did

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:26.380
once lend his voice to a commercial back in
1981 for dog food.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.670
Waits eventually came to regret the ad and
once famously went on record as saying that

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.340
he’d rather have “a hot lead enema”
than “sell out” like that again.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.480
Now you’d think that given his outspoken
and longstanding objections to having his

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.210
work used in a commercial sense that advertisers
would steer clear of the artist and perhaps

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.800
approach someone else when looking for a hit
to shill their product.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.500
You’d, of course, be wrong.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.470
Most famously, in 1988, Waits was approached
by the ad company Tracy-Locke on behalf of

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.130
Frito-Lay about using his hit, Step Right
Up, for a radio jinglepromoting Salsa Rio

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.280
Doritos.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.990
Waits quickly declined the request, so the
company tried a different tack.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.450
They hired a Tom Waits soundalike- someone
so good Frito-Lay’s own lawyers advised

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.530
the company that he sounded too much like
the real thing and the ad could cause legal

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.930
problems because of it.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.910
However, after hearing a version of the ad
with a generic blues singer and deeming it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.780
inferior to the Tom Waits soundalike version,
the executives at Frito-Lay decided to go

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.100
ahead with it anyway.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.000
According to Waits, he had no idea that Frito-Lay
had done this until he was sitting in an LA

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.810
radio station chatting about his latest album
and the DJ played the commercial during the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.810
ad break.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.450
Waits later noted that the impersonation of
his voice was so eerily accurate that he began

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.819
to question whether or not he was actually
listening to himself.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.930
It was only after placing a few phone calls
and confirming that the voice he’d heard

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.890
wasn’t him that Waits mood changed from
worriedly perplexed to enraged.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680
He stated,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.150
Part of my character and personality and image
that I have cultivated is that I do not endorse

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.150
products…

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.900
…whoever was going to hear this and obviously
identify the voice would also identify that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.190
Tom Waits in fact had agreed to do a commercial
for Doritos…

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.600
It embarrassed me.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.760
I had to call all my friends, that if they
hear this thing, please be informed this is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
not me.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.180
I was on the phone for days.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.430
I also had people calling me saying, “Gee,
Tom, I heard the new Doritos ad…”

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.850
Waits immediately filed suit which brought
about an unusual legal quandary.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.680
You see, Waits didn’t own the rights to
the song Step Right Up; his former label did.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.560
And, as it turned out, Frito-Lay had legally
obtained permission to use a version of the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.750
song in their ad.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.140
So what did Waits sue them for?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.780
A few months before this singer Bette Midler
had won a case against Ford for an unauthorised

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.010
use of her likeness and voice.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.310
Similar to Waits’ case, Ford hired a Midler
impersonator and soundalike (Midler’s long-time

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.620
backup singer Ula Hedwig) to sing one of her
songs in an ad after Midler, like Waits, told

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.550
them she wasn’t interested in doing the
ad.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.040
The court initially ruled against Midler,
but upon appeal reversed their stance, noting

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.390
A voice is as distinctive and personal as
a face.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.050
The human voice is one of the most palpable
ways identity is manifested… when a distinctive

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.740
voice of a professional singer is widely known
and is deliberately imitated in order to sell

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.090
a product, the sellers have appropriated what
is not theirs…

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.110
Following Midler’s lead, Waits sued on the
same grounds.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.850
Curiously, Frito-Lay and the advertising agency
they contracted with were both aware of the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.129
Midler case when they hired the soundalike,
but their legal team reasoned that Waits wasn’t

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.210
as well-known as Midler and you can’t legally
protect a style of singing or music; so while

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.680
there was a high risk they’d get sued, the
ad agency’s legal team felt it was unlikely

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.009
Waits would win and recommended Frito-Lay
go with the Waits’ knock-off version of

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.300
the commercial.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.210
Ultimately when sued, this reasoning became
the basis of Frito-Lay’s entire defense,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.960
with their lawyers arguing that: “A singer
is not widely known if he is only recognized

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.889
by his own fans, or fans of a particular sort
of music, or a small segment of the population”.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.919
The judge presiding over the case disagreed,
noting that although Waits wasn’t as well

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.960
known as Midler, he was an internationally
famous artist who’d sold millions of records

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.349
and was known by many explicitly for his voice,
which was officially described in the court

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.580
case as:

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.740
Like how you’d sound if you drank a quart
of bourbon, smoked a pack of cigarettes and

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.360
swallowed a pack of razor blades.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.729
. . . Late at night.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.779
After not sleeping for three days.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:36.529
Frito-Lay’s lawyers then had the audacity
to argue that Waits’ voice was that recognisable-

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.180
you know, even though Frito-Lay had gone to
the effort of hiring a guy who sounded exactly

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.600
like him for the express purpose of making
it seem like it was Waits singing in the ad.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.469
The ruling ultimately went in Waits’ favor,
cementing the earlier Midler ruling that celebrities

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.059
and people who are well known in a relative
sense own the rights to all aspects of their

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:00.249
appearance and persona, including their voice,
provided it’s distinct enough.

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:06.009
Frito-Lay were then forced to pay Waits damages
of a whopping $2.6 million (a little over

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.349
$4 million today).

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.379
As for what he did with the money, Waits later
jokingly quipped, “Two and a half million

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.379
bucks?

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.379
Spent it all on candy.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.529
My mom told me I was foolish.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.039
I’ve always been foolish when it comes to
money…”

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.479
This case, combined with Waits’ earlier
comments about preferring to have hot lead

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.689
piped into his rear end than have his music
used in advertisement should have scared off

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:33.219
ad agencies forever, but amazingly the singer
has had to sue other companies like Levi’s,

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:38.449
Audi and the car manufacturer Opel for the
more or less the same type of thing Frito-Lay

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.449
did.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.659
For instance, in the case of Levi’s, they
tried to skirt around Waits refusal to lend

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.120
his music to ads by licensing a cover of one
of his songs that had previously been licensed

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.409
to the artist in question by Waits.

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.710
Waits wasn’t amused and ultimately the company
were forced to issue a full page apology in

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.529
an issue of Billboard magazine.

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.199
In the case of Opel, they used a Waits’
soundalike after failing to get Waits to agree

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.759
to a deal and, unsurprisingly, lost the case,
this time with Waits donating the money he

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.900
won from the lawsuit to charity.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.610
More recently, Waits has become embroiled
in a legal battle with an award winning French

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.960
circus show directed by Bartabas the Furious
which uses 16 of Waits songs for their performances.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.210
Representatives of the show claim they paid
the necessary €400,000 royalties to Waits’

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.879
agent for use of the songs.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.369
Waits denies that he or his agent ever cleared
the songs for use in the show, and once again

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.639
articulates his objections to such a thing:

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.870
These songs were not found like driftwood
on the beach: they came from good families.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.759
I turn down all commercial product endorsement
offers and rarely collaborate or lend my name

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.349
or work to other endeavors.

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:48.050
… That value has been taken and exploited
for the profit and promotion of Bartabas’s

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.189
career and for his religious and political
ideology, which neither the songs nor I chose

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:56.069
to express.

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:02.569
Ironically, Tom Waits is often mistaken for
the actor Ron Perlman who shares a similar,

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:09.800
distinctive growly voice and haggard look
to such an extent Waits’ own fan club redirects

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:21.929
Perlman fans to his IMDB page.
