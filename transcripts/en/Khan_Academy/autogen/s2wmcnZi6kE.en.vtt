00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:01.969
 I took this task 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.628
 from the exercises of the Cannes Academy. 

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.588
 It reads: "Arrange the following expressions 

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.468
 from the smallest to the largest with the coordinates 

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:09.385
 of the rectangle below. " 

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.313
 So we have to find what y, z and x are. 

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:12.695
 Then we have to arrange them. 

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:14.448
 Let's first look at, 

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.514
 well let's take a look at y. 

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.779
 And this is a little confusing, 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.138
 because the variable t is used 

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.204
 to present the coordinate x, 

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.839
 to represent the x coordinate of this point. 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:24.814
 Let's see if we can find it 

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.800
 what is the x coordinate of this point. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.042
 This is a rectangle. 

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.921
 The x coordinate of this point here 

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.399
 will be the same as the coordinate x at this point. 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.899
 They lie on the same vertical line 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.072
 in the way they are painted. 

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:41.392
 If this has the same x coordinate of x equal to four, 

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:43.656
 then this will have the x coordinate of four. 

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.361
 And now we use the variable y for the coordinate x, 

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.417
 which is a bit strange, 

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.935
 but this would be the point of coordinates four and seven. 

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.999
 So y equals four. 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.935
 Now let's see what we can find for z. 

00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:00.814
 Ok, z is your coordinate for ... 

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.230
 let me use another color here, 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.582
 z is the coordinate y for this point. 

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:08.093
 But which other point has the same y coordinate? 

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.031
 Ok, it will be on the same level, 

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.053
 I suppose we can say so, 

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:12.609
 in a vertical direction. 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.780
 It will lie on the same horizontal line. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.357
 Therefore, it will have the same coordinates as this point. 

00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:19.272
 This point has a y coordinate equal to three. 

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:21.315
 So this point, its coordinate will be three, 

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:25.135
 or we can say that z equals three. 

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.410
 So it will be equal to three. 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.593
 Last, but not least, 

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:31.972
 we have to find out how much x. 

00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:33.971
 And x is the coordinate x. 

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.153
 Let me do it in a different color. 

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.789
 x is the x coordinate for this point. 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.994
 Okay, this x coordinate will be the same 

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:42.351
 such as the x coordinate for this point here above, 

00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.709
 which is equal to two. 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.253
 They lie on the same vertical line. 

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:46.635
 They both lie on the line, 

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.411
 x equal to two. 

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.696
 So x will be two. 

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.796
 It is the coordinate x and also the variable x. 

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:56.595
 Therefore, this will be two. 

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.525
 So if we want to sort them from the least to the greatest, 

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.551
 x is the largest. 

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.219
 Then we go to, this is actually the opposite 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.924
 of what we have here. 

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:09.086
 x, then z and then y. 

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.665
 Two, then three and then four. 

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:12.024
 Actually let me see the exercise 

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:13.614
 and just check the answer. 

00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:15.007
 So, x is the smallest, 

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:16.249
 then z is in the middle 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.910
 and finally y is the largest. 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.163
 We can check our answer. 

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.562
 We've got it right.
