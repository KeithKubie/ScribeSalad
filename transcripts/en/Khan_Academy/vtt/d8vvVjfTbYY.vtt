00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.520
Odie the octopus swam home.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.010
He swam at a constant speed.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.800
He plotted how far
he'd gone every 1/7

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.110
of a second on the graph below.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.280
Not all octopi
can create graphs,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.690
but Odie was no
ordinary octopus.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.210
And actually, octopi are some
of the smartest creatures

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.400
on this planet.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.830
What was Odie's speed--
after probably dolphins

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.170
and great apes and
probably most primates,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.800
but they're still fairly
smart, smarter than most fish.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.300
What was Odie's speed
in meters per second?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.740
Note we use m/s to show the
units of meters per second.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.500
All right.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.120
So to figure out speed
in meters per second,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.450
we essentially need
to divide distance

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.505
in meters divided
by time in seconds.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.530
So let's see if we
can pull that off.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.010
So the easiest thing-- let me
find a point that I can clearly

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.017
read how far Odie has traveled.

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.850
So it looks like this
point right over here.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
It's clearly that the
distance in meters is 4/7.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.960
So let me do that.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840
So the distance
in meters is 4/7,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.215
so I'll do that
in the numerator.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.620
the distance in meters.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.465
Gee, I don't like
that con-- well, I'll

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:25.830
just go with this color.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830
You know, the contrast
with the white background

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.494
is a little hard on the eye.

00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:37.540
And It took him 5/7 of
a second to get there.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.480
So 4/7 meters-- actually, let me
make sure I put the units here.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:50.600
4/7 meters in 5/7 seconds.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.080
And so literally, we just
need to divide 4/7 by 5/7,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.900
and we're going to get
it in meters per second.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.980
So this is going to
be the same thing

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:10.675
as 4/7 over 5/7
meters per second.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.950
And 4/7 divided by 5/7 is the
same thing as 4/7 times 7/5.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.130
So let me write that down.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.760
So 4/7 times 7/5.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.470
Dividing by a fraction
is the same thing

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.620
as multiplying by
its reciprocal.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.910
So times 7/5, and we get
this-- well, this 7 and this 7

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.787
cancel out, and
you get 4 over 5.

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:41.620
You could have also
done that by multiplying

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.730
the numerator and the
denominator here by 7.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.550
If you multiply it
by 7, multiply by 7,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.950
you would get 4/5.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.230
But either way, his speed
in meters per second

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.620
is 4/5 meters per second.
