00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.660
So we have this larger triangle
here and inside of that,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.670
we have these other
triangles, and we're

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.480
given this information
right over here.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.680
That triangle BCD is congruent
to triangle BCA, which

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.270
is congruent to triangle ECD.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420
And given just this
information, what

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.130
I want to do in
this drawing, I want

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.380
to figure out what every
angle on this drawing is.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.700
What's the measure
of every angle?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.124
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:30.790
So let's just start
with the information

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.380
that they've actually given us.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:40.340
So we know that triangle
BCD is congruent to-- well,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.264
we know all of these
three triangles

00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:43.430
are congruent to each other.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.760
So, for example, BCD
is congruent to ECD,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.320
and so their corresponding
sides and corresponding angles

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.840
will also be congruent.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.830
So just looking at the
order in which they're

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.270
written B, vertex B
corresponds, in this triangle,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.410
BCD, corresponds
to vertex B in BCA,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.610
so this is the B
vertex in BCA, which

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.030
corresponds to the
E vertex in ECD.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.530
So all-- everything that
I've done in magenta,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310
all of these angles
are congruent,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.900
and then we also know
that the C angle.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.930
So in BCA-- sorry, BCD,
this angle right over here,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.706
is congruent to
the C angle in BCA.

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.530
BCA, the C angle
is right over here,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.430
or C is the vertex
for that angle in BCA.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.330
And that is also the C angle, I
guess we could call it, in ECD.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
But in ECD, we're talking about
this angle right over here.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.845
So these three angles are
going to be congruent.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.620
And I think you could
already guess a way

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.180
to come up with the values
of those three angles.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.900
But let's keep looking
at everything else

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.170
that they're telling us.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.250
Finally, we have
vertex D over here.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.535
So angle-- so this is the last
one in where we listed-- so

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:08.630
in triangle BCD, this
angle right over here

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.440
corresponds to the A
vertex angle in BCA.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.390
So BCA, that's
going to correspond

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.812
to this angle right over here.

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:18.020
It's really the only one
that we haven't labeled yet.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.450
And that corresponds
to this angle,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.920
this vertex right over here,
that angle right over there.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.880
And just to make it
consistent, this C

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.989
should also be
circled in yellow.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.530
And so we have all
these congruences,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.030
and now we can come up with some
interesting things about them.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.520
First of all, here, angle
BCA, angle BCD, and angle DCE,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.820
they're all congruent, and
when you add them up together,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.130
you get to 180 degrees.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.720
If you put them all adjacent,
as they all are right here,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.260
they end up with
a straight angle,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.040
if you look at
their outer sides.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.759
So you have, if
these are each x,

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.300
you have three of
them added together

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.750
have to be 180 degrees, which
tells us that each of these

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.654
have to be 60 degrees.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:58.070
That's the only
way you have three

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.820
of the same thing adding
up to 180 degrees.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.180
Fair enough.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.820
What else can we do?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.310
Well, we have these
two characters up here.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.110
They are both equal and
they add up to 180 degrees.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.880
They are supplementary,
the only way

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.880
you can have two equal
things that add up to 180

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.140
is if they're both 90 degrees.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.880
So these two characters
are both 90 degrees.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.560
Or we could say this is a right
angle, that's a right angle.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.185
And this is congruent
to both of those,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:25.700
so that is also 90
degrees, and then

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.244
we're left with these
magenta parts of the angle.

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.660
And here, we could
just say, well,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.740
90 plus 60 plus something
is going to add up to 180.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.090
90 plus 60 is 150.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.520
So this has to be 30
degrees to add up to 180.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.280
And if that's 30 degrees,
then this is 30 degrees.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.744
And then this thing right
over here is 30 degrees.

00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:46.410
And then the last
thing-- we've actually

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.300
done what we said we would do,
we found out all of the angles.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.404
We could also think
about these outer angles.

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:52.820
So this-- or not
the outer angles,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.180
or these combined angles.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.620
So angle say AC-- or say, angle
ABE, so this whole angle we see

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.030
is 60 degrees.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.370
This angle is 90 degrees,
and this angle here is 30.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.770
So what's interesting is
these three smaller triangles,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.200
they all have the exact
same angles, 30, 60, 90,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.106
and the exact same side lengths.

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:15.730
We know that because
they're congruent.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.313
And what's interesting is when
you put them together this way,

00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:21.320
they construct this larger
triangle, triangle ABE,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.590
that's clearly not congruent.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.640
It's a larger triangle.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.320
It has different
measures for its lengths,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.250
but it has the same angles
30, 60, and then 90.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.250
So it's actually similar
to all of the triangles

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.600
that it's made up of.
