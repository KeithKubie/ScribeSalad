1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,480
The Joe Rogan experience in a way.

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:07,950
I think that one of the cultural
jobs this podcast has performed,

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:10,140
and this is like whether
deliberately or not,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,350
is it demonstrates that the old political
lines that we used to comfortably

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:19,260
abide within a starting
to sort of break down,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,480
cause you know like something like an
obvious signifier of a particular type of

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:29,481
person IEI go hunting now we have to
accept is coupled with your view that the

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,940
agricultural industry needs
to be regulated and it's
disgusting. Now they're,

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,550
you know,
they're,

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,550
we have complete and total agreement
and we both can see that the way that

11
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,370
legislation is set up is biased
towards corporate interests,

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:49,170
commercial interests and profit. Yeah.
And so for me, bloody whether or not,

13
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:52,020
you know, Chris Pat Prime in the name of
sheep, I think he had no problem, man.

14
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,570
Whoa, whoa. That's not, I don't need
to spend my time worrying about that.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,850
I'm a little bit like Alex Jones,
like with the,

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,900
why are we worrying about flat earth if
they've got them babies and all of that

17
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,980
stuff is, I feel like why don't we focus
on the things that are making a genuine

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,460
difference to the uh, the way
people are living lives. Yeah.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,810
And it seems to me that the one of the
priorities is in a new global landscape

20
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:13,770
that we're living with.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,880
What are the dominant forces and what
are the goals of the dominant forces and

22
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,860
how detached or those goals from the
lives of what you might say are ordinary

23
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,730
people or the majority of people
to use it less complex term.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,880
And what's probably most terrific about
reforming the system is that the people

25
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:33,400
that are going to suffer the most
are the people that are the poorest.

26
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,940
So if you think of like a fast
food in particular, right?

27
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:40,630
There's a lot of like really poor people
that re rely on fast food because it's

28
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,530
very inexpensive.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,120
If you go and you can get a
lot of calories for a small
amount of money, right?

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,490
But if you go from the fast
food restaurant and then
you'd go down the line to

31
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:56,320
factory farming and then somehow know
that they eliminate factory farming and

32
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:58,120
they say, no, no, if you're
going to raise animals,

33
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:02,410
you have to have the same
sort of standards that we
would expect if we knew you.

34
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,430
If we were there, we want pastures, we
went animals living in the wild. We want,

35
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean, you know, fenced in, but
like living like an actual animal,

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,240
not this crazy warehouse bullshit.
You guys are running well,

37
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:16,180
that's going to up our operation costs.
Well then that's how it's going to be.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,730
So then the beef becomes
far more expensive.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,050
Now the beef becomes far more
expensive than what a fast food.

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,400
What are the restaurants do?
Well,

41
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,050
they're going to have to make
things more expensive too.

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,830
So who's going to suffer the poor people
who's going to suffer with cheap meat

43
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,320
and supermarkets,
poor people that can't afford it now.

44
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,470
But I think that what happens
though is you start to put,

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,990
you have started to pull a Fred
that reveals how the, the fabric

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,710
of our culture is corrupted because it
shouldn't be more expensive than the

47
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:45,430
reason it's more expensive is because
everything is put into a capital based

48
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,470
ideology.
We're already,

49
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,070
I've heard many times on this show
you discussing universal basic income.

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,220
This is that the beginning of looking at
alternative economic models and there's

51
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:00,510
an argument for saying everyone
has the right to nutritious diet.

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,310
Everyone has the right to a safe home.
You know,

53
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,570
so like if we start prioritizing those
ideas above these organizations have the

54
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,000
right to maximize profit,
we were holding a snake,

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,940
then maximizing profit that's
getting taken off the table.

56
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,550
And then there comes your
counterargument about innovation. Well,

57
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:20,350
I would say if innovation slows
no problem because we've all,

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,490
we've decided as a culture to prioritize
housing and nutrition for the majority

59
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:27,600
of people. Now you can still say
that starts to, you know, that's,

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,250
that's kind of socialism but,
and I don't think that that can work on a,

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,190
on a continental scale.
I think you have to,

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,050
we have to break down centralized systems,
whether those are corporate,

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,970
centralized systems or national,
I feel that we, these two,

64
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,850
the time has gone where there's too
much diversity. Like they're not too,

65
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,190
they're probably always was diversity.
People are different.

66
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,190
We are influenced by our culture is
our schools, our education, our class,

67
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,390
our race is all of these factors.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,320
And then to expect us all to live in
this sort of single bandwidth of this is

69
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,960
what America is all, this is what
France is or this is what England is.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,080
People at these two different now.
But what it does,

71
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,680
it seems like the standards we
were adhering to unconsciously
or otherwise, he's,

72
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,120
these groups have the right to make as
much money as they can and to interfere

73
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:14,020
with that is an American or British
or wherever it was. Cause you know,

74
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,540
beyond the national ideas, I'm
sure. So you know for me that's the,

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,370
you pull that thread out. It's the
poor that will suffer within, no,

76
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:25,210
we have to rule out the poor suffer.
So we had, so what happens in the end,

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,690
you start to get into
redistribution of resources,

78
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,860
managing and regulate in the
power of the most powerful people.

79
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,330
And whenever that conversation starts,

80
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,150
it gets shut down because
we want to conserve,

81
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,920
even in a capitalist system.

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,490
Wouldn't it be more ethical if everybody
started from the same starting block?

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,380
Well, that's what's wrong
with the world, right?

84
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,310
What's wrong with the world
that some people are in a,

85
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,720
they have a terrible hand of
cards you've been dealt. You know,

86
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:54,180
and my point about food is that the
people that are going to see they're going

87
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:57,520
to suffer the most are the people
that rely on the cheap food. Yes,

88
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,740
you'll play as that cheat
food gets pulled away,

89
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,080
then a lot of those
supermarkets in a lot of those,

90
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,700
um, fast food stores that rely on
that factory farm food, you know,

91
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,480
they're going to be in a bad situation.
Things are gonna be much more expensive.

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,170
And if things are much more, if it, and
if they make animals live, like, um,

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,650
what is that guy's name?
Uh, Polyface farms.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,210
Joel's Salitan. Yeah,
he's a fascinating cat.

95
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:28,690
I had him on my podcast before
he sort of a farm reformist.

96
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
And what he believes is that these
animals should live just like animals.

97
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:36,010
When he has pigs, he puts
them in a, a fenced area,

98
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,230
but he moves the fence Darya every day.

99
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,730
So like the pigs move to a different spot
and so they're just constantly forging

100
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:47,150
and eating acorns and uh,
but they're, you know,

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,670
they're living like a pig.
They're living in a natural,

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,100
they're not living in some
crazy warehouse. Yes it
does. Same with his chickens.

103
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:57,160
He has this mobile chicken coop and
he moves it from pasture to pasture.

104
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,010
And this is how

105
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,560
he operates his entire farm.
Yes.

106
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,080
It seems again the appointment it's been,

107
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,810
we've talked about earlier that
we ought to like if we look at,

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,180
no one knows what's right.

109
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,770
So perhaps what we could try and do
is replicate what we do naturally.

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,590
And so there is an argument that
naturally we do hunt. There is a,

111
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:18,410
an argument that naturally we do eat meat.

112
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,040
There isn't actually grow food too though.
Right.

113
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,990
Is an argument that like total saying,
like getting into organic gardening,

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,410
if you have your own garden man mean
that is like one of the most Karma free

115
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,530
things ever. If you can figure out
a way to have your own compost,

116
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:34,640
your own garden, and you don't ever have
to rely on anybody else for your food,

117
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,950
well then you're not
participating in that shit at all.

118
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,420
Do you think that the spirit
of entrepreneurship could
be turned to designing

119
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,200
these systems?

120
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,490
Do you think the only thing
that incentivizes people is
maximum profit? I do too.

121
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,650
I think that it is possible that
people would sit around and go,

122
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:53,480
how do we organize a society that is
fair and just that doesn't kill people's

123
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,440
individualism or creativity or right
to pursue different goals are to be who

124
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,880
they are and belief who you know.

125
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,340
But like I feel like there's
so much fog in the air.

126
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,550
People don't know what they
actually believe in because
there's so much powerful

127
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,570
cultural influence, so
much toxin, physical toxin,

128
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,990
literal toxins and toxicity,
cultural toxicity. You know, how are,

129
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,220
how am I to,

130
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,240
Eh protect my children from
cultural influences that tell them,

131
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,340
do you have to look this way,
be this way, behave that way.

132
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,830
These are the things that call, if
you're not this, you're not a man.

133
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:25,250
If you're not this, you're
not a woman. You know, like w
like, you know, as a parent,

134
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,910
I feel the obligation to
create an environment where
they can grow up to be who

135
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,330
they are. I mean, in fact it me,

136
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,480
and then when you've sort of scaled
it up to a society, you know,

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,860
how can we start to recognize,

138
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,390
look is this time to look at
different systems for living. And I,

139
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,970
what I feel is people want
to be involved in that,

140
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,830
in the power systems that affect them.

141
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,840
Like if you have a group
of a hundred people,

142
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,080
they want a bit bow to run their own
schools, run their own care systems, run,

143
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:52,901
it'd be in charge of them.

144
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:57,680
And I've not just be some little beam of
energy flicked about by cultural forces

145
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,210
that they can't reach or touch.

146
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:03,020
It's alien a in and like one of the
things in Marxism and that you know,

147
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,640
and I know very little about this subject,

148
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,220
did he say that when capitalism
reaches a certain point,

149
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,500
people will be glossed,
alienated.

150
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,180
They feel like a cog in a machine.
No one will have no pride in their work.

151
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,740
No one will know what it's like to
make a whole bicycle and finger look,

152
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,930
I made that.
You'll just,

153
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,440
you're the guide that makes the pedals
now fuck off home. You know, now like,

154
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:21,681
you know,

155
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,470
like I've listened to enough Jordan
Peterson to understand that there are

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160
limitations to what socialism
and Marxism can achieve.

157
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,790
But just because you know,
capitalism is better than feudalism,

158
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,150
that doesn't mean that's the end of
the conversation that we shouldn't be

159
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,760
looking for. Fair about. I'm
more just ways of living. Well.
