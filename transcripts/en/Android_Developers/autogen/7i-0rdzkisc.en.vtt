features that are available in bonsai
blast so we'll start out on this level 3

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
blast so we'll start out on this level 3
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.459
blast so we'll start out on this level 3
right here alright so the technique here

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
right here alright so the technique here
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529
right here alright so the technique here
is to get as many points as you can and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
is to get as many points as you can and
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420
is to get as many points as you can and
fill up the bar over here at the top of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
fill up the bar over here at the top of
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340
fill up the bar over here at the top of
the screen so there got a big bonus

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
the screen so there got a big bonus
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.609
the screen so there got a big bonus
because i just unlocked a treasure chest

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
 
 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.710
 
at this point I'm simply matching 3 i'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
at this point I'm simply matching 3 i'm
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.310
at this point I'm simply matching 3 i'm
trying to gain as many points as i can

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320
trying to gain as many points as i can
 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200
trying to gain as many points as i can
so my company Glu Mobile we decided to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
so my company Glu Mobile we decided to
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240
so my company Glu Mobile we decided to
develop a game for android we picked a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
develop a game for android we picked a
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.789
develop a game for android we picked a
game called bonsai blast to develop it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
game called bonsai blast to develop it
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.990
game called bonsai blast to develop it
takes advantage of a lot of the features

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
takes advantage of a lot of the features
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910
takes advantage of a lot of the features
that android has it has a touch screen

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
that android has it has a touch screen
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.749
that android has it has a touch screen
interface it has a high frame rate lots

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
interface it has a high frame rate lots
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.780
interface it has a high frame rate lots
of sound effects and it's a fun game to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
of sound effects and it's a fun game to
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.140
of sound effects and it's a fun game to
play but it's a difficult game to master

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150
play but it's a difficult game to master
 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.999
play but it's a difficult game to master
so how we developed this game we

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
so how we developed this game we
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120
so how we developed this game we
basically ported this game from j2me so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
basically ported this game from j2me so
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.609
basically ported this game from j2me so
it's got a midlet class in a canvas just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
it's got a midlet class in a canvas just
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440
it's got a midlet class in a canvas just
like j2me but we switch that to an

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
like j2me but we switch that to an
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840
like j2me but we switch that to an
activity which is like a midlet and a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
activity which is like a midlet and a
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.480
activity which is like a midlet and a
view which is like a canvas that part

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
view which is like a canvas that part
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.690
view which is like a canvas that part
was pretty simple then we moved on to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700
was pretty simple then we moved on to
 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.050
was pretty simple then we moved on to
working on things like CPU usage one of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
working on things like CPU usage one of
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.929
working on things like CPU usage one of
the advantages of Android is that it has

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
the advantages of Android is that it has
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719
the advantages of Android is that it has
a simple tick interface basically we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
a simple tick interface basically we
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.510
a simple tick interface basically we
just use the ondraw method and to do our

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
just use the ondraw method and to do our
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.089
just use the ondraw method and to do our
threading we called invalidate in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
threading we called invalidate in
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.490
threading we called invalidate in
gameplay to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
gameplay to
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320
gameplay to
increase the performance to the absolute

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
increase the performance to the absolute
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.720
increase the performance to the absolute
maximum when you're in a menu that has

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
maximum when you're in a menu that has
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.480
maximum when you're in a menu that has
animation we use post and validate delay

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
animation we use post and validate delay
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.960
animation we use post and validate delay
to slow down the frame rate but free up

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
to slow down the frame rate but free up
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.050
to slow down the frame rate but free up
the CPU so it's not killing the battery

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
the CPU so it's not killing the battery
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.780
the CPU so it's not killing the battery
because this is a mobile device when

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
because this is a mobile device when
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.490
because this is a mobile device when
you're in a non-static over near in a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
you're in a non-static over near in a
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.260
you're in a non-static over near in a
static screen we use we turn off the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270
static screen we use we turn off the
 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.780
static screen we use we turn off the
constant repainting so that the handsets

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
constant repainting so that the handsets
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.130
constant repainting so that the handsets
not draining the battery and we only

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
not draining the battery and we only
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.770
not draining the battery and we only
respond to user input and that way the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
respond to user input and that way the
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.910
respond to user input and that way the
battery life is kept to an absolute

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
battery life is kept to an absolute
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.510
battery life is kept to an absolute
maximum while you're playing our game
