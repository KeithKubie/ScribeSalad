Hi, everybody. Welcome to the final unit of the course.

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:06.974
We're delighted that you stuck with us and hopefully learned a whole lot about parallel programming with Cuda.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.511
Now, this unit is going to be a little bit different.

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:14.117
Instead of discussing one topic in depth, we're going to go wide and discuss many topics briefly.

00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:16.920
The goal is to give you some pointers to things that you can follow up,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.362
according to your own interest and needs.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.747
Let's get started.
