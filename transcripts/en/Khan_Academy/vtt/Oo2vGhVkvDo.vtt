00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.000
One of the coldest temperatures
ever recorded outside

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.710
was negative 128 degrees
Fahrenheit in Antarctica.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.620
One of the warmest
temperatures ever

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.530
recorded outside was
134 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.130
in Death Valley, California.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.640
How many degrees
difference are there

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.850
between the coldest and warmest
recorded outside temperatures?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.490
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.604
Now, what I'll do is I'll
plot them on a number line.

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.970
But I'm going to plot it on
a vertical number line that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.527
has a resemblance
to a thermometer,

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:38.110
since we're talking
about temperature.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.390
So I'm going to make my number
line vertical right over here.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.180
So there's my little
vertical number line.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.450
And this right over here
is 0 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.070
which really is of
no significance.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.509
If it was Celsius,
we'd be talking

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:55.550
about the freezing point.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.240
But for Fahrenheit, that
happens at 32 degrees.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.330
But let's say this is
0 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.690
And let's plot these two points.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.769
So one of the
coldest ever recorded

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.880
temperatures was negative
128 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.890
So let's say that's
right over here.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.340
This is negative 128
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.640
And one of the warmest
temperatures ever recorded

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.160
was 134 degrees.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.130
This is a positive 134.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.360
So it's about that far
and a little bit further.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.060
So it's a positive 134
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.790
So when they're asking us
how many degrees difference

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.786
are there between the
coldest and the warmest,

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:39.160
they're essentially
saying, well,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.580
what is this distance
between the coldest

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.510
and the warmest right over here?

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.201
What is this distance?

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:49.450
And there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.908
You could say, hey, if I started
at the coldest temperature

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:54.380
and I wanted to go all
the way up to the warmest,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.230
how much would I have to add?

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.430
Or you could say, well,
what's the difference

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.220
between the coldest
and the warmest?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.220
So you could take
the larger number.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.660
So it's, say, 134.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.919
And from that, you could
subtract the smaller number,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:18.296
which is negative 128.

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.670
So this essentially
saying what's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.040
the difference between
these two numbers?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.206
It's going to be positive,
because we're subtracting

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.720
the smaller one
from the larger one.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.800
This is going to give you
the exact same thing as this.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.000
Now, there's several
ways to think about it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.700
One is we know that if you
subtract a negative number,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.660
that's the same thing as adding
the positive of that number,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.790
or adding the absolute value.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.370
So this is the same thing.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:52.810
This is going to be equal to
134 plus positive 128 degrees.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.870
And what's the
intuition behind that?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.432
Why does this happen?

00:02:56.432 --> 00:02:57.890
Well, look at this
right over here.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.598
We're trying to figure
out this distance.

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:03.610
This distance is 134
minus negative 128.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.240
And if you look at
that, it's going

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.360
to be the absolute value of 134.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.810
It's going to be this distance
right over here, which

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.010
is just 134-- which is just
that right over there--

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.170
plus this distance
right over here.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.550
Now, what is this distance?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.920
Well, it's the absolute
value of negative 128.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.780
It's just 128.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.350
So it's going to be that
distance, 134, plus 128.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.790
And that's why it made sense.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.910
This way, you're
thinking of what's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.390
the difference between a larger
number and a smaller number.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.140
But since it's a smaller
number and you're

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.030
subtracting a negative,
it's the same thing

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.050
as adding a positive.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.550
And hopefully this gives you a
little bit of that intuition.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.330
But needless to say, we can now
figure out what's going to be.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.440
And this is going
to be equal to-- let

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.630
me figure this out
separately over here.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:04:01.710
So if I were to add 134
plus 128, I get 4 plus 8

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.000
is 12, 1 plus 3 plus 2 is 6.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.740
It's 262.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.099
This right over here
is equal to 262.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.640
How many degrees
difference are there

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.660
between the coldest and warmest
recorded outside temperature?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.932
262 degrees
Fahrenheit difference.
