00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:01.119
Hey there!

00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.290
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today we’re looking at two

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.549
very different models of radical, transformative
theater.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.510
First, we’ll head to Poland for Jerzy Grotowski’s
Poor Theater.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.549
Then, we’ll zoom over to Brazil for Augusto
Boal’s The Theater of the Oppressed.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.100
These are pretty different movements: one
is mostly concerned with personal discovery

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.630
and the other is about creating broader social
change.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.800
But both of them do away with theatrical conventions
like costumes and scenery.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.570
They are even kind of meh on props.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.300
Eh, but you’re kinda like more of a “co-star.”

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.420
And both try to break down barriers between
actors and audiences, remaking the theater

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.519
as a space to create real and lasting change.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.780
Let’s rise up!

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.839
INTRO
Poor Theater was started by this guy, Jerzy

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:58.839
Grotowski.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.000
He was born in Poland in 1933 and later educated
in Moscow at the Russian Academy of Theater

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Arts.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.110
In 1959, he settled in Opole in Poland and
began to work with a group of artists who

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.670
would form the Polish Laboratory Theater.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.750
In the early 1980s, he left Poland, moving
first to America, where he taught at several

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.830
universities, and then to Italy.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.530
Like Stanislavski, who was both a big influence
and a big rival , Grotowski was a charismatic

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.260
figure who tried to create a new style of
acting.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.280
While Stanislavski’s style is based in psychological
realism, Grotowski moved away from realism

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.730
and toward something more ritualistic and
elemental.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.950
Grotowski’s theater had two main phases.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.390
Poor Theater was first.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.780
The other, which he developed after 1970,
is called the Theater of Sources.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.240
We’ll mostly focus on Poor Theater, because
it was the more influential of the two and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.890
because Grotowski compiled a very handy book
about it, “Towards a Poor Theater,” published

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090
in 1968, that was widely influential.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.100
If you have any interest in avant-garde theater,
it’s definitely worth a read.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.020
What is a poor theater?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.310
Well—surprise!—it’s the opposite of
a rich theater.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.719
A rich theater doesn’t have to be all that
rich.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:16.930
It includes everything from glitzy multimillion-dollar
Broadway productions to amateur shows in church

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.930
basements.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.030
What all rich theater has in common, though,
is lights and make-up and costumes and sets.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.939
It is deliberately illusionistic.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.409
The poor theater has none of that!

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.310
Not a single rotating gobo.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.609
Instead, it relies on the power of the actor
to convey character and setting.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.290
Grotowski writes:
“One must ask oneself what is indispensable

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.290
to theatre.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.290
Let’s see.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.069
“Can the theatre exist without costumes
and sets?

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.359
Yes, it can.

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.030
“Can it exist without music to accompany
the plot?

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.030
Yes.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.120
“Can it exist without lighting effects?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Of course.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.279
“And without a text?

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.279
Yes.”

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.410
Why exist without all this stuff?

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.670
A couple of reasons.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.700
One of them is that Grotowski realized that
theater was in competition with film and television.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.159
And if illusionism was what you were after,
then film and television were going to do

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.040
a way, way better job delivering it.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.430
But what film and television can’t do, Grotowski
reasoned, is to tap back into theater’s

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.749
origins in ritual and myth.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.790
Maybe you’re thinking, hey, that sounds
like Artaud.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.260
And you’re not wrong, although, as you maybe
remember from our earlier episode, Artaud

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.599
had no problem with big splashy effects.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.599
Aaah!

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.590
So many frogs, scorpions and jets of blood!

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.969
Another reason for poor theater is that Grotowski
wanted to eliminate the separation between

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.209
the actors and the audience.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.260
If spectators don’t get to have fancy wigs
and spotlights, then neither should the actors!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.719
In most of Grotowski’s productions, the
audience mingled with the actors or surrounded

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.290
the actors on all sides, so that they everyone
occupied the playing space.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.230
The performers were constantly exposed and
unmiked.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.099
Grotowski and his actors would spend years
rehearsing productions, refining every movement,

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.489
every breath, every facial expression.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.069
And yet actors still described a feeling of
intense spontaneity and emotional connection

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.069
to the work.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:25.550
Maja Komorowska, an actor in the company,
said it was a “precise, meticulous composition,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.669
but there wasn't the slightest sign of artificiality…

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.030
This explosion, an eruption of emotion and
truth—[it] was no longer merely theater."

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.280
Grotowski believed that a role should “penetrate”
the actor.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.860
That’s his word—well, except he said it
in Polish.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.150
Grotowski’s method required that an actor
open themselves to the role completely.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.660
Ryszard Cieślak, for many years his lead
actor, said of Grotowski’s style, “It

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.870
is anyhow impossible to treat it in merely
artistic terms.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.430
It resulted in my fundamental transformation,
not only as an actor, but also as a human

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.430
being.”

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.090
You might say this all sounds kinda… religious.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.479
And you’re not wrong.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.400
Director Peter Brook, who observed Grotowski
at work, considered Grotowski an example of

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.210
holy or sacred theater.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.729
Brook called this style of acting, an “act
of sacrifice, of sacrificing what most men

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.669
prefer to hide—this sacrifice is his gift
to the spectator.”

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.580
Brook wrote that in Grotowski’s poor theater,
actors give up everything except for the power

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.920
of their own bodies and unlimited rehearsal
time to bring those bodies to the role: “No

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.010
wonder they feel the richest theatre in the
world.”

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.550
… GET IT?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.550
Richest Theater?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.060
For a closer look at Grotowski’s methods
and style, let’s explore one of his most

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.220
famous and —fair warning—most disturbing
works, “Akropolis.”

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.849
“Akropolis,” first performed in 1962,
was based on a long 1904 poetic drama by Stanisław

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:57.849
Wyspianski.

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.160
A shout-out to Western culture and a call
for Polish national pride, it describes how

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.930
statues, tapestries, and carvings come to
life in a Krakow cathedral on the night before

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.930
Easter.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.240
But Grotowski transferred the setting to Auschwitz,
not all that far away from his theater in

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.040
Opole, and created a piece asking if culture
could matter at all after an event like the

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040
Holocaust.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:
[[[Hi.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
I know this will be disturbing to animate,
but all of Poor Theater is disturbing.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040
You can watch clips of the Peter Brook documentation
of Akropolis, if that helps.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
And I know we can do this sensitively.]]]

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
The audience is seated on all four sides of
the space.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.650
In the middle is a junk heap—pipes, nails,
a rusting bathtub.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.699
Above the heap is a web of ropes, a little
like barbed wire.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.370
This is a concentration camp.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.919
At the beginning of the play, an actor drags
in a headless dummy and delivers a prologue.

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.810
Then the other actors, dressed identically
in tunics, berets, and heavy wooden-soled

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.500
shoes, enter.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.840
Their faces are frozen into grimaces.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.569
Grotowski called these facial expressions
“life masks.”

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.370
One observer wrote that their eyes actually
look dead.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.560
They speak like a Greek chorus:
CHORUS:

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.340
Only once a year,
They come only once a year

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.370
On the cemetery of the tribes.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.180
A SINGLE VOICE:
Our Acropolis.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.370
CHORUS:
They read the words of judgment

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.620
On the cemetery of the tribes.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.169
They're gone and the smoke lingers on.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.699
Two actors become angels, and they suspend
the headless dummy from the ropes in a pose

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:14.979
like the crucified Christ.

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.630
A violin plays, and several of the actors
begin to work with materials from the junk

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.630
heap.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.090
They are building the crematorium where the
prisoners will be burnt.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.639
Three of the actors step out.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.409
Two become guards, and the third is a prisoner
whom they interrogate and torture.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.500
There is more work on the junk pile, an unhappy
sex scene between a man and a woman, and then

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.139
the retelling of the biblical story of Jacob.

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.379
The crematorium is completed; the action shifts
to Troy.

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.630
There is a scene between Paris and Helen.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.610
One prisoner steps out to become King David,
and he addresses a speech to God that ends

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.919
in a wild song.

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:55.690
And the dummy is lifted overhead, an image
of a dead, starved prisoner.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.840
One by one, the actors throw themselves into
a pit.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.759
That whole thing took fifty minutes, and at
the end, the audience was usually too upset

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:06.759
to applaud..

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:10.800
By 1970, Grotowski figured he’d gone about
as far as he could go in perfecting the work

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
of the actor.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.900
So he turned to eliminating the divide between
actor and audience, creating “a meeting,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.650
not a confrontation; a communion where we
can be totally ourselves.”

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:28.219
He also undertook an extensive study of ritual
performance in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean:

00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:30.080
the Theater of Sources.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.090
He died in 1999.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.740
Let’s turn to another theatermaker interested
in blurring boundaries between actor and audience.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.250
That would be this guy, Augusto Boal, born
in Brazil in 1931.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.830
Initially he studied chemical engineering,
but while he was a student at Columbia University,

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.300
he was introduced to the theories of Brecht
and Stanislavski.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.519
Later on, he was also profoundly influenced
by the educator Paolo Freire, who pioneered

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:58.260
the “Pedagogy of the Oppressed,” a nonhierarchical
educational method.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.450
Returning to Brazil, Boal began to direct
plays at the Arena Theater.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.769
First classics and then plays written by Brazilian
playwrights.

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:08.420
He toured his plays to poor neighborhoods.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.600
These plays often ended with actors asking
their audience to rise above oppression.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.760
But Boal began to think that, instead of just
talking to audiences, he should be listening

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.730
to them and empowering them.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.420
As his practices evolved, he encouraged audiences
to talk back to the action—you can see the

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.829
influence of Brecht here—and to suggest
new actions for the characters.

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:34.750
Legend has it that, during one performance,
a female audience member couldn’t make an

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.959
actor understand her suggestion.

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.690
So she stepped onstage and performed the action
herself.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.450
This birthed the idea of the spect-actor.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.100
[[[Yorick flies in wearing spectacles.]]]

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.100
No, no, no.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:51.560
The spect-actor is part spectator and part
actor and all awesome.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560
Unlike those glasses.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.680
Get out of here.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.011
This method eventually became known as Forum
Theater.

00:09:57.011 --> 00:10:02.420
A Forum Theater exercise begins with a short
scene centered on a social problem—sexism,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.360
say, or racial discrimination.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.670
After the scene concludes, it starts again.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:14.470
And this time, spect-actors are invited to
interrupt the proceeding with their own actions.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.500
A facilitator, usually called a “joker,”
monitors the performance.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.760
The “joker” doesn’t actually joke.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.720
They make sure that each spect-actor is able
to complete his or her action, and then asks

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.649
the audience to evaluate the usefulness of
each proposed solution to the social problem.

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:33.949
If you are freaked out by participatory theater—if
your idea of theater is hiding in the dark

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:38.630
and ruffling your Playbill, perhaps at most
glaring carefully at someone unwrapping a

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.700
bit of candy in the dark—Theater of the
Oppressed is not for you!

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.370
Boal believed that encouraging audience members
to step onstage was a way of empowering them.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.760
This meant showing them that they could take
action in their own lives if they felt that

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.440
they were experiencing injustice.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.899
This didn’t sit too well with Brazil’s
military regime.

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:03.540
And in 1971, after a performance of Brecht’s
“Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,” Boal was

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.320
kidnapped, tortured, and eventually exiled.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.269
Boal took his participatory show on the road,
eventually settling in Paris and continuing

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:12.810
to teach.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.199
In 1979, he published his first book “Theater
of the Oppressed.”

00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:20.470
He also pioneered another form of political
theater, “Invisible Theater,” which is

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.470
a kind of theater that the audience doesn’t
even know is theater.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.850
It could be happening anywhere, anytime—it
could be right behind you right now!

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.290
But probably not.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.880
He re-relocated to Brazil in 1986, became
a city councilman, and pioneered a form known

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.880
as Legislative Theater.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.570
In this form, citizens were encouraged to
participate in scenes that helped to identify

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.240
the social problems they were facing and to
brainstorm possible solutions.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.519
Augusto Boal died in 2009.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:51.920
Obviously, Grotowski and Boal were pretty
different dudes.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.200
Grotowski expected actors to rehearse for
years.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.730
Boal didn’t need his spect-actors to rehearse
at all.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.070
But both believed in theater as a means to
achieve something greater.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.709
For Grotowski, that’s a profound self-knowledge
and exploration of the human condition.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:15.079
For Boal, that’s the hope of true social
justice and solutions to endemic problems

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:16.920
discovered as a community.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920
CONCLUSION
Thanks for watching.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.880
Next time, we’ll make our first visit to
West Africa, studying intersections of theater

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.709
and ritual, and exploring Nigeria’s influential
postcolonial theater with a closer look at

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.540
playwright Wole Soyinka.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:13:04.910
Until then… curtain!
