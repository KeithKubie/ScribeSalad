00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:09.165
(intense electronic music)

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:17.917
- So, you may ask,
what's that title about?

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.406
Well, when you are
asked for a title early,

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:23.757
sometimes you don't know
what you're gonna say.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.590
(audience laughing)

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.766
So, I figured I could say anything and

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.349
what I was thinking
about was Ramon y Cajal

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.296
and what he would have thought beyond

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:39.296
his great gift of seeing
things with the Golgi technique

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:43.645
that were actually hiding
in a forest of complexity.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:47.436
That lead him to speculate
and make predictions that

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:49.505
we are still following
in Neurobiology today

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.338
about how things actually connect.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.500
If he were alive today,
he would be in wonderment,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.722
if you like, regarding all
of the scales of details

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:01.849
that we can now describe with

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:05.284
different kinds of
microscopies and labels.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:07.090
He would probably be, as I think

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.030
this conference is considering,
amazed at the gaps.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
So, where are we limited
with regard to filling

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700
gaps across, either the spatial scales,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.389
all the way from macromolecules to organs,

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:24.896
to the temporal scales?

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.030
So, today, I'm gonna tell
you a little bit about

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.999
filling a few gaps all
the way out to Life Spans.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.720
Two projects about dendritic spines

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.120
and about lifelong memories.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.149
But, I can't do this without giving you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.991
a little background on techniques.

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.283
At The National Center
that Jennifer mentioned,

00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:45.032
we use really two techniques

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.483
to do electron microscopy across scales.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:52.331
One is Serial Section Electron
Tomography where we take

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:55.310
thick sections, map them to get the best

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.553
X, Y and Z resolution.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:01:59.701
We look at systems that
can be manipulated,

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.943
so here a vestibular hair
cell is moving around,

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:03.982
that's what it's doing.

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:06.319
The top is rocking and
it's changing the output.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.319
Or we use a method that was
pioneered by Winfried Denk

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.633
called Serial Block Face Imaging.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.860
You'll see an alternative of
this from Hal Hess shortly,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.472
where you can put a microtome
inside of a scanning EM

00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:25.362
and just automatically record
image after image after image.

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:28.003
Kinda like taking a look
at a loaf of bread as you

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:29.881
keep slicing it, and get

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.712
a reconstruction with modern methods.

00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:35.763
If you selectively stain in a cell.

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:37.589
As was done by these colleagues.

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.273
This was a sample we imaged
when we first got this

00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:42.113
going about ten years ago.

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:46.819
That's the endoplasmic reticulum
in the mitotic spindle.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.793
If the endoplasmic reticulum
is stained, in this case,

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:52.756
with horseradish peroxidase,
you can then pick out,

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:53.764
these are mitochondria.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:55.249
Those are lysosomes.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.513
Wait til you see the ER,
and this cell's just in the

00:02:57.513 --> 00:02:59.596
early stages of dividing.

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:03.028
So that's all the ER.

00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:07.361
So how do you find that
stuff hiding in plain sight?

00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:14.532
First, unashamed pitch, we push
this technology quite a bit.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.973
While Harold has pushed the technology

00:03:17.973 --> 00:03:19.293
he's gonna tell you about.

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:22.741
We've been pushing this to
higher and higher resolution

00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:25.711
and bringing stains in, as
you see here, so that we can

00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:29.410
genetically mark components
in the context of this method.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.711
We pushed it, so that you
can look quite easily,

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:37.321
at structures like the golgi
apparatus, mitochondria ER.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:39.602
But we've done that through the benefit

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.792
of a long collaboration
with Roger Tsien, from

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:45.401
about the time Roger came to UCSD.

00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.642
Even before the fluorescent
proteins, but then with

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:52.533
families of proteins,
coming up with ways of

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:55.160
marking genetically for EM.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.423
Then ultimately with Alice Ting,

00:03:57.423 --> 00:04:00.683
APEX, which is a small peroxidase.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:04.100
Now, that was preceded by activity trying

00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:08.151
something called Photooxidation.

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:11.071
Using a reactive oxygen generating probe.

00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:14.791
Something as simple as Eosin,
to generate reactive oxygen

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.252
and capture diaminobenzidine,
which then can be reacted

00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:21.732
with osmium tetroxide or
ruthenium tetroxide to give

00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:24.132
you electron density in locations.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.791
At the scale of molecules,
we can see receptors marked

00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:29.702
quite clearly with this method.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.223
Here's an example, getting
us into spines now.

00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:36.093
Eric Bushong, who's here in the audience.

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:38.401
When he was a graduate
student in the lab, now he's

00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.151
a senior scientist in the
group, tried out using

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:44.412
phalloidin, which binds to actin.

00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:47.381
In this case with fluorescein,
but also with eosin.

00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:49.601
We had it specially
conjugated, to give us a way

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.683
of doing actin by EM.

00:04:51.683 --> 00:04:56.181
At that time, Francis Crick
had postulated, 1982, that,

00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:57.639
"Do spines twitch?"

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.252
You can look this up,
it's a beautiful little

00:04:59.252 --> 00:05:04.252
theoretical paper, which was
Francis' best thing being

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:05.712
a theoretician.

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:10.410
So these are all dendritic
spines marked by actin

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.859
in a confocal microscope.

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:15.440
The cell, that's a Purkinje
cell was also injected,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.973
just to see it with a red dye.

00:05:17.973 --> 00:05:21.890
At that time, our tomography
was best done with

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.221
massive microscopes.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.138
Here's a person for size reference.

00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:29.972
We could punch through with these

00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:33.322
very high energy electrons,
three million volts,

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:36.503
through samples as thick as ten microns.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.813
Kind of a light microscopic sample,

00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:39.983
but you can see inside.

00:05:39.983 --> 00:05:42.601
This is from a Fragile X
animal model, and you can see

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:45.040
how tortured, or variable, the spines are.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.718
That's a hallmark of that
disease, in animal models

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:48.551
or humans.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.513
Then if you switch to the Eosin
phalloidin, do more or less

00:05:54.513 --> 00:05:55.421
the same thing.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.730
That's the light microscopy.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.351
Actin looks like it's all over.

00:05:58.351 --> 00:05:59.761
It's not actually.

00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:01.943
It's concentrated in the
spines and if you punch

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:05.470
through it, this is not a
tomogram, it's just a projection,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.182
the spines are full with this

00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:09.021
flocculent material that's actin.

00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.662
It's not just filaments, it's
like we know in cells now,

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:13.951
a gel.

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:16.868
Actually forms dodecahedral plates.

00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:21.671
So, fast forward to today,
we continue to develop these

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.924
techniques and the math, and Rick Lawrence

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:28.016
is a Mathematician, Sebastian
Phan, who I believe is here,

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:31.340
is a Polymer Physicist,
we developed software

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.037
and methods and automated
these microscopes,

00:06:35.037 --> 00:06:36.474
so that we take as many as

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:40.444
a thousand or two-thousand
images of the same object.

00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:42.965
By tilting the sample, rotating
it, kind of like having

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:45.625
a thousand drones in
this room simultaneously

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.238
taking pictures of you.

00:06:47.238 --> 00:06:50.607
Then you have a super sampling,
so this solves to some

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:54.103
extent, what Daniels
said is the Z-Problem.

00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.796
What you just saw play,
was one of these volumes.

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:58.836
I'll show you another one,
but if you extract the

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:01.588
dendritic spine from that volume,

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.605
that's what it looks like.

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:07.806
After you use some fancy
tools to follow the actin.

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:09.574
So that's the post-synaptic density.

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:11.105
This is a little finger-like process.

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:14.445
Probably this guy was trying to extend.

00:07:14.445 --> 00:07:17.945
But this is just a surfacing of the actin.

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:21.507
Here is a more recent one
with something called the

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:25.597
Direct Detector, which we
invented at the center.

00:07:25.597 --> 00:07:30.325
Here's the spine, head, neck,
the shaft of the dendrite.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.488
These are actin polymers.

00:07:32.488 --> 00:07:35.587
The little balls you
see are actin monomers.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:37.934
Here, you can even see, if
you are close the to front,

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:39.387
membrane proteins in the membrane.

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:42.397
Then this is extracellular matrix.

00:07:42.397 --> 00:07:44.797
Perhaps the perineuronal
net, that I'll talk about in

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:45.798
a moment.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.379
What you can see actually
connects from the extracellular

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:51.016
space, through proteins in the membrane,

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:53.197
on into the cytoskeleton.

00:07:53.197 --> 00:07:56.137
That's the second part of the talk.

00:07:56.137 --> 00:07:58.804
If you look at this as a volume.

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:04.427
Just one slide, you can
see how rich this is and

00:08:04.427 --> 00:08:06.595
how we extracted with
the right algorithms,

00:08:06.595 --> 00:08:09.587
which you saw on the previous slide.

00:08:09.587 --> 00:08:12.649
So this is what we do today,
at even higher resolution

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:15.857
than this, to match up
the molecular details that

00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:18.539
are coming from structural biology.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:22.065
Then to begin with different
cadence of experiments

00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:26.337
to look at what changes during
sleep, wakefulness, time

00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:30.567
scales that we can actually
stop action quite easily.

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:35.484
So with colleagues in Munich
and in Stockholm, we developed

00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:43.026
methods to extract this kind
of information in large scale.

00:08:43.027 --> 00:08:45.416
This is just an example
of how this is done,

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:48.617
slice by slice, and you
can begin to study these

00:08:48.617 --> 00:08:51.497
and consistency between
spines in different regions,

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:55.377
or as was published in
Science recently by a group

00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:56.826
collaborating with us.

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:59.447
How this changes when you sleep or awake.

00:08:59.447 --> 00:09:02.457
Spines shrink by 20% when you sleep.

00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:05.806
More adventuresomely, we're
saying okay, if we know

00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:09.254
it's actin, or the majority
of what's there is actin.

00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:12.554
What does it look like if
you substitute for the center

00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:16.212
lines that we defined, for
the actin that you saw in that

00:09:16.212 --> 00:09:20.235
previous colorful spine
spinning, actually actin?

00:09:20.235 --> 00:09:22.426
Does that tell us
anything about the charge

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:24.176
and the crowding?

00:09:24.176 --> 00:09:27.276
So this is taking actin,
replacing all the threads.

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.794
This is actin from the PDB.

00:09:29.794 --> 00:09:30.627
Why do we do that?

00:09:30.627 --> 00:09:33.214
Because the actin is highly
charged, very acidic,

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:36.797
and this leads us to
predict that the actin

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:42.014
creates an ion biding matrix,
a gel, and it's actually

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:46.696
the sol-gel changes that
may be driving a lot of the

00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:49.605
physiology that's interesting.

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:51.776
That's a speculation.

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:56.147
Moving on, back to that
extracellular matrix,

00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:57.946
in a short amount of time,
I thought I'd try and

00:09:57.946 --> 00:10:01.366
squeeze in, what I think
is one of the most exciting

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:04.449
projects, kind of a leave from Roger.

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:09.075
This is what he and I,
and he was most excited

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.587
about when he died.

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:15.106
Projects now being led by
Varda Lev-Ram, who is here.

00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:18.246
Having to do with life-long
memories, and Martin Hetzer,

00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:22.275
who is also involved, because
this techniques overlap.

00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:26.763
Roger's hypothesis is this,
you can look it up, it's in the

00:10:26.763 --> 00:10:30.716
paper postulating that very
long-term memories might

00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:32.817
be stored in a pattern of holes

00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:35.004
in the extracellular matrix.

00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:38.497
The idea being, if the
extracellular matrix holds

00:10:38.497 --> 00:10:42.487
state and the more dynamic
things, like Daniel talked about

00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:43.916
and you'll hear more about.

00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:48.787
Know about the state of that
part of the brain, then those

00:10:48.787 --> 00:10:51.535
things that turn over will
come back or form those

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:55.456
parts of cells, guided by
the extracellular matrix.

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:58.025
Kind of like the extracellular
matrix is the stone

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:01.227
that's chiseled in, that
gives a durable state

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.466
for the brain.

00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:04.985
So that was Roger's idea,
that this extracellular matrix

00:11:04.985 --> 00:11:09.316
would be edited by
MetalloProteinases, synapses formed,

00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:12.837
synapses come to a shape
by activity or size.

00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:14.545
Predicted that the synaptic proteins,

00:11:14.545 --> 00:11:17.764
pre- and post-synaptic
would have short half-lives,

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:20.652
relative to the extracellular matrix.

00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:21.584
So how do you test that?

00:11:21.584 --> 00:11:22.634
How do you play with that?

00:11:22.634 --> 00:11:26.672
Well, sorry, this is just
a little bit more about the

00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:29.036
Perineuronal Net, which
had been described by Cajal

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:30.126
and others.

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:32.363
This is what it looks
like in light microscopy

00:11:32.363 --> 00:11:35.936
with wisteria floribunda
as a fluorescent stain.

00:11:35.936 --> 00:11:37.986
And this is some of the
molecules that are known to

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:39.235
be associated with it.

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:42.728
So you can use proteomics,
and look at that.

00:11:42.728 --> 00:11:44.717
You can stain it, sorry,
I got ahead of myself,

00:11:44.717 --> 00:11:47.970
You can stain this, the
same way that it was done

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.840
by light microscopy, by
doing a peroxidase reaction

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.871
to mark that material in
the extracellular space.

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:56.085
You can reconstruct it by
the methods that I showed

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:57.919
you, to see what it looks like.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:00.160
The synapses are in these holes.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.843
And then the question is,
"Does it stay around?"

00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:07.681
What Varda did, following a
protocol that Martin Hetzer

00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:11.339
had first done, was create
animals that are 100%

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:12.339
nitrogen 15.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.216
You're otherwise nitrogen 14,
so this is kind of the most

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:21.055
expensive and heroic
pulse-chase experiment.

00:12:21.055 --> 00:12:23.407
You can see the paradigm here.

00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:25.815
What is it, eight hundred
dollars a kilo, for the food,

00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:27.166
something like that?

00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:30.079
So these experiments, for
the food, could be a hundred

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:33.579
thousand dollars for a
colony of sufficient size.

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:37.280
Then at the right point, after
let's say, a six month or

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.147
18-month chase, with the normal nitrogen.

00:12:41.147 --> 00:12:43.500
You sacrifice animals from
the colony, grind up there

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.333
brains, do proteomics.

00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:49.699
Then you are able to ask,
synaptic proteins have short

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.188
half lives.

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:53.731
Those molecules that I said
are part of the extracellular

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:57.179
matrix at six-months, still 30% of them.

00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:58.990
At 18 months, they're
decreasing, but some of them

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.241
are quite significantly more persistent

00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:05.197
than those constituents that
everybody's excited about

00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:08.560
in synaptic plasticity,
which do turn over.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.977
This is supportive of Roger's hypothesis.

00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:17.569
Can we image N15, N14, so
then we went after tricks

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:21.736
that are done more in
geology, or in astrophysics,

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:26.399
looking at meteorites, or whatever.

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.837
Something that was taught
to me by a colleague,

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:31.952
Victoria Orphan, at Cal Tech,
working on some samples from

00:13:31.952 --> 00:13:33.282
the ocean.

00:13:33.282 --> 00:13:37.923
This is a machine that uses a
cesium-beam, knocks out atoms

00:13:37.923 --> 00:13:39.173
secondary ions.

00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:42.912
Runs em down something like
a mass spec column and then,

00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:47.071
point-by-point, you get a
collection of masses for

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:49.821
as many as seven different atoms.

00:13:51.312 --> 00:13:52.895
You can make a map.

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:59.201
So, one of the things we
tried, Nick's post-doctoral

00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:03.300
advisor, Jack McMahan,
so this goes back a way,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.371
postulated and then proved,
that agrin, a molecule that's

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:10.271
secreted into the
extracellular matrix guides

00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:13.210
synapse formation for the
neuromuscular synapse.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.793
We said, well, we have
intercostal muscles from these

00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:20.020
mice, what do the end plates look like?

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.762
Do we see a signal from this
method that I just showed you.

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.429
Yes, so that would be predicted.

00:14:28.328 --> 00:14:30.223
Here it shows you can do this.

00:14:30.223 --> 00:14:33.971
We went from there, to ask,
in these samples, from the

00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:36.262
mice that Varda grew.

00:14:36.262 --> 00:14:38.022
What about this stuff?

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:41.252
This extracellular matrix, is it old?

00:14:41.252 --> 00:14:46.085
Here you see, doing the same
sorta thing on those samples.

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:51.609
That in deed, it is. Okay?

00:14:51.609 --> 00:14:53.152
And this by the way is myelin.

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:56.272
Myelin turns out like you
saw maybe, if you were paying

00:14:56.272 --> 00:14:57.139
attention the bottom.

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:00.682
Myelin basic protein, two
other myelin proteins are old.

00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:03.001
So this is telling you,
if you look at the brain

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:06.423
after the majority of
proteins have turned over.

00:15:06.423 --> 00:15:10.051
Six months, 18 months later,
what piece parts are left

00:15:10.051 --> 00:15:11.142
behind.

00:15:11.142 --> 00:15:13.400
And here, this is the stuff

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.861
that presumably is left behind.

00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:19.322
Turns over very slowly,
and these terminals.

00:15:19.322 --> 00:15:23.822
These boutons come in, plug
in, in between, so this is

00:15:25.515 --> 00:15:29.402
how would you say, data that
is headed in the direction

00:15:29.402 --> 00:15:32.804
I think, of strongly
supporting Roger's postulate.

00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:37.204
All of this is unpublished,
but I think it's exciting.

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:39.258
It's the product of, I think,

00:15:39.258 --> 00:15:42.279
great thinking by many investigators,

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:45.516
great colleagues, great
collaborators, generous support.

00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:49.115
This is the cast of characters,
some of whom are here,

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.799
and I think with that,
maybe I might end it early.

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:55.132
(laughter and applause)
