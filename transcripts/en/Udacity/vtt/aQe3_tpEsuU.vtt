Hey team.
So,

00:00:01.147 --> 00:00:04.990
things are lot more chiller out
here since the Point Four launch.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.130
The users are happy,
our investors are happy.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.330
And now that we've got
sharing implemented,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.480
most of the features we want
in the app are basically done.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.860
I've even had enough capital to
hire Paulter on as our attorney and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.620
data scientist.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.120
&gt;&gt; That's so great to hear.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.460
It sounds like you're on track
to a very successful launch.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.640
&gt;&gt; Wait, JP.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.210
You're doing that thing.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.350
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.390
&gt;&gt; The thing you do when you're
worried about something but

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.295
you don't want to say it.

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:33.730
&gt;&gt; Well, you're both doing so well.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.490
I don't want to rain on your parade.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.220
I was just wondering if you looked
into some of the other features

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.880
Firebase offers?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, like what?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.590
&gt;&gt; Well, for example,
in version .5, if you have time,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.855
you could look into providing
some basic offline access.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.740
Firebase provides a few methods to
make it very simple to cache and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.810
persist your data locally, even when
you're Internet connection is shoddy.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.960
After that, you might want to take
a look at Firebase's offerings for

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.130
authorization and validation.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.590
It jSon database like Firebase,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.100
you can accept basically any
mishmash of key value pairs.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.025
Firebase allows you to write
some data rules server side.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.190
Then enforce the structure of your data.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.436
In addition, you can write permission
rules that based off of your users

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:20.905
authentication tests, allow you to
control read write access to the data.

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:23.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, JP.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.968
We'll think about it.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:27.208
Right now working on a slide deck for
investors.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.368
But, I guess I could have
the developer look at some of that.

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:34.304
But really JP its not like anyone
is actively trying to attack us.

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:44.304
