00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, everyone

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.670
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.840 position:56%
And I'm very happy to see you all in
the African - Middle East Division.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.440
I'm addressing you
here in the division

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.070 position:56%
but I'm also addressing all those
who will be watching this program --

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.870
not only in the United States
but also across the globe.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.250
And as you know, our
programs are webcast.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.370
And so, thank you for our team
that's webcasting this program.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.650
And we are, today, looking -- we're
going to be looking at a program --

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.690
at a subject which is impacting
many, many regions of the world.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.270
The issue of refugees.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.070
And our speaker -- and
I'm -- Dr. Yacob-Haliso --

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.040
is going to be addressing one
particular group of refugees.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.650
But what she says has
implications for --

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.610
not only Liberia but for
regions across the globe.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.240
And this is why it is
such an important program.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.280
And we're bringing her here -- she
has just flown from Lagos to be

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.490
with us and to share her thoughts,
her work, and her research with us.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.440
But let me make a little commercial
for our division as I always do.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.120
The African - Middle East
Division is one of the divisions

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.190
of the Library of Congress that
is responsible for the collections

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.150
from Africa, from the Middle
East, from Central Asia,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.860
from the Hebraic world, from
78 countries around the globe.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.310
And though these countries
have different languages,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.800
different cultures, different
scripts, they are all united

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.090
by a wide range of
issues -- problems.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:00.090
One of which is the
issue of refugees.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.310
They also are -- we collect from
these countries materials --

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.970
not only in English or French,
but the materials in the languages

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.160
in which those -- that research
and those books are written.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.010
In other words, this
division is responsible

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.870
for at least 35 different
languages from the countries --

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.070
from the 78 countries
that we represent.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.470
These materials appear in various
scripts and the collections

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.730
that we have focus on
the books, the journals,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.980
the serials, and also ephemera.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.250
Other collections on the
78 countries can be found

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.820
across the library.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.650
For example, raw [phonetic]
materials, let's say on Liberia,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.360
will be found in the raw library.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.020
Maps would be found in the
geography and map division.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.660
Music could be found
in the music division.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.970 position:56%
Recordings -- oral recordings would
be in the American Folk Life Center.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.360
Photographs and prints and posters
would be found in the Prints

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.820
and Photographs division.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.730
We also have a very large
directorate for cataloguing all

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.860
of these materials
because were we not

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.730
to catalogue them, they
would not be found.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.270
We have -- not only a large
cataloguing division and many

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.910
of our specialists, expert
cataloguers are present here.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.130
But they're also scholars and
specialists in the languages

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.350
and the cultures that we represent.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.680
So, now, we are very much looking
forward to hear Dr. Yacob-Haliso,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.690
but it would be one
of our scholars --

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.400
one of the scholars of the African
- Middle East Division, librarian

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.460
and scholar, professor, and
wide range was published

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.020
in wide range fields,
Dr. Angel Batiste,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.660
who is responsible for West Africa.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.400
And she will be introducing
the speaker today.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.700
So, Dr. Batiste.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.270
[ Applause ]

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.690
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Good afternoon.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.050
On behalf of the African section,
on behalf of my colleagues

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.520 position:56%
in the African section, it's a great
pleasure to welcome today's speaker.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.740
We're always extremely pleased
when we can have scholars

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.260
from Africa join us here
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.740
And our guest today, she's
just come in from Lagos.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.050
I know she's probably still
a little tired -- jet lagged.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.390
But she has agreed
to be with us today.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.690
So, we thank you.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:28.070

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:44.110
[ Applause ]

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.490
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso:
Thank you, Dr. Batiste,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.180
for the kind introduction.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.850 position:56%
And I want to also thank the head of
African and Middle Eastern division

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.500
of the Library of Congress,
Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.470
for granting me the
opportunity to speak

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.050
at this noon time symposium series.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.140
And thank you all for
coming out this afternoon --

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.950
at your lunch time -- to
listen to this presentation.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.700
This afternoon, I want to
turn our minds towards home.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.690
I have not -- your
own homes, I guess.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.950
Although, I bet you probably just
thought of your own homes just now.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.660
But I want us to contemplate
instead how the powerful idea

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.520
of home drives the artificial
forging of a post-conflict context

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.540
that encourages refugee return

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.550
with implications for
their reintegration.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.400
And so, this afternoon, we'll
be looking at the reintegration

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.180
of refugees in post-conflict
Liberia specifically,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:48.210
but I will focus my talk on the
local and global intersections

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.970
in the ways these refugees forage
home in the Liberian context.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.530
My paper is based on qualitative
research that I carried in

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.570
and on Liberia between
2006 and 2012,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.850
in which I employed a
triangulation of methods,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.880
in-depth interviews were
conducted with 100 refugee women,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.040
government officials, staff of
international and local agencies,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.000
community leaders, and other
members of civil society.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.300
And these were supplemented

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.850
with non-participant observation
and documentary review.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.300
I visited five of Liberia's
15 counties to collect data

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.400
for my research and four of these
five counties I visited were the

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.330 position:56%
areas of highest return of refugees.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.630
Participants were located
through snowballing and they came

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.570
from various backgrounds
and various experiences.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.480
I collected documents not
just from Liberia but also

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.510
from Geneva during my
post-doctoral time there.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.440
And I was able to also do some
intersubjective validation

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.370
of my data by speaking with
refugee expats, not just in Liberia

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.020
and outside Liberia but in Geneva.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.320
The UN [inaudible] --

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.430
at the headquarters of the
United Nations High Commission

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.000
for Refugees Office there.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.960
So, this is the basis for some

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.490
of the statements I'll
be making this afternoon.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.590
Let me also quickly say
that my analysis is informed

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.960
by a constructivist view of
international politics relying

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.300 position:56%
on Alexander Wendt's critique of the
so called structure agents problem

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.110
in international relations by
which international anarchy

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.730
and structure are deemed to
be the major determinants

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.730
of international politics
instead, of course,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.690
Wendt posits that this system is
one in which various actors --

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.560
which we will call agents here --

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.110
play significant roles
in determining structure

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.860
and are themselves in turn,
modified by structure.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.470
This is important for
my own analysis here

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.640
because it helps me recognize
that there are various --

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.730
there is in existence
various actors --

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.210
from the local to the global
operator within the domain

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.360
of post-conflict reintegration.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.070
And this makes it possible
for also --

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.890
acknowledge also, the roles of
women in their reintegration

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.830
because their narratives
are often buried

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.790
in the masculinist interpretation

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.050
of international processes
such as this one.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.760
This framework also
makes it possible

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.040 position:56%
to admit the constraining conditions
which international structure places

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.060
on the activities of the various
agents we'll be mentioning

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.360
in this paper.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.970
But at the same time, it
brings to relief the ways

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.780
in which these agents
and actors contracts

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.810
or forge their desired outcomes.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.070
In this case, the idea
of home in Liberia --

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.360
whether consciously
or unconsciously.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.540 position:56%
I will not bore you with definitions
because we know who refugees are.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.840
They're eligible basically

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.180
for international protection
under international law.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.860
And this is because national
protection has failed them.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.580
And one of the responsibilities
of the international community

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.420
to refugees is to find durable
solutions to their problems.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.240
And the three solutions that have
been applied over the decades

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.520
that the international
refugee has evolved, of course,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.570
are repatriation -- that is
return of refugees to the country

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.460
of origin; integration
which involves helping them

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.210
to acquire a new citizenship
in the country of asylum;

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.540
and resettlement with
a third country.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.680 position:56%
My focus is on repatriation and
voluntary repatriation has become --

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.610
in quotes -- "The most desirable
solution for refugee problems"

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.660
and has been promoted vigorously

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.190
by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees -- UNHCR.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.400
And, in fact, the 1990s
were described

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.570
as the decade of repatriation.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.320
The 2000s were referred
to the new era of return.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.510
And so, repatriation -- in fact,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.250
repatriation has become the
buzz word in the last two,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.810
three decades in refugee
and states practice.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:36.160 position:56%
Reintegration is supposed to proceed
concomitantly or after repatriation

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.520 position:56%
and it is a process that is expected
to result in the disappearance

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.110
of differences in legal
rights and duties

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.470
between returnees and
their compatriots.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.940
In this paper, I am not --

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.790
I am going to focus on the idea
of home, like I said earlier,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.460
because it's been noted that
one of the chief incentives

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.850
for refugees return to
the country of origin is

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.200
to recover a sense
of feeling at home.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.840
I have taken the task of home to
task because of the home to task

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.170
in one of my previous papers
where I argued that the illusion

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:23.600
of home leads to a partial illusion
of peace among returnee women.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.010
And, therefore, because of

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.710
that return may not be
sustainable in certain instances.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.780
Today, the questions that
I will be looking at relate

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.730
to how do Liberian refugees
returning from exile

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.810 position:56%
from various west African
countries encounter the country they

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.110
return to.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.230
In what ways do these returnees --
as members of various communities

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.830
and localities -- invent, shape,
and forage a home for themselves

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.740 position:56%
to enable sustainable reintegration?

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.900
What complimentary rules do local
and international agencies bear

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.000
in either particularistic
of global mandates play

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.540
in these processes
with what outcomes?

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.530 position:56%
And I'm going to argue that refugees
and returnees are not merely victims

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.370
of circumstances nor mere
wards of the national

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.430
and international system.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.950
Rather they are veritable
agents in constructing

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.280
or forging the home they return to.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.820 position:56%
We further contain here that the
returnees' perception of the country

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:30.010
of origin as home, as well as their
steady progress towards the touted

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.230
ideal of home, is significantly
shaped

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.460
by the intersecting activities
of various local, national,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.970
and international agencies
and [inaudible].

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.830
And so, I am going to --

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.860
In this presentation,
look at these --

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.760
I will begin by provided
international

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.650
and specific Liberian context
and then look at the actuals

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.200
that are involved in this process
of forging or shaping home,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.920
as well as the points of
intersection between the local

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.430
and the international agencies
and actors in the Liberian case.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.520
And then conclude with the
statements on what these means

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.880
for the process of forging home.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.610
Within the global context
between 1991 and 1996,

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.610
repatriation numbers
increased globally.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:29.640
Over one million refugees
returned to Ethiopia and Eritrea.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.100
About 1.7 million Mozambican
refugees returned

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.860
from several neighboring countries.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.120
More than 2.7 million
Afghans returned from Pakistan

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.660
and Iraq and so on and so forth.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.320
However, the trend
turned by the mid-2000s.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.070
official figures from country of
asylum and origin data indicate

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:54.440
that there has been a decline in
repatriation worldwide by 2014.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.970
Repatriation was reported
to be at a 30-year low.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:10.080
The lowest since 1983 was
recorded at just 126,800 refugees.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.950
Which was, again, significantly
lower than the year before that.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.140
These figures are from the UNHCR.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.310
Significantly, however, of
the eight countries accounted

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.970
for 95% of returns in 2015.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.690
Six of these countries
are African countries.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.780
And so, the fate of
these refugees returning

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.340
to sometimes unstable transitional
context is an important subject

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.640
of study.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.580
Liberia is a country that's had
what we'll call relative peace

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:45.640
for 133 years until the so-called
rice riots of 1980 [inaudible]

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.600
in the governments of Samuel Doe --

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.600
the military governments
of Samuel Doe.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.200
Which led to a decade of
crisis in that country.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.590 position:56%
And then, an insurgency that started
in 1989, of which the reports

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.040
of the Liberian Truth and
Reconciliation Commission says --

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.920
and I quote -- "Quickly degenerated
into a rebellion without a cause.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.470
At one point, a seven
cornered fight as represented

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.030
by seven distinct warring factions,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.040
engaged in a full blown
fratricidal civil war."

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.880
At the height of the
14-year civil war in Liberia,

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.720
several hundred thousand
Liberians fled

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.230
to neighboring countries
in a single year.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.200
It is estimated that in the cause
of the war, between 1989 and 2003,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.310
three quarters of the 3 million
strong Liberian population became

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.960
either refugees or
internally displaced.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.260
And that's a very big number.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.240
It's also estimated by
the government of Liberia

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.470
that an approximate 10%
of the population died

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.460
in the cause of that war.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.090
By the end of the civil war in
2003, the country was in ruins.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.280
All critical infrastructures
were destroyed.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.180
The economy was in shambles

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.230
with productive capacity
almost entirely depleted.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.140
Unemployment was estimated
to be over 80%.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.640
These are figures from
the Government of Liberia.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.960
And this was the dire situation
to which refugees began to return

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.550
at the end of the war in 2003.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.510
It took from about 2003
to 2012 -- thereabout --

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.290
for the majority of refugees
from neighboring countries

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.910
to make their way back
to Liberia as returnees

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.120
to their country of origin.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.980
Now, the comprehensive
peace accords that ended

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.050
that war says something --
specifies that the national --

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.560
and I'm quoting from the Accra
Comprehensive Peace Accord.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.870
It's ethical [inaudible]
Sections 1a to c.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.250
That the National Transitional
Government of Liberia,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.470
with the assistance of the
International Community,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.460
shall design and implement a
plan for the voluntary return

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.480
and reintegration of
Liberian refugees

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.050
and internally displaced
persons, including non-combatants,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.590
in accordance with international
conventions, norms, and practices.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.500
And I highlight this to show
that post-conflict order

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.890
that was designed for Liberia,
intimately embraced the rule

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.270
of international community, working
with the government of Liberia

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.740
to construct a society that would
be conducive to the restoration

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.590
of livelihood and dignity

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.000
for displaced persons
and returning refugees.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.010
How the returnees have
come to Liberia as home.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.620
And whenever I used home in
this presentation, there is --

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:45.050 position:56%
a double quotation mark around it to
indicate that it remains a concept

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.740
that I personally struggle
with and that many

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.190
of our respondents
also struggle with.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.960 position:56%
And do not agree on how the
returnees encounter Liberia as home.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:01.800
Majority of my respondents
in interviews indicated

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.210
that they fled Liberia because
of fear -- fear for their lives,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.850
for their families,
for their safety.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.960
And, of course, the most
cited reason for returning

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.260
to the country was the end of
the war and the opportunity

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.800
to participate in elections.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:25.090
Many of them indicated that they
also wanted to return to Liberia

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.780
for what we call "push" reasons.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.330
In other words, they felt pushed
out of the countries of exile

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.150
for various reasons including
suffering or unbearable conditions.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.530
People being cruel to them.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.020
These are their own words.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.530
Idleness and lack of
work in the camps

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.170
or because United Nations
High Commissioner

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.390
for Refugees said they
should return.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.930
Or because they lost
family members in exile.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.230
Or because the options

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.450
for resettlement was
not working for them.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.830
Apparently, the search for
home was partly occasioned

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:04.160
by the returnees' experiences
in exile which were antithetical

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.960
to their place of comfort
thereby propelling the refugees

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.790
to desire a better place.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.220
A place where they could
recover a sense of belong,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.930
of worth, and of dignity.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.020
All the returnees I interviewed
refer to Liberia as home.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.180
At least once in the conversation.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.970
And some, several times
over and over again.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.280
However, the political, social, and
economic situations of the country

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.600
in the post-conflict
period are the challenges

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.940
of reintegration were daunting
for these newly returned refugees.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.950
I will examine now the way in
which reintegration is forged

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.750
or constructed by various actors.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.890
Many returnees, as I said earlier,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.740
returned because wants
the feeling of home.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.040
And whenever that sense
of home is absent

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.140
or expected socio-economic
dividends are not attained,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.330
reintegration becomes uncertain.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:07.120
Laura Hammond, who worked with
Ethiopian returnees opined

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.690
that home is associated with
community and circumstance rather

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.160
than with a fixed geographical
space.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.660
Liisa Malkki who studied Hutu
refugees in Tanzania posited

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.350
that refugees identify
themselves based

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.640 position:56%
on certain socio-personal identities
such as gender, ethnicity, and age.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.360
And these are the factors

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.620
that eventually determines
one's connection to a place

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.850
and eventually, one's reintegration
in the country of origin.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.290
What this authors affirm --
and by which I confirm --

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:43.940
some of my observations is that
return to a geographical location

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.740
of memory and nostalgia is
an insufficient condition

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.290
for the reintegration of returnees.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.590 position:56%
Other realities of existence play
key roles in determining the ability

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.920
of former refugees to
settle down and thrive.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.210
In the Liberian case on this study
from interviews with agency staff

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.350
and from review of documents, we
identified a plethora of actors

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.300
that were involved in the
reintegration of refugees

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.550
and has shift the process
in significant ways.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.850
I group these into four: the
national - the governmental actors

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.190
or agencies; international actors;

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.910
community based actors;
and individuals.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.590
The most prominent of these was
the Liberian government itself.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.940
The chief government agency
with the responsibility

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.060
for Liberian returnees was the
Liberian Refugee Repatriation

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.830
and Resettlement Commission
-- LRRRC.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:39.220
We call it the L-triple
R-C, and it had offices

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.030
in all the returnee
areas and was created

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.520
by an act of parliament in 1993.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.690 position:56%
Its mandate covers refugees from all
over Liberia, as well as returnees

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.520
to Liberia, as well as
internally displaced persons.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.330
Their main goal is to ensure
repatriation is safety and dignity.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.160
And so, they partner with UNHCR
and other agencies that work

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.300
with bringing refugees
back to the country.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.600
And role of this government agency,
according to the program officer

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.080
for repatriation, is to create
a conducive atmosphere free

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.220
from harassment and other problems

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.450
and to ensure repatriation
in safety and dignity.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.740
And they perform various
tasks towards this end.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:29.180 position:56%
Now, we know that the majority of
refugees -- we know this for a fact,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:36.050 position:56%
women and children -- and so we were
interested in finding the role of --

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.410
looking for what aspect of
government is responsible

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.560
for attending to their
needs as returnees.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.710
Now the Minister of Gender
and Development, we found,

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.050
was playing an active role

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.530
in charting the post-war
position of Liberian women.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.460
They convened a national gender
based violence task force

00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.620
that was a platform for interagency
coordination for all the agencies

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.800
that work with Liberian women,
including women returnees.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.120
And this task force, we found --
I did attend some of the meetings

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.930
of the task force -- had expended
a lot of efforts to produce,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:20.070 position:56%
for example, a simplified version of
Liberia's ground breaking rape law.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.230
And they also had created
a monthly reports and form

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.280
for documenting cases of
gender based violence --

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.510
GBV -- across the country.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.590
In other -- now the accents of
implementation of these kinds

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.860
of policy instruments is a
separate matter by itself.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:41.630
The Ministry of Gender also
officially celebrates the United

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.490
Nation's declared 16
days of activism

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.040
against violence, against women.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.440
That's between November
25 and December 10,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.000
thereby linking Liberian
women's struggles

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.350
with global women's struggles.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.810
We found this GBV task
force replicated

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.010
in other countries that I visited.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.300
I attended a meeting
again in Lofa County.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.940
I found that the efforts
that were being promoted

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.460
in the capital were also
being promoted and replicated

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.260
in the counties which
was indeed had need.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.430
Another agency that I find
relevant to our discussion

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.830 position:56%
of the post-conflict context for
Liberian returnees is Liberia Agency

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.680
for Community Empowerment.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.430
L-A-C-E. LACE.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.220
And this organization was
specifically born out of the need

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.160
for funds for post-war
rehabilitation of infrastructure.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.670
In spite of the constraints
of external indebtedness

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.840
that made this initially difficult
for the Liberian Government

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.570
to benefit from the
World Bank's programs.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:48.210
According to government records,
the Liberian Government defaulted

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.580
on its debts in the mid-1980s.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.550
And by 2006, external debts had
soared to 4.5 billion U.S. dollars.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:02.240
Which was equivalent of
800% of the country's GDP.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.970
And the equivalent
of 3000% of exports.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:12.310 position:56%
It was because of this that the LACE
was established in 2004 by an act

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.600
of parliament to administer
a $6-billion grant

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.570
from the World Bank.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.180
And the agencies mandates, in
the words of the program manager,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.700
was community driven development
through community empowerment.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.150 position:56%
And because these are the
communities that refugees return to,

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.510
I was interested in
the activities of LACE.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.150
And one final government agency
I just mention, is the truth --

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.840
I would say was the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.850
of Liberia, the TRC,
which the Chairperson said

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.220
to me was created specifically

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.100
to promote national healing
and national empathy.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.610
Because Truth, according to him, is
the [inaudible] of reconciliation.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:07.330 position:56%
We know that return to post-conflict
context includes the capacity

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.600
of citizens to live
together in peace once again.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.550
And so, the work of the TRC was
one of those that we explored.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.080
International agencies, of course,
the most important was the UNHCR.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.610
Everywhere I went in Liberia,
the UNHCR was visible.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.490
And their activities could be seen.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.810
As a matter of fact,
the UNHCR seemed

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.060
to be the most authoritative
structure of governance

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.390
on the ground in many of
the counties that I visited.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:40.350
Even before organized repatriation,
before the government came to some

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.880
of these places, the UNHCR was
there preparing those counties

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.480
for the return of refugees
from neighboring countries.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.330
So, the agency was
engaged in several --

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.370
not just reintegration activities
or repatriation activities,

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.350
but some governance functions too.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.260
Providing health, education,
agriculture, shelter,

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.950
and several other functions.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.790
The United Nations Mission
in Liberia was another agency

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.120
that we engaged with
and saw the activities.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.040
And I want to mention here,
just one of the many NGOs

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.730
that we found acting
also on the ground,

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.630
the International Rescue Committee,

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:22.450
which specifically had
extensive programs for women.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.390
Established women's centers,
women's department programs,

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.590
women's resources [inaudible]
and did psycho-social counselling

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:38.090
with women which was a very, very
rare activity amongst other NGOs.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.800
At the committee level,
we interviewed committee

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.570
and religious leaders, youth
leaders, women leaders,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.140
but specifically, I'll
mention one here.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.600
One group here.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.800
The District Development
Committees which were created

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.660
by the United Nations Development
Program, the UNDP, and the Ministry

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.390
of Internal Affairs to bring power,
in quotes, to the grassroots.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.650
And their job was to
monitor projects carried

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.650
out by various agencies, evaluate
and report on these projects

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.620 position:56%
to ensure accountability, as well as
receive information from the people

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:18.300 position:56%
in the communities about their
needs and channel these to the UNDP.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.850
Ultimately, however, reintegration,
however conceived, is personal.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:26.960
In other words, it is the returnee
refugee's participation in his

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.580
or her own reintegration

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.170
that determines the
outcome for each person.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.060
While local and international
agencies may expend efforts towards

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.660
creating conducive
conditions in the resource,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.040
most exercise the prerogative
to return voluntarily

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.580
to access reintegration program
and to achieve the full exercise

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.390
of the rights and dignities
lost to them as exiles of war.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:56.150 position:56%
Now I'll quickly look at the global
-- how the global and the local meet

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.920
in this process of forging
home before I conclude.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.050
I have tried to skip a lot of talks

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.970
so that we can have
time to still discuss.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.060
Refugee experience has
shown that home cannot,

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.180
and does not have exactly
the same dictionary meaning

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.760
to returning refugees.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.790
One, nostalgia may invoke the
traditional expectation of home,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.740 position:56%
reintegration experiences are potent
for shifting these expectations

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.690
and act towards or further
away from the ideal.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.600
Here, in this section, I'm going
to [inaudible] process of shaping.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:40.630
Perhaps the process of invasion
or imitation of the institutional,

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:45.100
material, and ideational reference
of home in post-conflict Liberia

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.060
by both local actors and
international agencies.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:54.360
The first point here is that the
very discourse on return, on home,

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.870
reintegration, rights of
refugees, and the desirability

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:04.620 position:56%
of repatriation, that very discourse
is shift by international norms,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.130
processes, actors, and regimes
that leave little or no room

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.320
for initiative of the individual.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.150
And I give -- I explained this --

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.860
when the human security framework
was popularized by the UNDP

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.000
in the early 1990s, the UNHCR
defined reintegration in terms

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
of human security as the process
by which returnees achieve,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.360
and I quote, "a progressively
greater degree of physical, social,

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.220
legal, and material security."

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.920
When the human security framework
came under critique by said actors,

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.990
the UNHCR redefined reintegration
using human rights discourse

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.530
as legisumation [phonetic].

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:50.010
And so, reintegration -- by 2004,
came to be defined by the UNHCR

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.820
as a process that should result in
the disappearance of differences

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.400
in legal rights and duties between
returnees and their compatriots.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.090
And, of course, these frames are
basically imposed on the discourse

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:07.600
on refugee reintegration as
refugees are rarely, if ever,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.950
involved in firm and
durable solutions

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.300
at the conceptualization level.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.840
The overbearing role of
the UNHCR in this process

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.760
of norming [phonetic] is
worthy of [inaudible].

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.540
Many of our research participants
stated categorically that,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.730
while in the refugee camps,
the UNHCR was instrumental

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.420
to painting the picture of a
desirable home in Liberia in order

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.650
to encourage them to repatriate.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.850
In a fated dance, state actors

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:38.860
in post-conflict situations
replicate this idea and insist

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.270
on repatriation mainly
for political reasons.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.510
Because the success of
return and reintegration

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.440
of refugees is deemed a powerful
endorsement of the [inaudible]

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:55.810 position:56%
regime. So, the governments of these
newly post-conflict states then hand

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.970
down this conception of the
desirability of these norms.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.450
Especially here with reference
to repatriation of refugees

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.970 position:56%
through their legislatures --
meaning that they make relevant laws

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.650
and thereby create institutions
through the implementing agencies

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.710
of government, through
local governance structures

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.480
which are questioningly perpetuated
these constructs of home.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.650
Together, these global and local
forces then weave the ideational

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.260
context for return and [inaudible]

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.840 position:56%
to take place forging what is
sometimes a false sense of security.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.100
It is obvious that these ideas need
to be purveyed by certain agents

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.150
which in their function
and apply these norms

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.100
and ideas and bring them to life.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.980 position:56%
A And this is the second point here.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.660
The very determination
of actors or agencies

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.560
which eventually forge
the reintegration context

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.500
for refugees is also jointly
achieved by international forces,

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.850
national governments,
and local actors.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.920
And I give a few examples.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.440
It is a vote of the United
Nations Security Council

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.890
that establishes a
peace keeping mission

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.450
such as United Nations mission
in Liberia which became critical

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.520
to reestablishing security
in that country.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.880
And establishing stability
and democratic governance.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.910 position:56%
The UNHCR -- which occupies a
unique position among UN agencies --

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.650
Is another important one.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.510 position:56%
It is the executive committee of
the UNHCR that determines the extent

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:27.200
of the organizations involvement
in specific areas during its scope

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.840
and which, as politically

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.050
and oppressionally
[phonetic] expedient...

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.760
one refugee scholar says, and
I quote very clearly, well,

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.300
very carefully, that successive
high commissioners quickly realize

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.630
that in order to have any impact
on the world political arena,

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.110
they have to use the power
of their expertise, ideas,

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.070
strategies, and legitimacy.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:55.360
To author -- the information
and value context

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.590
in which states made policy.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:03.090 position:56%
The office of the UNHCR has tried to
project refugee norms in to a world

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.330
of politics dominated by states.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.200
For most of its history,
the office has acted

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.120
as a teacher of refugee norms.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.630
UNHCR not only acted as the
transmitter of refugee norms

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.420
but also socialize new states
to accept the promotion

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.260
of refugee norms domestically
as part of the common members

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.290
of the international community.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.350 position:56%
These decisions at that global level
are then replicated at national,

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.250
community, and local levels.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.710
In the Liberian case on the study,
for example, the government set

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:41.230
up its own refugee agency,
the LRRRC to parallel and work

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.330
with the UNHCR's objectives.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.710
When the UNDP required
community structures to work,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.600
the government set up the
District Development Committees.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.740
When the World Bank needed a
credible agency outside the corrupt

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.920
machineries of government
to administer new loans,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.340
then the government
also created the LACE --

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.110
the Liberian Agency for
Community Empowerment.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:06.890
Those we see here -- a persistent,
concurrent, and concomitant machine

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.510
of global intentions and actors
with local desires and agents

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:14.330
to forge the reintegration
context for returning refugees.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.440
The third instance I'm
going to mention here --

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.850 position:56%
that's the penultimate one -- is the
conjoining of local and global agent

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.970
in constructing reintegration
concerns especially with respect

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.260
to the determination of projects
of importance to be implemented.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.850
The data we have shows
that a lot of times,

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:40.340
the local communities are invited
to participate in the activities

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.880
of these various international
and government agencies

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.950
by suggesting projects
to be implemented.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.200
But we found that a lot of
times -- in most cases --

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.590
the role of these local agents
did not include envisioning

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.890
and program design.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.040
The fourth and final dimension
I just want to mention here

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.000
of this local and global
intersections

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.760
in the reintegration context is
a bit positive because we found,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.450
in almost every county
that I visited, that --

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.450
we found specific instances
of global level actors working

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.850
through international benedictions
and governments collaborator

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.930
with local groups to provide
reintegration services.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:34.840
So, whereas, it was difficult
to include them in the selection

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.910
of projects because those are --

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.200
[inaudible] driven and
politically driven sometimes.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.570
The global meets the local in the
Liberian context most effectively

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.340
and most positively in the
implementation of projects.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.190
And we found several
examples of certain projects.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:57.000
One of the most common that the
UNHCR used, not just in Liberia

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.560
but around the world, were the
community empowerment projects.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.040
But I found one and I
wanted to just mention here,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.130
the Voinjama District Women
Organization for Peace

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:12.510
and Development which was a
program in the Lofa county area

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.390
of Liberia founded by the UNHCR --

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.340
both managed by the women in
that committee themselves.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.750
And it was free for all
participants and they found this --

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.060
the assessed that it was
useful for their reintegration.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.960
I will conclude at this time...

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.300
My paper has explored intersections
between global and local agencies

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.840
in constructing the
[inaudible] ideal of home

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.010
for returning refugees to Liberia.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.800
International norms are
created and handed down.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.860
Various actors are created to
participate in the application

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.680 position:56%
of these norms and deliberate action
is taken by global and local actors

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.990
who collaborate on the
selection and implementation

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.780
of reintegration projects.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:03.380
The outcome of these processes

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.970
for the reintegration
of refugees is two-fold.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.540
Home becomes no more than a
fabrication for some and for some,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.730
it remains a goal to be attained.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.240
If home is a fabrication, a
product artificially constructed

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.980
by the interflow of the
various ideas, norms,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:25.110
and actors both originating and
present in the country of return,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.380
that means that returnees must
work for their reintegration

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.420 position:56%
by taking decided actions, decisions

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.270
for creating the home
that they desire.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.740
If home is destination,

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:42.250
then it means that returnees
themselves must strive

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:46.180
for that ideal.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.900
That destination they
refer to as home.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:54.580 position:56%
Because the home they remember,
usually, with time blunted nostalgia

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.540
from the pre-conflict
period no longer exists.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.660 position:56%
And the home they fled from during
the war, of course, was undesirable.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.960
And the home that they encounter

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.730
when they return is
not really perfect.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:10.950
And so, these former exiles who are
stripped of options in most cases,

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.900
must continue to forge
ahead steadily

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.660 position:56%
but surely towards that destination.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.410
A place of comfort called home.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:26.760
If they must achieve
their ideals again

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:34.380
because as Bill Bryson puts
it, "once you leave home,

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.160
you can't go home again."

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.720
And these implications
for the many refugee

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.490
and returnee repatriation
context around the globe today.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.990
I want to thank everyone
for listening.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.790
Thank you very much.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:57.040
[ Applause ]

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.340
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Thank you so much

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.090
for this rich, scholarly
contribution.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:08.650
As was noted earlier, this is
a topical issue facing several

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.760
countries at this point in time.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.690
So, we thank you for your
contribution to this topic.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.860
At this point, we will open
up for question and answer.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.040
Before I --

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.220
Your questions [inaudible],
I'd like to note

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.740
that this program is being webcast.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.330
And in asking a question, you are
giving permission to be webcast.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.510
At this point, let's
open for questions.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:46:18.040
[Inaudible comment]

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:24.220
&gt;&gt; Is there a situation in which
committees or refugees are set

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:30.630
up to determine what it is
that they need and they want

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:37.830
because very often someone
coming from across the globe

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.250
and who has been in another part

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:51.330
of the world may not really
understand what is needed

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:55.450
to recreate a home or build a new
home or to integrate [inaudible].

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:56.750
So, is there now -- are there
committees [inaudible] in order

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.050
to design projects for the
reintegration of refugees?

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.960
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso: Thank
you very much for that question.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.360
Usually in the camps, there are
committees, the refugee leadership

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.820
and various groups of
refugees are represented

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.270
in consultations before there
are mass repatriation movements

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.790
like those to Liberia
at the end of a war.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:24.690
And to a large extent,
what we find is

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:30.290
that while these refugees
are consulted and included

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:34.280
in the processes of repatriation,
and eventually reintegration,

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.440
there is not much initiative left

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.240
to the refugees beyond the
decision to repatriate.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:48.320 position:56%
In fact, in many instances in Africa
-- including the Liberian case --

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.510
there were camps in West Africa,
and I will mention specifically

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.730
in Ghana housing Liberian
refugees for instance,

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.980
why the refugees did not want
to return at the end of the war,

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.080
and the UNHCR cajoled, the
government of Ghana cajoled,

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.420
and eventually, had to
view the [inaudible] stick,

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.440
like the Kenyan Government
is doing right now

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.760
by closing the largest
refugee camp in Ghana.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.340
So, all we find is that what --

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.420
rather, refugees might
have their preferences,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.770
might have their own
ideas of what they want,

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.770
the fact is that the governments
and the international agencies tend

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.130
to have their way more often
than the refugees have their way.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:29.030
And I think that's just
what I've seen about that.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:33.450
[inaudible] what is the best
approach to that perhaps would be

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:39.350
that at the conceptualization level
then, refugees need to be involved.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.100
And that way, their voices
are entirely missing.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.400 position:56%
They are not involved in the laws --

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.360
in making the policies
that involves them.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.660
Or in the agencies --

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.490
in the government structures of
the agencies that work with them.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:58.170
And so, they are simply included
at the stage of implementation

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.010
of those policies and that's
where the problem lies.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.310
[Inaudible comment]

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.510
Yes. Yes.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:41.050
[Inaudible comment]

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.610
Thank you very much.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:47.910
If there's anything I'm saying,
really, it is that the idea

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:52.780
of home has nothing -- has
-- I'm not saying nothing.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.360
Has little to do with
geographical space.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.440
Meaning that refugees can find
home even outside their countries

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.870
of citizenship.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.930
They can find home like
some have found in Ghana

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.620
and refuse to go back to Liberia.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:11.760
And so, home then has to be defined
by all of several other references

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.490
that helps them --
like you rightly put --

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:18.980
and which is a phrase the
UNHCR uses all the time.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.280
Define safety.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.580
Define dignity.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.880
And so, that's home.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.170
So, why do I need to go back
to a post-conflict context

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:30.330
where safety is not guaranteed,
and dignity is not guaranteed.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:34.470
And that's something that
some refugees grapple with.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.770
Thank you.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:45.020
&gt;&gt; I'm interested actually in
something I'm -- it's actually --

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:50.100
I have a follow up question
on the first question.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.400
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso: Okay.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.340
&gt;&gt; I mean, sure, repatriation --

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.720
repatriazation [phonetic] is the
idea course, I understand that.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.020
But refugees don't leave
for simple reasons.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.320
I mean, it's always complex.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.120
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso:
That's correct.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.090
[Inaudible comment]

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.390
That's right.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:14.830
&gt;&gt; What guarantees are there when
these people are crossed, I mean,

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:26.880
return -- that their safety
is guaranteed, for example.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:37.000
I mean, in the case of civil
war, maybe they're discriminated

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.880
against [inaudible] ethnicity,
it could be political views.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.180
Now, you're voicing that the return

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.490
and the UN is saying
[inaudible] guaranteed that.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.800
But maybe the opposite side won.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.100
I mean, [inaudible].

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.960
How can you guarantee their safety?

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.260
How can you guarantee
their [inaudible]?

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.840
I mean, what steps are taken
in [inaudible] for example.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.210
The UN can only stay
there for so long.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.510
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso:
Thank you so much.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.410
You have just highlighted the
other issues that I didn't bring

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:04.870
into this paper but I have
engaged with in other publications.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:08.240
The fact that there are
no guarantees especially

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.390
in the immediate return context.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.740
Over the years, certainly,
the governments

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.930
in the post-conflict
country can acquire capacity,

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.870
can become stronger, and
its reach gradually extends

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.460
to the various parts of the country

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.850
where it's [inaudible]
have not been true.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:32.070
And then, there's also the problem
you mentioned that sometimes,

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:39.630 position:56%
the "enemy" -- in quotes -- is still
alive and well in the communities

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:42.850
that these refugees return to.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:45.430
And nobody is doing
anything about that.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:52.980
And that was one of the
concerns of refugees either --

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:59.370
outside Liberia who were still
refugees in Nigeria a while back.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.990
And sometimes, there's not
much the government can do.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.840
In the case of Liberia, may of the
so-called enemies were, and are,

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:12.780
holding powerful positions in
government, in their counties.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.920
And there's nothing these
refugees can do about that.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.290
It's either they refuse to
return or they just submit --

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:23.550
as some just said to me in
Liberia, they are still afraid,

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:24.850
but where else can they go?

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.150
They lack choices.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.680
And many did mention that other
solutions such as integrations --

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.980
local integration elsewhere --

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.920
or resettlement were
not available to them.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.440
So, returning to Liberia was
because they had no choice.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.910
So, in that context, the
government -- as I said, usually,

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.950 position:56%
eventually develops capacity to deal
with the harder psychosocial aspects

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.250
of return, including
safety and dignity.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.550
And the restoration of rights
to people across the land.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.330
But in the immediate context, which
I saw, it was extremely difficult.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.630
The international agencies,
I would say,

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:44.930
especially in the Liberian
context, were doing a great job.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.230
The UN mission in Liberia
was everywhere.

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.530
The UNHCR, like I said,
was everywhere.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:48.850
Where the government was
absent, they were present.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:52.900
But again, their mandates are
quite specific which, again,

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.430 position:56%
means that there isn't much they can
do but their presence seemed to --

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:02.810
in many instances, make
the returnees feel a bit,

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.350
like, they were home.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.170
And they also expressed exactly
the same worry that you expressed.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:10.750
When the [inaudible] of
the UN mission Liberia --

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.820
when it leaves, what's
going to happen to us?

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.980
Many of them said this to me.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.670
Really. And there's
nothing anyone can say

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.180
because the mission will leave.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.770
They will have to grapple
with their own governments.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.600
&gt;&gt; Another question over here.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:52.560
[Inaudible comment]

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.860
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso:
Absolutely.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.430
&gt;&gt; For instance, if you left
your country because of war,

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:04.510 position:56%
and you're a refugee in another
country, and you're going back to --

00:55:04.510 --> 00:56:57.040
[Inaudible comment]

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.620
&gt;&gt; Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso:
Thank you very much for that.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.720
I won't disagree with you.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:09.360
And one of the -- I think, I
could say one basic fact is

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.990
that when refugees return
to a post-conflict context,

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:20.110
this situation in the country of
origin, at first, is usually worse

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:23.500
than the situation in the refugee
camps where they're coming from.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.290
At least, [inaudible] the
country begins to recover.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:31.840
What I found in Liberia is not
just because there were no economic

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.780
and order opportunities, it
was instead the expectations

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:40.140
of the refugees were too high
for a post-conflict context.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.770
And so, they returned and they were
highly disappointed about the fact

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.310
that there were no
jobs, there were no --

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.960
even the queues the [inaudible].

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.980
There were not markets
for those queues.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.230
And so many such problems.

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:56.530
So, I do understand.

00:57:56.530 --> 00:58:00.780
I just see [inaudible]
speaking about what --

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:08.540
I also think that beyond appealing
to the international community,

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.860 position:56%
the individuals, like I said in my
paper, as well as the communities --

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:19.190
where they came together, they
were able to achieve some things.

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.950
If there were more instances of
their coming together to articulate

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:28.290
and find solutions, there would
have been better prospects

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.590
of reintegration.

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:33.810
But what we found instead was
a predisposition, in some case,

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.580
to what I would call
"Aids dependence"

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.220
and which has negative
consequences too.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.590
Just to give you another
side of that.

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.390
Thank you.

00:58:44.390 --> 00:59:13.280
[Inaudible comment]

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.230
Well, thank you very much.

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.290
There are studies.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:19.850
But frankly speaking,
one of the justifications

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:23.970
for my research has been that there
are very few in-depth case studies

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:27.800
that show what's happening in a
particular country over the years

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.550
which is what, I think,
I'm trying to do really.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:31.900
Following this particular case

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:35.230
since I started following
in 2006 until now.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:38.870
And for Liberia, for instance,
I found just one other study.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.960
A 2011 study that tried
to also look at some

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.260
of the issues that I looked at.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.390
Not many. And I found for, maybe,

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:49.080
Angola and a few other
countries -- Columbia.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.050
A few other countries scattered
there but while there is a lot

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:57.150
of work on refugee issues by
scholars around the world,

00:59:57.150 --> 01:00:03.210
I think we need more of an in-depth
look at each country's context

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.560
because in many instances,
context is everything

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.620
and not just the larger debates
that other scholars engage with.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.400
So, I would join you in saying
that we need to know more.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.810
The UNHCR itself, when I spoke with
expats that [inaudible] with us,

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:23.230 position:56%
of course, through its own internal
processes tries to track the results

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.160
of what they are doing
systematically.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.130
And because of that, I have
actually come to believe

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:32.070
that it's probably one of
the most dynamic UN agency

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:37.010
because it's more able to
adapt and change quickly

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:41.530
to emergent situations in its
activities around the world.

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.740
And, that's all.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.080
Thank you.
