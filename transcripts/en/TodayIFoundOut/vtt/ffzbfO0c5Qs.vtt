00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:16.079
For 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:38.429
the uninitiated, Kinder Eggs 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:46.230
are a chocolate treat widely available throughout
Europe, Mexico and Canada, with the company

00:00:46.230 --> 00:01:00.690
that makes them, Ferrero (perhaps better known
in the U.S. for being the makers of Nutella),

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.180
selling a whopping 1.5 billion of the eggs
per year.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.720
Where they don’t sell any is the United
States, where the eggs are indeed illegal

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.110
(though something of a blackmarket does exist
for them).

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.010
So why is a beloved candy the world over explicitly
banned in the land of the free?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.320
In a nut-or in this case egg-shell, Kinder
Eggs are illegal in the states because they

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.770
break a rule in the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
Regarded as a “watershed in US food policy”
the act was drafted to protect the public

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.810
from unscrupulous, or sometimes just negligent,
manufacturers.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.100
It was made law on the back of several highly
publicised cases of poisoning, most notably

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.230
the deaths of 107 people (the majority of
whom were children) in what became known as

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.060
the The 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.930
It had long been known that the previous laws
the FDA were operating under, most notably

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.880
the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, were
woefully inadequate for protecting consumers,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.060
but the Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident sparked
major public awareness of the issue.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.550
So what happened?

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.250
Although “sulfanilamide” sounds like a
terrifying chemical to ingest, it’s actually

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.220
a perfectly safe antibiotic when administered
properly, and was used, among other things,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370
at the time to good effect at treating streptococcal
infections.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.690
(It was later massively beneficial in reducing
infection and mortality rates in WWII.)

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.230
However, in an attempt to create a liquid
version of the drug (it normally came in either

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.740
powder or tablet form), the lead chemist at
S.E.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.130
Massengill Company, Harold Cole Watkins, mixed
it with diethylene glycol, commonly used today

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.620
in antifreeze and as a solvent.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.640
At the time, it was known that diethylene
glycol was highly poisonous to humans (most

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.190
notably causing kidney failure), but this
had only recently come to light, and Watkins

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.690
did not know this when he decided to use it
in the company’s elixir.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.190
He chose it owing to how well sulfanilamide
dissolved in the substance and because diethylene

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.120
glycol tastes slightly sweet.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.660
In this case, even animal testing would not
have been required to discover the substance

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.720
was toxic.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.170
Watkins would have merely needed to do a surface
level look into the compound, with several

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.230
previous published studies noting diethylene
glycol, even in relatively small doses, would

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.770
cause kidney damage and potentially failure
of said organ.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.500
But no such due-diligence research nor testing
to determine the safety of such an elixir

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.710
before putting it on the market was required
at the time.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.819
Blissfully unaware that they were about to
start selling a tasty tonic of death to their

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.819
customers, S.E.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.190
Massengill sent out 633 shipments of the elixir
in the autumn of 1937 to pharmacists across

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.190
the nation.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.000
It didn’t take long for disturbing reports
to begin coming in, including news of deaths

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.290
trickling back to S.E.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.510
Massengill Co, resulting in them issuing telegrams
requesting the elixir be sent back for a full

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.270
refund, though not disclosing to pharmacists
the seriousness of the issue if they ignored

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.270
the telegram.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.819
This all was capped by a short and truly heart
wrenching letter by one Marie Nidiffer to

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.010
President Franklin D. Roosevelt describing
what happened in the days following administering

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.600
the drug to her 6 year old daughter, who at
the time was suffering from a sore throat:

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.620
The first time I ever had occasion to call
in a doctor for [Joan] and she was given Elixir

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.830
of Sulfanilamide.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.400
All that is left to us is the caring for her
little grave.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.230
Even the memory of her is mixed with sorrow
for we can see her little body tossing to

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.840
and fro and hear that little voice screaming
with pain and it seems as though it would

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840
drive me insane.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.260
… It is my plea that you will take steps
to prevent such sales of drugs that will take

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.240
little lives and leave such suffering behind
and such a bleak outlook on the future as

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240
I have tonight.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.200
As for Dr. Samual Evans Massengill, who owned
S.E.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.380
Massengill Co., he responded to the many dozens
of deaths caused by his company’s negligence

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.710
by issuing the following statement:

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.300
My chemists and I deeply regret the fatal
results, but there was no error in the manufacture

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300
of the product.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.990
We have been supplying a legitimate professional
demand and no one could have foreseen the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.370
unlooked-for results.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.630
I do not feel that there was any responsibility
on our part…

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.060
Needless to say, when all this came to light,
the public were more than a little outraged,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.060
with S.E.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.500
Massengill’s somewhat brazen statement that
his drug company wasn’t responsible for

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.320
making sure their products weren’t simply
poison at the recommended dose before selling

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320
them only fanning the flames.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.050
To add to the tragedy, it appears Harold Watkins
did not quite have the clear conscience of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.970
Dr. Massengill, with Watkins sadly committing
suicide not long after it came to light that

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.540
his error had resulted in the deaths of over
100 people.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.080
In the end, the Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident
was the final straw, spurring the 1938 Federal

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.280
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to hopefully
prevent such a tragedy from occurring again.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.750
Among other things, the Act required that
for the first time in US history, drug makers

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.260
had to demonstrate to the FDA that drugs were
reasonably safe before they could be marketed

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.540
to the public, set standards for how different
kinds of food should look and be packaged,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.750
and specified legal maximums for “certain
poisonous substances” commonly added to

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.260
food and drink at the time.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.560
So what does any of this have to do with Kinder
Surprise?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.370
The Act also included a small section explicitly
banning the sale of any confectionery that

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.930
contains either alcohol (except in limited
quantities, as an amazing number of things

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.060
we all eat every day actually contain trace
amounts of alcohol) and banning any consumable

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.130
product that:

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.350
“has partially or completely imbedded therein
any nonnutritive object, except that this

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.790
subparagraph shall not apply in the case of
any nonnutritive object if, in the judgment

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.060
of the Secretary as provided by regulations,
such object is of practical functional value

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.550
to the confectionery product and would not
render the product injurious or hazardous

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.520
to health;”

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.210
The exceptions mentioned are things like the
stick of a Tootsie Pop which is embedded in

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.110
the candy item, but serves a purpose and otherwise
has been deemed not to make the product dangerous.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:14.730
Kinder_Surprise_EggKinder Eggs, on the other
hand, are essentially a chocolate, egg-shaped

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:36.009
shell that contains a hard plastic egg, inside
of which is a small toy.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:50.440
The toy does not serve a “practical functional
value to the confectionery” and has been

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.919
deemed by the FDA to be injurious, specifically
as a choking hazard.

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:59.490
That said, as many critics of this banning
point out, countless children choke on things

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.110
like hotdogs and large hard candy items every
year and nobody’s calling for it to be made

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.199
illegal to sell hotdogs or gobstoppers.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.440
Or, more to the point, critics note that children
are given chokeable toys all the time- and

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.199
occasionally choke on them- but nobody’s
calling for a banning of all toys that may

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.040
get stuck in a person’s windpipe.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.039
It’s also noted by critics of this particular
banning that the packaging, as with so many

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:22.810
toys that are a potential choking hazard,
have a warning on them not to give the Kinder

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.810
Surprise to children under 3 because the toy
inside presents a choking hazard.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.660
Given the many billions of Kinder Surprise
eggs sold since their creation in 1974, this

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.400
may have you wondering if they have ever been
the cause of a child’s death due to choking.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.419
The answer there is actually yes, there are
a handful of such occasions- though it appears

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.890
never having to do with a child eating the
egg and not realizing there was a toy inside.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.779
(The size of the egg makes that scenario an
unlikely proposition.)

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:56.621
Most recently, in 2016 there was the sad case
of a 3 year-old girl in Saing-Elix-le-Château,

00:08:56.621 --> 00:09:05.700
France who choked to death on one of the toys
contained in a Kinder Egg.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.720
Paramedics were able to resuscitate her, but
she later died of brain damage caused by asphyxiation.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.589
Yet another “recent” case we could find,
(somewhat illustrating the rareness of this)

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:20.190
is one in 1985 in the UK, where a 3 year old
boy, Roddy John Breslin, choked to death on

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.680
the wheels and axle of the toy inside the
egg.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.500
(The toy was meant to be constructed by the
child.)

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.560
However, after investigation into whether
this particular confectionery should be banned,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.410
the UK Department of Trade and Industry issued
a report, among other things noting,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.130
… the death did not occur as a result of
the child biting into the egg, and it appears

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.990
that eating the egg and swallowing the set
of wheels were separate events…

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.350
It is an unfortunate fact that the world is
full of small objects which can cause the

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.050
death of a child by choking.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.580
This tragic death emphasizes again the need
for parental vigilance.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.070
Needless to say, they didn’t choose to ban
the Kinder Surprise.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.220
That said, supporters of the FDA’s position
on this one note that while it’s true that

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.790
kids are apt to choke on little toys, whether
they’re encased in a chocolate egg or not,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.470
they are perhaps more likely to do so if in
the mindset of finding the toy packaged with

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.160
a tasty treat- if young enough, potentially
even not understanding that the toy inside

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.000
is not also something to eat.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.070
Of course, nobody’s lobbying for the banning
of toys in Happy Meals or non-edible birthday

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.980
cake decorations on these grounds as far as
we are aware.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.660
Unsurprisingly, this law has been challenged,
most notably by Nestle, who in 1997 introduced

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:33.610
a product called Nestle Magic (essentially
a not-so-subtle ripoff of the Kinder Surprise,

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.220
comprising of a chocolate ball with a plastic
casing inside that contained a tiny Disney

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:45.710
character toy).

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.830
When Nestle was preparing to launch the product,
the FDA explicitly notified them it was illegal

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:57.130
under the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, but Nestle disagreed, noting the product

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.820
was completely safe so should be considered
one of the exceptions.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.200
Their position was backed by a report from
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.589
did their due diligence on the candy and determined
it, and the non-edible item inside, were not

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:11.959
a choking hazard.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:17.740
Despite the warning from the FDA, Nestle launched
the product a month after the FDA contacted

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.120
them about it.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.920
A spokesman for Nestle, then vice president
for corporate and brand affairs, Laurie MacDonald,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.430
stated they decided to move forward with the
product “because we believe it’s legal.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.240
We believe we have an honest disagreement
on a technical issue.'”

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.490
Nestle also attempted a political lobbying
blitz to change the law, including trying

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.920
to get Congress to embed wording in an Agricultural
Appropriations bill that would have made their

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.730
product legal, with Representative George
Nethercutt of Washington state, whose district

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:53.670
just so happened to include a large Nestle
plant employing hundreds of voters, championing

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.670
the tweak in wording.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:12:00.089
A heated legal battle was waged, with Mars
(Nestle’s chief rival in the states) leading

00:12:00.089 --> 00:12:01.579
the charge against Nestle.

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:04.140
Although Mars ultimately claimed to be acting
out of concern for the public, they initially

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.150
denied having anything to do with the campaign
to confirm the candy was illegal.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.840
It was only later that it emerged that Mars
had, in fact, attempted to fund the case put

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.310
forward by public interest groups, at first
behind the scenes before their involvement

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.310
was discovered.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.640
They also initiated their own lobbyist blitz
to convince the appropriate politicians that

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.970
Nestle Magic was dangerous (no doubt, to Mars’
bottom-line).

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.579
Ultimately Nestle was forced to take the product
off the shelves, with precedents such as this

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:28.079
making it practically guaranteed that Kinder
Eggs will, at least for the foreseeable future,

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:30.670
not be available for sale in the United States.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.720
This has resulted in a small, but thriving
black market for the candy due to the toys

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.860
inside being highly collectable, as well as
the fact that it makes for a great candy to

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.480
put in an Easter basket particularly.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.970
In fact, United States’ customs agents note
that they see a massive upswing in attempts

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.839
to bring the candy into the country around
Easter.

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:52.079
They also warn that attempting to do so, even
if it’s just for your own personal use and

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:56.709
not you trying to use the eggs for commercial
purposes, can see you slapped with a massive

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.310
fine.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:09.361
For example, in one case a couple returning
to the United States from Canada was fined

00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:17.080
$12,000 dollars for trying to bring 10 Kinder
Eggs into the country, to be eaten by their

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.680
own school aged kids.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.100
This said, such heavy-handed punishments are
rare and in most cases the eggs will simply

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.630
be confiscated by customs agents.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.921
However, according to a self-described Kinder
Egg smuggler called Joe Wos, he has on at

00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:34.170
least one occasion been allowed to enter the
US with the toys contained inside Kinder Eggs.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.870
In this case, the customs agents in question
made him eat all of the eggs, rather than

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.010
just allowing him to discard the chocolate
in the trash and take the toys.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:18:19.429
Wos noted that “They wanted to see me suffer,
so I had to eat 20 chocolate eggs.”
