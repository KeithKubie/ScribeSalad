1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.500
Relatively,
but it's not required.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.700
That's why people come to it now.
You can't get the truth from mainstream media.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.720
While I was trying to explain to a friend who was talking about doing a podcast,

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.470
a deal with a network and I was like,
stop.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.740
You can't decide one thing that you can have where you can,

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.450
it can be mainstream and it's free of everything.
Free of any influence,

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960
and you're going to let a bunch of pen,
pencil pushers and button pressers.

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.160
They're gonna tell you what you can and can't say which direction you can and

9
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.980
can't go.
You know they're going to try to influence you,

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
but isn't Google doing that now?
What do you mean with conservatives?

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.240
Like shutting down Dennis Prager.
It's like a fucking,
what do you mean?

12
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.500
W W goes flower as well.

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.830
It was owned by go about a company.
Right.
Okay.
What I'm talking about a company,

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
you going into business with them?
Yeah.
You can wear your podcasts.

15
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.790
You're free and independent.
Right.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.890
It's probably the only thing in the world where you can be completely free and

17
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.600
independent and still reach millions of people.

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.600
It really is the only thing in the world.
But,
but,
but how,
what is Google doing?

19
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:07.770
What I'm saying?
Google owns youtube.
Right,
right.
And uh,

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.630
people like Dennis Prager religious right guy is well is show gets shut down on

21
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:15.840
youtube.
Have we managed shutdown?
They shut at the,
he's suing.

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.780
He's sewing fucking gold bowl.
I didn't know about this.
Yeah,
I know.

23
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.640
He does those shows with a Corolla Corolla.
So listen to them.
And I lived in La.

24
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.940
He's a conservative religious Jewish guy.
I've listened to him a hundred.
Yes.

25
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.220
They consider it hate speech.
I mean that's,

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.010
that's when we get into dangerous territory.
Wait a minute,
I pull up,
uh,
what,

27
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:35.850
what happened to him?
Cause I'm,
I'm completely ignorant about this.

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.110
This is the first time I'm hearing about this.

29
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:41.040
So this is going to go to the Supreme Court.
Really?
I think so.
They pulled it.

30
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.060
So they took his page down.
They said you can't have a page on youtube anymore.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.600
Yeah.
They say shut the show down.
Do you remember what it was about?

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.630
Not specifically,
but I know it was labeled hate.

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.870
And if you listen to this guy for 10 minutes,
he's the most congenial,

34
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.820
fair minded,
uh,
you know,
but he's,
he's a,
you know,

35
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.000
a religious guy.
Do you know that shit doesn't fly in?

36
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.680
Do you know Douglas Murray is,
he's actually a,
her who is,
he's a,

37
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.760
he's a a,
an intellectual from England who wrote about,

38
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
wrote the book about immigrants in Europe called the strange death,

39
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.080
I think it's called Islam in the strange death of Europe.
And uh,

40
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.380
he's basically talking about how people from these countries that have

41
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.660
immigrated into Europe or changing the culture,

42
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.950
changing the culture and North Africa.
There's all sorts of,
you know,

43
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.370
crimes and things that are happening that didn't exist before and people are

44
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.160
developing these communities of likeminded people that didn't exist before.

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.190
No go zones.
And,
and he's saying that this is,
you know,

46
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:48.090
this is fundamentally dangerous,
but he's saying it from a point,

47
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
a perspective of understanding the actual facts involved and talking about the

48
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:57.120
situation and talking about how these are people that don't respect homosexuals.

49
00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:00.260
They want to throw them off roofs and they have these opinions.

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.570
They have these opinions about people that are extremely antiquated,

51
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.200
not aligned with European values in the modern Western world.
Right.

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.270
He and Sam Harris had a conversation and that conversation got flagged on

53
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.920
Youtube.
Uh,
it got flack as someone put it up in there.
You know,

54
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.410
you make a,
like a little watch list.
What is it called?
What was it called?

55
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:25.120
The v the list.
You could,
will you put it on Youtube,

56
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.940
on your channel where you could the playlist.

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.930
So he puts it on his playlist and he gets a compute,
uh,

58
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.950
a community guideline strike against him for putting up this conversation

59
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:37.150
between two intellectuals.

60
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.130
So I have this conversation with this lady at Youtube and I said,
well,
why,

61
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.930
why would you do that?
Why,
why does that get?
She goes,
well,
it's hate speech.
I go,

62
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:44.920
it's hate speech.

63
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.550
Have you talked about to intellectuals having a discussion about a real thing

64
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.860
that's happening right now in Europe?
And you're saying hate speech?

65
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.160
If you listen to the podcast,
there's no slurs used.
Just facts.

66
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.000
They're just talking about.
But this is,
this was the way she said it,

67
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.510
cause it's hate speech.
I'm like,
you had,
you said that so easily.
Yes.

68
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.460
You'd never seen this.
A lot of power,

69
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.570
but it's also a lot of irresponsible power or responsible use of power.

70
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.400
<v 1>But,
but,
but,
but my point is they're cracking down on people who lean.
Right.</v>

71
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.650
Whether it's Twitter,
yes.
100% true.
Yeah.
And uh,

72
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.200
that's a big fucking problem.
A hate speech.

73
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.430
We're going to let Google decide though.

74
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.580
What's the name of the company that owns alphabet?
Uh,

75
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.170
they're going to decide what,
what I,
I brought that up on.

76
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200
I brought that up on a tough crowd years ago about when you disagree with a

77
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.830
liberal or whatever you're arguing with,
they always go,
oh,
you're a hater.

78
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.940
They would keep saying that.
And that's what it turned into.

79
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.530
If you just disagreed,
you're a hater now.
It's you're a bigot or a racist.

80
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:51.530
If you didn't agree with Obama's policies,
you are bigot or a racist and,

81
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.610
and that shit works.
That's been working for the left the years.

82
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.260
But now that the social media,

83
00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:00.580
Google controls almost all the information you want,
you and I hear every day.

84
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.350
I mean,
that's why it's so dangerous.
So look up.
Yeah.
Is uh,
uh,

85
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.940
is the first example that comes to mind.
[inaudible] that guy [inaudible] she me,

86
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.980
um,
uh,
yeah,
because he's,
he's,
you know,

87
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.930
a Christian,
no,
whatever.
But he's not he,
yeah,
he's Jewish.
But,

88
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.530
<v 2>but you can get up it unless,
unless I'm,
what I just read was wrong.</v>

89
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.520
They weren't w from youtube at least they weren't deleted.
They were restricted.

90
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.880
Put it like me and you're like,
okay,
thanks Shanghai.
Show up that uh,
the,

91
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.500
the adult thing,

92
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.020
like you have to have an account that says you're 18 or older or something like

93
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.530
that.
And they were fighting,
having a lawsuit against that,

94
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:40.920
saying that what they have in their videos or not shouldn't be behind that.

95
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.480
Like that wall,
whatever that is.
They also then,
but this is my point,

96
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:48.120
you have to go to youtube to get the store,
hold on.
Sorry.
No,

97
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.340
I'm on their website.
I went to a couple different websites to see it,

98
00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:54.480
but they were also,
like yesterday they had ads blacklisted from Spotify,

99
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.980
so they had ads that were I guess initially approved

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 0>and now they have been disapproved and they haven't really explained to them</v>

101
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:05.720
when those triggers as well.
He's so and so,
but his page is still up,
you know,

102
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.710
Corolla,
don't I?
Yeah,
I believe that's come about.
Yeah.
Well,

103
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.670
but the youtube page is still up.
Your shows not up his own.

104
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.010
His show was shut down.
They might've,
they might've taken it down by now.

105
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.880
This is like,
this is kind of from a couple months ago.
Yeah.
They shut them down.

106
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.170
So if you go to the dentist,
Prager youtube channel,
that doesn't exist.

107
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.780
So the idea that they would make that 18 plus because it's conservative.

108
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.190
That's hilarious.
It's up.
This is it.
Right?
Okay.

109
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.740
This is this channel Bro.
Prager U.
Yeah,
that's true.

110
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.360
But he's got a million subscribers,
million 940 shut his shell down.

111
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.610
I only brought it back up.
Is that what you're saying?

112
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.780
Maybe that he could run any lot.
So do you have a video up from an hour ago?

113
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.290
Spotify,
bands,
Prager from advertising,
Google prego lawsuit.
I mean,

114
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.690
that's what it was about.
It's about them being restricted.

115
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.670
I am angry because we're not getting the full story here.
Well,

116
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.720
I mean that it's up right now.
It's,
he's uh,

117
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.940
he's still on him.
Yeah,
no,
I believe you.

118
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.870
So my point being is these big tech,

119
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.650
big tech companies,
uh,
crushing conservative.
Well,
when's the most part?

120
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.100
Yes.
And here's a good way to look at it.

121
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:18.140
If you're going after a guy like Dennis Prager.
Yeah.

122
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.680
Who again is most congenial guy,
never swears.
Very,

123
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.700
very mild mannered,
very cool and calm.

124
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:29.780
And whether you agree with them or disagree with them,
it's not the,

125
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.150
the way to go about something like this.

126
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.850
If you disagree with someone who's not to to shut them down.

127
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.080
I was to have a debate.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And that's not happening.
Well,

128
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.880
you know when you saw the Google memo,

129
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.330
you saw what happened with that guy when he provided all this information about

130
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.410
one of the reasons why women don't get into tech and they labeled him as being a

131
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.530
massage.
This a woman hater and defined like,
no,

132
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:54.560
he's giving you scientific studies that show that women have different
interests.

133
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.300
Is that Lauren Summers you're talking about?

134
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.050
There's been a few since Lawrence Summers was actually the president of Harvard

135
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.670
and he was giving a speech and that's all he said he was.

136
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.880
He brought up the numbers as far as males go into science and math.

137
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.640
He didn't say women are good at it and he got fucking canned from Auburn.
Yeah,

138
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.460
yeah.
You can't have anything that's fascism.
Yeah.

139
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.750
If it disagrees with the orthodoxy,
they'll come down on you.

140
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.500
Even if it's factual like James Demore and you could clearly back it up.

141
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.730
You could look at the actual numbers.
Not only that that James did,

142
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.940
more guy put a page and a half in there on strategies for encouraging women to

143
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:36.380
get into tech.
I mean,
if he was a real massage tomorrow,
Google.
Google,
yes.

144
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.980
He's the Google memo,
right?
That was what started off the,

145
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:41.180
it's all these intellectuals came to his side.
They'd go,
look,

146
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.190
why are we doing all this research?

147
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.070
If you guys completely ignore every time it comes up,
right?

148
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.190
Like you're pretending that this research is not valid.
This research is,

149
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.110
it's it's scientific information that shows that certain types of people are

150
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:57.110
more interested in different things.
We've known that forever.

151
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.470
That's why boy toys and girl toys are different because boys and girls like

152
00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:03.350
different shit.
