00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.810
One of the great and slightly strange dangers
of falling in love with someone is how we

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.919
may respond the day they start to love us
back. Some of the reasons we fall in love

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:16.289
with people is because we long to escape from
ourselves into the embrace of a person who

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.270
appears as beautiful, perfect and accomplished
as we feel ourselves to be flawed, dumb and

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.640
mediocre. But what if such a being were one
day turn around and love us back? Nothing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.090
could discredit them faster. How could they
be as divine as we'd hoped for when they have

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.320
the bad taste to approve of someone like us?
It turns out that one of the central requirements

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.190
of a good relationship is a degree of affection
for ourselves; built up over the years, largely

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.559
in childhood. We need a legacy of being deserving
of love in order not to respond very obtusely

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.940
to the affections granted to us by adult partners.
Without a decent amount of self-love, the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.720
love of another person will always prove sickening
and misguided – and we will self-destructively

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.659
– though unconsciously – set out to repel
or disappoint it. It will simply feel more

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.700
normal and therefore comfortable to be disliked
or ignored when that is mostly what we have

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.380
known. If we are not wholly convinced of our
own lovability, receiving affection can appear

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.680
like being bestowed a prize for an accomplishment
we don’t feel we ever earned. People unfortunate

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.330
enough to fall in love with self-hating types
must brace themselves for the recriminations

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.780
due to false flatterers. There is an old joke made by Groucho Marx about not deigning

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.530
to belong to a club that would accept someone
like him as a member. We laugh at the Marxist

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.690
position because of its absurd contradictions:
how is it possible that we should both wish

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.840
to join a club, and yet lose that wish as
soon as it comes true? Why wouldn’t we just

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.290
be happy to have been allowed into this club?
The answer lies in self-hatred; because for

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.090
many of us, being accepted into a grand and
beautiful club doesn’t feel like what our

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.480
inner psyches have been shaped to accept.
We wonder how we can continue to believe in

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.730
a club, or indeed a beloved now that they
believe in us. There is usually a troubling

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.340
Marxist moment in every relationship, a moment
when it becomes clear that love is going to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.840
be reciprocated; that we won’t simply admire
someone from afar without hope of mutuality.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.959
The way the crisis is resolved depends on the balance
between self-love and self-hatred in our own characters. If self-hatred

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.780
gains the upper hand, then the one who is
being loved back will declare that the beloved

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.660
(on some excuse or other) is just not good enough
for them (not good enough by virtue of associating

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.959
with no-goods). But if self-love gains the
upper hand, then both partners may accept

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.780
that seeing their love reciprocated is not
proof of how low the beloved is, but instead of how

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.440
lovable they have themselves turned out to
be. It emerges that knowing how to love

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.190
ourselves a little can be one of the kindest
and therefore most romantic things we can

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.610
ever learn to do for our partners.
