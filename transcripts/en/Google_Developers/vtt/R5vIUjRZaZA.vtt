SHAMS ZAKHOUR: Hi.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.050
So I've been a Dart
writer at Google

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.560
for a little over four years.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.330
And before that, I was a Java
writer for 10 years at Sun

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.400
and then four more
years at Oracle.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.540
So when I came to Google,
it was just-- we had just

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.620
launched 1.0 of Dart,
maybe a month by the time

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.360
I started in mid-December.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.870
And I just felt there was
this lack, this serious lack

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.970
of a cute mascot.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.880
I mean, languages
need cute mascots!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.229
So I finally got--

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.000
like Duke or Android
or Go, the Gopher.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.590
So I finally got the
go-ahead for this conference

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.790
to make a mascot.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.365
So I was working with a
vendor I found in New York,

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.240
going back and forth.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.120
And there's a lot
of detail involved

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.590
that you might not expect.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.460
We had drawings.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.740
We were going back and
forth on eyes and eyebrows

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.620
and how 3-D the tail
was and all this.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.440
And we ended up
with a specification

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.930
that I never actually saw,
but I said the size I wanted

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.970
and whether it has a tuft
of hair and all this.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.692
So then that was sent off to
a factory, and we got this.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:13.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.720
Now, that might be cute,
but what was interesting

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.030
was she sent it
to two factories,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.644
the same specification.

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:24.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.120
Woo-hoo!

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.560
So I like the size of
this one, but come on.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.285
This is cuter.

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:36.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.130
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: Come on.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.210
So this is what we ordered
for this conference.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
And I wanted it smaller,
but that would only

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.180
happen if we had another
three weeks to do

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.955
a prototyping cycle,
which we didn't do.

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:51.330
They weren't
willing to just make

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.370
it smaller without a prototype.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.430
So I figured that
once we deplete these,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.350
we can order new ones
at a smaller size.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.720
And then, because you
guys are early adopters,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.018
you'll get a family.

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:03.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.720
So if you exit this way, you
can have your Dart plushy.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.470
