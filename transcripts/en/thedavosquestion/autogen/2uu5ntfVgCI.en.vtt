important in terms of them getting their
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.529
important in terms of them getting their
knowledge we also need to get these

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
knowledge we also need to get these
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270

people to start thinking of how they can

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
people to start thinking of how they can
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.530
people to start thinking of how they can
innovate you know look at their

look at things differently so if you'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
look at things differently so if you'll
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.160
look at things differently so if you'll
take a lot of work because if you look

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
take a lot of work because if you look
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660
take a lot of work because if you look
at the day of the most of the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
at the day of the most of the
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.160
at the day of the most of the
educational systems that you have to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
educational systems that you have to
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.790
educational systems that you have to
gain I find more of them a more academic

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
gain I find more of them a more academic
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.280
gain I find more of them a more academic
but i think if we make that shift in

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
but i think if we make that shift in
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.430
but i think if we make that shift in
terms of realizing that times have

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
terms of realizing that times have
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.810
terms of realizing that times have
changed you need to have a more

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
changed you need to have a more
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.479
changed you need to have a more
innovative ver society then we'll put in

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
innovative ver society then we'll put in
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.120
innovative ver society then we'll put in
a lot of emphasis in terms of empowering

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
a lot of emphasis in terms of empowering
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.370
a lot of emphasis in terms of empowering
these guys or you know they at the youth

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
these guys or you know they at the youth
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.320
these guys or you know they at the youth
to become innovative that will lead to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
to become innovative that will lead to
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.520
to become innovative that will lead to
use of technology in a better way

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
use of technology in a better way
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.800
use of technology in a better way
because i believe that most of the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
because i believe that most of the
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.990
because i believe that most of the
solution so I mean solution to most of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
solution so I mean solution to most of
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.490
solution so I mean solution to most of
the problems that we face today or the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
the problems that we face today or the
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110
the problems that we face today or the
challenges I can place today and Africa

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
challenges I can place today and Africa
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.229
challenges I can place today and Africa
will default by us and one of the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
will default by us and one of the
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.090
will default by us and one of the
biggest assets as you have today is you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
biggest assets as you have today is you
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.470
biggest assets as you have today is you
know if you can build a knowledge base

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
know if you can build a knowledge base
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.590
know if you can build a knowledge base
that leverage

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
that leverage
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.110
that leverage
technology then we also be able to take

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
technology then we also be able to take
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.380
technology then we also be able to take
it to the next level to use technology

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
it to the next level to use technology
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.080
it to the next level to use technology
use I CD for example to come up with

this they will be able to take this
 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.350
this they will be able to take this
forward and use whatever technology with
