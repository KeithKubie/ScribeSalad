I'm going to start with the most basic

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849
I'm going to start with the most basic

I'm going to start with the most basic
definition and that is free access of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720
definition and that is free access of
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.140
definition and that is free access of

public immediately after publication the
 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.880
public immediately after publication the
basic is that publishers who provide

publish open access journals what's the

publish open access journals what's the

selective journals by that I mean we get

00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:02.129
selective journals by that I mean we get
 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:05.059
selective journals by that I mean we get
a large number of submissions we carry

a large number of submissions we carry
 

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:08.629
a large number of submissions we carry
out stringent peer review thus we have a

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:26.420
open access journalist to sell the news
 

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.480
open access journalist to sell the news
content an example of that is the

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.490
content an example of that is the
 

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.699
content an example of that is the
British Medical Journal they make all of

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:30.709
British Medical Journal they make all of
 

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.400
British Medical Journal they make all of
their research content open access and

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.410
their research content open access and
 

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.530
their research content open access and
sell subscriptions to the news content

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.540
sell subscriptions to the news content
 

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.119
sell subscriptions to the news content
they've a very large news section I'll

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:40.129
they've a very large news section I'll
 

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:42.639
they've a very large news section I'll
use bmj again is an example another way

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:42.649
use bmj again is an example another way
 

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.769
use bmj again is an example another way
to subsidize is to sell subscriptions to

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:44.779
to subsidize is to sell subscriptions to
 

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:47.050
to subsidize is to sell subscriptions to
other journals in a stable of journals

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.060
other journals in a stable of journals
 

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.869
other journals in a stable of journals
so the bmj group publishes a whole lot

00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:49.879
so the bmj group publishes a whole lot
 

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:52.679
so the bmj group publishes a whole lot
of journals almost all of them are

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:52.689
of journals almost all of them are
 

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:54.990
of journals almost all of them are
subscription-based they offer no

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000
subscription-based they offer no
 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.879
subscription-based they offer no
research content open access and that's

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:57.889
research content open access and that's
 

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:59.679
research content open access and that's
subsidizing the open access in their

00:13:59.679 --> 00:13:59.689
subsidizing the open access in their
 

00:13:59.689 --> 00:14:03.600
subsidizing the open access in their
flagship journal to the research papers

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:03.610
flagship journal to the research papers
 

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.619
flagship journal to the research papers
and a final way to subsidize author

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:08.629
and a final way to subsidize author
 

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:11.470
and a final way to subsidize author
payments is by publishing an archival or

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480
payments is by publishing an archival or
 

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.920
payments is by publishing an archival or
high volume open access journal and a

high volume open access journal and a
very successful example of that that

00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:17.439
very successful example of that that
 

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:20.619

even though serials are still at a very

problem for us the cost is still high

first in the u.s. initiative that you
see undertook we negotiated this

00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:47.649
see undertook we negotiated this
 

00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:49.550

effective for the two thousand nine and
two thousand ten years of our license so

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.230
two thousand ten years of our license so
 

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.710
two thousand ten years of our license so
it's a two-year pilot under which all

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720
it's a two-year pilot under which all
 

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.010
it's a two-year pilot under which all
you see authored articles are published

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.020
you see authored articles are published
 

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.960
you see authored articles are published
with full and immediate open access

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:02.970

this was negotiated as part of our

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:09.540
this was negotiated as part of our
 

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.720
this was negotiated as part of our
license fee for the journals we did

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:11.730
license fee for the journals we did
 

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.460
license fee for the journals we did
there was no increase in our license fee

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:13.470
there was no increase in our license fee
 

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.990
there was no increase in our license fee
for the journal so essentially we are

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000
for the journal so essentially we are
 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.640
for the journal so essentially we are
paying Springer what we were paying to

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:16.650
paying Springer what we were paying to
 

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.710

whatever we had negotiated for the for
 

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.620
whatever we had negotiated for the for
that subscription period so we are not

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:24.630
that subscription period so we are not
 

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.450

that awareness of things like that tends

that awareness of things like that tends
to degrade over time so my guess is that

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.290
to degrade over time so my guess is that
 

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.220
to degrade over time so my guess is that
the issue here is awareness and not an

those things so some differences between

streams so right now we we handle hand

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:33.850

publishers a pretty big check and we

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:35.380
publishers a pretty big check and we
 

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.930
publishers a pretty big check and we
could still hand publishers a pretty big

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:36.940
could still hand publishers a pretty big
 

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.250
could still hand publishers a pretty big
check and that's one financial

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:38.260
check and that's one financial
 

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.440
check and that's one financial
transaction so it preserves some of the

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:40.450
transaction so it preserves some of the
 

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.540

open access publishing there are more
readers and there are authors so

higher fee we've also thought a little

higher fee we've also thought a little
bit about submission fees and I just

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:56.630
bit about submission fees and I just
 

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.329

many in the publishing industry have
 

00:40:08.499 --> 00:40:11.769
many in the publishing industry have
have asserted is that part of the growth

00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:11.779
have asserted is that part of the growth
 

00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:15.849
have asserted is that part of the growth
in the cost of journal publication is a

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:15.859
in the cost of journal publication is a
 

00:40:15.859 --> 00:40:17.440
in the cost of journal publication is a
result of the growth in journal

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:17.450
result of the growth in journal
 

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:20.349
result of the growth in journal
publication itself and this has been

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359
publication itself and this has been
 

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:22.930
publication itself and this has been
studied by a number of folks showing

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:22.940
studied by a number of folks showing
 

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.109
studied by a number of folks showing
that there's been really a quite a

00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119
that there's been really a quite a
 

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.420
that there's been really a quite a
steady increase over time in the rate of

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:28.430
steady increase over time in the rate of
 

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.519
steady increase over time in the rate of
publishing over very long time frames of

00:40:30.519 --> 00:40:30.529
publishing over very long time frames of
 

00:40:30.529 --> 00:40:33.609
publishing over very long time frames of
about three percent per year and if you

00:40:33.609 --> 00:40:33.619
about three percent per year and if you
 

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:36.729
about three percent per year and if you
look at between 1980 and 1995 for

00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:36.739
look at between 1980 and 1995 for
 

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:38.709
look at between 1980 and 1995 for
example if you look at the growth in

00:40:38.709 --> 00:40:38.719
example if you look at the growth in
 

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:42.130
example if you look at the growth in
research rd workers the growth in

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:42.140
research rd workers the growth in
 

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.539
research rd workers the growth in
articles that grows in journals they

00:40:43.539 --> 00:40:43.549
articles that grows in journals they
 

00:40:43.549 --> 00:40:46.029
articles that grows in journals they
also fall follow this same trajectory

00:40:46.029 --> 00:40:46.039
also fall follow this same trajectory
 

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:49.120
also fall follow this same trajectory
and so there's just more stuff and more

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.130
and so there's just more stuff and more
 

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.940
and so there's just more stuff and more
stuff more stuff every year well so

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:51.950
stuff more stuff every year well so
 

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.559
stuff more stuff every year well so
we've got a little bit about and

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:53.569
we've got a little bit about and
 

00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:55.029
we've got a little bit about and
meanwhile of course we hear that the

00:40:55.029 --> 00:40:55.039
meanwhile of course we hear that the
 

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:57.640
meanwhile of course we hear that the
cost of peer review and and the cost of

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:57.650
cost of peer review and and the cost of
 

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.660
cost of peer review and and the cost of
selectivity is very high and as we see

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:00.670
selectivity is very high and as we see
 

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.400
selectivity is very high and as we see
increasing growth around the world we

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:03.410
increasing growth around the world we
 

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.279
increasing growth around the world we
also see that we r we libraries are

00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:06.289
also see that we r we libraries are
 

00:41:06.289 --> 00:41:08.559
also see that we r we libraries are
paying for that submission that increase

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:08.569
paying for that submission that increase
 

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:10.450
paying for that submission that increase
in submissions and so is there a way to

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:10.460
in submissions and so is there a way to
 

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.209
in submissions and so is there a way to
use submission fees to diversify revenue

00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:13.219
use submission fees to diversify revenue
 

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:15.670
use submission fees to diversify revenue
streams there are some fields that do

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680
streams there are some fields that do
 

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.660
streams there are some fields that do
have submission submission fees so in

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:19.670
have submission submission fees so in
 

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.670
have submission submission fees so in
this example this or a hypothetical

worldwide journal publishing system at

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:26.930
worldwide journal publishing system at
 

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.209
worldwide journal publishing system at
eight point nine billion dollars which

00:41:30.209 --> 00:41:30.219
eight point nine billion dollars which
 

00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:32.380
eight point nine billion dollars which
I've seen figures of eight billion

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:32.390
I've seen figures of eight billion
 

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.589
I've seen figures of eight billion
dollars some though give her a give or

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599

the current estimate seemed to be

an average rejection rate has been said

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.630
an average rejection rate has been said
 

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.300
an average rejection rate has been said
to be fifty percent so if you do the

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:51.310
to be fifty percent so if you do the
 

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.300
to be fifty percent so if you do the
math and you assign a hypothetical

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.310
math and you assign a hypothetical

would produce another 270 million

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:00.820
would produce another 270 million
 

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.270
would produce another 270 million
dollars under this calculation to the

publishing system as a whole obviously

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160
publishing system as a whole obviously
 

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.500
publishing system as a whole obviously
more of that would flow to the very

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:07.510
more of that would flow to the very
 

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:11.280
more of that would flow to the very
selective journals but it tracks it

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:11.290
selective journals but it tracks it
 

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.230
selective journals but it tracks it
tracks reasonably well with the growth

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:13.240
tracks reasonably well with the growth
 

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.230
tracks reasonably well with the growth
in publishing so I know many publishers

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240
in publishing so I know many publishers
 

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.340
in publishing so I know many publishers
have said the overhead and

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:17.350
have said the overhead and
 

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.109
have said the overhead and
administrative cost of processing

00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119
administrative cost of processing

administrative cost of processing
submission fees makes this unattractive

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:22.180
submission fees makes this unattractive
 

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.000
submission fees makes this unattractive
and not feasible and of course

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.010
and not feasible and of course
 

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.650
and not feasible and of course
publishers don't are competing with one

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:25.660
publishers don't are competing with one
 

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.990
publishers don't are competing with one
another and so very few publishers will

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000
another and so very few publishers will
 

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.760
another and so very few publishers will
adopt something like this if their

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:29.770
adopt something like this if their
 

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.340
adopt something like this if their
competitors are not adopting a similar

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:32.350
competitors are not adopting a similar
 

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.350
competitors are not adopting a similar
model but again it's one way to think

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:34.360
model but again it's one way to think
 

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.750
model but again it's one way to think
about how the revenue stream might not

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760
about how the revenue stream might not
 

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.600
about how the revenue stream might not
only be differentiated but also scale

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:39.610
only be differentiated but also scale
 

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.030
only be differentiated but also scale
with the activity that's actually going

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040
with the activity that's actually going
 

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.370
with the activity that's actually going
on it might in fact dissuade some

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:44.380
on it might in fact dissuade some
 

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.470
on it might in fact dissuade some
spurious submitters from submitting

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480
spurious submitters from submitting
 

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.150
spurious submitters from submitting
articles that they know won't get

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160
articles that they know won't get
 

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.740
articles that they know won't get
published in a particular outlet and

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:49.750
published in a particular outlet and
 

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.180
published in a particular outlet and
that would then lower the publishers

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:51.190
that would then lower the publishers
 

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.630
that would then lower the publishers
costs so again just something that we've

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640
costs so again just something that we've
 

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.580
costs so again just something that we've
been thinking about and trying to model

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:56.590
been thinking about and trying to model
 

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.530
been thinking about and trying to model
a couple of other projects that are

00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:58.540
a couple of other projects that are
 

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.220
a couple of other projects that are
going on at you see that are not aimed

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:02.230
going on at you see that are not aimed
 

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.620
going on at you see that are not aimed
at the existing journals but at newer

at the existing journals but at newer
 

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.690
at the existing journals but at newer
journals one is the Berkley research

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:06.700
journals one is the Berkley research
 

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.150

00:43:54.289 --> 00:43:54.299
math I'm here
 

00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:56.900
math I'm here
seventy-five percent of the articles

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:56.910
seventy-five percent of the articles
 

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.779
seventy-five percent of the articles
that were requested for which support

00:43:59.779 --> 00:43:59.789
that were requested for which support
 

00:43:59.789 --> 00:44:01.759
that were requested for which support
was requested were actually able to be

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:01.769
was requested were actually able to be
 

00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:04.329
was requested were actually able to be
funded through research grants so the

00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:04.339
funded through research grants so the
 

00:44:04.339 --> 00:44:08.779
funded through research grants so the
fund only had to to sponsor 25% of the

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:08.789
fund only had to to sponsor 25% of the
 

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:11.599
fund only had to to sponsor 25% of the
requests and the average fee was about

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:11.609
requests and the average fee was about
 

00:44:11.609 --> 00:44:14.179
requests and the average fee was about
sixteen hundred dollars so Berkeley is

00:44:14.179 --> 00:44:14.189
sixteen hundred dollars so Berkeley is
 

00:44:14.189 --> 00:44:16.699
sixteen hundred dollars so Berkeley is
estimated that their authors publish

00:44:16.699 --> 00:44:16.709
estimated that their authors publish
 

00:44:16.709 --> 00:44:19.910
estimated that their authors publish
about 5,000 journals per year if that's

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920
about 5,000 journals per year if that's
 

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.650
about 5,000 journals per year if that's
the case then their total cost for

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660
the case then their total cost for
 

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.509
the case then their total cost for
supporting authorship under this model

00:44:23.509 --> 00:44:23.519
supporting authorship under this model
 

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:25.640
supporting authorship under this model
would be two million dollars their total

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:25.650
would be two million dollars their total
 

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.529
would be two million dollars their total
licensing fees for everything that they

00:44:27.529 --> 00:44:27.539
licensing fees for everything that they
 

00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:29.839
licensing fees for everything that they
license is 4.4 million dollars that

00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:29.849
license is 4.4 million dollars that
 

00:44:29.849 --> 00:44:32.989
license is 4.4 million dollars that
includes resources that that CDL license

00:44:32.989 --> 00:44:32.999
includes resources that that CDL license
 

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:34.880
includes resources that that CDL license
is on their behalf as well as resources

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:34.890
is on their behalf as well as resources
 

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.219

they license locally so you know their

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:37.229
they license locally so you know their
 

00:44:37.229 --> 00:44:39.019
they license locally so you know their
calculus is that this could lower the

00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:39.029
calculus is that this could lower the
 

00:44:39.029 --> 00:44:41.089
calculus is that this could lower the
institutional costs whether it lowers

00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099
institutional costs whether it lowers
 

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:42.620
institutional costs whether it lowers
the system costs is a very different

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:42.630
the system costs is a very different
 

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.380
the system costs is a very different
question but the focus here is on the

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:45.390
question but the focus here is on the
 

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.019
question but the focus here is on the
cost to the Berkeley library that is

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:48.029
cost to the Berkeley library that is
 

00:44:48.029 --> 00:44:50.150
cost to the Berkeley library that is
interesting but many of these

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160
interesting but many of these
 

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.660
interesting but many of these

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.660
overheads and that's something that will
vary depending on the organization the

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:48.670
vary depending on the organization the
 

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.670
vary depending on the organization the
type of organization and then surplus

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680
type of organization and then surplus
 

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.370
type of organization and then surplus
which would be profit or in the case of

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:53.380
which would be profit or in the case of
 

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.770
which would be profit or in the case of
a non-profit a non-profit surplus that

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:55.780
a non-profit a non-profit surplus that
 

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.170
a non-profit a non-profit surplus that
that supports the organization and you

00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:58.180
that supports the organization and you
 

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.940
that supports the organization and you
can see the percentage is there I about

00:47:59.940 --> 00:47:59.950
can see the percentage is there I about
 

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.890
can see the percentage is there I about
forty percent i think is in first copy

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:01.900
forty percent i think is in first copy
 

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.070
forty percent i think is in first copy
costs and the rest is pretty much 20 20

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:05.080
costs and the rest is pretty much 20 20
 

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.640
costs and the rest is pretty much 20 20
20 so if you look at our East

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:08.650
20 so if you look at our East
 

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.610
20 so if you look at our East
scholarship service our at the rate that

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:11.620
scholarship service our at the rate that

we're currently ingesting content and

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:13.420
we're currently ingesting content and
 

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.840
we're currently ingesting content and
this this is not this is not necessarily

this this is not this is not necessarily
 

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.090
this this is not this is not necessarily
journal content this is also our working

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:18.100
journal content this is also our working
 

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.400

meetings the cost per unit is 475

00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:23.039
meetings the cost per unit is 475
 

00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:25.430
meetings the cost per unit is 475
dollars so that's a very basic

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440
dollars so that's a very basic
 

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.039
dollars so that's a very basic
calculation that's based on our cost to

00:48:28.039 --> 00:48:28.049
calculation that's based on our cost to
 

00:48:28.049 --> 00:48:30.500
calculation that's based on our cost to
run and manage the repository and the

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:30.510
run and manage the repository and the
 

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.940
run and manage the repository and the
amount of content that we're taking in

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:31.950
amount of content that we're taking in
 

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.410
amount of content that we're taking in
every year as that content increases

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:35.420
every year as that content increases
 

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.990
every year as that content increases
certainly our cost would grow but not

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000
certainly our cost would grow but not
 

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.200
certainly our cost would grow but not
just honest the unit cost would decline

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:42.210
just honest the unit cost would decline
 

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.480
just honest the unit cost would decline
over time and you can see that in the

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:44.490
over time and you can see that in the
 

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:48.200
over time and you can see that in the
archive repository where which ingest

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:48.210
archive repository where which ingest
 

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.740
archive repository where which ingest
about 58,000 articles per year the

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:51.750
about 58,000 articles per year the
 

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.299
about 58,000 articles per year the
annual cost for running the repository

00:48:53.299 --> 00:48:53.309
annual cost for running the repository
 

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:56.150
annual cost for running the repository
now is about 360 thousand dollars plan

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160
now is about 360 thousand dollars plan
 

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.650
now is about 360 thousand dollars plan
to go a little higher in the next couple

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660
to go a little higher in the next couple
 

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.620
to go a little higher in the next couple
of years so the unit cost for ingesting

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:00.630

squishy number so it could be it could
 

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.559
squishy number so it could be it could
be lower but that's one number that

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:19.590
doesn't have to pay any phenyl at all or
 

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:23.520
doesn't have to pay any phenyl at all or
they pay a little amount and the fees

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.530
they pay a little amount and the fees
 

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:28.110
they pay a little amount and the fees
for the authors are discounted I think

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:28.120
for the authors are discounted I think
 

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.110
for the authors are discounted I think
by twenty-five percent yeah so again

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:31.120
by twenty-five percent yeah so again
 

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.110
by twenty-five percent yeah so again
here it's the institutional approach one

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:34.120
here it's the institutional approach one
 

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.660
here it's the institutional approach one
institution taking care of its authors

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:36.670
institution taking care of its authors
 

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:39.480
institution taking care of its authors
in this group of journals or the author

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:39.490

three pillars I want you to introduce to

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:48.340
three pillars I want you to introduce to
 

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:53.760
three pillars I want you to introduce to
you and now let's look at at our open

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:53.770
you and now let's look at at our open
 

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.950
you and now let's look at at our open
access uptake across disciplines down

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:55.960
access uptake across disciplines down
 

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.350
access uptake across disciplines down
the left column shows you the

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:58.360
the left column shows you the
 

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.240
the left column shows you the
distribution of our articles across

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:00.250
distribution of our articles across
 

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:03.540
distribution of our articles across
disciplines you can see we are very

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:03.550
disciplines you can see we are very
 

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.070
disciplines you can see we are very
strong and medicine biomedical

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:05.080
strong and medicine biomedical
 

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.700
strong and medicine biomedical
scientists fields and maybe these fields

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:08.710
scientists fields and maybe these fields
 

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.579
scientists fields and maybe these fields
are generally stronger in science

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:10.589
are generally stronger in science
 

01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:13.370
are generally stronger in science
at all in total of course and if you

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380
at all in total of course and if you
 

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.410
at all in total of course and if you
look at the open access articles

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420
look at the open access articles
 

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.420
look at the open access articles
distribution across disciplines that the

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:17.430
distribution across disciplines that the
 

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:21.499
distribution across disciplines that the
pattern looks pretty similar why is that

01:01:21.499 --> 01:01:21.509
pattern looks pretty similar why is that
 

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:23.779
pattern looks pretty similar why is that
well definitely one of the reasons is

01:01:23.779 --> 01:01:23.789
well definitely one of the reasons is
 

01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:26.719
well definitely one of the reasons is
that our open access articles to third

01:01:26.719 --> 01:01:26.729
that our open access articles to third
 

01:01:26.729 --> 01:01:29.299
that our open access articles to third
come from institutional arrangements so

01:01:29.299 --> 01:01:29.309
come from institutional arrangements so
 

01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:31.959
come from institutional arrangements so
for two third of our articles this

01:01:31.959 --> 01:01:31.969
for two third of our articles this
 

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:35.870
for two third of our articles this
payment barrier is solved right the

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880
payment barrier is solved right the
 

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.239
payment barrier is solved right the
author does not have to ask himself do I

01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:38.249
author does not have to ask himself do I
 

01:01:38.249 --> 01:01:41.059
author does not have to ask himself do I
really want open access but I can't

01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:41.069
really want open access but I can't
 

01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:42.620
really want open access but I can't
really pay or I don't want to go through

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:42.630
really pay or I don't want to go through
 

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.319
really pay or I don't want to go through
the hassle of getting reimbursed for the

01:01:45.319 --> 01:01:45.329
the hassle of getting reimbursed for the
 

01:01:45.329 --> 01:01:48.969
the hassle of getting reimbursed for the
fees so if we remove the payment barrier

01:01:48.969 --> 01:01:48.979
fees so if we remove the payment barrier
 

01:01:48.979 --> 01:01:51.829
fees so if we remove the payment barrier
we see this pattern reflecting the

01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839
we see this pattern reflecting the
 

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:54.739
we see this pattern reflecting the
general publication pattern you also

01:01:54.739 --> 01:01:54.749
general publication pattern you also
 

01:01:54.749 --> 01:01:57.079
general publication pattern you also
notice that the uptake is particularly

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:57.089
notice that the uptake is particularly
 

01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:58.880
notice that the uptake is particularly
strong and biomedical and life sciences

01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:58.890
strong and biomedical and life sciences
 

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.640

mandates and simply the familiarity with
 

01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:13.870

open access is stronger in this field

01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880
open access is stronger in this field

access idea but let's talk about the

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:30.500
access idea but let's talk about the
 

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.070
access idea but let's talk about the
other aspect which I mentioned if we if

01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080
other aspect which I mentioned if we if
 

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.460

we now say to you you know you keep the

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:36.470
we now say to you you know you keep the
 

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.950
we now say to you you know you keep the
level at one hundred twenty percent is

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960
level at one hundred twenty percent is
 

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.690
level at one hundred twenty percent is
for open access only 80 percenters for

01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:40.700
for open access only 80 percenters for
 

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.460
for open access only 80 percenters for
the license then let's keep in mind that

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:42.470
the license then let's keep in mind that
 

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:46.030
the license then let's keep in mind that
for this twenty percent of open access

01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040
for this twenty percent of open access
 

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.980
for this twenty percent of open access
articles we can't sell them to anybody

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:47.990
articles we can't sell them to anybody
 

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:51.310
articles we can't sell them to anybody
else right so we are actually I mean

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:51.320
else right so we are actually I mean
 

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.620
else right so we are actually I mean
this is a strong disadvantage as long as

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:53.630
this is a strong disadvantage as long as
 

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.780
this is a strong disadvantage as long as
we see it as long as the transition

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:55.790
we see it as long as the transition
 

01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:57.730
we see it as long as the transition
takes place and we don't have a switch

01:08:57.730 --> 01:08:57.740
takes place and we don't have a switch
 

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.610
takes place and we don't have a switch
overnight so there is a certain risk or

01:09:00.610 --> 01:09:00.620
overnight so there is a certain risk or
 

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.390
overnight so there is a certain risk or
you could say disadvantage to publishers

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400
you could say disadvantage to publishers
 

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.100
you could say disadvantage to publishers
going into this transition s2 achiever

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:06.110
going into this transition s2 achiever
 

01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:10.360
going into this transition s2 achiever
you mentions to achieve SS yeah there

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:10.370
you mentions to achieve SS yeah there
 

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.130
you mentions to achieve SS yeah there
needs to be a certain support for

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:12.140
needs to be a certain support for
 

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.640
needs to be a certain support for
publishers to step into this transition

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:15.650
publishers to step into this transition
 

01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:18.130
publishers to step into this transition
and we believe that as long as the

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:18.140
and we believe that as long as the
 

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.410

sort of proxy and journal Brad and

01:34:51.979 --> 01:34:51.989
sort of proxy and journal Brad and
 

01:34:51.989 --> 01:34:55.580
sort of proxy and journal Brad and
impacted is a proxy and no one has that

01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:55.590
impacted is a proxy and no one has that
 

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:56.719
impacted is a proxy and no one has that
I know of has come up with an

01:34:56.719 --> 01:34:56.729
I know of has come up with an
 

01:34:56.729 --> 01:34:58.549
I know of has come up with an
alternative proxying that would be

01:34:58.549 --> 01:34:58.559
alternative proxying that would be
 

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.259
alternative proxying that would be
efficient I mean I tend to think that

01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:00.269
efficient I mean I tend to think that
 

01:35:00.269 --> 01:35:03.049
efficient I mean I tend to think that
that the system would change more

01:35:03.049 --> 01:35:03.059
that the system would change more
 

01:35:03.059 --> 01:35:04.790
that the system would change more
rapidly and people wanted it to change

01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800
rapidly and people wanted it to change
 

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.770
rapidly and people wanted it to change

if those who write and those who are
 

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.779
if those who write and those who are
involved in the scholarly communication

01:35:08.779 --> 01:35:08.789

process and in ten year and almost

01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:10.579
process and in ten year and almost
 

01:35:10.579 --> 01:35:13.759
process and in ten year and almost
wanted to change and finally find those

01:35:13.759 --> 01:35:13.769
wanted to change and finally find those
 

01:35:13.769 --> 01:35:16.009
wanted to change and finally find those
the right ways to do it and I don't mean

01:35:16.009 --> 01:35:16.019
the right ways to do it and I don't mean
 

01:35:16.019 --> 01:35:18.379
the right ways to do it and I don't mean
that folks don't want change but then

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:18.389
that folks don't want change but then
 

01:35:18.389 --> 01:35:22.400
that folks don't want change but then
the mechanisms the past isn't that isn't

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:22.410
the mechanisms the past isn't that isn't
 

01:35:22.410 --> 01:35:23.930
the mechanisms the past isn't that isn't
self-evident but things can change very

01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940
self-evident but things can change very
 

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.000
self-evident but things can change very
quickly you have certain if the

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:26.010
quickly you have certain if the
 

01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:28.730
quickly you have certain if the
conditions are right so a lot of our

01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:28.740
conditions are right so a lot of our
 

01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.380
conditions are right so a lot of our
experimentation is predicated on

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:30.390
experimentation is predicated on
 

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:33.080
experimentation is predicated on
generating a lot of experimentation so

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:33.090
generating a lot of experimentation so
 

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:34.910
generating a lot of experimentation so
that conditions can be disrupted and

01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920
that conditions can be disrupted and
 

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.160
that conditions can be disrupted and
make the right conditions can a bird we

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:37.170
make the right conditions can a bird we
 

01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:39.140
make the right conditions can a bird we
can we can learn whether there are in

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.150
can we can learn whether there are in
 

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.820
can we can learn whether there are in
the right conditions for some sort of

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:40.830
the right conditions for some sort of
 

01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:44.150
the right conditions for some sort of
transformation but so I tend to think

01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:44.160
transformation but so I tend to think
 

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.360
transformation but so I tend to think
that if if the right proxy if someone
