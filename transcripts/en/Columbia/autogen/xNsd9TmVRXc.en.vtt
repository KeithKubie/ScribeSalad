I'm going to invite you to argue with us
 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.850
I'm going to invite you to argue with us
and tell us why we're all hopelessly out

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:14.860
and tell us why we're all hopelessly out
 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.779
and tell us why we're all hopelessly out

very briefly in five minutes is about

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:25.529
very briefly in five minutes is about
 

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.499
very briefly in five minutes is about
trying to get technology transfer to

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:28.509
trying to get technology transfer to
 

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.299
trying to get technology transfer to
developing countries for addressing

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:30.309
developing countries for addressing
 

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:33.959
developing countries for addressing
climate disruption and the key vision

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:33.969
climate disruption and the key vision
 

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:35.219
climate disruption and the key vision
here is you know people would love to

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:35.229
here is you know people would love to
 

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.909
here is you know people would love to
see a leapfrog effect

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919
see a leapfrog effect
 

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.920
see a leapfrog effect
we're developing countries would move to

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:38.930
we're developing countries would move to
 

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.509
we're developing countries would move to
clean technologies that having to go

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519
clean technologies that having to go
 

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.339
clean technologies that having to go
through the dirty ones but the key

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:42.349
through the dirty ones but the key
 

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:44.560
through the dirty ones but the key
developing countries here like China and

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:44.570
developing countries here like China and
 

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.449
developing countries here like China and
India already have lots of dirty

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:46.459
India already have lots of dirty
 

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.889
India already have lots of dirty
technology so it's going to be more

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:47.899
technology so it's going to be more
 

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:50.110
technology so it's going to be more
complicated than that but everybody

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120
complicated than that but everybody
 

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.910
complicated than that but everybody
agrees that this is at the heart of the

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920
agrees that this is at the heart of the
 

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.650
agrees that this is at the heart of the
challenges if we can get the kind of

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:53.660
challenges if we can get the kind of
 

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.930
challenges if we can get the kind of
technological transfer in developing

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:55.940
technological transfer in developing
 

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.610
technological transfer in developing
countries as well as in developed

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.620
countries as well as in developed
 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.810
countries as well as in developed
countries to address climate disruption

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:00.820
countries to address climate disruption
 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.329
countries to address climate disruption
and it's absolutely essential both for

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:06.339
and it's absolutely essential both for
 

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:08.019
and it's absolutely essential both for
sustainable development and economic

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:08.029
sustainable development and economic
 

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:10.540
sustainable development and economic
development because if we don't address

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:10.550
development because if we don't address
 

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.790
development because if we don't address
this properly we're going to have big

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800
this properly we're going to have big
 

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.189
this properly we're going to have big
economic problems both because climate

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:15.199
economic problems both because climate
 

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:16.840
economic problems both because climate
disruption itself is an economic

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:16.850
disruption itself is an economic
 

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.509
disruption itself is an economic
calamity and because fossil fuel will

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519
calamity and because fossil fuel will
 

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.040
calamity and because fossil fuel will
run out and before it runs out it's

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.050
run out and before it runs out it's
 

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.019
run out and before it runs out it's
going to become very expensive and wreak

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:23.029
going to become very expensive and wreak
 

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.150
going to become very expensive and wreak
economic havoc that way so we really

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160
economic havoc that way so we really
 

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.670
economic havoc that way so we really
need to do this the question is how and

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680
need to do this the question is how and
 

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.250
need to do this the question is how and
they're two basic governance mechanisms

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.260
they're two basic governance mechanisms
 

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.069
they're two basic governance mechanisms
that try to address technology transfer

00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079
that try to address technology transfer
 

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:35.530
that try to address technology transfer
to developing countries a trade we might

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:35.540
to developing countries a trade we might
 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.290
to developing countries a trade we might
call them trade and aid the trade model

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:38.300
call them trade and aid the trade model
 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.180
call them trade and aid the trade model
is used in the clean development

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
is used in the clean development
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.970
is used in the clean development
mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol where

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:42.980
mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol where
 

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.490
mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol where
the idea is that developed countries

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:45.500
the idea is that developed countries
 

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.069
the idea is that developed countries
will fund projects in developing

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.079
will fund projects in developing
 

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:51.880
will fund projects in developing
countries in lieu of local reductions

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:51.890
countries in lieu of local reductions
 

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.590
countries in lieu of local reductions
that they would otherwise be obligated

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600
that they would otherwise be obligated
 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.300
that they would otherwise be obligated
to make so that's the Clean Development

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.310
to make so that's the Clean Development
 

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.430
to make so that's the Clean Development
Mechanism where people get out of their

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440
Mechanism where people get out of their
 

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.290
Mechanism where people get out of their
emission reduction obligations locally

00:09:59.290 --> 00:09:59.300
emission reduction obligations locally
 

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.120

by funding projects in developing

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.130
by funding projects in developing
 

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.290
by funding projects in developing
countries and that's a means of

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:02.300
countries and that's a means of
 

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.990
countries and that's a means of
technology transfer the other another

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000
technology transfer the other another
 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.610
technology transfer the other another
means we also see in the Kyoto Protocol

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:06.620
means we also see in the Kyoto Protocol
 

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.769
means we also see in the Kyoto Protocol
but it's more cause more robust in the

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:08.779
but it's more cause more robust in the
 

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.860
but it's more cause more robust in the
Montreal Protocol is a government aid

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:11.870
Montreal Protocol is a government aid
 

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.540
Montreal Protocol is a government aid
model and there you have an

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:13.550
model and there you have an
 

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.860
model and there you have an
international institution with

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:14.870
international institution with
 

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.210
international institution with
government funds used to fund

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.220
government funds used to fund
 

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.689
government funds used to fund
technologies abroad and so our task is

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:19.699
technologies abroad and so our task is
 

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:22.870
technologies abroad and so our task is
to mail these things or choose the right

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880
to mail these things or choose the right
 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.350
to mail these things or choose the right
one in some way and i would say that

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360
one in some way and i would say that
 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.569
one in some way and i would say that
there are three big policy attributes

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:28.579
there are three big policy attributes
 

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:30.059
there are three big policy attributes
you have to look for this to work

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.069
you have to look for this to work
 

00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:32.319
you have to look for this to work
positive spillover scale and

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:32.329
positive spillover scale and
 

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.519
positive spillover scale and
additionality i want to talk briefly

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:33.529
additionality i want to talk briefly
 

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:37.240
additionality i want to talk briefly
about each of these things and the CDM

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.250
about each of these things and the CDM
 

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.579
about each of these things and the CDM
in particular the CDM never adds

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:39.589
in particular the CDM never adds
 

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:41.829
in particular the CDM never adds
emission reductions net it is always

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839
emission reductions net it is always
 

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.269
emission reductions net it is always
about trade so you always give up

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279
about trade so you always give up
 

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.500
about trade so you always give up
something to get one so there's no

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.510

there was a cost-effectiveness value

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040
there was a cost-effectiveness value
 

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.420
there was a cost-effectiveness value
unless there's a positive spillover that

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.430
unless there's a positive spillover that

some have China has a strict standards
 

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.500
some have China has a strict standards
for vehicles and there are other

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:08.510
for vehicles and there are other
 

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.740
for vehicles and there are other
policies abroad that have tried to do

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:11.750
policies abroad that have tried to do
 

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.170
policies abroad that have tried to do
that and we need more of that so

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:14.180
that and we need more of that so
 

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.920
that and we need more of that so
positive spillover is very important the

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:17.930
positive spillover is very important the
 

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.640
positive spillover is very important the
other thing is a scale and this is why

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:21.650
other thing is a scale and this is why
 

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.410
other thing is a scale and this is why
we recognize the international community

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.420
we recognize the international community
 

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.840
we recognize the international community
to have an influence it's not enough to

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:25.850
to have an influence it's not enough to
 

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.970
to have an influence it's not enough to
have a few projects going on I mean if

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:27.980
have a few projects going on I mean if
 

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.040
have a few projects going on I mean if
we're building a coal-fired power plant

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.050
we're building a coal-fired power plant
 

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.470
we're building a coal-fired power plant
every week and we have a few renewable

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480
every week and we have a few renewable
 

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.300
every week and we have a few renewable
energy projects going along on the side

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.310
energy projects going along on the side
 

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.250
energy projects going along on the side

man-made and seventy-five percent of
that is related to energy so there is an

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.110
that is related to energy so there is an
 

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.600
that is related to energy so there is an
extremely close connection between

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:55.610
extremely close connection between
 

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.230
extremely close connection between
energy and the environment something

00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240
energy and the environment something
 

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.509
energy and the environment something
that has surprised me the most here is

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519
that has surprised me the most here is
 

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:05.379
that has surprised me the most here is
that there is a kind of ideology debate

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:05.389
that there is a kind of ideology debate
 

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:09.790
that there is a kind of ideology debate
between energy and the environment so

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800
between energy and the environment so
 

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.610
between energy and the environment so
it's a kind of debate between left and

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:12.620
it's a kind of debate between left and
 

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.430
it's a kind of debate between left and
right I would say that it is rather a

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440
right I would say that it is rather a
 

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.249
right I would say that it is rather a
debate of right and wrong because what

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:18.259
debate of right and wrong because what
 

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:21.519
debate of right and wrong because what
we need is action and we need action now

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:21.529
we need is action and we need action now
 

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:25.240
we need is action and we need action now

a lot would be

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:05.830
a lot would be
 

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.310
a lot would be
on the policy design very much and I

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320
on the policy design very much and I
 

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.899
on the policy design very much and I
finished with that the idea was with a

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:09.909
finished with that the idea was with a
 

00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:11.880
finished with that the idea was with a
strong carbon price we will have this

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:11.890

realize that this ease of you it's a
 

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:19.080
realize that this ease of you it's a
sort of a very theoretical view of how

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:19.090
sort of a very theoretical view of how
 

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.769

the beginning of this session there was
 

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.980
the beginning of this session there was
a remark that when the ji a issue

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:58.990
a remark that when the ji a issue
 

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.870
a remark that when the ji a issue
originally came out it was the Atomic

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880
originally came out it was the Atomic
 

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.629
originally came out it was the Atomic
Age when it was the Atomic Age it was

00:25:03.629 --> 00:25:03.639
Age when it was the Atomic Age it was
 

00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:05.190
Age when it was the Atomic Age it was
pretty clear that you needed Superman

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200
pretty clear that you needed Superman
 

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200
pretty clear that you needed Superman
and it was pretty clear that you needed

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.210
and it was pretty clear that you needed
 

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.480
and it was pretty clear that you needed
kryptonite to balance out Superman it

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:09.490
kryptonite to balance out Superman it
 

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.060
kryptonite to balance out Superman it
what I'm getting at is that the

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.070
what I'm getting at is that the
 

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.070
what I'm getting at is that the
double-edged sword of technology was

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080
double-edged sword of technology was
 

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.070
double-edged sword of technology was
made very clear at that time in the case

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080
made very clear at that time in the case
 

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.080
made very clear at that time in the case
that we were discussing here now with

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.090
that we were discussing here now with
 

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.419
that we were discussing here now with
carbon we are this has been a slower

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:21.429
carbon we are this has been a slower
 

00:25:21.429 --> 00:25:23.730
carbon we are this has been a slower
discovery part but it's a similar story

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:23.740
discovery part but it's a similar story
 

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.529
discovery part but it's a similar story
and today i would say that what you're

00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:28.539
and today i would say that what you're
 

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:31.230
and today i would say that what you're
going to get taken through largely

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240
going to get taken through largely
 

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.060
going to get taken through largely
because of the rate at which our

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.070
because of the rate at which our
 

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.799
because of the rate at which our
populations have grown thanks to

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:34.809
populations have grown thanks to
 

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:39.169
populations have grown thanks to
technology again is um the alphabet trip

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179
technology again is um the alphabet trip
 

00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:41.580
technology again is um the alphabet trip
okay the alphabet trip starts with

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:41.590
okay the alphabet trip starts with
 

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.440
okay the alphabet trip starts with

cause us harm in some way but these are

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440
cause us harm in some way but these are
 

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.580
cause us harm in some way but these are
all fundamental to technology and

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:07.590
all fundamental to technology and
 

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.080
all fundamental to technology and
today's technology rather than the

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.090
today's technology rather than the
 

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.480

argument is that well before that we are

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.070
argument is that well before that we are
 

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.440

going to start running into the food

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.450
going to start running into the food

water constraint these are all

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:03.680
water constraint these are all
 

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.780
water constraint these are all
interdependent but we will see that and

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:06.790
interdependent but we will see that and
 

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.370
interdependent but we will see that and
we are already seeing that in places

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:09.380
we are already seeing that in places
 

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.060
we are already seeing that in places
that are densely populated and have high

supply namely India and China so if you

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960
supply namely India and China so if you
 

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.470
supply namely India and China so if you
talk to the Chinese and you bring up the

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480
talk to the Chinese and you bring up the
 

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.420
talk to the Chinese and you bring up the
point that Professor Pena did about

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.430
point that Professor Pena did about
 

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.730
point that Professor Pena did about
their energy constraint they actually

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:24.740
their energy constraint they actually
 

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.500
their energy constraint they actually
have a more fundamental food constraint

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:26.510
have a more fundamental food constraint
 

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.530
have a more fundamental food constraint
ultimately I would actually argue that

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:29.540
ultimately I would actually argue that
 

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.120
ultimately I would actually argue that
they have solved that constraint more

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.130
they have solved that constraint more
 

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.710
they have solved that constraint more
better than India because they have a

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720
better than India because they have a
 

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.900
better than India because they have a
better population growth strategy so

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:34.910
better population growth strategy so
 

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.540
better population growth strategy so
there's that a piece of it which will

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:37.550
there's that a piece of it which will
 

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.890
there's that a piece of it which will
work now if I'm saying that we will hit

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:41.900
work now if I'm saying that we will hit
 

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.390
work now if I'm saying that we will hit
that constraint before we hit a

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:43.400
that constraint before we hit a
 

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.850
that constraint before we hit a
constraint posed by climate then I have

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:45.860
constraint posed by climate then I have
 

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.740
constraint posed by climate then I have
to advance some arguments as to how

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
to advance some arguments as to how
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.210
to advance some arguments as to how
technology is going to get us out of

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:49.220
technology is going to get us out of
 

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.000
technology is going to get us out of
that because of course our goal is to be

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.010
that because of course our goal is to be
 

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.410
that because of course our goal is to be
a thousand billion people on this planet

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:53.420
a thousand billion people on this planet
 

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.530
a thousand billion people on this planet
because most people love to live beyond

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:56.540
because most people love to live beyond
 

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.410

their means are create technological

00:27:59.410 --> 00:27:59.420
their means are create technological
 

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.480
their means are create technological
bubbles create financial bubbles and and

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:01.490
bubbles create financial bubbles and and
 

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.070
bubbles create financial bubbles and and
then watch them burst and move to the

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080
then watch them burst and move to the
 

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.500
then watch them burst and move to the
next one so how are we going to solve

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:05.510
next one so how are we going to solve
 

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.120
next one so how are we going to solve
the water problem and how are we going

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.130
the water problem and how are we going
 

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.640
the water problem and how are we going
to solve the food problem the biomimicry

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:09.650
to solve the food problem the biomimicry
 

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.010
to solve the food problem the biomimicry
angle and the nano angle come into play

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:47.039
there are products their technologies
out there today that say that we can

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:47.049
out there today that say that we can
 

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:48.840
out there today that say that we can
start growing rice which is the largest

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:48.850
start growing rice which is the largest
 

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.960
start growing rice which is the largest
water consumer by the way in places like

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:51.970
water consumer by the way in places like
 

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.629
water consumer by the way in places like
India forty to sixty percent of the

00:28:54.629 --> 00:28:54.639
India forty to sixty percent of the
 

00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:56.669
India forty to sixty percent of the
total electricity in the agricultural

00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679
total electricity in the agricultural
 

00:28:56.679 --> 00:28:59.539
total electricity in the agricultural
areas goes for pumping groundwater okay

00:28:59.539 --> 00:28:59.549
areas goes for pumping groundwater okay
 

00:28:59.549 --> 00:29:03.509
areas goes for pumping groundwater okay
similarly much of the energy used for

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519
similarly much of the energy used for
 

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:06.269
similarly much of the energy used for
producing fertilizer is what what gives

00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279
producing fertilizer is what what gives
 

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.190
producing fertilizer is what what gives
you the high food output that we have

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200
you the high food output that we have
 

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.019
you the high food output that we have
today so if we can get around all of

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:10.029
today so if we can get around all of
 

00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:11.999
today so if we can get around all of
these issues we have a magical solution

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:12.009
these issues we have a magical solution
 

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:14.730
these issues we have a magical solution
so people have them if you can go and

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:14.740
so people have them if you can go and
 

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.909
so people have them if you can go and
grow rice in the ocean margin using salt

00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919
grow rice in the ocean margin using salt
 

00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:21.029
grow rice in the ocean margin using salt
water um that takes away the water

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039
water um that takes away the water
 

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:22.350
water um that takes away the water
problem because that's one of the

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360
problem because that's one of the
 

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.659
problem because that's one of the
largest consumers can we do it yes it's

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:24.669
largest consumers can we do it yes it's
 

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:27.899
largest consumers can we do it yes it's
done now okay so the thing is the

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:27.909
done now okay so the thing is the
 

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:29.519
done now okay so the thing is the
question that was put before us is

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:29.529
question that was put before us is
 

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:30.509
question that was put before us is
what's the relationship between

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519
what's the relationship between
 

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.970
what's the relationship between
technology and development and to try to

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:32.980
technology and development and to try to
 

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.950
technology and development and to try to
sum up my argument I'll say that

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960
sum up my argument I'll say that
 

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.860
sum up my argument I'll say that
technology is development technology

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:37.870
technology is development technology
 

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.659
technology is development technology
also poses the constraints of

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:39.669
also poses the constraints of
 

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:40.799
also poses the constraints of
development because what we have

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:40.809
development because what we have
 

00:29:40.809 --> 00:29:43.259
development because what we have
repeatedly found is that each advance

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:43.269
repeatedly found is that each advance
 

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:45.269
repeatedly found is that each advance
that we make leads us to a new

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279
that we make leads us to a new
 

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:47.789
that we make leads us to a new
constraint which we solve so will we get

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799
constraint which we solve so will we get
 

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:50.310
constraint which we solve so will we get
to a thousand billion people I think so

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320
to a thousand billion people I think so
 

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.490
to a thousand billion people I think so
i think that is how we got to this

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:53.500
i think that is how we got to this
 

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.590
i think that is how we got to this
planet because we ruin the previous

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600
planet because we ruin the previous
 

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.940
planet because we ruin the previous
planet we were on with a thousand

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:56.950
planet we were on with a thousand
 

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.039
planet we were on with a thousand
billion people and somehow migrated here

00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.049
billion people and somehow migrated here
 

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:00.779
billion people and somehow migrated here
and there are very very many stories of

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:00.789
and there are very very many stories of
 

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:03.749
and there are very very many stories of
how you can argue that happened but the

00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:03.759
how you can argue that happened but the
 

00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:07.320
how you can argue that happened but the
fact of it is that i think growth will

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.330
fact of it is that i think growth will
 

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.799
fact of it is that i think growth will
happen I and development is synonymous

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:10.809
happen I and development is synonymous
 

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.409
happen I and development is synonymous
with growth to a certain extent at the

00:30:13.409 --> 00:30:13.419
with growth to a certain extent at the
 

00:30:13.419 --> 00:30:14.850
with growth to a certain extent at the
Earth Institute we talk about

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:14.860
Earth Institute we talk about
 

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.009
Earth Institute we talk about
sustainable development which many

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:17.019
sustainable development which many
 

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:19.379
sustainable development which many
people will argue is an oxymoron because

00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:19.389
people will argue is an oxymoron because
 

00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:21.840
people will argue is an oxymoron because
sustainability is viewed as a paradigm

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:21.850
sustainability is viewed as a paradigm
 

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.850
sustainability is viewed as a paradigm
which is status quo and we have learned

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:23.860
which is status quo and we have learned
 

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.980
which is status quo and we have learned
that that's simply not what it is we are

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:25.990
that that's simply not what it is we are
 

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.680
that that's simply not what it is we are
going to evolve and we'll have ups and

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:28.690
going to evolve and we'll have ups and
 

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.499
going to evolve and we'll have ups and
downs and we'll have evolution all

00:30:31.499 --> 00:30:31.509
downs and we'll have evolution all
 

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:33.629
downs and we'll have evolution all
through there the goal of sustainable

00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:33.639
through there the goal of sustainable
 

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:35.070
through there the goal of sustainable
development really should be to minimize

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080
development really should be to minimize
 

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.649
development really should be to minimize
the downs as we are going up and with

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:37.659
the downs as we are going up and with
 

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:40.320

that I will stop and pause one ok first

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:40.330
that I will stop and pause one ok first
 

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.379
that I will stop and pause one ok first
you heard that sometimes I sit on these

00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:43.389
you heard that sometimes I sit on these
 

00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:44.590
you heard that sometimes I sit on these
panels and

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600
panels and
 

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.050
panels and
wonder it's so interesting to hear my

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.060
wonder it's so interesting to hear my
 

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.720
wonder it's so interesting to hear my
fellow panelists I'd love to try this

addiction to see / at some point in the

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:51.560
addiction to see / at some point in the
 

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.350
addiction to see / at some point in the
future but I guess it's just starting

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360
future but I guess it's just starting
 

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.030
future but I guess it's just starting
tonight so this is a gateway program

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.040
tonight so this is a gateway program
 

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.290
tonight so this is a gateway program
absolutely a gateway forum so our big

00:30:59.290 --> 00:30:59.300
absolutely a gateway forum so our big
 

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.590
absolutely a gateway forum so our big
questions were kind of around this issue

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600
questions were kind of around this issue
 

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.100
questions were kind of around this issue
of our is there an opportunity to kind

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.110
of our is there an opportunity to kind
 

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.140
of our is there an opportunity to kind
of leapfrog technologies particularly in

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.150
of leapfrog technologies particularly in
 

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:12.250
of leapfrog technologies particularly in
the developing world and then how might

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:12.260
the developing world and then how might
 

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.980
the developing world and then how might
technology be adapted or applied in a

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:14.990
technology be adapted or applied in a
 

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.950
technology be adapted or applied in a
local context and then whether there's a

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960
local context and then whether there's a
 

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.930
local context and then whether there's a
tension between I guess the question

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:19.940
tension between I guess the question
 

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.780
tension between I guess the question
assume there was a tension between

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:21.790
assume there was a tension between
 

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.320
assume there was a tension between
sustainable and economic development

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.330
sustainable and economic development
 

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.650
sustainable and economic development
which professor loll just spoke about my

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:26.660
which professor loll just spoke about my
 

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.170
which professor loll just spoke about my
role is is I guess to be a spokesperson

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:29.180
role is is I guess to be a spokesperson
 

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.960
role is is I guess to be a spokesperson
for the private sector which is kind of

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:31.970
for the private sector which is kind of

interesting because usually if i'm on a

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:33.500
interesting because usually if i'm on a
 

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.620
interesting because usually if i'm on a
panel like this i mean i'm an

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:35.630
panel like this i mean i'm an

stage companies and so usually there's

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.470
stage companies and so usually there's
 

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.290
stage companies and so usually there's
someone from a really big company but if

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:41.300
someone from a really big company but if
 

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.790
someone from a really big company but if
they're there they're being very quiet

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:42.800
they're there they're being very quiet
 

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.930
they're there they're being very quiet
tonight so so I guess I'll just preface

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:46.940
tonight so so I guess I'll just preface
 

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.720
tonight so so I guess I'll just preface
my remarks by saying when I talk about

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:49.730
my remarks by saying when I talk about
 

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.910
my remarks by saying when I talk about
what I do I am NOT a large company

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:53.920
what I do I am NOT a large company
 

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.470
what I do I am NOT a large company
innovator and that's important stuff too

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480
innovator and that's important stuff too
 

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.310
innovator and that's important stuff too
and for sustainability to happen those

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320
and for sustainability to happen those
 

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.470
and for sustainability to happen those
folks have to be at the table and they

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480
folks have to be at the table and they
 

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.490
folks have to be at the table and they
have to be incented properly I guess I

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:05.500
have to be incented properly I guess I
 

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.840
have to be incented properly I guess I
see the entrepreneurs more as the

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:07.850
see the entrepreneurs more as the
 

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.300
see the entrepreneurs more as the
yapping dogs or the mammals around the

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:10.310
yapping dogs or the mammals around the
 

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.550
yapping dogs or the mammals around the
stumbling dinosaurs as we as we close

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:12.560
stumbling dinosaurs as we as we close
 

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:19.900
stumbling dinosaurs as we as we close
out this this era so i guess if looking

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:19.910
out this this era so i guess if looking
 

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.680
out this this era so i guess if looking
at the overall title for this program of

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:23.690
at the overall title for this program of
 

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.960
at the overall title for this program of
innovating for development and

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:24.970
innovating for development and
 

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.890
innovating for development and
understanding the role of technology I

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:26.900
understanding the role of technology I
 

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.420
understanding the role of technology I
guess what I would hasten to add is

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:28.430
guess what I would hasten to add is
 

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.030
guess what I would hasten to add is
whenever you hear about innovation and

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:31.040
whenever you hear about innovation and
 

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.670
whenever you hear about innovation and
it's mostly focusing on technology

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:32.680

while we do all of that but the

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359
while we do all of that but the

while we do all of that but the
fundamental question I want the panel to

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.010
fundamental question I want the panel to
 

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.180
fundamental question I want the panel to
be thinking about is as we think about

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.190
be thinking about is as we think about
 

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.930
be thinking about is as we think about
sustainable development or least

planet and we think about technology how

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.030
planet and we think about technology how
 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.900
planet and we think about technology how
do we get a handle on what is realistic

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:56.910
do we get a handle on what is realistic
 

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.510
do we get a handle on what is realistic
in the development of Technology and how

00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520
in the development of Technology and how
 

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.970
in the development of Technology and how
do we get a handle on using public

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200
diffusion what sort of policies need I
 

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.630
diffusion what sort of policies need I
think the first point is that we do need

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640
think the first point is that we do need
 

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.310
think the first point is that we do need
policies that is this isn't like the

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320
policies that is this isn't like the
 

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.920
policies that is this isn't like the
ipod because this is collective but it's

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:42.930
ipod because this is collective but it's
 

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.270

not even like a cook stove where you're

not even like a cook stove where you're
 

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.310
not even like a cook stove where you're
protecting your own environment it's a

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320
protecting your own environment it's a
 

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.550
protecting your own environment it's a
collective problem so it's going to need

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560
collective problem so it's going to need
 

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.450
collective problem so it's going to need
policy and I think that's an elementary

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460
policy and I think that's an elementary
 

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.970
policy and I think that's an elementary
point that actually is neglected in some

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980
point that actually is neglected in some
 

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.670

and I don't think that's true how to do

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020
and I don't think that's true how to do
 

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.140
and I don't think that's true how to do
it is tricky and its cultural specific

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.150
it is tricky and its cultural specific
 

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.109
it is tricky and its cultural specific

the unpredictability that you highlight
 

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.580
the unpredictability that you highlight
it's still true that it's unpredictable

it's still true that it's unpredictable

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:38.880
because at one stage you you you begin
to make the cost and benefit analysis

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:38.890
to make the cost and benefit analysis
 

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.820
to make the cost and benefit analysis
and then because of this uncertainty

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:41.830
and then because of this uncertainty
 

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.400
and then because of this uncertainty
around should we go really to the

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:44.410
around should we go really to the
 

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.140
around should we go really to the
low-carbon economy then all the system

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:46.150
low-carbon economy then all the system
 

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.410
low-carbon economy then all the system
is really getting not destroyed but with

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:49.420
is really getting not destroyed but with
 

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.110
is really getting not destroyed but with
a lot of problems now in France you have

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.120
a lot of problems now in France you have
 

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.220
a lot of problems now in France you have
a number of economic actors screaming

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:56.230
a number of economic actors screaming
 

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.870
a number of economic actors screaming
that we will have to get free to the

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880
that we will have to get free to the
 

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.170
that we will have to get free to the

enough to really to invest for these new

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:10.930
enough to really to invest for these new
 

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:14.160
enough to really to invest for these new
new energy sources and so in a way you

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:14.170
new energy sources and so in a way you
 

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.950
new energy sources and so in a way you
see policies are very necessary but the

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960
see policies are very necessary but the
 

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.560
see policies are very necessary but the
steadiness the resilience of the policy

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:19.570
steadiness the resilience of the policy
 

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:23.400
steadiness the resilience of the policy
the long-term aspect is key when you

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.410
the long-term aspect is key when you
 

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.650
the long-term aspect is key when you
have investment cycle and of course

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:25.660
have investment cycle and of course
 

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.200
have investment cycle and of course
energy is a very long investment cycle

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:28.210
energy is a very long investment cycle
 

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.930
energy is a very long investment cycle
you as you said you don't switch from

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:30.940
you as you said you don't switch from
 

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.690
you as you said you don't switch from
one year to another one so I think I see

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:33.700
one year to another one so I think I see
 

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.610
one year to another one so I think I see
the problem where because there is a lot

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:35.620
the problem where because there is a lot
 

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.730
the problem where because there is a lot
of uncertainty or that's really we can

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:38.740
of uncertainty or that's really we can
 

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.440
of uncertainty or that's really we can
go to this low carbon economy that's

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:40.450
go to this low carbon economy that's
 

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.290
go to this low carbon economy that's
really the perspective you have a lot of

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.300
really the perspective you have a lot of
 

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.680
really the perspective you have a lot of
policies who seems very solid and now we

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:46.690
policies who seems very solid and now we
 

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.530
policies who seems very solid and now we
can be changed from not from one day and

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:49.540
can be changed from not from one day and
 

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.050
can be changed from not from one day and
it's all a bit really be undermined and

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:52.060
it's all a bit really be undermined and
 

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.360
it's all a bit really be undermined and
that's nice think the main problem we

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:54.370
that's nice think the main problem we
 

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.880
that's nice think the main problem we
have it's about an Israel Industrial

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:56.890
have it's about an Israel Industrial
 

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.880
have it's about an Israel Industrial
Revolution but can we have the policy

missoula Turkish enough I think if we
 

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.870
missoula Turkish enough I think if we
think about the policy signals and then

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880
think about the policy signals and then
 

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.880
think about the policy signals and then
you know you look at say the French

you know you look at say the French
 

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.520

applied but they are in that business

00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:42.619
applied but they are in that business
 

00:56:42.619 --> 00:56:44.919

then there comes a point in the science

00:56:44.919 --> 00:56:44.929
then there comes a point in the science
 

00:56:44.929 --> 00:56:46.419
then there comes a point in the science
and technology development the R&amp;D

00:56:46.419 --> 00:56:46.429
and technology development the R&amp;D
 

00:56:46.429 --> 00:56:48.609
and technology development the R&amp;D
development where it has commercial

00:56:48.609 --> 00:56:48.619
development where it has commercial
 

00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:51.579
development where it has commercial
potential and then it requires the

00:56:51.579 --> 00:56:51.589
potential and then it requires the
 

00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:54.159
potential and then it requires the
private sector participation the

00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:54.169
private sector participation the
 

00:56:54.169 --> 00:56:57.669
private sector participation the
personal computer the the internet all

then at some point it leaves the

00:57:03.249 --> 00:57:03.259
then at some point it leaves the
 

00:57:03.259 --> 00:57:04.390
then at some point it leaves the
government and goes into the private

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400
government and goes into the private
 

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.249
government and goes into the private
sector so how do we get the

00:57:06.249 --> 00:57:06.259
sector so how do we get the
 

00:57:06.259 --> 00:57:07.989
sector so how do we get the
entrepreneurs into this and how can they

00:57:07.989 --> 00:57:07.999
entrepreneurs into this and how can they
 

00:57:07.999 --> 00:57:13.839
entrepreneurs into this and how can they
play a role in development in just a few

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:13.849
play a role in development in just a few
 

00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:15.680
play a role in development in just a few
minutes let me answer that one

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:15.690
minutes let me answer that one
 

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:22.670
minutes let me answer that one
so so I think that there to pick up on

happen at the margins or boundaries of
 

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.109
happen at the margins or boundaries of
fields and cultures so the more you can

00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119
fields and cultures so the more you can
 

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:05.870

it and why there's some learnings about

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:11.490
it and why there's some learnings about

there's that I often there's this theme

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:32.420
there's that I often there's this theme
 

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.780
there's that I often there's this theme

I'd say one of the examples that it

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:45.890
I'd say one of the examples that it
 

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.320
I'd say one of the examples that it
seems to have worked quite well is

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:47.330
seems to have worked quite well is

01:16:18.299 --> 01:16:18.309
but there will be there may be progress
 

01:16:18.309 --> 01:16:21.810
but there will be there may be progress
from states and local governments on

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:21.820
from states and local governments on
 

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.779
from states and local governments on
these issues and in fact historically

standards that are modeled after the
 

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.029
standards that are modeled after the
California Standards so you're going to

01:16:45.029 --> 01:16:45.039
California Standards so you're going to
 

01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:47.699
California Standards so you're going to
see big big improvements and we've

01:16:47.699 --> 01:16:47.709
see big big improvements and we've
 

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:48.899
see big big improvements and we've
already seen this helping our

01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:48.909

their their step they're not being so

01:16:52.919 --> 01:16:52.929
their their step they're not being so
 

01:16:52.929 --> 01:16:54.600
their their step they're not being so
retrograde anymore they're stepping up

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:54.610
retrograde anymore they're stepping up
 

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.180
retrograde anymore they're stepping up
and getting up in front a little more on

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:57.190
and getting up in front a little more on
 

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.529

and you know I wish there was a class on
how to market to the bottom of the

01:24:22.979 --> 01:24:22.989
how to market to the bottom of the
 

01:24:22.989 --> 01:24:24.240
how to market to the bottom of the
pyramid I thought I think you'll be

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:24.250
pyramid I thought I think you'll be
 

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.919
pyramid I thought I think you'll be
really interesting and seatbelt and the

01:24:25.919 --> 01:24:25.929
really interesting and seatbelt and the
 

01:24:25.929 --> 01:24:28.410
really interesting and seatbelt and the
reason why I bring this up is that you

01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:28.420
reason why I bring this up is that you
 

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.760
reason why I bring this up is that you
know when you look at the bottom of the

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:29.770
know when you look at the bottom of the
 

01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.379
know when you look at the bottom of the
pyramid as you say the equation is

01:24:31.379 --> 01:24:31.389
pyramid as you say the equation is
 

01:24:31.389 --> 01:24:33.689
pyramid as you say the equation is
completely different right there's these

01:24:33.689 --> 01:24:33.699
completely different right there's these
 

01:24:33.699 --> 01:24:35.910
completely different right there's these
huge scales and the prices have to be

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920
huge scales and the prices have to be
 

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.860
huge scales and the prices have to be
drastically shifted as well because

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:37.870
drastically shifted as well because
 

01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:40.439
drastically shifted as well because
people that are on consuming a dollar a

01:24:40.439 --> 01:24:40.449
people that are on consuming a dollar a
 

01:24:40.449 --> 01:24:43.350
people that are on consuming a dollar a
day can they really afford to buy the

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360
day can they really afford to buy the
 

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.780
day can they really afford to buy the
gas stove that you currently mentioned

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:45.790
gas stove that you currently mentioned
 

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:48.330
gas stove that you currently mentioned
so I guess my question is you know is

01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:48.340
so I guess my question is you know is
 

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.050
so I guess my question is you know is
that in that analysis is that when a

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060
that in that analysis is that when a
 

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.540
that in that analysis is that when a
global public good can be created such

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:54.550
global public good can be created such
 

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:59.700
global public good can be created such
as a inventors incentive fund so new

01:24:59.700 --> 01:24:59.710
as a inventors incentive fund so new
 

01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.680
as a inventors incentive fund so new
inventors can enter the market and the

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:01.690
inventors can enter the market and the
 

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:03.330
inventors can enter the market and the
stability for the invention is

01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:03.340
stability for the invention is
 

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.490
stability for the invention is
guaranteed by governments that hey if

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:05.500
guaranteed by governments that hey if
 

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.020
guaranteed by governments that hey if
you do discover something that will work

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:07.030
you do discover something that will work
 

01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:09.060
you do discover something that will work
then we'll step in and buy the product

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:09.070
then we'll step in and buy the product
 

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.280
then we'll step in and buy the product
from you so is there a way for the two

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:11.290
from you so is there a way for the two
 

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:14.000

professor tobyhanna maybe a for the

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:17.830
professor tobyhanna maybe a for the
 

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.129
professor tobyhanna maybe a for the
moment totally in this new sector of

01:25:20.129 --> 01:25:20.139
moment totally in this new sector of
 

01:25:20.139 --> 01:25:22.910
moment totally in this new sector of
energy and energy efficiency and

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920
energy and energy efficiency and
 

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.260
energy and energy efficiency and
decarbonisation we don't for the moment

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:25.270
decarbonisation we don't for the moment
 

01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:27.479
decarbonisation we don't for the moment
maybe we don't have innovative models of

01:25:27.479 --> 01:25:27.489
maybe we don't have innovative models of
 

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.760
maybe we don't have innovative models of
a relation between government and

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:29.770
a relation between government and
 

01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:32.220
a relation between government and
private sector but when you look at the

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:32.230
private sector but when you look at the
 

01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:35.129
private sector but when you look at the
health issue again this year's because

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:35.139
health issue again this year's because
 

01:25:35.139 --> 01:25:42.439
health issue again this year's because
of malaria treatments or AIDS or more on

01:25:42.439 --> 01:25:42.449
of malaria treatments or AIDS or more on
 

01:25:42.449 --> 01:25:46.770
of malaria treatments or AIDS or more on
disease were not really there's no

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:46.780
disease were not really there's no
 

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.310
disease were not really there's no
private research on them then we found

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320
private research on them then we found
 

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.919
private research on them then we found
through innovative foundation logic gate

01:25:52.919 --> 01:25:52.929
through innovative foundation logic gate
 

01:25:52.929 --> 01:25:54.870
through innovative foundation logic gate
foundation there was a lot of discussion

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880
foundation there was a lot of discussion
 

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.649
foundation there was a lot of discussion

here has a lot of initiative to create

01:25:59.819 --> 01:25:59.829
here has a lot of initiative to create
 

01:25:59.829 --> 01:26:02.209
here has a lot of initiative to create
how could be the new model of research

01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219
how could be the new model of research
 

01:26:02.219 --> 01:26:04.859
how could be the new model of research
knowing that the private sector has the

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:04.869
knowing that the private sector has the
 

01:26:04.869 --> 01:26:07.589
knowing that the private sector has the
information so it's not is they have to

01:26:07.589 --> 01:26:07.599
information so it's not is they have to
 

01:26:07.599 --> 01:26:10.080
information so it's not is they have to
do it but you have to create a new

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:10.090
do it but you have to create a new
 

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:12.330
do it but you have to create a new
incentive model to for them to be

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:12.340
incentive model to for them to be
 

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.520
incentive model to for them to be
interested in these new diseases and I

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:14.530
interested in these new diseases and I
 

01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:16.520
interested in these new diseases and I
think we have to look for these models

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:16.530
think we have to look for these models
 

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:19.589
think we have to look for these models
because in a way the companies have to

01:26:19.589 --> 01:26:19.599
because in a way the companies have to
 

01:26:19.599 --> 01:26:22.319
because in a way the companies have to
have very different business model too

01:26:22.319 --> 01:26:22.329
have very different business model too
 

01:26:22.329 --> 01:26:24.659
have very different business model too
we have a very interesting conversation

01:26:24.659 --> 01:26:24.669
we have a very interesting conversation
 

01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:28.049
we have a very interesting conversation
with a major electricity company in

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:28.059
with a major electricity company in
 

01:26:28.059 --> 01:26:29.669
with a major electricity company in
France which which I am advising

01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679
France which which I am advising
 

01:26:29.679 --> 01:26:32.850
France which which I am advising
sometimes and the idea is how you will

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:32.860
sometimes and the idea is how you will
 

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.250
sometimes and the idea is how you will
sell less electricity and more energy

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:35.260
sell less electricity and more energy
 

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:38.009
sell less electricity and more energy
services which is how you sell less and

01:26:38.009 --> 01:26:38.019
services which is how you sell less and
 

01:26:38.019 --> 01:26:40.109
services which is how you sell less and
less electricity and more and more

01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119
less electricity and more and more
 

01:26:40.119 --> 01:26:42.299
less electricity and more and more
energy services that's the way your new

01:26:42.299 --> 01:26:42.309
energy services that's the way your new
 

01:26:42.309 --> 01:26:44.459
energy services that's the way your new
business model should be and that again

01:26:44.459 --> 01:26:44.469
business model should be and that again
 

01:26:44.469 --> 01:26:46.140
business model should be and that again
we are in the middle of the discussion

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:46.150
we are in the middle of the discussion
 

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:49.949
we are in the middle of the discussion
here and I see where if we could invent

01:26:49.949 --> 01:26:49.959
here and I see where if we could invent
 

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:53.909
here and I see where if we could invent
new models of relations that looking at

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:53.919
new models of relations that looking at
 

01:26:53.919 --> 01:26:55.169
new models of relations that looking at
the health sector I think it was

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:55.179
the health sector I think it was
 

01:26:55.179 --> 01:26:57.179
the health sector I think it was
interesting that I think that could help

01:26:57.179 --> 01:26:57.189
interesting that I think that could help
 

01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:59.310
interesting that I think that could help
it's not the old generation may be on

01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320
it's not the old generation may be on
 

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.009
it's not the old generation may be on
pull and push system Lanka of government

01:27:02.009 --> 01:27:02.019
pull and push system Lanka of government
 

01:27:02.019 --> 01:27:04.049
pull and push system Lanka of government
on the 70s maybe that's all the models

01:27:04.049 --> 01:27:04.059
on the 70s maybe that's all the models
 

01:27:04.059 --> 01:27:06.299
on the 70s maybe that's all the models
but we should be quick to invent them

01:27:06.299 --> 01:27:06.309
but we should be quick to invent them
 

01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:08.609
but we should be quick to invent them
anyway okay I think we have time for one

01:27:08.609 --> 01:27:08.619
anyway okay I think we have time for one
 

01:27:08.619 --> 01:27:10.890
anyway okay I think we have time for one
more question if there is one and then

01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:10.900
more question if there is one and then
 

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.189
more question if there is one and then
we'll do our wrap-up so please good

01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199
we'll do our wrap-up so please good
 

01:27:14.199 --> 01:27:17.640
we'll do our wrap-up so please good

have not taken place a couple of years

01:27:23.609 --> 01:27:23.619
have not taken place a couple of years
 

01:27:23.619 --> 01:27:29.609
have not taken place a couple of years
ago and I feel that there's a big role

01:27:29.609 --> 01:27:29.619
ago and I feel that there's a big role
 

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:32.969
ago and I feel that there's a big role
in putting the environmental issues into

01:27:32.969 --> 01:27:32.979
in putting the environmental issues into
 

01:27:32.979 --> 01:27:35.339
in putting the environmental issues into
policy discussions thanks to scientists

01:27:35.339 --> 01:27:35.349
policy discussions thanks to scientists
 

01:27:35.349 --> 01:27:39.629
policy discussions thanks to scientists
so I was I was my question is what is

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639
so I was I was my question is what is
 

01:27:39.639 --> 01:27:42.629
so I was I was my question is what is
the role of scientists in the policy

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639
the role of scientists in the policy
 

01:27:42.639 --> 01:27:45.839
the role of scientists in the policy
world and if they should what should

01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:45.849
world and if they should what should
 

01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:47.729
world and if they should what should
they do what is the role I think we only

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:47.739
they do what is the role I think we only
 

01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:49.890
they do what is the role I think we only
have one scientist here right mono so

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:49.900
have one scientist here right mono so
 

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.449
have one scientist here right mono so
you're going to have to speak for your

01:27:51.449 --> 01:27:51.459
you're going to have to speak for your
 

01:27:51.459 --> 01:27:55.830
you're going to have to speak for your
whole community like I know the depends

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840
whole community like I know the depends
 

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.009
whole community like I know the depends
on what you call science if the if there

01:27:59.009 --> 01:27:59.019
on what you call science if the if there
 

01:27:59.019 --> 01:28:01.350
on what you call science if the if there
if science is the pursuit of truth right

01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360
if science is the pursuit of truth right
 

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.909
if science is the pursuit of truth right
which is the same as the goal of

01:28:02.909 --> 01:28:02.919
which is the same as the goal of
 

01:28:02.919 --> 01:28:04.620
which is the same as the goal of
religion sometimes depending on how you

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:04.630
religion sometimes depending on how you
 

01:28:04.630 --> 01:28:06.200
religion sometimes depending on how you
define religion

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:06.210
define religion
 

01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:09.860
define religion
and I think science is the flag bearer

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:09.870
and I think science is the flag bearer
 

01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:14.000
and I think science is the flag bearer

who asked about landing on the moon
 

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.459
who asked about landing on the moon
probably someone thought about landing

01:28:28.459 --> 01:28:28.469
probably someone thought about landing
 

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:31.040
probably someone thought about landing
on the moon as a good idea in 5000 BC

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:31.050
on the moon as a good idea in 5000 BC
 

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.830
on the moon as a good idea in 5000 BC
but could not execute it so it's at a

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840
but could not execute it so it's at a

certain point science gets to the stage

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060
certain point science gets to the stage
 

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.180
certain point science gets to the stage
where you can say yes this is feasible

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:38.190
where you can say yes this is feasible
 

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:41.120
where you can say yes this is feasible
and hence you need to now be able to do

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:41.130
and hence you need to now be able to do
 

01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:42.290
and hence you need to now be able to do
something and I think that's the

01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300
something and I think that's the
 

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.630
something and I think that's the
fundamentally the role that scientists

01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:44.640
fundamentally the role that scientists
 

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.910
fundamentally the role that scientists
can play what they should play is a

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920
can play what they should play is a
 

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.310
can play what they should play is a
value judgment scary from that okay

01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320
value judgment scary from that okay
 

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.620
value judgment scary from that okay

interesting conversation I'm going to
 

01:29:00.930 --> 01:29:02.840
interesting conversation I'm going to
ask each of the panelists to give us

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:02.850
ask each of the panelists to give us
 

01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:05.840
ask each of the panelists to give us
some concluding thoughts about the role

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:05.850
some concluding thoughts about the role
 

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:09.310
some concluding thoughts about the role
of Technology in sustainable development

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320
of Technology in sustainable development
 

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.590
of Technology in sustainable development
from their own perspective and then I

01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600
from their own perspective and then I
 

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.600
from their own perspective and then I
understand after that we're going to

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:14.610
understand after that we're going to
 

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.690
understand after that we're going to
have a reception and so I'm always aware

01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:17.700
have a reception and so I'm always aware
 

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:18.950
have a reception and so I'm always aware
of the fact that I don't want to be

01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960
of the fact that I don't want to be

between a group of students and liquor
so I'm cognizant of the need to sum this

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:25.050
so I'm cognizant of the need to sum this
 

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:29.600
so I'm cognizant of the need to sum this

I'll build on the young man who asked
 

01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:34.930
I'll build on the young man who asked
about marketing for the vop class

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:34.940
about marketing for the vop class
 

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.240
about marketing for the vop class

and conferences that we just talk about
 

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.170
and conferences that we just talk about
things and nothing happens so I will

lots or growing number of faculty that

01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:49.980
lots or growing number of faculty that
 

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.530
lots or growing number of faculty that
are teaching classes like that so the

01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540
are teaching classes like that so the
 

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.760
are teaching classes like that so the
syllabi are out there so you just need

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:52.770
syllabi are out there so you just need
 

01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.890
syllabi are out there so you just need
to go find a faculty member who's

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900
to go find a faculty member who's
 

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.540
to go find a faculty member who's
willing to kind of put themselves out

to achieve good and and maybe look at
 

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.610
to achieve good and and maybe look at
whether marketing really is just about

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620
whether marketing really is just about
 

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.300
whether marketing really is just about
creating needs for things or once for

challenge for me I look at it this is a

01:30:45.319 --> 01:30:45.329
challenge for me I look at it this is a
 

01:30:45.329 --> 01:30:47.870
challenge for me I look at it this is a
time of a lot of opportunity but it's

01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880
time of a lot of opportunity but it's
 

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.399
time of a lot of opportunity but it's
also probably a time of a lot of

01:30:49.399 --> 01:30:49.409
also probably a time of a lot of
 

01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:51.290
also probably a time of a lot of
destruction in terms of destroying some

destruction in terms of destroying some
of the things that don't work as well

01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360
of the things that don't work as well
 

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:57.290
of the things that don't work as well
and i hearken back to what an economy

01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300
and i hearken back to what an economy
 

01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.740
and i hearken back to what an economy
does is trade in goods and services and

those words if you as you think about
 

01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:07.700
those words if you as you think about
them so think of companies whose goods

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:07.710
them so think of companies whose goods
 

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:10.010
them so think of companies whose goods
are really good or think of companies

01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020
are really good or think of companies

we're starting ones that do that thank

we're starting ones that do that thank
you for SLO so there's this thing I've

01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:27.449
you for SLO so there's this thing I've
 

01:31:27.449 --> 01:31:29.660
you for SLO so there's this thing I've
heard since I was a kid which is the

always wondered what they were trying to

01:31:32.899 --> 01:31:32.909
always wondered what they were trying to
 

01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:36.140
always wondered what they were trying to
get me to understand and I realized that

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:36.150
get me to understand and I realized that
 

01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:37.700
get me to understand and I realized that
perhaps what they're trying to tell me

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:37.710
perhaps what they're trying to tell me
 

01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:40.100
perhaps what they're trying to tell me
is that the evidence is that the meek

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:40.110
is that the evidence is that the meek
 

01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.859
is that the evidence is that the meek
are coming in lost in everything that

01:31:42.859 --> 01:31:42.869
are coming in lost in everything that
 

01:31:42.869 --> 01:31:45.439
are coming in lost in everything that
you see but I guess another way to look

01:31:45.439 --> 01:31:45.449
you see but I guess another way to look
 

01:31:45.449 --> 01:31:48.350
you see but I guess another way to look
at that saying is that if points are

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360
at that saying is that if points are
 

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.020
at that saying is that if points are
essentially what we have learned from

essentially what we have learned from

essentially what we have learned from
biodiversity anytime we have an

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980
biodiversity anytime we have an
 

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.490
biodiversity anytime we have an
ecological system which turns to

01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.500
ecological system which turns to
 

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.709
ecological system which turns to
monoculture eventually it vanishes and

01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719
monoculture eventually it vanishes and
 

01:31:57.719 --> 01:32:00.290
monoculture eventually it vanishes and
if you have a mix of strategies if you

01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:00.300
if you have a mix of strategies if you
 

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.479
if you have a mix of strategies if you
have a mix of groups trying to look at

01:32:02.479 --> 01:32:02.489
have a mix of groups trying to look at
 

01:32:02.489 --> 01:32:04.850
have a mix of groups trying to look at
these problems then you end up with a

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:04.860
these problems then you end up with a
 

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.640
these problems then you end up with a
more stable situation so whether we look

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:07.650
more stable situation so whether we look
 

01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:09.680
more stable situation so whether we look
at the policy side or the technology

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:09.690
at the policy side or the technology
 

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.169
at the policy side or the technology
side or countries such as China or

side or countries such as China or
 

01:32:12.179 --> 01:32:14.870
side or countries such as China or
countries such as Bangladesh strategies

01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880
countries such as Bangladesh strategies
 

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.850
countries such as Bangladesh strategies
pursued by different groups are somewhat

01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860
pursued by different groups are somewhat
 

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.010
pursued by different groups are somewhat
different and I think the richness of

of on the risks and that was
 

01:34:44.130 --> 01:34:46.790
of on the risks and that was
time that was difficult to get the same

01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800
time that was difficult to get the same
 

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.709
time that was difficult to get the same
vision of the risk and now my students

01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719
vision of the risk and now my students

the receipt we we already know that we
 

01:34:58.679 --> 01:35:00.830
the receipt we we already know that we
we know that the risk are there we are

have a common vision a common assessment
 

01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:09.620
have a common vision a common assessment
of the risk and that is I think the main

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:09.630
of the risk and that is I think the main
 

01:35:09.630 --> 01:35:12.890
of the risk and that is I think the main
