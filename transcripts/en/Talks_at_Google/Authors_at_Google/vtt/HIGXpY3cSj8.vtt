00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.140
SPEAKER: Clapperton
Chakanetsa Mavhunga's

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.330
professional interests lie
in the history, theory,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.870
and practice of science,
technology, innovation,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.690
and entrepreneurship in
the international context,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.120
with a focus on Africa.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.420
He joined MIT as an
assistant professor in 2008

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.030
after completing his PhD at
the University of Michigan.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.500
He is the author of "Transient
Workspaces, Technologies

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
of Everyday Innovation
in Zimbabwe."

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.600
And his second book
is an edited volume,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.520
which we'll hear about
today, entitled, "What

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.932
Do Science, Technology, and
Innovation Mean from Africa?"

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:41.890
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Mavhunga.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:45.992
CLAPPERTON CHAKANETSA
MAVHUNGA: Thank you.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.760
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:02.620
I would like to start off by
giving just a brief background

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.900
to how this project came about.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.870
It's a progression from my first
book, "Transient Workspaces."

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.320
And what I was trying
to do in that book was

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.580
to ask this very important
question; why is it

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.870
that in the history of
technology, science,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.980
and Innovation, Africa does
not seem to be on the map.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.180
Is it a question that it
does not have any technology,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.955
or simply that it
has been ignored?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.940
So as you know, Africa
is a very big continent,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.440
54 countries, probably plus,
if you include the islands.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.320
And this is not something
that you can just

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.130
cover inside one book on your
own in a short period of time.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
So I wanted to ask this
question on a larger scale,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169
and this was the
birth of this book.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.940
Take a closer look at the title.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.660
The major word there is "from."

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.210
The idea was to take
seriously African voices.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.170
Not just as empirical evidence
or cannon fodder for a theory,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.530
but as an intellectual
audience in their own right.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.230
What if we took what they
know seriously enough.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.710
To do that, I organized
a number of scholars,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.390
some of them mentors to
me, others colleagues

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390
at the same level; DA
Massolo at Louisville,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.030
Shadrek Chirikure at
University of Cape Town,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.806
Gerie Augusto at Brown, Katriene
Pype at KU Leuven, Ron Eglash,

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:12.180
who some of you may know, at
RPI, Ellen Foster, his student,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.960
Toluwalogo Odumosu,
and Garrick Lewis,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.270
both of them at
University of Virginia,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.290
both engineers, and their
colleagues, [? Nazima. ?]

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.920
So the idea was could
we have a conversation

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.970
across disciplines?

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.640
I didn't want this idea of us,
just the science and technology

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.460
studies people
speaking to ourselves.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.350
I wanted to open up
this conversation

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.730
to multiple disciplines; the
bench sciences, engineering

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.190
disciplines, lawyers.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.650
The conference that I
organized in November 2014

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.740
was actually very eclectic.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.330
And actually, this became
the actual title of the book.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.100
We haggled over this.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.780
Some of you may
know from publishing

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.510
that publishers want a
certain type of title

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.190
for marketing reasons.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.420
I said, no, this is the title.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.270
Like I say, there is this
persistent negative image

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.890
of Africa.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.980
But there is also
the agency of some

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.140
of us working on Africa to
escape a rather stifling

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.690
Western dependence on theory.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.660
Could we imagine science,
technology, and innovation

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.780
from, say, our own languages?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.480
I look at definitions
of science, technology,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.540
and innovation today, and I'm
sure you would agree that they

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.870
are very reductionist.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:08.020
Science comes to be removed from
all kinds of social dimensions.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.980
But as we know, science
itself is a social activity.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.930
The idea was to restore that
and see where we would get.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.130
In Africa, for example,
it is impossible to reckon

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.860
with any major innovation
without taking seriously

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.480
the religious aspects that
undergird the rich wall

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.640
of knowledge production.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.660
The same for technology.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.660
If you look at
technology today, it's

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.070
as if it's just
technical gadgets.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.310
And I'm saying this at Google.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.110
But it's a whole complex system;
social, technical, cultural, et

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.220
cetera, et cetera.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.460
My interest was to restore
that, but also to disturb

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.080
the meaning of technology.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.250
Is it that obvious, or
could it be something more?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.580
Could it be that we are--

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.790
in being-- in reducing
it to gadgets,

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.670
we are missing out
on something else?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.880
What could that
something else be?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.280
The same with-- if we look
at innovation, innovation

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.720
has been reduced to this
very commercialized,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.410
techno-centric realm.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.340
So what are we to do
with those activities

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.200
that people engage with
that fall outside that?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.210
Now, why did this conversations
OK when they did--

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.470
this was just a year
before I got tenured, 2015.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.430
And I was beginning to be
frustrated by the insular

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.490
way in which academia
engages with questions

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.930
that affect the world.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.150
And so I begin to engage
policymakers, for example.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.130
Could I see myself
playing a role

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.655
making interventions in policy?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.650
I had been conducting
research since 2008

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.800
on what I call everyday
knowledge, that knowledge that

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.700
sustains people when the--

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.690
our nice careers
here, when people

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.460
don't have those carriers.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.420
They never went to school, or
if they were fired from work.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.250
Many of these
people in Africa go

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.260
back to what is now
called informal sector

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.820
or the informal economy.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.370
What undergirds the
informal activity?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.900
These skills that you need to
go by every day, most of them

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.870
are not in the curriculum,
in the school curriculum.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.660
A good number of
them are actually

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.420
dismissed traditionally
as primitive or simply

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.070
unknowledgeable.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.500
So I say that I started
this project in 2008.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.110
By then I had already
begun to hear this talk,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.520
Africa is rising.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.620
You're seeing a
new young African

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.560
who is quite driven
to make a difference.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.520
There is one generation
that still says colonialism

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.090
is to blame for all our ills.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.510
There is another that
says, no, no, no.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.970
We have been
independent for a while.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.850
Quit this nonsense.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.909
This generation that
I'm talking about,

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.450
the younger generation,
I feel they needed

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.300
a different kind of
narrative about Africa,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:52.070
deeply rooted in history, but
also tackling the key words

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:57.290
in their own time, like tech,
like science, like innovation,

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.050
like entrepreneurship.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.170
And yet when you look
at Africa's history,

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.020
it's a blank slate.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.264
Historians have ignored that.

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:07.180
Anthropologists, yeah.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.060
They are beginning
to come around to it.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.050
As for engineering,
science, and tech,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.960
they don't deal with that stuff.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.824
So each nation subsists on
its own myths and heroes.

00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:23.990
What kind of heroes will
this generation subsist on?

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.540
That's the basis for
writing this book.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.190
It was intended for what,
since the book was published,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:44.200
is now imaged clearly in my
mind as a project of training

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.590
critical thinker doers.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.840
In other words, it's
to say that Africa

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.320
has a lot of critical thinkers,
but most of them are not doers.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200
And those that actually
do things are not critical

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.850
thinkers.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.130
So how do you bring these
two and square the circle?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.130
The research that I
had done both during

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.150
and since PhD had
taught me that the best

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.290
way to be effective
in the world is

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.620
to be humble before knowledge.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.980
To not appear like you
monopolize the space

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.660
of common sense and reason.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.480
And I was coming from being
at MIT as an academic.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.950
And what I learned in my field
work and through growing up

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:43.080
was a lot of knowledge that
is handed down from generation

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.830
to generation through practice.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.380
And part of this
required me to have

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.715
to really look at Africa in a
different light as somebody who

00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:57.225
was coming back from
years in the diaspora.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.730
I found that one of
the most underestimated

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.440
strengths, the most
underrated assets of Africa,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.950
is what one would call
creative resilience.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.790
Where even when people's
backs are against the wall,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.980
they don't just die
or roll over and die.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.830
They die fighting.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:26.250
And so that creative
spirit is often ignored.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.710
People just talk about
oh, Africa's people

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.730
are very resilient.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.120
Look at what is thrown at them.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.290
No, it's not just resilience.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.370
It's also creativity.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.940
You can be resilient
all you want,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.840
but if you are faced
with hunger and death,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.310
you have to innovate.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.770
The concern for me was that a
lot of what we are seeing now

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.400
in the African context,
in terms of innovation,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.190
arises out of trying to make do.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.110
To deal with a very
tough situation.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.800
So let me take you through
the individual chapters

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.670
in the process of answering
this question, what

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.230
do science, technology, and
innovation mean from Africa.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.930
I have said that I held--

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.940
I convened a meeting
at MIT in 2014.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.170
I had also organized the
previous one in South Africa

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.700
to recast the idea
of laboratory.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.290
Why recast it?

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.830
Because I don't
believe that the built

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.600
laboratory is the only
laboratory that exists.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.370
If we limit it to that, we are
shutting out the door a lot

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.420
of possibilities.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.000
Now, where would
you start with this?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.290
The first port of
call for me was

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.380
can we engage
philosophers who have

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.290
been dealing with a
lot of these questions

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.260
about African knowledge?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.700
And so in the chapter
that DA Masolo writes,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.080
it's a very interesting
example from Egypt.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.620
The concern for the
afterlife and how it gave

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.420
rise to the science
of mummification,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.790
and this discovery
of natron, which

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.370
was used to preserve the body.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:38.150
And one of the theories he
advances is that this was--

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:44.360
the rationale for turning to
natron and mummifying a body

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.850
or preserving it
in a fresh state

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.270
was so that it could
travel the journey

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.870
to the afterlife
in a fresh state,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:59.460
instead of arriving there
in a decomposed state.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.470
Now, however we may
think about the belief

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.760
systems of the ancient Egyptians
is not the question here.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.690
Usually, in the past, African
knowledge has been dismissed.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.780
Oh, this is cuckoo.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.630
That can't happen.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:22.600
And yet, when you look at
the science that follows,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.206
usually, that's what we
just take, and say, OK.

00:14:25.206 --> 00:14:26.330
This is what we hold on to.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.830
The rest is rubbish.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.640
Marsolo touches on
what is often conceived

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.330
of as a "primitive
society" in trying

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:44.025
to find technology and
innovation in that space,

00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:49.430
the Masai of Kenya and
other parts of East Africa.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.040
And how they have been
able to both maintain

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.990
salient aspects of designing
spears as well as adopting

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.562
and adapting some elements
that are coming in.

00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:12.730
In my own chapter, I focused
on something different.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.150
I wanted to see if
we can really think

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.925
about science from a
truly indigenous language.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:28.160
And if we did that, what kind of
keywords might we come up with?

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.340
And what I found was
quite interesting.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.600
In several parts
of the chapter, I

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.730
give the example of the way in
which observations of animals

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:49.870
and animals signs give rise
to a whole way of defending

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.970
against enemy attack and
constructing defense systems.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.430
My best is mice.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:03.100
As a rule, mice always
have a plan B. When

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.370
they dig, they have two exits.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.970
One is the obvious one.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.780
The other is the
other you don't see.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.520
So they enter up this way.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.920
If you wait here and think
that the mouse is going

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:23.200
to come back this way, and you
are ready, poised to hit it,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.890
oops.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.510
It has already
bolted the other way.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.100
It's gone.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.480
When it digs, there are
all these various caverns

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.280
that it hides in.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.510
So you may be digging this way,
and it takes a detour and just

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.130
hides there.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.030
Mice are also known to
be very good at defending

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.970
against seige warfare.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.650
One example I give
there is they stick--

00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:00.740
and squirrels do this as well,
but in this case, it was mice.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.170
And this had very
substantial consequences

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.510
to the concept of chimurenga.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.369
The idea that women would be
stocking food in the caves

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:15.589
while all the men would be
busy mounting the defenses.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.420
It was a communal effort.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.140
What I'm interested there
is not so much the war.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.750
I tend to be anti-war.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.290
I am much more
interested in the idea

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.310
that you can learn a lot of
things from other animals.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.030
And I'm sure if you look at
some of the science that's

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.050
coming out, like
Geckskin, for example,

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.850
it's coming out of this
idea to learn the animal

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:49.360
world in order for you to
apply to other purposes.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.110
For Shadrek Chirikure,
the interesting thing

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.210
was to think about
the laboratory

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.460
as a site which is not
fixed or tethered to space.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.900
It's something that is moving.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.720
You can lift it and
press it somewhere.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.080
What remains constant
is the practice.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.500
And for this example,
this is a stunning example

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.030
of how you could actually
build furnaces, blast furnaces

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:21.070
in clay in order to
smelt iron and do so

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:27.850
in a way that is capable
of being shifted elsewhere.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.670
And I'm calling this
science because how else

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.080
do you explain the fact that
these ironsmiths on this

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.610
[INAUDIBLE] plateau in
the Congo, in the 16th

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.080
to 18th centuries, they
out-competed the Portuguese.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.520
We had come with their
engineers from Europe

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.950
to construct foundries.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.750
And the Portuguese,
lo and behold,

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.590
they couldn't penetrate
the local market.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:19:00.530
In fact, they did not even have
confidence in their own iron.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.190
And then they deferred
to these locals

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:08.500
in order to continue
to be viable.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.810
Part of what I
find interesting is

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.390
the way in which
these ironsmiths were

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.805
able to manipulate air supply.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.330
To initiate combustion
and control it.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:27.760
To know what kind of trees
were required to provide wood

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.580
with good charcoal.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.880
And to be able to
do so in such a way

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.910
that they prepared the charcoal
under specific conditions.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.730
That's science.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.400
There is no way we
can go around it.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.970
That's science.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.880
So iron working is one
of the two activities

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880
that Chirikure looks at.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.560
The other one is pottery.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.210
Pottery is interesting because
it's practiced by women, mostly

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.260
women in Africa.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.570
I've not heard of
societies where men

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.440
are to be found making pots.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.480
Nor have I heard of--

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.630
until, perhaps, recent times,
of any women smelting iron.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.050
Both were governed by taboos.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:29.900
If a woman comes anywhere
near the furnace,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:35.760
the iron would not
come out nicely.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:41.740
At the same time, if a
man came anywhere near

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.380
where women were making
pots, they would crack.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.740
That was the taboo.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.900
Production could
only take place under

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.270
these specific conditions.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.160
Nothing else.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.800
And before anything was
done, these folks had

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.010
to go before their ancestors
and the ghosts of technology,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:12.340
if you want, to say, this
is what we are going to do.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.820
If anything failed, they
would blame the failure

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.660
to observe taboo.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.340
Taboo may sound
strange, doesn't it?

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.320
It's nothing more than
the kinds of things

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.490
that you do in science.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.240
Science has its own taboos here.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.540
The do's and don'ts under which
an experiment is carried out.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.710
We often think of
innovation as something

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.920
that we are free to do.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.120
And if you look at the
narrative of innovation,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.970
it is usually this independence
period of creativity and risk

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.420
taking, particularly
by the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.450
Think slavery.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:07.030
How do you innovate freedom?

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:12.520
Or how do you innovate
survival or a life

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.180
under bondage, when your
life has been reduced

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.660
to nothing more than a
machine of mass production

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.350
on the plantation?

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.410
That's the focus of
Gerie Augusto's chapter.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:30.180
She is trying to reposition
the Trans Atlantic

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.760
trade in Africans as slaves--

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.320
I don't call it slave trade--

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.570
as a technology transfer
and innovation process.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.320
The argument she's making
through seeds and medicines

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.090
is an interesting one.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.960
That it's easy to say
they were carriers

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.170
of ready-made
products from Africa

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.340
or knowledge in their
heads from Africa.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.660
That's easy to say.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.670
Some scholars have said that
for ice, others for masonry,

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.200
others for metals.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.710
The work of Candace
[INAUDIBLE],, for example.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:20.170
But what she's saying is that
in that space between departure

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:25.440
and arrival, enslaved
Africans had to survive.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.660
The only way you would
survive was to keep yourself

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.852
with high morale.

00:23:31.852 --> 00:23:33.560
Of course, there was
also the possibility

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.800
that you could recuse yourself
from the space of being

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.590
molested by your captor and
just jump overboard and end

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.124
it and deny them profit.

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:46.630
That was another way.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:51.550
Still very creative under
difficult circumstances.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:57.040
Or you could take only those
resources that you had--

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.380
there was nothing
else to work with--

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.290
and shift them in form.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.860
Transform them in order
to create something that

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.750
would enable you to survive.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.650
So the space between
departure and arrival

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.240
was not a dead space.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.560
It was a creative space.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.720
What she calls the
inter-trance, the in between.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.030
At the same time,
when they arrived,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.060
picture yourself arriving in
a foreign environment, where

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.135
you have to eke out a living,
even as you are enslaved.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.200
What she is calling
attention to is

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.060
to look at the slave quarters
as an innovation space.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.430
I like this picture
because it partly tells

00:24:54.430 --> 00:25:02.610
a biography of me growing
up, where a lot of things

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.330
were not-- did not
have space locally.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.710
It was during sanctions.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.530
And I saw the Rhodesian
community innovating

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.170
in very interesting ways.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.370
Replacing imported
parts with local ones

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.680
that they could
easily manufacture.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:29.040
And when they ran their
life, they actually

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.070
began to manufacture
them locally.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.160
Examples include a
lot of the Humvees

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.910
that you see in the
battlefields in the Middle East

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.640
that are coming from
Australia, much of that

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.610
R&amp;D was Rhodesian made.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.370
These Rhodesians then
migrated after independence.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.870
They did not want to have--

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.430
to be ruled by a
black government.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.290
They migrated.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.147
That's one narrative.

00:25:55.147 --> 00:25:56.730
The other narrative
that's interesting

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:05.030
is that if you wanted your
mom to cook food for you,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:10.490
you had to make the utensils
necessary to process it.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.650
In precolonial
Africa, for example,

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.110
there were no hammer mills.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.540
There were no steam machines.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:22.870
The only way you could
grind grain and produce meal

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.870
was to produce
mortar and pestle.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.800
And what you see in this
picture is a process.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.180
A dad taking his son through
the process of how you make one.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.410
And to the point until
your mother actually

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:43.080
pounds grain to
make food for you.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.900
At MIT, we talk
of mind and hand.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.870
This is mind and
hand as you can get.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:56.550
The subject of Toluwalogo
Odumosu's chapter

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.800
is an interesting one.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.710
Because you are hearing
more and more now

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:07.000
Africa being referred
to as leapfrogging.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.020
For most of Africa, there
was no fixed land line.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.910
Then comes cyber, which
by the way, did not come--

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:18.510
cell phones.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.980
They did not come just
by the grace of God,

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.630
nor were they brought
by foreigners.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:33.000
The first-- the pioneers
of cellphones in Africa,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.610
who brought cellular
phone to Africa,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:46.950
included people like Miko
Rwayitare, who founded Telcel.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:55.910
For us to have undersea cables
that circumnavigated the Cape,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.120
that idea was pushed
very vociferously

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.150
by former South African
president, Thabo Mbeki.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.430
His argument was simple.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:10.940
There was one slot reserved for
hosting the World Cup for 2010,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.360
and it would go to
an African country.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.100
Now, which country would it be?

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.490
Would it be Egypt?

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.680
Egypt was too far north.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.910
In any case, it was almost right
on the path of the undersea

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.900
cables going to India.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.190
The argument that Mbeki
was making was interesting.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.090
If Egypt gets the
World Cup, Africa

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:43.160
has lost its chance
to have its internet.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.080
It has lost this chance.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.290
So the only way it can
have it is if the Cup

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.730
came to South Africa.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.390
We now know that if you look
at the map, the cyber map

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:58.190
of Africa, that has come to be.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.230
Come to pass.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.400
Since then, we have seen
interesting developments.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.020
We have seen innovations in
mobile money with M-pesa,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.760
which is revolutionizing
not just African--

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.820
how Africans movement.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.400
It's revolutionizing the
way the whole world does

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.130
mobile banking and so forth.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.580
The latest innovation is
by Zipline International

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.820
in Rwanda, a partnership
that has resulted

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:35.240
in the supply of blood to
difficult-to-reach countries

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.990
using drones.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.165
And this is now
expanding into Tanzania.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.060
These things have
policy implications.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.310
For example, how
can a sensibility

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.730
of Africa as the center of
technology shape policy?

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:07.260
And part of the reason why
we produced this volume when

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.190
we did is because
we were concerned

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.870
that the strategic
plan for Africa,

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:19.870
the science, technology, and
innovation strategy for Africa,

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:26.350
focuses on big science and
national systems of innovation

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:33.980
derived from mostly European
countries whose economies are

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.310
science intensive.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.580
They are research intensive.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.600
By contrast, 70%
of Africa's economy

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.320
is generated in the
informal sector, produced

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.657
by that everyday knowledge
that I highlighted earlier on.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.800
So part of what
Chux Daniels does

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.010
is to try and return us to
that kind of conversation.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.770
Can we have something more
sophisticated than just

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.170
cutting and pasting?

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:13.190
In closing, I've talked
so far about what we did.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.050
This is what has happened since.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.450
The imperative now
is to transform

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.610
some of these findings
into actual curricula.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.110
And so we have been
turning the networks

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:36.770
that we built through this
process into syllabi like this.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.850
For example, how
about we take students

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:47.420
to these sites like this forge
here, and taking seriously

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.350
the science involved in this
and combine it with engineering.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.180
What might we get?

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.020
How about we take
knowledge of grain storage,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:05.430
under which Africans
dug underground

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:11.160
or constructed structures
made of clay and heated them.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.910
And after heating,
and it's cool,

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.650
they put grain inside
and then seal it,

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.610
thereby ensuring that
no weevils get in.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:28.410
What are we to make
up of that, as opposed

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:34.180
to using all these toxic
pesticides to preserve grain.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.570
Finally, I'll say that one
of the things that I've

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.450
been trying to do
is to demystify

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.550
the purpose of education.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.570
And this is a matter
that is dear to my heart.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:55.900
When we are educated, we leave
the villages, the communities,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.170
and go abroad, we
never come back.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.220
And many of these insights,
as good as the were,

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.930
they were produced by academics.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:11.440
And these academics,
what do we do?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.230
Does it just end in talk?

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:19.300
I said earlier that Africa
has a huge deficit of doers.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.850
A lot of critical thinkers
who are not doers.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.270
A lot of doers who are
not critical thinkers.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.130
The challenge personally
was what have I ever done?

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.620
Because I want to change
the whole of Africa.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.040
I want to change the world.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.200
What have I ever really done
for my own little village?

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.570
And so I wanted to challenge
fellow academics who

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:46.240
come from Africa to say, can't
we be catalysts and build it?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.200
So I returned home,
remodeled my own homestead

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.800
into a kind of laboratory
where I could try out--

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.900
if I had ideas that
I thought worked,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.000
why not try them
out first to see

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.280
if they work before I can
propose them to government?

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.840
I can't just talk from--

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.850
that's empty rhetoric.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.179
And as you spend substantial
presence in the village,

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:20.590
you realize that
actually, people,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.020
where they work,
every day, these

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.940
are their own laboratories.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.650
Like this young man
here, who told me

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:31.810
that if you want to see
if one fertilizer works

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:36.219
among three of them,
just plant three crops.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.080
Three plants, right?

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.000
One, two, three, and then put
the same amount of fertilizer

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.090
on each.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:45.900
Three different.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.590
The one that grows more
has justified itself

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.340
as the better option.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.950
So you could come to that
space as a learner and not

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.700
just somebody who's
telling people what to do.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.600
Finally, there is a
concept that I talk about

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.710
in the introduction called
[? nimbe. ?] Under which

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.990
the society came together
to do communal work--

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.690
the whole village--

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:22.700
to do community work
for women were widowed,

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.840
for orphans, or those that
were too old to do work,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.340
or simply for those that
had excelled and got

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.200
overwhelmed by their
own crop production.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:43.400
It's called [? nimbe. ?] It's
an ethos of collective work.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.620
The idea that I
was bringing back

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.820
was can't we do this
again, but this time

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.380
focusing on self-development
in the village.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.330
The picture you see
was taken this morning.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:02.810
It is a picture of us
electrifying our own village

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.330
using that concept.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.890
It's not easy.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.820
There will be people who are
still very individualistic.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.210
But it has turned out, once
you cut off the rough edges,

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:21.190
this turned out to be a
very, very successful model.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.816
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.880
AUDIENCE: You remind
me of an-- ahem.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.170
Excuse me.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:40.670
An experience I had recently
with a community garden.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.830
It is near here.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.770
It is not individual plots
for people in the community.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.500
It is done communally,
as a group.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.380
And many of the people in that--

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.540
maybe most-- in that group,
are engineers, and a lot

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.310
of the engineers from MIT.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.000
And I learned from
there that farmers--

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.320
in the US, at least, in the
Western world, don't innovate.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.460
The industry of
selling them products

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.190
does the development,
the innovation,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.060
and sells them answers to
their questions, basically.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.240
So they don't ask questions
at all, themselves.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.180
But clearly, in a village,
you get this sense

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.920
of being not just empowered,
but required to ask and answer

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.660
your own questions, or
they will never be known.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.960
It seems a natural thing
for a village environment

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:41.990
or a group large enough to
be able to differentiate who

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.840
is doing what work,
but small enough

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.030
that everyone is an
individual, and everyone

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.550
can hear what one
person has to say,

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.430
to do that kind of innovation.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:57.740
To learn, perhaps,
that one kind of tree

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.020
blocks the wind better
when the wind is making

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.170
it difficult for young plants.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.270
So thank you for
bringing that to light.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.950
But it very much
clicked with me,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.917
based on my personal experience.

00:38:08.917 --> 00:38:11.000
CLAPPERTON CHAKANETSA
MAVHUNGA: Thank you so much.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.930
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if you see
one particular nation in Africa

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:20.150
or a particular city or region
as the most likely to export

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.940
the next world-changing
technology,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.990
or if that doesn't
really matter so much,

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.130
and if you're more focused
on some of the work

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.400
you've shared today that
really has direct, local impact

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.780
in communities.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.501
CLAPPERTON CHAKANETSA
MAVHUNGA: Rwanda.

00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:35.000
Rwanda.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.499
Why?

00:38:35.499 --> 00:38:39.980
Because if you look at what
President Paul Kageme is doing,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.160
he's willing to take risks.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.540
I was very impressed
by the story

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.530
that the [INAUDIBLE] Ronaldo
from Zipline told me.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:52.540
He was saying that everybody
else just laughed them off,

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.570
basically.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:39:00.220
Even the big
pharmaceutical companies,

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.190
the big foundations
in the United States,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.560
let alone government.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.440
They just said, you
are crazy, little boy.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.570
Get out of here.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:14.690
But Kageme was prepared
to take the risk.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.395
And they piloted
the first-- it's

00:39:18.395 --> 00:39:21.260
the world's first, actually.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.840
So that on it's own, what's
happening, is very interesting.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.550
You already have
M-pesa, so that,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.950
to say nothing of [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.840
Now, one could
say, oh, but these

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.270
are people who are
coming from outside,

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.400
or they're big
corporations, in the case

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.390
of-- that are doing this.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:44.360
But why is it that it's
possible in Africa?

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.230
And what kind of infrastructures
are they creating?

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.060
Zipline is very interesting.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:55.480
Where it goes next
will be critical.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.400
So I would say Rwanda,
without any doubt.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.670
Second to which
would be Mauritius.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.330
I think the big innovation
will be in problem

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.520
solving education.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.540
You have two institutions,
one in Mauritius

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.865
called African
Leadership First Academy,

00:40:14.865 --> 00:40:18.090
they're now a university.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:25.680
And they are modeling their
education system as declaring--

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.740
you declare--

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:33.210
a student declares not
a major, but a mission.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:38.340
And one of their missions is
to solve global challenges.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.250
[INAUDIBLE] in Ghana is
doing the same thing,

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.650
I think differently, though.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.330
But I would watch
Rwanda in Mauritius.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.099
AUDIENCE: I work on education
initiatives at Google.

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:52.140
I was wondering if you
could provide a little bit

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.020
more specific information
about those examples

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.560
that you just
mentioned, where there

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.530
are these educational
models around mission

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.370
rather than knowledge for
the sake of knowledge?

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.680
Where can I go and learn
more information about that?

00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:11.410
CLAPPERTON CHAKANETSA
MAVHUNGA: They--

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.325
so the thing with African
Leadership University

00:41:14.325 --> 00:41:18.360
is that there is a big vision.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.470
And they have started
their journey to get there.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:26.160
And they are on a big
recruitment drive.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.380
That's how I got to know
that, in the interest

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.790
of full disclosure.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.830
What interests me
about them is that they

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.650
are willing to gamble
and take big risks

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.590
and start entirely
something new.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:42.120
They are not interested
in settled waters.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.450
Because when the water
is crystal clear,

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.850
you see where the crocodile is.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.730
They are prepared to
plunge in and gamble

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.570
that the crocodiles will
see that they are too brave,

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.800
they must be banking on
something, and back off.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.680
So their website
is a good start,

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.070
but they are very
approachable in terms of--

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.850
Fred Swaniker, this
founder himself,

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:09.390
is very, very approachable.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:14.130
They are mixing this corporate
style of doing things with,

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.390
I can't say traditional way
of delivering education,

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.970
but that corporate
style is interesting.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.470
Because when he has a vision,
he can push it forward.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.596
SPEAKER: Please join me again
in thanking Professor Mavhunga.

00:42:28.596 --> 00:42:29.707
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:29.707 --> 00:42:31.790
CLAPPERTON CHAKANETSA
MAVHUNGA: Thank you so much.
