00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.575
- So when I thought, oh
you know what I wanna do?

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.778 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wanna jet ski
across the country.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.980
People said, that's impossible.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.982
Turns out they're right.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.451
(audience laughs)

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.320 align:start size:84% position:16%
But then I said what
about jet skiing

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.721
from Chicago to New Orleans?

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.856
And they said,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.690
Eh,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.459
it's physically doable,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.096
but it's incredibly stupid.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.098
And I said, let's do it.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
I jet skied from
Chicago to New Orleans.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.506
We got some jumping fish!

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.376
To try to raise $50,000
for Heifer International.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.446 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do the people at
Heifer International know

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.381
that this is what you're doing?

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.251
- So they could provide 500
goats and 1,000 chickens

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.821
to African families in need,
and help create a sustainable

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.956
economy for their communities,

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I really
thought I can do it.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.161
Let's get wet for goats!

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.899
(screaming)

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.471
(pounding orchestra music)

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.474
(slow motion bleat)

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.815 line:0%
- Really gonna ride a jet ski
to New Orleans, from Chicago?

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:22.649
- Yes.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.418 line:0%
- There's no way you'll do this.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.721 line:0%
Let's run down every reason
why you're not qualified.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.625 align:start size:94% position:6%
You haven't been on a
jet ski in over 15 years.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.560
- I'll figure it out.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.861
- You're not a good swimmer.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.030 line:0%
You don't have a
waterproof phone,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start size:94% position:6%
so you have no real sense
of where you're going

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.234
- But I believe in myself?

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.336
- Yeah, you're not doing this.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:45.238 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm happy you guys
believe in me, so thank you.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.073 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- You wanna do a show?

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.341
- Let's do a show.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.676 align:start size:81% position:19%
- How fast are you
gonna be going?

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.010
(laughter)

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.378
- He's never gonna stop.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.647 align:start size:88% position:13%
- 20 miles an hour?
- You don't even know?!

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:58.017
How do you keep pirates from
stealing the jet ski for you?

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.719
Pirates are gonna
steal you jet ski.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.254
Then you're just gonna be stuck

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.523
in the middle of the country.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.458 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm excited that you
guys are here to see me off

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.161
possibly on my last
day of being alive.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.063
(laughter)

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:15.068
- I'm nervous about jet skiing
from Chicago to New Orleans.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:18.805 align:start size:84% position:16%
Somewhere in here
is what we're doing.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is how well
organized this idea is.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.345
So here it is, this is the
route that I take tomorrow.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:28.915 align:start size:75% position:25%
Chicago to TBD!
(laughter)

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.719 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I was wondering if
everybody would be willing

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.421
to come up on stage so
we can get a photograph,

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start size:84% position:16%
like a class picture,
for this night.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.625
Ready?

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.194
- [All] Let's get wet for goats!

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.462
(audience cheers)

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.931
- Thank you very much everybody!

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.599
I'm happy you exist.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.771
(driving rock music)

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.176 line:0%
- Kurt is actually facing
1200 miles of waterway

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.844 line:0%
on six different rivers.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.346 line:0%
Part of that, like the upper
Mississippi, is never designed

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.714 line:0%
for recreational boating.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:02.849
The hazards to be
faced on the river

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.083
include changes in weather,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.752 align:start size:84% position:16%
opposing heavy
commercial traffic.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.587 align:start size:81% position:19%
We also have to
be facing the fact

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.656
that there aren't any gas
stations along that way

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.424
so we have to have
a land support team

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.594
that is with us at
all points in time.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.202
(epic fanfare)

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:28.074
(light applause)

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.643
- Hello, fellow Chicago-mites.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start size:94% position:6%
Thank you for taking
time out of your busy day

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.050
of eating bowls of cheese
and being into sports.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.153
I stand before you now
tremendously honored

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.654
to take my place

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:45.258
in the pantheon of great
explorers and adventurers.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:49.562
Men like Ponce de Leon, who
sought the fountain of youth,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.733 align:start position:0%
and instead discovered Florida,
where people now go to die.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:59.872
Why do I choose to jet ski
from Chicago to New Orleans?

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.341
Because every day,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:05.278 align:start size:97% position:3%
870 million people go hungry
and that's unacceptable.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.482
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.852
(audience applauds)

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:17.323 align:start size:97% position:3%
I would like to now welcome
the mayor of Chicago.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.826
Not even gonna use the stairs.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:23.329 align:start size:97% position:3%
Thank you so much, mayor,
for being here with us today.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.665
I really appreciate it.
- I'm not the mayor.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.934
- Let's get wet for goats!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience cheering)
- You really shouldn't

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.472
You shouldn't cheer for this.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.441
He's not going to
accomplish this.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.576
- Here we go!

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.645
- I have no faith in you.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.883
- Here we go!

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:44.717
How do we.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh.
(engine starts)

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.757
Let's get wet for goats!

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:54.260
(invigorating rock music)

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.368
- You're waving cause you
know he's gonna die, right?

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.202
- Yeah.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.038
- Aw yeah!

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.543
(lock signal horn blares)

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.717
What is this?

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:18.851
- It's a lock.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.053
- What does it do?

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.722
- I don't know, but it stops us.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.435 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm sure at some point
during the six months

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.937
while we were planning this,
someone mentioned locks to me

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.272
but I wasn't paying attention.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.208
I was dreaming about jet skiing.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.278
It turns out there are 22 locks

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:48.448
between Chicago and St. Louis.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.117
That's just the first 150 miles!

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
Each one is a potential
four hour delay.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.191 align:start size:88% position:13%
So immediately it's
like, the trip is over.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
How many miles have
we gone so far?

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.960
- About a mile.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.894
- About a mile?

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.597
- But, we've raised 12 dollars.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.866
(mystical music)

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:07.934
- Kurt, Kurt!

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.238
You're going to fail.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.074
Seriously you're gonna fail.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.909
This is a stupid idea.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.745
- No!

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:19.679
I'm gonna do this.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.913
We're gonna do it together.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.615 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah.
- We'll do this for goats.

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:25.218
We'll do it for chickens,
we'll do it for Africa,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.886
we'll do it for America!

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:30.623 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was gonna jet ski away
but we're in a lock.

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:31.758
- We're in a lock.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.593 align:start size:72% position:28%
- God dammit.
- I know.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.029
- We are seriously fucked.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.301
(heavy industrial music)

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.250
- Guys, thank you so much
