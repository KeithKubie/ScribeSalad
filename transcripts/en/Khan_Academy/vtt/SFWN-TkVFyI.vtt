00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:02.468
- [Lecturer] The number e has all sorts

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.080
of amazing properties.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.046
Just as a review you can
define it in terms of a limit.

00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:09.819
The limit as n approaches infinity of

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:13.236
1 + 1/n to the nth power.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:19.064
You can also define it as
the limit as n approaches 0

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:22.731
of 1 + n to the 1/nth power.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:25.645
What we're going to focus on this video

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.299
is an amazing property of e,

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.241
and e has many many amazing properties,

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.017
but this is the one that's maybe

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.134
the most relevant to calculus,

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:33.589
and that's the notion that if I take

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:38.428
the derivative with
respect to x of e to the x,

00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:41.327
then it is equal to, drumroll,

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:43.564
equal to e to the x.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.349
That to me is amazing.

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:46.963
Let's just appreciate it for a second

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.870
before we actually prove it.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.126
This is part of the
graph of y = e to the x.

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:55.277
And so what this says is,
the derivative of e to the x

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.432
for any x is equal to e to the x!

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.754
The slope of the tangent line

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:01.814
at any point here is equal
to the value of the function.

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:04.084
Let's just appreciate that.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.864
So right over here the
value of the function is 1,

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:09.454
and the slope of the tangent line is 1.

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:11.250
Here the value of the function is 2,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.233
and the slope of the tangent line is 2.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.858
Here the value of the function is 4,

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:19.673
and the slope of the
tangent line is equal to 4.

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:21.056
So I could just go on,

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:24.540
this is just another
amazing thing about e,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.657
and we'll see many more in calculus,

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.299
but let's now prove that
this is actually true.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.337
So let's just use our
definition of a derivative.

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:37.504
So the derivative with
respect to x, of e to the x,

00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:42.881
would be the limit of delta
x, or as delta approaches 0,

00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:48.851
of e to the x + delta x, - e to the x,

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:54.816
all of that over, all
of that over delta x.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:56.926
Now let's do some
algebraic manipulation here

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.328
to see if we can make some sense of it.

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:03.495
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as delta x

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.238
approaches 0 of, let's see,

00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:09.927
what happens, well I
won't skip any steps here.

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:14.473
This is the same thing as e to
the x times e to the delta x,

00:02:14.473 --> 00:02:16.386
this is just using our
exponent properties here

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.136
minus e to the x over delta x.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:25.146
Just to be clear, I rewrote
this right over here

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:27.146
as this right over here.

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.982
Now I can factor out an e to the x,

00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:34.880
and in fact, because e
to the x is not affected

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.779
as delta x approaches 0,

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.142
I can factor the e to the
x out of the entire limit.

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:43.798
So let's do that, let's take e to the x

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:47.965
out of the entire limit, let's
factor it completely out.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.076
It does not get affected by the delta x.

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:54.013
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.513
factor that e to the x out,

00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:01.578
e to the x times the limit
as delta x approaches 0,

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:07.738
of e to the delta x - 1,
all of that over delta x.

00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:15.276
So now we're gonna get a little
bit fancy with our limits.

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.381
We're gonna do what's known
as a change of variable.

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:21.059
So I'm gonna say, well
let's see I don't know

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.924
how to directly find this
limit right over here,

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:24.500
but maybe I can simplify it,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.573
and who knows, maybe I can get it into

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.994
one of these forms up here.

00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:30.985
So what if I were to
make the substitution,

00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.714
and let me do it over here.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.870
Let's say I would make
the substitution that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.620
n = e to the delta x - 1.

00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:44.381
So what would this be if we
were to solve for delta x?

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.379
Well let's see, we could
add 1 to both sides,

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.688
n + 1 = e to the delta x.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.746
To solve for delta x we could just take

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:54.546
the natural logarithm,
log base e of both sides.

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:58.713
And we would get the natural
log of n + 1 = delta x.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.924
And so, we can make that substitution,

00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:08.021
this could be replaced with this,

00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.124
and what we have in
the numerator over here

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:13.541
can be replaced with n, right over there,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.473
and what would happen to the limit?

00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:19.223
Well, as delta x approaches 0,

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.304
what does n approach?

00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:27.425
So delta x approaches 0
implies that n approaches what?

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.322
Let's see, as delta x approaches 0,

00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:33.053
this would be e to the 0 which is 1 - 1,

00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:34.840
so looks like n approaches 0.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.218
And you can look at it over here,

00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:38.697
as n approaches 0, right over here,

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:40.931
natural log of 0 + 1, natural log of 1,

00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:42.370
that is 0.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.798
So as each of them, as
delta x approaches 0,

00:04:44.798 --> 00:04:46.423
n approaches 0, as n approaches 0,

00:04:46.423 --> 00:04:47.667
delta x approaches 0.

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:50.197
So then you can replace, if
you make the change of variable

00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:52.220
from delta x to n, you could still say

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.363
as n approaches 0.

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:56.403
So let me rewrite all of this.

00:04:56.403 --> 00:04:59.297
That was the fanciest
step in this entire thing

00:04:59.297 --> 00:05:01.002
that we're about to do.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.481
So this is gonna be e to the x times

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.576
the limit, since we changed our variables

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:09.107
now gonna be as n approaches 0,

00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:11.284
because as delta x
approaches 0, n approaches 0,

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:12.526
and vice versa.

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:14.058
And this numerator here, we said hey,

00:05:14.058 --> 00:05:16.725
that's gonna be equal to n over,

00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:21.905
delta x is now the natural
log of n + 1, ln(n+1).

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:26.496
Now what does that do for us?

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:29.472
Well what if we were
to divide the numerator

00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:31.750
and the denominator by n?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.272
So let's multiply down here by 1/n,

00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:38.243
and let's multiply up here by 1/n.

00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:40.356
Well our numerator's
just gonna be equal to 1.

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:42.577
What does our denominator equal?

00:05:42.577 --> 00:05:44.684
Well here we can just use
our exponent properties.

00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:47.279
All of this is gonna be equal to,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.871
this is gonna be equal to, we
have our e to the x out front,

00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.121
e to the x, and then we have the limit,

00:05:58.652 --> 00:06:02.657
as n approaches 0, our numerator is now 1,

00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:05.740
over, and now I'm gonna rewrite this,

00:06:06.578 --> 00:06:09.507
just using our logarithm properties.

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:11.620
If I have, I'll do it right over here.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.562
If I have a times the natural log of b,

00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:15.844
this is the same thing as

00:06:15.844 --> 00:06:20.495
the natural log of b to
the a power, the ath power,

00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:22.191
this is just natural log properties.

00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:24.051
So we have down here, this
would be the same thing

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:28.218
as the natural log of n+1,
actually let me write it

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.317
the other way around, 1+n,
1+n, I just swapped these two,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.096
to the 1/n power, so the
natural log of that whole thing.

00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:41.373
Now, you might be getting
that tingly feeling,

00:06:41.373 --> 00:06:44.226
because something is
starting to look familiar.

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.039
What I just constructed
inside the logarithm here,

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.764
looks an awful lot like what
we have right over here.

00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:52.381
And the limit as n approaches 0,

00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:54.695
limit as n approaches 0.

00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.190
And in fact we can use
our limit properties,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.228
this one isn't affected,
what's really affected

00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:01.718
is what's inside the logarithm.

00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:04.370
So we could say that this
is going to be equal to,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.145
and we're approaching our drumroll,

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:10.312
e to the x times 1 over,
1 over the natural log,

00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:18.110
I'll do that blue color, natural log of,

00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:21.097
I'll give myself some space,

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:24.264
the limit, the limit as n approaches 0

00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:30.527
of this business right over here,

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:36.241
which I could just write
as, 1+n to the 1/nth power.

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:40.268
So this is really interesting.

00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:42.172
What is this?

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:44.340
What did I just, what do I
have there in the denominator

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.332
with this limit?

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.399
What is this thing equal to?

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:50.537
Well we already said,
that is a definition of e.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.809
That is this right over here,

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:55.036
which is equal to this over here.

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:56.869
So this is equal to e.

00:07:57.816 --> 00:08:00.051
So what does this all boil down to?

00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:01.250
I think you see where this is going,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.730
but this is fun, we're downhill from here.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.897
This is e to the x times 1/ln(e).

00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:16.464
Well, ln(e), what power
do I have to raise e

00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:17.451
to get to e?

00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:19.026
Well I just have to raise it to 1.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:22.609
So this gets us e to
the x, and we're done.

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:27.447
We've just proven that the
derivative with respect to x

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:30.884
of e to the x is indeed
equal to e to the x.

00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:33.947
That's an amazing finding, that shows us

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:38.030
one more dimension of the
beauty of the number e.
