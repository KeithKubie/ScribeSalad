that i think that finally that coupled

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
that i think that finally that coupled
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.030
that i think that finally that coupled
with the recession and a number of other

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
with the recession and a number of other
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.319

is going to be digital or in digital

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
