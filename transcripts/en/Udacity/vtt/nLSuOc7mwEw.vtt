00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.010
I think the best way to learn is
to build an example from scratch.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.610
The sample I showed earlier is from
Google's canonical samples, and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.690
there's a link to them
in the speaker notes.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.770
We're going to build the same
thing from first principles so

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.440
that you can see how it's done.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.239
You should be familiar with
the first few steps by now.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.830
You'll create a new
app in Android Studio.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.320
Make it a single zoo application,
don't use any templates.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.900
You'll then add the service libraries
to your build.gradle file and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.170
then once you've done this,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.420
you'll edit your app.manifest
to use these service libraries.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.479
When you've done all of this and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.340
you're ready to go, check this box
