00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.700
This shark just spent years alone and then,
spontaneously, produced children.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.269
Sometimes I think my Mom wishes I was this
shark.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.519
Howdy Sharky the shark dog and other fans,
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.330
Leonie the zebra shark has been alone since
2013, when her partner shark was moved to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.470
another tank.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.920
Over the intervening years, she took up knitting,
mixology, kickboxing, and spin and barre classes.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.870
Finally, over a bottomless brunch with her
gal pals, she decided it was time to chum

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.950
the water and download Bumble.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.170
Wait no, that’s just my friend, and all
that sounds completely normal and awesome.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.500
Leonie did something strange, she was alone
for four years, and then birthed a litter

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.910
of sharks -- a virgin birth!

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.820
And they have no idea how she did it!

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.860
In a new paper in Scientific Reports, scientists
documented parthenogenesis in a zebra shark

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.469
that had previously had pups with a partner!

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.629
This was the first time they'd seen this animal
switch from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis!

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.329
Parthenogenesis, is asexual reproduction for
higher life, and it’s been observed in plants

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.160
and invertebrates, but also some species of
bony fish, snakes, lizards, rays, chickens

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and turkeys!

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160
And of course, sharks.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.410
But what about us?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.890
Could we just give up the other sex and go
all asexual?

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.780
Parthenogenetic animals have some mutation
that allows them to reproduce without input

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.720
of genes from another individual.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
That addition of new genes is super important,
because it adds genetic diversity, a.k.a.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210
Sex makes the gene pool larger.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.790
Humans require 46 chromosomes -- or packets
of DNA.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.880
Mom and Dad each have 23 -- combined, the
genetic information inside the chromosomes

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.950
create the plans for a full human.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.860
So, yes, you could take two eggs (or two sperm)
and mush them together and get that total

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.970
of 46, but there’s a problem -- genomic
imprinting.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.940
Unlike parthenogenetic animals, in mammals,
bits of DNA are present in both egg and sperm,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.610
but not all the genes are switched on.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.909
Even if somehow two eggs merged into a zygote,
the zygote wouldn’t make it far before finding

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.800
it was missing some genes it could only get
from sperm.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.980
Mom genes just don’t cover all the bits.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.140
Thanks to genomic imprinting, sometimes the
MALE version of the gene is used, and sometimes

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.810
it’s the FEMALE version.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.950
One study in Nature Genetics, says we use
58 percent from pops.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.420
Not to mention the Y-Chromosome… which makes
fetuses male.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.780
Don’t feel bad though, ladies, we can’t
just use the genetics in sperm alone either,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.670
because all mitochondrial DNA -- which keeps
our cells alive -- comes from the Mother.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.620
We’ve never had scientific proof of human
parthenogenesis, though there have been multiple

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.620
claims.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.920
In the 1950s, a paper in The Lancetdetailed
the examination of 19 Moms who claimed virgin

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920
birth.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.530
They didn’t have DNA tests, so they looked
at gene expression.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.120
For example: Mom has brown eyes, kid has blue
eyes?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.560
There’s a Dad in the picture.= because recessive
genes would only express if there were two

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.560
parents.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.030
Part of the reason we’ve never had proof?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.910
It might not be possible.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.390
Genomic imprinting alone affects, scientists
think, 200 different genes.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.270
There haven’t been enough humans on our
planet to see even one example of this happening

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.270
randomly.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.440
And thanks to the number of genes, scientists
don’t think this could happen naturally.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.590
In a laboratory, with the right techniques,
scientists might be able to create a “virgin

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.690
birth” but they’d still need genetics
from more than one person.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.930
So, if you were hoping to Forever Alone with
your own little parthenogenetic kid; you’re

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.900
kind of out of luck.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.150
Parthenogenesis, even in nature, seems like
it would be completely impossible!

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.040
Don’t we all need that genetic variety?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.069
If a Mom produces an exact copy of herself
in the womb, isn’t that just a clone…

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.110
A study in Nature from 2010 finally figured
out exactly how an animal could reproduce

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.050
with an all-female population and still maintain
genetic diversity, and avoid debilitating

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.050
mutations…

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.030
They specifically looked at the whiptail lizard,
which start with a ton of genetic diversity

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.440
to begin with!

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.740
Whiptail lizard eggs contain twice the number
of chromosomes of sexual lizards of a similar

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.740
species.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.920
So, when they start parthenogenesis, their
genes don’t overlap, because they have so

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.410
much more to work with!

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.410
How did this evolve?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.260
They’re… still working that out.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.379
Even though sex in nature is fun (and messy
and crazy and often weird) there are advantages

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.240
to being able to parthenogenetically reproduce
-- populating a new area, for example, or

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.480
in the case of disease, or disaster -- the
species goes on!

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.370
There are reasons that we have sex.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.820
Lots of them.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.019
You want to know more, of course you do, so
watch this video.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.070
Would you rather reproduce asexually?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.100
