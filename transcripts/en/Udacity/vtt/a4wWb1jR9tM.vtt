00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.070
We first went to our design team to get
a design that not only better reflects

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.620
material, but provides substantial
improvements in utility.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.920
Weâ€™ve looked at the material
design specification.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.150
Specifically, how colors, elevation, and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.320
animation can be used to create
delightful user experiences.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.360
We covered tools and technique to
help create both material design and

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.955
responsive designs, including Toolbar,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:32.470
CardView, Recycler view,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.060
and GridLayout.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.730
We've looked at using dimensions,
graphs, and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.300
included layouts to simplify our
responsive designs for tablet's.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.310
Finally, we've covered some simple
techniques to create L specifics and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.599
L style animations in your applications.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.010
With all of this, we've implemented
a new, completely refreshed design for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.420
Sunshine that brings us much closer
to a production application.
