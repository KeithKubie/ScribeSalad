00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:08.246
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:09.329
NICHOLAS MEYER: Thank you.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.985
Thanks very much.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.800
Good afternoon.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.830
And thank you for inviting
me to speak here today.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.516
Because I use a computer, I feel
as though I know all of you.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.400
And I'd like to
begin by thanking

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.550
each and every one
of you for looking up

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790
all that stuff for me 24/7.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
There was not so long
ago an astronomer who

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.110
was giving a lecture to
a very full audience,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.570
and he said that the sun
was going to burn out

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.380
in 5 billion years,
at which point

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.060
an agitated member of the
audience leapt up and said,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.560
what?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.370
What did you say?

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.300
Said, I said the sun was going
to burn out in 5 billion years.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.870
And the guy says, whew.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.480
I thought you said
5 million years.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.090
I begin with this story,
A, because I find it funny,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.870
and B, because it touches
on our peculiar relation

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.920
to science in this country,
and more particularly,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400
on our disinclination
to learn or understand

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.890
what science tells
us is happening,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.550
has happened, or
will soon happen.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.700
Our ignorance in
this department seems

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.120
only equal to Americans'
congenital reluctance

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.170
to master any foreign language.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.040
It is scarcely a
secret that we live

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.520
in a terrifying world,
a world in which

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.720
the viability of planet Earth
itself hangs in the balance.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.440
In these unprecedented
circumstances,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.650
it is hardly surprising
that some people

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.590
are inclined to
shoot the messenger,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.930
rather than confront
the message.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.470
The irony is that
most Americans,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.480
while content to profit, buy,
and from amazing scientific

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.320
achievements, falling
in love with the latest

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.440
must-have gadgetry, display
very little interest

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.470
in how such miracles work.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
What science causes
airplanes to fly or cancers

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.750
to go into remission?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.840
As long as the air
conditioned car goes,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.300
who cares what's under the hood?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.180
More than that, there
are certain segments

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.960
of the population
who actively make war

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.540
on science,
rejecting information

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.630
that frightens them.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.790
They cherry pick the science
they find acceptable or useful,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.630
or seek out reassuring
alternative facts

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.630
to suit their emotional
requirements when

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.950
objective data upsets them.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.540
I must state at
the outset that I'm

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.200
about as far from a
scientist as you can get.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.760
I am still puzzled by gravity.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.360
I must add that I typically read
very little science fiction,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.700
though I adore Jules
Verne and his scientific--

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.950
or I should say, unscientific--

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.510
but presciently entertaining
rival, HG Wells.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.030
Their differences
are worth noting.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
When Verne shot his rocket
to the moon, he did the math

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.820
and figured out the
rocket would have

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.940
to leave from Cape Canaveral;
that the capsule, when

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.450
it returned, would have to be
recovered at sea, et cetera.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.150
By contrast, Wells
simply dreamed up

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.600
an anti-gravity
metal called cavorite

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.830
and floated his travelers
upward to the lunar surface.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.540
Science fantasy versus
science fiction.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.579
No, I am not a scientist,
just an artist.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.025
As Joseph Conrad wrote, my aim,
above all, is to make you see.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.640
I tell stories, the
purpose of which

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.670
is to make people laugh or cry--

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.050
in a word, to make you feel.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.700
And if at the end
of what is meant

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.030
to be an emotional journey
you wind up thinking

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.180
about what you have
felt, so much the better.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.030
But before we go any
further, two caveats.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.930
First, I'd like to
observe that artists

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.430
lose all proprietary
authority over their creations

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.710
once they're finished.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.850
Artists put messages
in bottles and then

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.500
toss them into life's ocean,
hoping that someone will find

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.090
and decode what's inside them.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.180
But we won't be around in
every instance of discovery

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.610
to say, you're
right, you're wrong.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.540
That's not gum, that's
gun, et cetera--

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.370
when and if they do.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.180
The artist's opinion by that
point is just another opinion.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.165
People will make of works
of art what they will.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.470
They always have.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.140
In short, I am not the answer
to a series of equations

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.650
at the end of a math book.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.600
I can say what I intended
or attempted to accomplish--

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.670
in a word, what I
thought I was doing--

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.050
but not what any of it
means to each of you,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.170
much less whether I've
succeeded in my intention.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.190
My second caveat is this.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.000
Like magic tricks
when once explained,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.510
an artist's answers
tend to disappoint.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.060
Art and science,
too, for all I know,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.330
is much more interesting posing
questions than answering them.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.470
As you may gather, this is
going to be a talk about ideas.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.440
There's no visual aids.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.300
Answers may be few, but
perhaps, some of the questions

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.710
will hold your attention.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.510
So here goes.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.450
Unlike Oscar Wilde,
who maintained

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.770
that all art is
useless, Leo Tolstoy,

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.980
the author of my favorite
novel, "War and Peace,"

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.040
once stated that
the purpose of art

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.230
is to teach us to love life.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.960
No matter how beautiful,
terrible, what we depict,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.310
I think Tolstoy is right.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.770
The bottom line function of art
is to infatuate us with life.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.150
The purpose of art, and
if the purpose of art

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.610
is to teach us to love life,
"Star Trek," it seems to me,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.110
totally fills this bill.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.540
Granted, it is more
fiction than science.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.000
But I think many of you,
whom I infer to be devotees,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
first became interested
in the universe

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.220
by responding to
"Star Trek's" message

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.640
about life, its
variety, its value,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.760
and as Spock would
say, its possibilities.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.660
Tolstoy also quibbled
with Shakespeare.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.470
He said, to be not to
be is not the question.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.390
We're here.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.620
The question is, now what?

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.520
Isn't that also a
"Star Trek" question?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.450
I happen to be a slow
reader, and slow thinker,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.070
and slow understander.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.380
It may come as a surprise,
but when "Star Trek"

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.530
was first telecast shortly
after the Civil War,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.560
I was not among its adherents.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.410
What I saw was a lot of folks
running around cheesy sets

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.320
wearing what looked like
Dr. Dentons and a man

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.120
with pointy ears.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.340
I never stuck around.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.220
Later, as an undergraduate
at the University of Iowa,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.370
a friend also from New
York, but getting his PhD,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.809
was hooked on the show.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.480
He watched it daily
after he dropped acid.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.370
As I recollect, he did this
for about 54 straight days,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.170
at the end of which
time his wife left him.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.030
There was nothing in this
ritual that encouraged

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.690
me to watch the show.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.180
It was many years later
while working in Hollywood

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.310
that another friend, an
executive at Paramount

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.900
Pictures, encouraged me
to overcome my snobbery

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.910
and meet Harve
Bennett, who'd been

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.110
assigned to produce the second
"Star Trek" feature film.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.990
Bennett had produced a great
deal of television, including

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.570
"The Mod Squad," "Six
Million Dollar Man,"

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.620
and the first big time mini
series, "Rich Man, Poor Man."

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.840
He had never made
a feature film,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.330
but we got along famously.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.810
He showed me "Star Trek,
The Motion Picture."

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.480
Many people are pleased
to knock this film,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.870
but I am not among them.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.220
Director Robert Wise went boldly
where no film had gone before.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.310
If he had made mistakes or
misjudgments along the way,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.420
I would learn from them.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.110
But at the time, "Star
Trek" depicted a world

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.570
I didn't understand and
a philosophy to which

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.470
I was unable to subscribe.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.910
Other than technology,
I see scant evidence

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.500
of the human
condition has changed.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.020
We've added buttons.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.560
We still cannot seem to
get past using our fists,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.400
when we find no other
solution to our disagreements.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.340
It would take me years
and my own involvement

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.780
with "Star Trek" to change
my views about the series

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.990
and to understand or
start to understand what

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.390
it was trying to accomplish.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.280
I did not find
the original film,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.710
as I said, especially
engaging, but Harve

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.600
persisted and made
me watch several

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.720
of the original
television episodes, which

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.060
proved more absorbing
than I had anticipated.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.790
I began to perceive striking
innovations in the show, things

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.440
I'd originally failed
to notice while channel

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.460
surfing the unprecedented
melting pot,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.060
multinational,
multicultural cast--

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.680
the shocking first
televised interracial kiss;

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.500
the show's willingness
to confront and grapple

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.750
with social issues
that, by setting them

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.110
in a sci-fi context,
allowed viewers

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.010
to contemplate subject
matter that if set on Earth,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.520
might push so many bias
buttons, that shackled

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.640
by our prejudices, we
might never consider

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.960
such topics objectively.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.900
The best science
fiction, it seems to me,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.620
whether set in the past,
future, or outer space,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.040
seems always to reflect the
human condition of the time

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.900
in which it was created.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.755
Watching these episodes also
put me pleasantly in mind

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:42.310
of something I liked,
but it took me a while--

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.730
it always takes me a while--

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.400
to tease out what it was--

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.120
a series of novels
by CS Forester, who

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.120
also wrote "The African Queen"
about an officer in the Royal

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.870
Navy during the Napoleonic Wars,
one Captain Horatio Hornblower.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.180
Hornblower's adventures
and exploits,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.110
which always included
a girl in every port,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.620
had fed my pre-adolescent
fantasy life.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.560
And I now recognized
with an agreeable shock

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.310
that Captain Kirk was
Hornblower in outer space.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.950
Later, when I discussed
this with Bill Shatner,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.750
he became excited
and said, that's

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.070
exactly what Roddenberry said.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.530
Now I was starting
to become stoked

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.950
about the idea of
directing a Hornblower

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.800
movie with spaceships.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.940
But even after all this time, an
involvement with three feature

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.590
films-- that would
be 2, 4, and 6,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.570
for those of you
who keep score--

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.680
I still hadn't gleaned all that
"Star Trek" had to teach me.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.660
It may seem strange
how long it took

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.090
me to understand
that while Hornblower

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.980
might be a way into Star
Trek, it wasn't all there was.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.770
Adding submarines
or battleships might

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.990
have enabled me to create
"Star Trek" movies,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.390
but it was only after
the fact that I finally

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.040
began to grasp how essential
the idea of the show was

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.060
and what made it precious
to so many people.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.780
And in "Star Trek 6,"
Spock says that logic

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.500
is the beginning of
wisdom, but not the end.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.430
Hornblower might be
the beginning of a way

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.510
to think about "Star Trek," but
it certainly was not the end.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:42.420
Predicting the future,
whether in real life

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.890
or what we term science
fiction, is a tricky business.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.520
And most prognosticators,
professional and amateur,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.450
get the future wrong.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:52.950
True.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.430
"Star Trek" got
cell phones right.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.290
But who could have
foreseen Donald Trump?

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.530
Science fiction always
winds up depicting

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.260
the time in which it was
made, rather than the time

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.660
in which it is supposedly set.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.620
But one thing "Star Trek"
does that finally resonated

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.480
with me was its optimism.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.890
Its implicit thesis
that problems

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.010
were capable of solutions--

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.550
they may not always be the
simplest or most gratifying

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.040
solutions, but
again, quoting Spock,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.000
there are always possibilities.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.520
Mankind has frequently
been confronted

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:44.430
by seemingly insoluble problems
that were then somehow solved.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.270
You people must know all
about solving problems.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.590
To take a random instance, by
the turn of the 20th century,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.610
New York City, clogged
with horse drawn vehicles,

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.230
was literally drowning in shit.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.250
The pollution threatened
the safety and health

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.690
of the great metropolis.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.700
And then mirabile dictu,
along came the automobile.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.880
And in short order, the
horse manure problem

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.120
went away, granted,
to be replaced by car

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.640
exhaust and engine noise.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.590
But with recent advances
in electric cars,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.140
some of which I've
lately sampled

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.810
in the neighborhood, maybe
the exhaust problem and even

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.390
the drunk driver
problem will go away.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.010
Similarly, bubonic
plague periodically

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.630
decimated huge
swaths of humanity.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.220
And then came the
miracle of vaccination.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.460
And diseases, including
smallpox, tuberculosis,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.110
and polio, were, for all intents
and purposes, eradicated.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:58.660
People who were so frightened by
the prospect of climate change

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.290
that they cannot concede
its reality would do well

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:08.140
to immerse themselves in "Star
Trek," which can, like Tolstoy,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.540
teach us to love life, believing
that just as science shows us

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:19.750
difficulties, science, coupled
with men and women of goodwill,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.490
can uncover solutions.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.360
So, too, "Star Trek's"
science of optimism

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.380
can fill us with plausible
hope that human beings, working

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:38.920
together, can surmount seemingly
intractable difficulties.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.360
As I began by observing, we
live in a terrifying world,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:50.570
I confess, a world whose
very survival seems to be

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.620
hanging by a fraying thread.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.520
No wonder we spend so much
time amusing ourselves

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:05.510
to death in trivial pursuits,
or insubstantial escapism video

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.910
games, or movies
featuring men in Spandex--

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:17.349
so-called superheroes,
saints for a secular society

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:22.540
where Mickey Mouse and Superman
head the pantheon of gods.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.760
Because mere heroes are
no longer sufficient.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.080
What I have more recently
come to understand

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.560
is that "Star Trek," on a
more sophisticated level

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.590
than Batman, for
example, provides

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.670
what is perhaps a more plausible
optimism than Superman.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:47.940
It attempts to show a world not
where Superman can rescue us,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.910
but where humankind
can improve, where

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.510
the definition of
progress isn't that just

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.540
because we can do
something, it doesn't

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.210
follow that we must do it.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.255
Technology must not become
the tail wagging the dog.

00:18:07.474 --> 00:18:11.980
It does not follow that
because we can blow ourselves

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.310
to smithereens, we must blow
ourselves to smithereens.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.440
That men and women are
capable of learning

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.930
from past mistakes--

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.460
in a word, capable of evolving--

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.250
dangerous word with connotations
to another word, evolution.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.340
But there, we've swallowed it.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:41.040
"Star Trek" arguably
doesn't promise superpowers.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.110
But it does hold
out the possibility

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:49.140
of evolved change, a belief
that human beings may never

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.300
be perfect, but that striving
for perfection, trying

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.170
in the spirit of intelligent
and humane query,

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.520
is a legitimate
and desirable goal.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.925
In addition to Tolstoy's
dictum that the purpose of art

00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:08.270
is to teach us to
love life, "Star Trek"

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.700
has taught me something else--

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.460
that art has the power to
change how we see and experience

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.630
the world.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.020
It is no accident that
most original members

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.720
of NASA and JPL got their
start and inspiration watching

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.900
that crude television series.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.850
The sun, remember, will
extinguish itself in 5 billion,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.950
not 5 million years.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.510
"Star Trek" urges care
in carefully carving out

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.700
our human destinies.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.310
We could do worse
than to consult

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.050
the science of optimism.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.055
Thank you, and I'm happy
to answer questions.

00:19:54.055 --> 00:19:57.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.320
If there are no more questions.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.510
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.470
Thanks for being here today.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.270
There's--

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.980
NICHOLAS MEYER: No charge.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.420
AUDIENCE: Kind of non-written
rule among "Star Trek"

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:23.360
fans that even numbered
movies in the franchise,

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.435
the original one--

00:20:24.435 --> 00:20:25.560
NICHOLAS MEYER: Oh, shucks.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.600
AUDIENCE: The best ones.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.810
How do you react to that?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:33.392
And how do you see the odd
numbered movies in the series?

00:20:33.392 --> 00:20:34.850
NICHOLAS MEYER:
Well, first of all,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.110
you're obviously very
discerning and completely right.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.150
I don't know what it
is about those even

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:46.190
numbered "Star Treks" that
is worth our attention,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.210
or devotion, or adoration.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.070
I'm just picking random words.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:57.430
I'm not about to pick apart
anybody else's movies.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.260
I feel that I was very lucky.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.850
Movies are like souffles.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.550
They either rise, or they don't.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:11.260
And the fact that
mine rose is like--

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.547
my mother is very happy.

00:21:12.547 --> 00:21:13.380
What can I tell you?

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.550
I don't know what else to--

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.560
I think it's good that
people like the even

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.400
numbered ones, so.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.750
Remember, I said
artists aren't the best

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.600
judges of their own work.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.900
So it's just like whatever I
say is just another opinion.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.150
AUDIENCE: Mr. Meyer, thank
you so much for being here.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.360
I have a question about
the movie, "The Day After."

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.860
For those who don't
know what it is,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.010
it's a TV movie that
scared the bejesus out

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.258
of most of North America.

00:21:45.258 --> 00:21:46.800
It was all about
nuclear annihilation

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.670
during the Cold War.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.920
So I'm just curious
if you can tell us

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.250
how that project came about
and maybe your reaction

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.670
to the country's
reaction to that movie.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.420
NICHOLAS MEYER: This
is an enormous topic.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.690
For those of you
who do not know,

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.880
"The Day After" is
the most watched movie

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.240
ever made for television.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.070
I didn't write it.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.450
I directed it.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.500
It came out in 1983.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.682
It was watched by 100
million people in one night.

00:22:12.682 --> 00:22:16.630
"The New York Post" called me a
traitor on its editorial page.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.350
There are lots of stories
about "The Day After."

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.770
And I can tell you a little bit
about how I became involved,

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.540
and then I'll tell
you my favorite story,

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.720
which is not so much about me.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.690
I was the fourth director
that ABC of television

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.790
offered to do this movie.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.620
The thing about nuclear war
is that the nuclear dilemma,

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.920
the ability of the human
race to extinguish itself,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.200
is a relatively recent
development, 1945.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.480
At the same time, there is
something so terrifying,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.810
that most of us prepare not to--

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.430
we don't think about it.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.510
We've learned to
kind of dial it out.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.050
And we go about
our business with

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.580
this Damoclean nuclear sword
hanging over our necks,

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.000
and we sort of pretend
that it isn't there.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.920
And we may tell ourselves
that we're doing OK.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.882
But you've no idea
how many close calls

00:23:24.882 --> 00:23:27.090
or how many bombs have been
dropped that, by the way,

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.370
didn't go off, including
two once on North Carolina.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.470
So we're hanging
by a thread here.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.690
I didn't want to have anything
to do with this either.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.140
I was having a good time.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.380
I was making "Star Trek"
movies and meeting girls.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.110
It was all fine.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.890
But I was also being
psychoanalyzed at the time.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.350
And my shrink never spoke.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.530
You have to understand how
psychoanalysis works, is

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.660
that you're doing
the heavy lifting.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.870
You go in there, and you say
whatever comes into your head.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.480
And at the end of it, he
plays it back for you,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.577
but slightly rearranged.

00:24:09.577 --> 00:24:10.660
But he's not volunteering.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.010
He's not a guru.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.626
But in this case,
he opened his mouth.

00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:17.870
As I'm lying there
on the couch, trying

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:24.080
to figure a way not to
do this, and he said,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.890
well, I guess this is where we
find out who you really are.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.000
And I realized at that point
that I had no choice, because I

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.630
have to shave in the morning.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:47.650
And that's tricky if you
don't look at yourself.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.420
And I actually corralled
a lot of people

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.970
into the movie with
that damn line.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.310
I told my cinematographer
from "Star Trek 2,"

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.323
we're going to do
this nuclear thing.

00:24:58.323 --> 00:24:59.490
He goes, aw, no, no, no, no.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:24:59.990
Don't.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.697
Come on.

00:25:00.697 --> 00:25:01.780
And I said, wait a minute.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.363
Wait a minute.

00:25:02.363 --> 00:25:03.940
Let me get this straight.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.290
The one time this
town is going to allow

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.830
you to put your work in the
service of your beliefs,

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.200
you're going to pass and
bitch at dinner parties?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.820
I think this is where we
find out who you really are.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.030
So that's how I got
into making the movie.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.280
And there's a million details.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.050
There are books
about this movie.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.700
There are PhD theses, and
there are crazy stories.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.670
There was a general
on Castro's staff

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.720
who later said that the
Cuban Missile Crisis had not

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.600
been real to him, until
he had seen the movie.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.376
Can you imagine?

00:25:46.376 --> 00:25:51.790
And the morning after
the movie was on TV--

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.270
and I sat and watched it.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.740
And I thought, who
in their right mind

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.880
would sit through this?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.290
It's available on Blu-ray,
by the way, if you wanted to.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.580
I don't think I'm
selling it very well.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:16.180
Anyway, I was mildly
astounded, to put it mildly,

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.070
that 100 million
people had watched it,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:23.230
and the phones were ringing
off the hook the next morning.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.290
I guess all that publicity
from people running up and down

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.310
protesting the movie,
but it had scared up

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.680
a lot of-- nothing like being
banned in Boston to sell books.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:41.350
At which point, the media, as
we call them, ever helpful,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.780
ran around with their
microphone, saying,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.410
did this movie change your mind
about nuclear war, yea or nay?

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.650
And then came, rather gleefully,
I thought, running back to me

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.520
and saying, according to
our morning after survey,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.645
your movie didn't
change anybody's minds

00:26:57.645 --> 00:26:59.270
about nuclear war
one way or the other.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.000
What do you have to say?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.170
And I said, well, number
one, I don't think people

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.500
change their minds overnight.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.700
Number two, I don't think they'd
tell you if their minds were

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.215
changed by a TV movie.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.870
Number three, I'm not sure
people know what they really

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:23.987
think anyway.

00:27:23.987 --> 00:27:26.320
If you say, do you believe
in God or you ask a question,

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.450
people will tell you,
give you an answer.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.490
But maybe until there's
a gun put to their head,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:35.390
you don't really know
what they really think.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.870
But there was one
person whose mind was

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.208
changed by the movie very fast.

00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:43.250
And he happened to be the
President of the United

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.167
States, Ronald Reagan.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.080
There is a lot of
evidence, including

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.160
Reagan's own memoir, for the
effect that the movie had.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.040
But the end result was
that he flew to Reykjavik,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.770
met with Gorbachev,
whom he had previously

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.380
called the architect of the
evil empire or something,

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.310
and they signed the Intermediate
Range Nuclear Weapons

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.890
Treaty, the Missile Treaty.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.060
And he had come
to power believing

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.020
in a winnable nuclear war.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.850
And he changed his mind.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.580
And not only does his
own memoir say this,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:27.130
but I became friends with
his in-house biographer,

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.070
a rather interesting man
named Edmund Morris, who

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.650
won the Pulitzer
Prize for his book,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.780
"The Rise of
Theodore Roosevelt."

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.470
And I got to know Morris.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.720
And Morris said he'd lived
in the house for three years

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.340
while he was writing this book.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.610
He said the only time he
saw Ronald Reagan freak out

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.690
was after the movie.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.580
There's lots more
stories about it,

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.160
but it's probably
to date, until I

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.820
got to speak to you guys, the
most worthwhile thing I ever

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.780
got to do with my life.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.690
AUDIENCE: Mr. Meyer,
thanks for joining us.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.590
I want to ask you
about the theme

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.900
that you were speaking
about in terms of optimism,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.520
regarding optimism
in science fiction.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.012
I'm curious, more specifically--

00:29:14.012 --> 00:29:16.220
you mentioned a couple of
times about science fiction

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.620
as reflecting the state
of society and kind

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.390
of the concerns
that preoccupations

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.700
of contemporary folks.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.500
So I'm curious, what do you
see as kind of circumstances

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.280
that will give rise to kind
of different forms of science

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.010
fiction?

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.050
And I guess, what
I'm referring to,

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.758
in particular, is
like, often, we see--

00:29:37.758 --> 00:29:39.800
and this is something that
other folks, like film

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.140
critics, cultural
critics, have seen--

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.450
is that science
fiction, especially

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.640
over the past couple of
decades, it's very much been

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.020
in the sort of cyberpunk mode.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.950
It's like this really kind
of dystopian depictions

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.940
of capitalism, maybe going back
to "Blade Runner," maybe going

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.180
back beyond, and
how, for some people,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.100
that's a kind of-- or
the origins of that

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.720
is a kind of critique of
neoliberal capitalism.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.620
I'm curious if you
kind of share that.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.760
And then what do you
think might give rise

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.820
to sort of new inspirations
for science fiction

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.440
into the future?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.740
Or do you have
thoughts about what

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.320
might sort of result
in a more optimistic

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.690
or the return of a
more optimistic vision,

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.805
like what you were
referring to in "Star Trek?"

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:28.180
NICHOLAS MEYER:
Well, again, this

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.980
is just one person's
extremely uninformed opinion,

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.320
but I look at the
world, at the moment,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.760
and I see what I consider to
be some very ominous trends.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.770
I see a very divisive
and destructive leader

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.360
in this country.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.870
I see the sort of
disappointment and failure

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.230
of democracies around
the world, whether we're

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:05.110
talking about India under Modi
or various European countries

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.150
that are all drifting right.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.060
And I find it very chilling
and very frightening.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.900
But I think that,
speaking for myself

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:20.320
and my own creative
ideas, I would

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.090
take whatever science fiction
I'm working on and try--

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.660
again, I use the
word plausibly--

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:37.680
to construct scenarios that are
believably optimistic out of--

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:45.730
take the horse shit image
that looks really bad.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.330
And things have looked
really bad before.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.610
They've looked bad politically.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.250
They've looked bad in the
midst of the bubonic plague.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.430
They have looked bad before.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.370
When you read certain
histories of certain times--

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.080
if you read about
Andrew Johnson,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.590
who will give the incumbent a
run for his money as the worst

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.490
president, when you look at some
terrible political campaigns

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.580
that have been run in
times before this--

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.280
and Thomas Jefferson was
one of the worst offenders

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.790
when he ran against John Adams.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:23.640
And he hired people to write
the most awful, awful things,

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.330
untrue.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.060
And Adams was the first
president, the only president,

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.440
not to attend the inauguration
of his successor--

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.900
even though he later
patched up everything

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.000
with Thomas Jefferson.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.410
I don't know if you
know this story,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.210
but they never saw
each other again.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:46.110
They had collaborated on the
Declaration of Independence,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:50.100
and Adams went up to
Braintree, Massachusetts

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.050
after his presidency.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.197
Jefferson retreated
to Monticello.

00:32:54.197 --> 00:32:55.530
They never saw each other again.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:01.520
But they had a mutual
friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush,

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.880
who said to John
Adams, this is a shame.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.710
You guys started a country.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.600
You're really not going to
ever say anything to him?

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.420
He's got a birthday coming up.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.590
Why don't you send him a card?

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.710
And Adam said, well,
supposing he doesn't answer.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.220
And Rush said, John,
send them a card.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.590
So he sends him a
letter, happy birthday.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.260
And he was absolutely
delighted, stunned.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.020
After all this acrimony,
and time, and distance,

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.870
got an instant reply.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.720
And thus begins the most
famous correspondence

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.380
in American letters,
that for the last 10, 12

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.212
years of their lives, these
guys write about everything.

00:33:50.212 --> 00:33:51.420
They write about the weather.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.590
They write about their children.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.920
They write about their farms.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.160
They write about-- but they're
also writing about the country,

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.600
and about themselves, and
before the bar of history.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.220
And if that isn't overcoming
something, I don't know what.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.320
But they did, better yet,
they died on the same day.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.631
What day would that be?

00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.050
AUDIENCE: July 4.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.370
NICHOLAS MEYER: You bet.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.580
July 4, 50 years to
the day after they

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.790
signed the Declaration,
after they wrote it.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:25.370
And John Adams' last words were,
Thomas Jefferson still lives.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.880
So things are possible.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.949
And it isn't just
science fiction

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:32.830
that reflects the time
in which it was created.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.300
All art reflects the time
in which it was created.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.730
Mozart doesn't just
sound like Mozart.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.870
He sounds like late 18th
century middle European music.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.389
Renoir doesn't just
look like Renoir.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:51.850
He looks like 19th century
French Impressionism.

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:52.810
You can identify.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.620
If I show you four movies
that are set in 1776,

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.220
and one was made in 1906,
and one is made in 1936,

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.970
and one is made in 1996, and
the other one is made in 2006,

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.340
you will know
within five minutes,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.730
most within five years,
when those works of art

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.080
were created.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.230
Either because of the way
people look, the way they sound,

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.030
what comes out of their mouths,
how long their eyelashes are,

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.320
what their hairstyle is, or
what their political ideology

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.800
is invested in the
content of the film.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.440
So science fiction is not alone.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.730
And speaking for myself,
I just tell stories,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.190
and I've never
cared whether it was

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.820
a future story or a past story,
comical, tragical, tragical,

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.960
historical, it doesn't matter.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.390
I just want it to
be a good story.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.348
And somebody said, well,
what's your definition

00:35:44.348 --> 00:35:46.560
of a good story?

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.323
My definition of a good story
is that after you've heard it,

00:35:49.323 --> 00:35:51.240
you understand why I
wanted to tell it to you.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:59.055
And I wanted to teach
you to love life.

00:35:59.055 --> 00:36:00.840
AUDIENCE: Question
from the Dory here,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.960
from Bradley in San Francisco--
he said my project at Google

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.930
is named Tricorder, after
the "Star Trek" device.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.660
What is your favorite instance
of a product's technology

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.688
or fashion that you think
was inspired by "Star Trek?"

00:36:13.688 --> 00:36:14.730
NICHOLAS MEYER: Oh, gosh.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.070
This calls for a
level of expertise

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.090
that I think is
beyond my pay grade.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:26.850
That phone thing, I think, is
the most remarkable instance

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.780
of science fiction, actually
prognosticating, predicting

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.620
something that was coming.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.500
You could argue that the Dick
Tracy two-way wrist watch

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.380
was sort of in the same vein.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:48.240
But the cell phone seems to
bear a remarkable resemblance.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.240
Of course, they no longer
need the fliptop of it.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.400
But otherwise, it
was pretty cool.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.010
It's a scary device.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.963
That phone is like
smarter than me, which

00:36:57.963 --> 00:36:59.130
may not be saying that much.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.165
But it may be smarter
than a lot of you, too.

00:37:04.918 --> 00:37:07.460
AUDIENCE: So you talked a little
bit about how, as an artist,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.627
you're trying to say things.

00:37:08.627 --> 00:37:10.850
So I was wondering
if you could just

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.210
mention a few maybe particular
things that you were trying

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:19.250
to say, or details that
you had a hand in or wanted

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.430
to do a particular way in some
of those "Star Trek" movies?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.150
NICHOLAS MEYER: Well,
again, it looks almost

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.830
like you're asking for answers
at the back of the book, which

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.330
I'm not--

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.690
AUDIENCE: I was asking
what your intent--

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.660
NICHOLAS MEYER:
My intention was--

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.290
AUDIENCE: Your intention,
not for what you did,

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.380
what your intention--

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.140
NICHOLAS MEYER: I think
the best villains in movies

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.420
are villains that
you can agree with.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.670
When you talk about Khan
in my movie, for example,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.405
he's got a point.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.225
Admiral Kirk never bothered
to check on our progress.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:07.740
When you look at Richard III,
there are problems there.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.880
You can understand why this
is an angry, bitter man.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.160
And it doesn't always have to
be something that's sort of self

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.940
evident in that way.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.600
I was once working on
a James Bond movie.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.360
And I was told before I
got on the plane to London,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.250
we have two questions.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.020
What does the villain want?

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.000
And parenthetically,
remember, he's already

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.190
wanted the gold in Fort
Knox, the atom bombs,

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.050
the guided missiles,
control of outer space,

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.250
control of the water way.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.080
And number two, keep it simple.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.200
Well, it's a long plane ride.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.390
And I'm sure you
all know, you have

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.080
smart days and stupid days, days
when you come home and you go,

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.100
oh, oh.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.710
And then there are days
when you go, hello, this is

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.240
why they pay you the big bucks.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.490
So I said--

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.730
I'm meeting in a room.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.210
There was like 30 people
sitting in the room.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.000
And I said, OK, it seems to
me when you look at James Bond

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.610
movies that they have
something of the formality

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.080
of an English sonnet.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.220
It's a highly structured thing,
or a haiku, or something.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.850
It starts with the amazing
opening stunt, followed

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:28.370
by colorful title credits, theme
song, followed by James Bond

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:32.510
goes to see M and
banters with Moneypenny.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:35.270
Gets assignment from
M, and then there's

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.760
action sequence, action
sequence, action sequence,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.200
until he meets Mr. Big,
who says, no, Mr. Bond.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.590
It's not about the money.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.290
It's about fill in the blank.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:50.880
And so I thought, imagine
all this has happened.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.030
And Bond is now
in Mr. Big's lair.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.960
And in this version of
events, Mr. Big says,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.010
Mr. Bond, everything that's
happened to you up till now

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.420
has been a kind of test.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:11.320
I just wanted to see if
you were the man for me.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.560
And I think you may just be.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.460
I think when you get
to know me, that you'll

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.570
find out that fundamentally,
I'm a people person.

00:40:26.148 --> 00:40:27.190
There's too many of them.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.320
Even lemmings.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.940
Even lemmings, Mr. Bond.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.705
And he pushes a button,
and oh, look, there I am.

00:40:38.705 --> 00:40:41.890
Have I been there
the whole time?

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.600
Was I doing the same thing
back there that I was?

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.710
Then why are you looking--

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.210
anyway.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.600
He pushes the buttons,
and all these monitors

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.840
come up of overpopulation--

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:03.270
traffic jams in Los Angeles,
starving people in Ethiopia,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.530
whatever.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.810
Even lemmings, Mr.
Bond, know what

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.170
to do when they
grow too numerous.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.590
I am willing to bite
the bullet on a question

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:19.080
that no politician
will even touch.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.480
Will you help me, 007?

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.810
That's some kind of
license, isn't it?

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.680
How much game are you allowed
to bag without license?

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.320
Will you help me
save planet Earth?

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.900
And there's dead
silence in this room.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.890
Here's a villain.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.640
He was absolutely right.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.760
And his idea was to start a
war between India and China,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.270
the two most populous nations.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:55.020
And the next day, I came back,
and it was off the table.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.760
Too serious.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.310
But I had come up with--

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.760
I had fulfilled the assignment.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.240
It was simple.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.970
It hadn't been done before.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.460
And my dictum, if you can
agree with the villain,

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.950
then the hero really
has to be on his mettle.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.135
Bond really has to be good.

00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:14.010
You know what I said.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.427
Yeah, and Bond
says, you're right.

00:42:15.427 --> 00:42:17.700
I will help you.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.030
And I said, don't worry.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.430
The smart people in the
audience know he's not really

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.460
going to help him.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.127
And the stupid people
will be surprised

00:42:24.127 --> 00:42:25.960
when he doesn't help
him, so you can't lose.

00:42:29.264 --> 00:42:31.630
AUDIENCE: And that became
the "Infinity War."

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.755
NICHOLAS MEYER: Oh, did it?

00:42:32.755 --> 00:42:34.220
I didn't see it.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.970
Anyway.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.770
I see little movies.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.770
There's a movie called
"The Hummingbird Project"

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:41.190
that I saw.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.315
Did anybody see this movie?

00:42:42.315 --> 00:42:44.700
About trying to build a high
speed fiber optic network

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.800
between Kansas and
Wall Street to beat

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.750
the amount of information
by a millimeter

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.995
of a second in order--

00:42:49.995 --> 00:42:51.120
that was interesting to me.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.495
I like to see
movies about people

00:42:52.495 --> 00:42:53.670
trying to figure out shit.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.340
But if it gets too
noisy and too loud,

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.403
I kind of hunker down
and find more popcorn.

00:43:00.403 --> 00:43:02.820
AUDIENCE: All right, we have
another question on the Dory.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.357
This one's from
Hannah in San Bruno.

00:43:04.357 --> 00:43:05.940
This one says your
journey as a writer

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.195
started with the 7% solution.

00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:09.570
How did you decide
to write that,

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.610
and what made you shift
to writing screenplays?

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.010
NICHOLAS MEYER: OK, long story.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.980
And by the way, if you
guys get up and leave,

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.230
I can take a hint.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.030
In the first place,
before I finish this,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.110
I should say that I have another
Sherlock Holmes book coming out

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:34.220
in October, called "The
Adventure of the Peculiar

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.070
Protocols," which you
can preorder, by the way,

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:37.670
on Amazon.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.190
I didn't start out
wanting to be--

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.360
I wanted to make movies.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.520
I fell in love with movies
at a very early age.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.100
And that's what I wanted to do.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:55.610
So books is kind of an
afterthought in the sideline.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.700
My father was a psychoanalyst,
and I would go to school,

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.400
and people would say, oh,
your old man's a shrink.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.066
Is he a Freudian?

00:44:04.066 --> 00:44:06.130
And I didn't know.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.780
So I said, Papa,
are you a Freudian?

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.410
And he said, oh, that's
kind of a silly question.

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:15.930
And I said, why?

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.080
Why is it a silly question?

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.620
And he said, because it's
no more possible to discuss

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.880
the beginnings or the
history of psychoanalysis

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.500
and not start with Freud.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.110
It's like saying we're
going to discuss the history

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.620
of the discovery of America.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.570
And we're not going to talk
about Columbus or the Vikings.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.740
But to suppose that nothing
has happened since the Vikings

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.430
is to be pretty rigid,
pretty doctrinaire.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:47.040
When a patient comes to see
me, I listen to what they say.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.400
I listen to how they say it.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.530
I'm especially curious as
to what they do not say.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.950
I'm looking to see if they're
on time, what kind of clothes

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.260
they're wearing, what
their body language is.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:04.180
I am in short searching
for clues from them

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.960
as to why they are not happy.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.870
And against this, I
apply a background

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.440
of some clinical experience.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.490
And I said-- I'm like 13
years old or something--

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.890
it sounds like detective
work, what you do.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.900
And he said, it is like
detective work, in a way.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.270
And I suddenly realized
who my father had always

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:26.223
reminded me of.

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.390
Because I was reading all
the Sherlock Holmes books,

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.510
all the Arthur
Conan Doyle books.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:36.800
And I thought, gosh, I
wonder how much Arthur Conan

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.240
Doyle knew about the
writing of Sigmund Freud.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.140
And the first thing I learned
is that they're both doctors.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.230
They both died in the same
city within nine years

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.700
of each other.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:55.760
Holmes is a cocaine addict,
and so was, for a time, Freud.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.060
And these coincidences
and even more than that,

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.330
because Freud's first
exposure to cocaine

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.150
had been with the paper
he wrote with two eye

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.570
doctors, Konigstein and
Curler, on the uses of cocaine

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.460
as an anesthetic
during eye surgery.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.950
Conan Doyle had
studied ophthalmology

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.570
for six months in Vienna.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.980
And out of all this,
over many years--

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.010
because I tell you, I'm
a very slow thinker.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:25.820
So I started this
thought when I was 13,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.760
but the book didn't
come out till I was 28.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.900
And no one I knew was interested
in Sherlock Holmes, except me.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.360
So I just waited.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.440
The Writers Guild
went on strike.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.850
I was writing movies
and television movies.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.493
But I wasn't allowed to.

00:46:41.493 --> 00:46:43.910
And my friends said, so now
you can write that book you've

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.385
always been talking about.

00:46:46.385 --> 00:46:47.760
I never dreamed
that it was going

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.250
to become the number
one best selling

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.400
novel of the United States.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.750
That was a surprise.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:02.350
So since I'm thinking
we're out of hands,

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.980
I guess I'll let you guys go
back to fixing the future.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.360
And please hurry up.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.020
Thank you.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.670
[APPLAUSE]
