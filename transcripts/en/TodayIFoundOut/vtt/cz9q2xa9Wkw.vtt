00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.590
For hundreds of years, x has been the go-to
symbol for the unknown quantity in mathematical

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.260
equations.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.840
So who started this practice?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.850
Algebra was born in the Middle East, during
the Golden Age of medieval Islamic civilization

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.640
(750 to 1258 AD), and its early form can be
seen in the work of Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
and his 9th century book, Kitab al-jabr wal-muqabala
(al-jabr later morphing into algebra in English).

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.390
During this heyday, Muslim rule and culture
had expanded onto the Iberian Peninsula, where

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.140
the Moors encouraged scholarship in the sciences
and math.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.070
So what does this have to do with the letter
“x” in math?

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.360
In a recent TED talk, the director of The
Radius Foundation, Terry Moore, posited that

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.240
the the use of “x” in this way began with
the inability of Spanish scholars to translate

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.450
certain Arabic sounds, including the letter
sheen (or shin).

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.170
According to Moore, the word for “unknown
thing” in Arabic is al-shalan, and it appeared

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.549
many times in early mathematical works.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.939
(For example, you might see “three unknown
things equals 15,” with the “unknown thing”

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.560
then being 5.)

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.420
But since Spanish scholars had no corresponding
sound for “sh,” they went with the “ck”

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.770
sound, which in classical Greek is written
with the chi symbol, X. Moore theorizes, as

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.450
many others before him have done, that when
this was later translated into Latin, the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.939
chi (X) was replaced with the more common
Latin x.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.159
This is similar to how Xmas, meaning Christmas,
came about from the common practice of religious

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.829
scholars using the Greek letter chi (X) as
a shorthand for “Christ.”

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.320
The principle problem with Moore’s explanation
is that there is no direct documented evidence

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.390
to support it.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.191
More speculatively, people translating the
works would not care about phonetics, but

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.069
the meaning of the words.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.069
So whether they had a “sh” or not one
would think would be irrelevant.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.069
Despite the lack of direct evidence and flaws
in the argument, it nonetheless remains a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.590
very popular origin theory, even among many
academics.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.120
(Do a quick Google search and you’ll find
many a PhD in mathematics parroting this theory.)

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.260
The 1909-1916 edition of Webster’s Dictionary,
among others, also puts forth a similar theory,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.620
although stating that the Arabic word for
the singular “thing,” “shei,” was

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.490
translated into the Greek “xei,” and later
shortened to x.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.950
Dr. Ali Khounsary also notes that the Greek
word for unknown, xenos, also begins with

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.900
x, and the convention could simply have been
born of an abbreviation.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.860
But here, again, we have a lack of any direct
documented evidence to support these theories.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.680
As for a documented theory, we turn to the
great philosopher and mathematician, René

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680
Descartes (1596-1650).

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.380
It’s entirely possible Descartes did not
come up with the practice of using “x”

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.530
for an unknown, perhaps borrowing it from
someone else, but at least as far as documented

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.300
evidence that has survived to today goes,
he seems to be the creator of the practice,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.430
as noted by the OED and the phenomenal work
by Florian Cajori, A History of Mathematical

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.480
Notations (1929).

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.880
At the least, Descartes’ helped popularize
the practice.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.620
Specifically, in his landmark work, La Géométrie
(1637), Descartes solidified the movement

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.650
to symbolic notation by instituting the convention
of using the lowercase letters at the beginning

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.000
of the alphabet for known quantities (e.g.,
a, b and c) and using those at the end of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.490
the alphabet for unknown quantities (e.g.,
z, y and x).

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.490
Why?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.260
And why x more than y, and z for unknowns?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.310
Nobody knows.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.390
It has been speculated that the prominence
of x being used more than y and z for unknowns

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.210
in this work had to do with typesetting; one
story goes that it was Descartes’ printer

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.870
who suggested x be the principle unknown in
La Géométrie because it was the letter least

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.590
used and so the one he had more letter blocks
available to use.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.560
Whether this is true or not, Descartes used
the x to be an unknown at least as early as

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.370
1629 in various manuscripts, well before La
Géométrie.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.410
And, indeed, it would seem he had not come
to any hard rules on x, y, and z indicating

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.750
unknowns; in some manuscripts from this time,
he actually used x, y, and z to represent

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.590
known quantities, casting even further doubt
on the supposed “unknown thing” translation

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.310
theories listed above.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.259
So, in the end, by all appearances, Descartes
simply arbitrarily chose the letters to represent

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.190
different things in his works as was convenient
and it just so happened in his landmark work,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.330
La Géométrie, he decided the specific variable
nomenclature, perhaps, on a whim.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.920
Whatever the case, as with Descartes’ notation
for powers (x3), after the publication of

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.610
La Géométrie, the use of x as a principle
unknown (as well as the more general tradition

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:03.540
of a, b, c = knowns and x, y, z = unknowns)
gradually caught on.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:23.150
And 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:06:29.410
the rest, as 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:11:17.589
they say, is 
mathematical history.
