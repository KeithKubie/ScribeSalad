00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.469
So as we were building
out our purchase flow.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.770
One of the things which
we became attuned

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.150
to is the importance of making
sure people feel comfortable.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.860
Putting their payment information
into the purchase experience.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.020
And so one of the things
which we did learn is that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.110
it's important to offer
multiple different options.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.100
Because different buyers
have different levels of

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.010
appreciation of the security as you're
going through the purchase flow.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.220
And so for us that meant being able
to offer both a credit card option or

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.040
offering like a PayPal option.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.220
And so,
I think traditionally it's kind of

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.490
understood to try to make your purchase
experience as simple as possible.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.850
Like remove all the different options.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.620
But, particularly as you
think about payments,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.190
creating options which give
the sense of security.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.850
Was pretty important as we
built out this experience.
