00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:01.112
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:02.961
is talk about acidity and in particular,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:06.187
we're gonna talk about the pH scale.

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:09.552
Now the first question
is what does pH stand for

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.613
and it turns out that there's some debate

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.285
why we have this lowercase p here,

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.095
we know why we have the h,

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:17.787
and some people will tell you it stands

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:22.717
for power of hydrogen, the
capital h for hydrogen.

00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:26.884
Some people will say it's
the potential of hydrogen.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:32.034
Some people will say it's
the capacity for hydrogen,

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:35.803
you might say capacity
doesn't start with a p

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.983
but if you go into Latin, it can.

00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:39.915
But what do all of these things mean

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:43.137
and why do we care about hydrogen so much?

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:45.400
Well, it turns out that
hydrogen, and in particular,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.034
a hydrogen positive ion, and ion

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:50.655
is just a positively charged molecule,

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.061
that a hydrogen ion can play a major role

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.917
in how acidic or basic something is.

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:58.192
And so the pH scale, you're gonna see it

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:00.692
go from zero all the way to 14

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.938
with of course, seven in the middle,

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:09.617
and something that is towards the left,

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:13.460
something that is less than
seven is considered acidic,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.042
and so if you have a pH near zero

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:17.337
that is highly, highly, highly acidic,

00:01:17.337 --> 00:01:21.494
while something to the
right is considered basic

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:25.961
and something in the middle
is considered neutral.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.178
And another term for
basic you'll sometimes see

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:31.946
is alkaline, and alkaline
actually comes from Arabic

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:35.777
for alkali which was the word
that ancient Arab chemists use

00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:39.933
for a compound that
happens to be very basic

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.116
by our modern definition.

00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:44.299
But what does it mean to be acidic

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.945
and what does it mean to be basic

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:49.521
and once again, how does that
connect with hydrogen ions?

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.209
Well, it turns out, and
I'm not gonna go in depth

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.264
in this video, is that
things that are acidic

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:57.097
tend to have lots of hydrogen ions

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:03.136
and while things that
are basic tend to react,

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.436
react with these hydrogen ions.

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:08.886
There's other definitions
for what it means

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.720
to be an acid or base
and we'll go into depth

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.233
in chemistry class on that,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.000
but this is why it's
connected with the term pH.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.905
Now what are examples of
things that are acidic?

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.856
Well, you see it on this
chart right over here.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:23.616
Here, we're going in
the vertical direction.

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:26.194
Things in our everyday
life that are quite acidic,

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:28.248
a lot of fruits are quite acidic,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.218
for example, lemons and grapefruits

00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.185
and orange juice are quite acidic.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.920
They're at the low end of the scale.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.046
And some of the telltale signs for acidity

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.696
is if you were to drink it or eat it,

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:43.475
that it would have this kind
of sharp sour taste to it,

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.400
while if you go to the
other end of the spectrum,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.846
things that are basic, these
would be things like bleaches

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:52.170
and ammonia solution and we can even go

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.137
super basic to liquid drain cleaner,

00:02:55.137 --> 00:02:59.210
and these are going to have
more of a slimy texture to it.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.282
In fact, even soap is quite basic.

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.498
And of the basic things
that you could eat,

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:07.755
you might have a bitter
taste associated with it.

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:09.941
But to be clear, I really don't recommend

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.494
eating or drinking anything
that is either highly basic

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:15.940
or highly acidic, and the reason is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.143
is that things that are at
the extreme of the pH scale,

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:22.233
so things that are either extremely basic

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.150
or things that are extremely acidic

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:29.321
like battery acid or hydrochloric acid,

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.807
because they're so reactive,
they will damage you.

00:03:32.807 --> 00:03:34.940
If you pour it in your
skin, it will damage you.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.200
If you ingest it, it
will damage your cells

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.918
and it can even kill you.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.507
So don't try to taste things to see

00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:44.517
whether they're acid or
basic, and if you do,

00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:46.012
try to make sure that they're closer

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:49.095
to this middle range of our pH scale.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.259
So I've talked a lot about
things that are acidic

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.587
or basic, but also what's interesting

00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:57.216
is things that we consider to be neutral.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.386
So our blood, for
example, is quite neutral,

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.763
and this is something
that doctors might measure

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:05.750
because if your pH in your
blood gets a little bit too high

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.583
or a little bit too low,

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.705
that can cause some serious problems.

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.735
Sea water is pretty
close to being neutral.

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:15.006
Milk is not that far off of being neutral.

00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:17.064
Now with that said, in order to read

00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:20.004
the pH scale appropriately
or appreciate the differences

00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:23.011
in acidity and basicity,
it's important to realize

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.255
that it is not a linear scale.

00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:28.851
So for example, something
that has a pH of eight

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:33.319
is not twice as basic as
something that has a pH of four.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.290
It turns out, when you go
form one level of our pH scale

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.265
to the other, you are
going up in basicity,

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:42.098
say going from a pH four to a pH of five,

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:43.610
by a factor of 10.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.671
And so, comparing
something with a pH of four

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:47.819
to a pH of eight, that
thing with the pH of four

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.819
would be 10, 100, 1,000,

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:53.934
10,000 times more acidic,

00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:56.009
or you could say the
thing with a pH of eight

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.509
is 10, 100, 1,000,

00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:00.822
10,000 times more basic.

00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:03.556
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:06.522
Keep a lookout when people
talk about pH balance

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:09.184
or blood pH, and we're also, as we study

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.134
more and more biology,
we're gonna talk about

00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:14.365
how pH might influence
some biological reactions

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.672
and especially once
you get into chemistry,

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:20.839
pH will inform us what type of
reaction is likely to happen.
