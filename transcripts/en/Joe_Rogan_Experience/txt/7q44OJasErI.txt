Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I rarely watch the event live. Hello? Skanks. What's up? Hello live. This is sort of hell. You were recorded. Could you see boys? Duggans avenue things got strange. As soon as I said we're alive, everybody's like, whoa. Oh Man. We were having a great conference. Now we're listening a little too high right now. People are listening to what? God Damn Mike Tyson weed and we really were just having the most natural conversation. Everyone was going back and forth. Nothing. Yeah, Mike Tyson. We were talking when you went to the bathroom. Mike Tyson says he smokes $40,000 of weed. We also sells weed, so he just charges it himself. A lot of money. He gets hired as a supply slip. $40,000 worth of weed. I mean maybe like his whole crew. You have to say this about himself. There's no way a month. How much is 40,000 I want to see what it looks like in a room like, yeah, am I buying that?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       It would be a pile that you could fall into and take a nap. Like you could definitely take like bean bag chair and you could fly through the air with confidence. So how much is, I mean you're getting it in bulk, so it's going to be probably like a hundred dollars it's getting worse. Even less than that. If you're going to spend 40 grand, they'll give you more than 40 grands worth just to be like, here, man. We smoked 10 tons of weed at the ranch a month. Oh my God, this is Britain said uh Eban. Is that how you say his name? Even Eben. Eben Britton. So a 10 tons of weed is $40,000 that doesn't seem right, does it? None of that seems right. [inaudible] pounds of weed. It's impossible. He obviously could have easily been joking and laughing while he said this too. We're reading it in print, but he's like, dude, we smoked 10 tons a month.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       We talk. That's what I'm saying. Sounds like something I would say more than you trying possibly imagine with the chef. Keep burning and we brought in all the time. We don't even believe I'm going to throw out a wild number. Forty million forty million, 40,000 someone should maybe some journalists should do. Oh, look up. Do just make an image of this is what $40,000 worth of weed looks like. Yeah. It's going to be more than even like Tyson and his crew can smoke when they fill this whole room. I think it would. It'd be, yeah. One of the like shipping crates is, is it? There's a graph. Is it even possible to smoke $40,000 a weed a month? 980 [inaudible] not that much, but with a cro niner I think about it. If you do a two grand blunts, that's two blonds per eighth essentially a little bit less.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       This guy's got a broken down baby. This guy really could just tell you how much it is in bulk. He's giving you 908th seems a little bit lazy to even write 1800 blondes between Mike Tyson's. Crew is not actually that much for a month. It's not that much. Now when I'm looking at the how this guy saying it, he's saying it. It's basically four blunts per hour. That's totally possible. If you've got a number of people with you. I will never question Mike Tyson again. This is it ever Amanda. Not still not 10 tons. I think we're being silly. I think they were joking around. I bet a lot of it they give away too. You know, they might go through a personal stash of that much weed. I didn't know we have ranch, right? Tyson's in the weed game son all in. Dude. He was one of the most fascinating guys that interview because I couldn't believe I was really talking to them. So like, I can't believe that's really Mike Tyson. Like there's smart people. Like you talk to them like, oh, that's really Mike Tyson. This is crazy. It doesn't make sense

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       what he's been through in his life. Yeah. You're like, and now he's here

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       knowing him as a kid when he was the fucking man and you'd see him on the cover of these magazines like kid dynamite when he was 19 years old on sports illustrated and just smashing everyone in front of him and then all of a sudden he's hanging with you. Yeah. It's very strange. She's 10. It's also just as a fall from grace and then a resurgence and still weird for surgeons too. Like nobody ever saw him becoming like, you know, cartoon character and like a fucking Broadway actor and a one man show and now we'd rancher. That's [inaudible] who saw that? Nobody said that was going to be Mike Tyson's trajectory. I just hope it doesn't

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       started the tech, the uh, the trajectory of when I found out who he was when I was a kid and started getting those bought like very shortly after you saw it, a monster he was, was that Robin Givens interview where he just sat there like a doofus while she was like gay beats up me and rapes my mom and he's like, [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       [inaudible] just go on. Like when these cameras go off, oh boy, you better hope that thin if you go to the phone for four days. But wasn't there some talk about them medicating him? Wasn't that part of what was happening? Like they were the Mama Rob given to date him? Maybe. I just remember him talking about him in the documentary and he was just like, he said he was just so, he couldn't believe she was saying it, so he was just like silent. But if you watch it, it seems like he's furious and just trying to not say something angry. Key to Mike Tyson is that he always seemed like he was furious. Yeah, and he even talked about it once. He goes, I'm just mad. I'm mad at my dog. I'm mad at everything, and that's when he was at the top of the heat, man.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Fuck how? He's like this peaceful, friendly guy. He had to overcompensate for all that. That's why he needs 40,000 childhood. It was all therapy. Right. He had to be, he has had like 20 therapists. He beat up the first seven of them. I mean, to be a great fighter, you have to be able to look at yourself. You have to be able to look at your skills. You still, it doesn't mean you still can't make horrific mistakes, but you have to be able to look at yourself. It's the only way you get any better. Those the best fighters have an understanding. Even if they have ego problems, they still have a pretty good understanding of who they are and that's, that can benefit you if you use it. I'm sure he probably went through therapy but he didn't necessarily, he could probably have figured it out on his own just cause he's a smart guy.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       He's a smart guy that grew up in a horrible, horrible where the first love he had was an old boxing trainer that turned him into a murderer. Then that was the first love that guy experienced. His life was horrible man. And from him being adopted by custom motto when he was a little kid and having extreme physical gifts as well. It was this perfect storm did they said when he was 13 he weighed 190 pounds. Teddy Atlas used to bring him to boxing the smoker events and they were like Dang, he's fucking 13 and they put him in with a 16 year old cause nobody wants to believe that a 13 year old could be jacked like that when Jay would, when Jason was 13 years old, they were like two 20 it's true. [inaudible] different kind of was it a different build? He be okay. I got them motherfuckers out of your Goddamn tank.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Yeah. That's not a 13 year old. You want to fight. Also fun fact he is the reason Mike Tyson solely is the reason why now if you're on TV for even five minutes they start scurrying about your tattoos being covered or can you get a release for the mall because when he came on a, was it the hangover movie, the company that did where the tattoo artists that did his face tattoo suit for like and I think one for like millions of dollars. How is that possible for doing the movie? Because they used that purchase artwork without them. Once you put a tattoo on. Yeah. Nobody is your own, you know, you claimed part ownership of that Yeltsin that makes tattoo so much. Gayer it just, you know, walk around with some fucking dudes. Oh yeah, this is fine. This is, I married in a lesbian in Alaska. This is when I became, I guess a a partners in life with a guy in Montreal who spoke French.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       Say how many tattoos did we have in common? We are the same. You guys have a bunch of 10. One, two, three. Yeah, we have the day of suicide. What did, what did, what do you guys have here we go. Oh, we're doing that. You guys get, what do you, what's happening here? There's a lot of people that can't hear this. So what are these things? This is notes half hearts. It says Dave and Smith. Wow. Yeah. So you are on their arm. Yeah. These two would make you uncomfortable. I did not consent to see much of a pussy to get a tattoo. So we did it for him. Ah, these are very cute. He's very Jewish. That's real love, man. You guys have to stay friends for life. Now. I know I was going to be out the door and they got this tattoo. No girls want to get married, guys do that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Oh Bro, Bro, I'm fucking [inaudible] Bro. You got to do much. I tried to, hey, you could have as many guys tattooed on you. I don't care. I'm not jealous, but I want my fucking name on your leg, Bro. There was a Worldstar, there's a wellstar video yesterday of a guy catching a girl cheating in a hotel and the other guy's like naked in the hallway and she's like in her underwear and the guy is just screaming at her. There's a guy there and she just fucking keeps going. And he's like, I got my fucking your name tatted on me. And she's doing all of that. I'm sorry. Calmed down. I'm sorry. And when she just decides that she doesn't give a shit anymore, she goes, well no one told you to get my name tatted on you. Now you'll get fucking ass. Oh my damn. Have you ever done anything for a girl? Like a tattoo? Yeah. You know, so I've three characters

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       here. This is back when I was young enough when a tattoo shop was able to convince you, which I think they still do. The people that Chinese characters can say or spell anything, which is just not true. Well, like what's supposed to be letters. So I got, when I believed Chinese characters was CMS, they're still there. Uh, they're just blended into something else. But it was Sherilyn Marie Sleeter was, uh, was the name of my girlfriend when I was a terrible name. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       All Sleeter she sounds like she's got shit teeth infamous now. Good teeth. Sheriffs. Leary says, I see have fucking teeth pointing in every which direction. Hot

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       CIC actually. But, uh, just, I mean, coming from like a real pack of dummies, like real stupid and so stupid. In fact, was she, that I got those tattooed on me. Thank God. And Chinese characters, CMS. Her mom didn't like me and I came, I couldn't wait to tell her mom that I got this tattoo. I go, look what I got for your daughter. And she's like, what does that go to CMS? And she goes, what's that? I go, your daughter's initials. Sherilynn Maria's leader. And she goes, uh, her mom could, she was so happy to go. That's not your name. My girlfriend was so dumb. She didn't know her name is not, in fact, she just made up the Murray part. Her name is Cheryl Lynn Sleeter and it was that. So I got a wrong tet to have a girl from that. She was perfect. She was with me while I got it and didn't know her own middle name. Sat there confidently like, make sure you get the m good.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       Yeah. That's, that too is wild large patches of America. That is, that tattoo, that tattoo like that. That's that fucked up bodies so many lives. Oh yeah. So many people. So many people have made horrendous choices. Yeah. I had my first tattoo. It just said, uh, Lew dog. I gotta cover it out. But Ludo, l, U. D. O, g, g, nobody has ever called me Lou dog, except for afterwards sarcastically to make fun of me. They're like, all right, Lou dog is there, but you were so sick to go tell your friends. Hey guys, you're calling me Lou dog. It was weird cause I only had $70 and I was like, all right dude, I have $70 I'm 18 I just turned 18 I was like getting a fucking tattoo and I was like, all right, I'm going to Ludo no matter what. But I gotta get like a little design underneath it. [inaudible] script and then underneath it it was, it was tribal like almost they had walls look like, like antlers, like tribal antlers. But it was because I was poor. Some you would like scribble on a binder while you're bored in class. Dude. It was just, it was like there was a tramp stamp. It was like about tiny trash stamp underneath Lou dog for no reason. Were you under age? No, I was 18

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       oh, I was under it. That's why my mind is the word Jay and old English and it is so high up here to so my mom wouldn't see it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       Oh right. You sold immediately. Why was the hide it under your tee shirt? We were both fat kids and I had a big fat arms with this little tiny shit that too. And my big fat arm. And your j is so tiny, it's so tiny. It's still, they're all bad. It's bad. It's bad. Yeah, it's that, yeah. Then more Chinese stuff here and then a Pam Anderson Barbwire wire around my arm. But I've just accepted all my tattoos of some shitty dumb stories in high school. My friend Jimmy was the first one to get tattooed and he got this really shitty like tiger on his arm with his name case if he gets his name, you know, I think we were like 18 at the time, maybe 17. And he came home and uh, he had like a little bandaid peeking out underneath his shirt. His mom started screaming at him and if I'm, I hope I'm not re, I'm fucking this story up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       I hope I'm not, but like are I remember thinking that like, wow, he was the first, like, everyone's got to get a tattoo eventually. Like the idea that someone's gonna draw on you permanent. I was like, Ooh, forever. You've got to keep it like it's a balls. Funny. It never really hit me like that hard, but I know it and it's true. And by the way, I wish you know, talk about having a time machine. If you can go back and just tell your teenage self like just wait til even like your late twenties you're going to have a lot of good years with awesome tattoos. We're going to make this decision now and have the rest of your life with some pretty shitty. You want money when you're 18 you don't, there's no money for good tattoos. You probably from some Alicia live in Miami 20 I've have, I have $20 tattoos on me for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       I was, if I was offended by the drawing because I'm an artist and I was looking at, I was like this is so bad. The guy just traits. I mean the guy was not an artist at all. Whoever did the tattoo, he was fucking just a guy who got a job doing tattoos, who learned how to use the gun on my leg. I have a dragon, like a, another tribal dragon. I was 19 and Florida. We Miami like we liked like on a boardwalk tattoo shop with like Chinese people in the front. Like they don't ever get tired. Never going to tablets. You're in China and they're using the old like taffy techniques where they fucking do that. Don't go to like a Shit Bodega Tattoo shop because that's what I got and it's all blended together now. And the guys had no idea. It's painful shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       They don't know what they're doing. The other problem with it is it's really painful. They go too deep. They pull it out. Well that's another thing about [inaudible] ladies. If you uh, or guys who are in the Henna Tattoos, if you get those Hanna Tattoos, I can Thailand or something like that. Sometimes it's not really Henna, it's hair dye and the hair dye can be poisonous to your skin. She's like not good stun. You didn't even die getting a real tattoo. Wow. You can die, but I think it fucks you up. I'm getting painted on with hair dyes. What a, I think there was like a warning about this that I've read where they're saying don't don't get Hannah from places that aren't using real Henoch cause they, they use cheap hair dye. They could've just stopped that dunk at Henna. Yeah, you could have said that. That's a weird one. Right? It's like I want a tattoo but not really. Yeah, it looks like a, it looks like a spray on Tan's wearing off. It just looks disgusting.

Speaker 3:          00:14:33       P D is Con in it. Whatever. Black can often contains PPD at high levels and when that applied to skin can cause chemical burns and allergic reactions. And I don't know what PPD is. I'm trying to find that chemical burns.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       Yeah, you gotta be careful out there. Kids don't do heels on you. Joe Rogan says steer clear of Hannah, drill holes in your skin and pumped some ink in there. It's apparently there had to be like a, uh, some errors made when they were coming up with like tech. Like the first tattoos, peoples arms were fucking falling off their body. I'm pretty sure the first tattoos were like in Africa, carving shit into your arm or something. Scarring thing. When someone's a great tattoo artists, I'm always blown. It's the most sloppy, uncomfortable with the fact that I couldn't do anything near that with like a pencil and art supplies and a set. Yeah. You know flat surface like was it meant to have to do that as correct when someone's amazing at it, it makes no sense. No it doesn't because they always, also, there's still just going like and just scribbling basically it looks like and then they swipe it away and it's like they're mad at you.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       It's like, man, I found the craziest fucking page. Jamie, I'm gonna send it to you. This is a lady and she does paint on people's face that makes it look like they have extra eyeballs and the, the paint is so accurate. You're looking at a video of it and you're like, what the fuck am I looking at? I have to say, is it the Asian check? Cause she makes herself into different do that. That chick is fucking talented, which he does with makeup and she got in trouble cause she did black face but she does everything. She can do blackface. She made herself into like an African Nubian princess. It was the most amazing thing in the world. Is this her? But it still has like the outline.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       She was shucking and jiving. She was choice. I'm a Newbie and princess, whether you're talking [inaudible] name is Mimi Choi. This is the shit she does. Whoa, look at that dude. That's insane. Yeah. Your head. She's got eyeballs drawn. All those Rogan's perfectly well. Yeah. That's like a tool video. She's a fractal. That is something you would see if you were on some serious drugs and this is the kind of shit you got to pretend to enjoy where if you want to fuck a hot Asian chick her, I'm super into new dance. Like look at that. Oh this is a different check than I was thinking of, but yeah, I guess there's a category. It's cool. It's crazy. If you go scroll down and look at some of the eyeball ones where the extra eyeballs are below or face [inaudible] Jesus Christ. That's a fucking freak out. It's a fucking freak out.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       Yeah. Yeah. That's so weird. Yeah, it's wild. It's that same sort of level of tattoo art that the really high level Tattoo guy. Have you seen that Guy Steve Butcher? I've showed you that guy before, right? That guy walked into a room. I would think that it's a monster and I would kill it. Yeah. He like, what the fuck? He was terrifying. Someone drugged you. Yeah. You would see like, Oh my God, Satan is real. I've been budding around arrogant thinking that Satan's not real. Yeah. This is Steve Butcher. Steve Butcher does insane shit, man. He did one of me. Somebody got me tattooed on their leg and it's fucking increase. Do you feel about that Joe? So weird. Don't do that. Don't do that. Doesn't mean you can't say it to the guy when he sends you a fucking just dump stuff. God got Legion of skanks tattoo on his face and like you look at you go, that's awesome that you want to do that. But man you maybe you shouldn't have bunch of other face tattoos though. It wasn't the first one. True. Who that? Kobe Bryant. Scroll up a bit. Look at that. Kobe Bryant. He's got the tee shirt. His mouth. Get the fuck Outta here man. That might as well be a photograph. That's crazy. Like look at the resolution. Look at the sweat. If you said to me, what's the one thing you can't draw? I'd say black people sweat. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       this guy pulled it off somehow. If I was drawing that we just have white drips. Dennis failing. You got like copied. Make that bigger Jamie. That guy did that with needles man. That's insane. How good that is. Yes. Somehow it doesn't seem nearly as weird to get athletes tattooed on you. Is it those comedians does for now? It's still [inaudible]. I'm sure Kobe's running around going, damn dude, that's a little different that these people grow up on. Like, I mean that's not true dude. Cause I, the connection that people feel with like comics and podcasts, it's pretty, I get it. You know, it's like we don't want the responsibility. We want to do it, but we don't want the response. But I don't want the responsibility of being your Shin. I 100% want my fucking face tattooed on people. So anybody out there I will. I'll give you a free lesions, gangs, t-shirts. There's the dude. It's a good tattoo. It loves it says Lou dog. That is crazy. That's so that is as accurate as a photograph. That would suck my fucking face. That's my face. That's fucking intense. It's amazing. Yeah. I don't remember what, that's fine. I was probably making a point. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       whatever it was. You were right. [inaudible] problem with me, man. You get any one clip of me or my face and you could make decisions. That's a, that's an incredible, ted says the first time Joe saw always butthole. There's no way I can remember that far back. I think fun. I think always said so many times. I think he's in process of getting his butthole fixed. Is he going to get surgery? He's been bleeding since I've known him. It's bizarre that he just lives life like that. That was shut. That's a problem. That would shut me off from going out to the world. What, what causes those things? Hemorrhoids. What causes hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids. Working out. Cause I wasn't breathing when I was lifting weights and I was just clenching, just clenching my butt hole. And it just popped out like squeezing a balloon animal. You made blisters inside your butthole. Wheezing it together for a while. Well, this is actually how we got introduced to Ari's butthole was I was complaining about me having hemorrhoids and I'm leaving to skanks. We opened up my butthole to show them. I showed all the guys did it. We didn't call open up. We said, that's not a ham roll. And we're like, what ax?

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       You call that a hemorrhoid. Oh, that's step aside. Little ladies, let me show you a hemorrhoid. And it was like, no, it was like the uh, you know, and stranger things. The fucking monster, the way the face opens up, that's what all always asshole does. Looks like Yammer. Simpson's mouth. Yeah. Remember like the blade, remember the blade vampire mouse. Predator. Predator. It's baggy but it just cause it opens a lot the way it opens. How does he get away with what he gets away with? Dude? He like, he keeps, he keeps tissues in his asshole at all times. And if you're with Ari at one point he might just throw a bloody tissue at you. If it got to, I get, I get staying away from the doctors, I get it. But if you're actively bleeding out of your asshole, I'd be on an operating table face down, click quick. I think it's a real pain in the ass to get the surgery.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       I liked it and dealing with it as is. You don't know yet. But I mean it's, I'm glad he's going to get it fixed though. It's troublesome. When your friend says, how many times did that guy send you a picture of bloody toilet paper? I've seen way too much, way too much [inaudible] people. The height up thing to me is that, uh, Ari historically is just crushed ass like hot chicks walking around with the confidence guy. He's confident walking around with Napkins, weirdly handsome. Like you don't think you'd see me? Like, all right, that's a fucking goofy camel face. Fucking asshole. Yeah, but then you look at him again. He kinda has dreamy eyes dreaming and he's in good shape. I don't know, man. He got in good shape for sober October. He's a fucking animal. I knew that he was going to be a real problem. He was trying to win that God damn thing. That's not right there, dude. You can't fucking have a athletic competition with all of your add a shape, fat friends. It's not fair.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       But they were willing to do it. I'm like, okay, good luck. I'm like, look, we're gonna, we're gonna work out seven days, seven days, six hours a day. We're going to have to do that. We're gonna see who drops. This is not smart, but I understand it because they're sober. Ari came the closest, arguing close. He got close. He went hard. He went fucking hard. If Ra was in shape going into it, he would probably would've at least what's gotten a lot worse? Winning. Millie, how do you win? Do you have this? Uh, this is last year. Last year was the only time we met at a competition and I think it's better off not being a competition. Honestly. I think the first year we had to do 15 yoga classes over the month, 1590 minute hot yoga classes, which is annoying. Yeah, it's annoying. Like you don't want to do it, but you have to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Like can you get in there? All right, number seven, like, and you're starting to think how many more days are there? I'm going to have to do a bunch of work. I want up having to do nine in a row. So I did yoga nine fucking days in a row, but it would know it was no competition, but we just had a requirement and everybody met the requirement. We felt good that we accomplished the goal together. But then everybody started talking crazy. They wanted to do a competition. And Tom was like, yeah, let's wear these a heart rate monitors. I'm like, okay, all right, we're all gonna die. So what was, how did you, how would it Ari of one, like what was the point system it based on 80% of your heart rate, right? So your [inaudible], it finds your Max heart

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       rate and then you know 80% of that gets you x amount of points and 90% of that gets you y amount of points. I forget what it is over a course of time. Yeah, but you can't really maintain 90% 90% is like the sprints. The real smart move is a stay at 80 and go longterm. So we were doing these cardio workouts. It's all just in your head cause it's not hard to do. It's not hard to do an elliptical machine. It's an easy motion. So it's all in your head and all you do is you wear this fucking heart rate monitor. And what I did is I watched the murder scene from John Wick where it goes into the Russian bathhouse and over again. I'm on a loop for five hours and I just stayed on the fucking elliptical machine for five hours watching that scene and I get to the end of that and I'd rewind it and I'd watch it. I'd be like, ah, music fucked up. And I just, I did it for fucking six, six hours a day, seven hours, six hours a day. That's psychotic while we were having a competition. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:24:47       it's probably not healthy to work, but it's not helpful. Like [inaudible] we were competing. Yeah, we know we're going to hell. We're going to hell. I'm like, we're going to hell. There's no way. Bert, Bert Kreischer was the one who talked the most shit. So I would think about him while I was getting tired and I was like, there's no way bitch. There's no way you're going to die. We're all gonna die. Let's just go. We're going to go til there's no sleep. Is there an advantage to starting off being like one of the fattest guys because you kind of lose more instead of, no, no, no. Your body's going to have a hard time recovering. 80% of your max heart rate is different than 80% of my max heart rate. So technically I don't have to work as hard as you, you know, you'd have to run on, you know, seven on a treadmill.

Speaker 4:          00:25:28       I could run at a 4.5 but no, I think it's based on your age as well. So the Max heart rate is different. So it might actually be easier because it's just used to doing it. It's all about your body being used to doing. If you're using, you're looking out [inaudible] percent is only like 140 beats a minute, you know, or maybe a little bit more like one 46 beats per minute. That's not that bad. Like you can kind of do that for a long time. He goes, sh what's like, she just watched something that's engaging and make sure you keep breathing at that rate and you get, you get trapped in whatever you're watching. And for me it was fights too. That was a big one. I just put on some great fights. So I got a TV right in front of me and I'm on this fucking elliptical machine watching fights and I would drink gigantic jugs of water with Himalayan salt and all these different hydrators right up. No, to keep your hydrated [inaudible]. Okay. I see that sweet, sweet, delicious water. I sweat so much that I set off the fire alarm. What? I filled the room up with so much steam that the fire alarm went off. I filmed it good. I put it on youtube or on Instagram, but it was ridiculous. If you make me so mad, Dave's never worked out a day in his fucking life. He's just, there's gotta be a few.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       They look, yeah, he looks good. He's handsome. My point was, Ari got close. He got close to me. He wasn't even working out. That's how crazy Ari is. And then you have to deal with the fact that you're doing this publicly and you can't allow already to beat you with this thing. I was in normal hour, Burt, if our he beat me, I would have said Mao, man, I would've, I would've said, wow man, that is really, really impressive. But there was no fucking way [inaudible] Tom, if Tom beat me, I'd be like, dude, you did it man. Wow. I wish I won. But you won Burt. No Way. There's no way we're going to hell. You just leave. We never hear from your again. Go into the darklands. I'm wearing that monitor on me all day long. I'm just going to be lifting weights everywhere I go far back was Burton the stairs?

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       He's barely working out talking shit. What did he do? Was it a marathon he ran or something? Half Marathon. No, no. He ran a full marathon and he ran. It was pretty impressive. It's insane. Burt's tough. All bullshit aside like Burt talks, tremendous amounts of shit. That's why I didn't want to lose to him, but person tough. I think you also talked shit to sort of set the expectation for himself too. Cause he says it, he's going to fucking have to stick to it because it's a very loose thing. That's made it [inaudible]. We always talk about, he speaks very declarative about things and I'm like, why do you do that? Hold myself to that standard. If I say I'm going to lose weight publicly and then I don't ever want to call me a fucking phony, and if I, if I keep it in my head, I probably will be more likely to skip the gym or whatever else it is.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       That's really wise. That's really wise. That's a good strategy. If you fail, it works for better podcasting. He's also true public acknowledgement of your failings when it comes to like little goals that you set up for you. It's like lets everybody know, hey man, this is not easy to do comics and he, I dude, we live in a social media generation. It's all like, you need that. I need people to tell me, dude, you're losing weight. And when they stopped telling me that I get fat again and then they're like, oh, you're getting fat. And then I start losing weight again. I, and I'm, it's almost that the attention is sort of what motivates me. I need something beyond just being [inaudible]. How much time have you spent researching different methods of losing weight and how much you looked into intermittent fasting? I've done in a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       It did. I've done, I've been assessed try that. I've never, I still don't fully understand what it is. Simple. You just have a small feeding window like a, for me, I like to fast f I feel at my best on fasting 14 hours. So what I'll do is, you know, if I eat at 8:00 PM then I eat at 10:00 AM the next day. It's not that hard. I was doing 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM I was eating, I could eat from 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Um, but I wasn't really eating healthy things. What I was doing, I [inaudible] thing I was eating shitty. What I'm better at is if I just cut out most of the carbs, I eat fruit and shit like that. But if I cut out all the carbs in the burgers and the fucking bread and the pasta and the rice, I can manage that because I can get creative.

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       And if I'm the mood for pizza, I can figure out a, you know, a low carb version of pizza, you know, Callie fire across or whatever it is. Gay. Yeah. You know what? You should just come to you that it's really delicious. Do all those things but also lift weights. Yeah. I have been, I just started again like two weeks ago. That's a big one. But lifting weights is huge. It burns a shit ton of cowers. And more importantly, when your body has more muscle than your body burns more calories so you can eat the same amount of food and you lose weight, you could do all that. Or Louis, I know you just fist fight a comedian. [inaudible] lose weight, you'll lose body fat. Joe, you eat like tons of meat. I eat a lot of meat. Do you ever get, have you gotten gout, uh, stuff ever gouts from meat.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Isn't that like a wine disease? What do you get gout from? A lot of meat, meat and beer on your feet and your toe. It hits your fucking right big toe. It sucks. I'm sitting in a chair for too long and eating too much meat. I think it's all those things. Your heel too. Doesn't it? Fuck your heels. Maybe. I don't know. I haven't tried it hit it hit twice ever and my toe was awful. But you had gout. Yeah, but that was like, and by the way it would hurt so much. When I went to the doctor I was like, I'll take, cause there's like, you know you can get medicine for it every day you take so you don't get it. And I would have absolutely taken that as how much it hurt and they go, no, you don't have like a condition.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       You know what I mean? Like I think I just, I went to like a festival of concerts one weekend and [inaudible] shit. Gouty definitely shout it up. Here's the definition. Gout occurs when you're eight crystals accumulate and your joint causing inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Your eight crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in the, in your blood, your body produces uric acid. When it breaks down Purina substances that are found naturally in your body. I got his blood that still didn't answer my question. What's Jane Cause here it, I got people at ease up on the foods, meat, poultry, seafood co chemical compounds that are high amounts and certain foods like meat, poultry and seafood. That's interesting. I think you also have to be fat hypo. Uremia yeah, my friend was not fat. I'm hyper Yersinia it sounds like something that a fat person should only get though. Dude, I lied. I was on a flight yesterday and I lied

Speaker 5:          00:31:39       and uh, because we, we were on the runway for two and a half hours and I was just getting really impatient. I was like, I'm fucking hungry. I mean I made up that I was hyperglycemic to get food. I buzzed, busted thing and they wouldn't come. So eventually I started just like waving like a mad man. And Mike [inaudible], who's a friend of ours, a comic, he was a few rows up. This is how he knew what was on the plane cause I was being a lunatic and I was like, we've been on here forever. Oh, I'm hypoglycemic. I need food right now man. I'm like, don't get me orange juice. It was the most fucking embarrassing thing, but here, suck a lemon. Keep getting me two and a half hours.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       When you're angry on a plane that's not going anywhere. It's, I'm blown away by the amount of rules. Like when you've been at the gate for like two hours before, I'm like, can I just go back into the airport? And they're like, now like it doesn't make any sense to you and not like take the flag and like I want to, I'm off. I think you can be lifted. Doors closed a big deal if you want to. That's a big deal. But as a Puerto Rican, if you do leave Louis, you have to twerk on your, I don't know if you watch those videos when people leave playing, they go fine. Oh fuck. They all used to work their way out. You will get put on a list for sure. If your asshole every time you fly on a plane. Well Lewis already has that problems.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       He flew my guessing. Do you think that they would probably check you if you decided I want off the plane right now and if you make a scene, pull the plane back into. They'd be like this guy, that's my [inaudible]. You don't think you're not gonna get off unless you make a scene. You won't get up once it's away from the gate. I'm talking about when they stay at the gate and they never actually pull away from like the a Yadda plane. You just hoping everyone can keep it together. Yeah. Hoping. Just hoping everyone can keep it together. What's your craziest playing experience? I hate, I hate flying and, and I've had plenty of weird ones. Two dudes [inaudible] almost get after it once on a plane over overhead space. This one guy was claiming the space overhead. There's only four or five arguments you could have on a plane over space.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       Middle person gets both armrests this one guy was on this side, right? But his shit was all filled up, so he opens up the bin on the other side and puts his bag in and sits down, and the guy who was behind him, that was his side. He goes, hey man, that's my storage space. He goes, no, it's not. He goes, it storage space. I put my bag in there first I was in, I was ahead of you. I put my bag in there. He's like, no, you have yours and I have mine and yours is full. And he goes to grab his shit and the guy goes, hey man, don't touch my fucking bag. Right. By the way, the guy who took the other source space, you don't have, it's not, it's not a personalized source space. Fuck off dude. It's just storage space on first-class.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       I wish one of those degenerate fucks from the back. We'll try to put some shit in my storage space. I flew first class one time. They almost went after it though. The, the waitress had to cut them off. She cut them up. We're in the air waitress, Joe, we're in the air and they're going at it again, so it's like wheat there. They were going at it when they were about, the plane was about to take off and then they got through it and then the air, they were going at it again. The waitress, the stewardess, she cuts them off. Wouldn't let them have alcohol, but it was tense, so it's like, you know, you have to keep an eye on. I was going to say like the whole time she fell with me, the lady made me, she's like, you're going to help me ride.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       I'm like, Jesus Christ lady. Anything's going to happen. Well, you see my girl, right? The woman behind me, as I was complaining, she was like, and I was like, I was like, yeah, you know. He was like, well, what do you want to do? I was like some orange juice and coffee, maybe a kind bar. That'd be nice. He goes, I should like loud enough for me to, she goes, just get him some orange juice, and I went and turned around and was like, mind your this lady. Shut the fuck up lady. These guys, those undercover dudes that are on planes or Marshall's air marshals, right? So if you're an air Marshall and you see these two, two guys getting after a little bit, just talking shit, grabbing bags, just shoot them Dickie to each other. Wendy move in because you don't want everybody to know you're an air Marshall.

Speaker 1:          00:35:33       You're like, they don't have a bomb. You guys gotta work this out like you fucking pussies are just going to push each other like you're not. You know you guys aren't terrorists. What am I doing here? Just a an architect and a fucking, if somebody wanted to have a fighter plane and give up their entire fucking, it's such a pain in the ass. What did you're going to deal with to get into a fist fight on a plane? I don't know how many different crimes it is. I have to, but they have to pull this fucking plane over. You are fucked dude. You have to really want to fight somebody in order to do that because you'll deal with a lot of shit, but you're going to get to that point plane. You're going to like one Tonomys they arrest you. You saw that lady smack her boyfriend in the head.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       The guy gets up, he's trying to leave and she throws the laptop and yeah, as as he's walking down the aisle. Yeah. All right. I didn't see who threw a laptop right there in the air. This is going to lady's screaming at their sewing laptop. Yeah. She's like, you ain't shit. He'll say she's fine if she catch her boyfriend cheating on the plane or something like that. Weird. But she got super loud and it became like a huge scene where everybody was listening to her, talking to him. It was like, oh my God, this is so crazy. I mean, when they were dragging the Asian guy out of the planes, one of the funniest videos of all time, I wanted to go home. He just wanted to go. He started chanting, I want to go home, but it was so sad. They would legitimately have to drag me out if they were trying to get me to give up my seat, they would have to drag me out of the plane.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       They can do that. Imagine thinking they could do that. We just got to grab you physically and take you off the show. Like come on, you're you're, you're on the plane. The plane's about to take off. We're going to grab you and just pull you out of there and [inaudible] I think they probably just settled with them. They probably just gave him a ton of money and said shut the fuck up. Because at what point it is your price. Find out what type of business they do have security. I mean what point does somebody wants to leave your private business? I'm sure it's within the, the, the contract that you fucking the terms of service for the ticket that they can do that. So you think so where the guy's already sitting down? Well he's saying no after they asked him to leave a lot of times, so I don't know what the law is. I mean if it's his ticket and he bought the ticket, you can just decide if you've got times of service. So ridiculous. Exactly. You're right Logan saying it's a terms of service. Dumb line. They can do anything they want. Anything they want. Well what happened is they got destroyed on social media for like weeks afterward and they apologized and we're like, we're changing our policy and [inaudible] don't even get me fucking started. Joe Starbucks or American Airlines says officially thank God that guy wasn't black.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       I fucking, I live in Harlem and the Starbucks in Harlem. I mean it looks like a bus depot. It's crazy. It's just lines of people just sitting there charging their cell phones, not ordering because they had their new policy is everyone that walks into customer, their customer says, what's the fucking all it happened because of one bad PR Philly, Philly. When these two black dudes would just trying to sit down and chill out at, at Starbucks and someone decided to remove them from the premises. Yeah, but look now take [inaudible] cause here's what happened. I know that you have opinions on all I'm saying, the Libertarian perspective, they might've been Dick. Starbucks might've been Dick's, but what I know is they, they asked them to leave. They called the cops. The cops weren't going to arrest them. The cops told them you have to leave and they still refuse to leave and then they didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       Then they let them go. They literally just cuffed him and took him to the station and they were like, we'll just charge him with any, they also tried to order four loco, so they were out. But here's what I know. I know that we don't know what happened. Yes, no, I agree with that completely. You don't know. It was a human interaction. You don't know who the con was there. It could've been them. It could've been the person worked. I know what fucking happened, but I know exactly what happened. Things happened. These two guys walked in, they didn't buy anything. They were like, Oh yeah, you guys gotta buy something. They were like, no, we don't. They're like, well, you got to leave that. And they're like, no, we don't. And it was just weird. A little Mexican standoff between a fucking dumb idiot Starbucks employee and two dummy days.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       It wouldn't leave a Starbucks. Well, here's the deal. Here's the screening was around Mexican standoff between blacks and some Chinese. Do you think that the influx of homeless people is bad for their business? Do you think it's hurting business at all? Absolutely. I mean, I imagine like that one move from that one store, if the wings of the butterfly from that one little incident creates like a a dip in the value of the company. I feel like people wouldn't want to hang out there as long and you probably buy more shit if you like stay there. There's probably people who go up online a couple times if they're there, you know? Right, and you don't want to write your script on your laptop while a guy shitting his pants next to you. I know we're four morons, but let's solve this. Like why are there, why are there so many homeless people and what could be done? I think that's a real tough area. That's like the thing that they used to do is just institutionalize them. Right. Just fucking grab them and throw them and there's some problems with that for sure. But who decides who's worthy of being institutionalized and you know, we get hunt them at night, like Nutria at night. Here's there. They just go around with the thinking of the shooting. I didn't tell you that on his show. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       you wouldn't do trio hunting. Yeah, it's bad out here man in New York. But you guys got real bad here. You ain't seen shit until you go downtown. Downtown la makes everything. If post up pass every underpass in La, now you're, you're subject to see tents. They're all over the place. All over through the valley. Homeless people in La and New York are pretty friendly though. They're not, they're not that aggressive. I was in Seattle. Those fuckers who will come up to you and they will go at you. They want like [inaudible] give them money. They will like give you an attitude about it everywhere else too. Like a Cleveland horrible homeless, like every other city besides San Fran, like yeah. Really. It's like the aggressive shit. The Canadian homeless are the shittiest and most aggressive where a kid, what not. Like this was around when we, when we were kids, you would see those boxes on the side of the road and it was usually someone who is so fucked up that you know, they, they just couldn't go anywhere and they'd have a box and they used, smelled like shit and they were covered up.

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       But we're seeing like different levels. You grow up suburban. Yeah. [inaudible] I grew up in Brooklyn. I saw homeless people all the time, but I never saw anything and I haven't seen it in person, but I've never seen anything like the camps and stuff that I've seen. That's insane. Yeah. That's the new thing. Yeah, that's what's new. It's like the underpasses too. When I, when I first started coming here in 94 there was never any tents on the underpasses, at least I don't remember that being, I think now there's like almost some people think it's cool. I live in east village, New York and there is so many just kids that you're like, you're a phone call away from like solving this problem. You kind of want to be out here like that. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       just like there. It's literally like some the heroin kids, they all like punk rockers, 20 year old, 19 year old white kids who are clearly on out just like 20 though. [inaudible] that's what I'm saying. Big Kids. They're a fomo bustle. I bet. I bet you those kids are from really, really fucked up situations at home and around the drugs and some, I think more often than not they're probably dealing with the fucked up shit at home. You don't end up on the streets to to you know, rebel against your mom. You're good. Mom and dad, most of the time I'm sure it happened also watching a guy like you know who just looks like a as Crotty is homeless can be like charging his phone on one of those stations is pretty flick. Everyone just doesn't, where's your address for bill? Yeah. How is this?

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Do you have that too? Yeah. Who's billing has Verizon get you the bill every month, prepaid phones anymore. [inaudible] New York is on every corner now. They have like a big station, right? And on that station you could do literally free phone calls. You could just dial a number. It's a speaker phone, phone call. You could charge your phone and it has like a Wifi station. So everyone on the street has wifi in New York and you're like, this is a great idea. Except now there's always a homeless person literally plugged into it. And that's now their power source for their little homeless thing. They were jerking off outside. They had to take the screens off the screens off. There was about a week after they came out where you'd see regular people using them and now it's only homeless people like nobody else touches them. If you had a look at a graph of all the crimes that were committed using burner phones, like seven 11 burner phones, like how many seven 11 burner phones are used by poor people and how many of them are used to commit crimes like serious espionage between like Liz [inaudible], international spies, fucking giant international crime tool that goes unreported burner phones like seven 11 burner phones.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       We get it. It's in the plastic. You pop it open, it's got an hour in it. Fuck. Who the fuck is using those things? Some of them are poor people. It's getting, I think it's getting more and more exclusively criminal. Even pulls like leaving their planes. Just like leaving an airplane. If you buy a seven 11 phone, you're on a list. Well, you could go to like Verizon and get a bottom of the line phone that's affordable. That's better than anything that existed like five years ago. Like where technology is now. You don't have to spend like, what's a cheap, what's a cheap android phone? If you were going to [inaudible] at your pcs right now, get a free android phone sign up for $40. Right? And then you're out, you're out the door and then you never have to pay it again because it's prepaid. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       So you just have a certain amount of minutes, right? Well no, it's unlimited. I have, I have metro pcs guys and I uh, if you're homeless, you make fun of me. Do you have the general insurance to you? Just do everything. It's a phone call. So as online rights online, I get everything unlimited fuck off. I don't understand why I would ever switch besides for the fact that my friends make fun of me. I'll sell your phone works in places. It works everywhere. You're doing some sort of a roaming thing, I guess. No, there's no roaming. There's no overture over, just nothing. It's just better. There's, it really sounds like we're doing a fucking ad read of parametric pts right now. It's one of the UFC sponsors. But people make fun of you like your hot garbage and then not tell people the truth. Cause you screenshot everything.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Anytime I screened some shots on that. It says Metro pcs in the corner. Tampons, pictures, Instagram, scratch down. Put boost mobile makes it that much better. Mobile. Even if they're great, they're embarrassing. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Even if they're great. It's embarrassing that it's great. Like I think Hyundai has a problem with these new cars that they're making. So they started calling them the genesis. They started calling them Hyundai's cause people are like no, no Hyundai Hyundai's that car that costs, it's real cheap but it runs forever. That's a Hyundai. There's no, no, no Hyundai's luxury. We've got this, lighten that up. Nope. Nope. Can't have both. Yeah, they got handed. Yeah. Make sure pcs, even if it's the best service, you know like the, the, the problem is like anytime anything is a bargain, even if it really is a great deal and metro pcs seems like a great deal.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       It is. It does. Anytime with things that bargain, people don't want it. Like some people want the shit that costs a lot and it's hard to get. And when I was a kid, I remember I would, I just wouldn't get sneakers that weren't like Nike's or like, yeah, it even for they were comfortable sneakers. Even if they were more expensive. Yeah. It didn't matter. This kind of like a loser. I felt the fucking idiot. You got home every day like a rebel. If you want Adidas Grocery store sneakers, I don't give a shit now. It's funny how important it is when you're younger though. It's very important because anything that could get you just ridiculed when you were young you had to be always conscious of like you had to always be aware of what could fuck up your day. There's not enough of a delineation between shitty stuff and like the mid range stuff, but I think like high end stuff tends to be like better quality and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       She's always shown that with clothing and stuff or like my ex wife I remember always was talking about per how much you spend on a purse, which I said is ridiculous and she goes put, it lasts forever and to some degree I still think it's ridiculous to do that. For a purse, but my point is paying for the quality like does last longer. It's better things are made better Smith. But the difference between like a knock off fucking Louis Vuitton bag and like a bag you'd buy in like a store. It's like not much difference. It's not like a fake Ferrari. There's a huge difference between those bags I think. I don't remember seeing a thing. My Dad, my dad used to base it in the fashion moms are like the stitching. I mean like I did a check, it was a fashion check. Yeah, there's definitely a huge difference in those bags.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Yeah. Yeah. I'm agreeing. I said, but like high end and I'm saying, but I'm just saying the difference between like this one you'd buy it like JC penny versus like a shitty one you'd buy on the street. There's not much difference in quality in that you might as well as buy the fake Louis Vuitton if you are a kid and you didn't have like a good name brand sneaker, you were shamed Bobos yeah, they call them the Bobo. I Voight's. I remember when I was in the sixth grade, they were voids and there was, that was the last shitty sneaker I ever had. It was just vo I t got them at ch warns, which was this, I mean, as Shitty of a department store as you could possibly get and a kids would just make fun of your shitty sneakers. It was terrible. I had lottos.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       I had lottos that had velcro on the side that you could change the lotto symbol. Different colors, like a fat fucking cheerleader. I was dressed like a cheerleader. The change, the cohorts go my school spirit. If you are, if you are like a runner, maybe get away with new balance. Yeah. There were people wore new balance when I was in high school. I feel like that was like, okay, it's okay. You're alternative you, it's a good quality shoe. Okay. Marvin Hagler used to wear them like at a six gels. People thought you had an arch problem or you were a wrestler. [inaudible] he's, Oh yeah. 86 wrestling shoes. By the time high school came around, I knew I knew well enough to just change my style, so I'd saw her on like air walks and like those shitty like skaters. They were like 45 bucks a pop.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       Good move. Yeah. That was very smarter. So it was a big Genco Jean Guy. Converse, chucks never went out of style. Right. They never went out of style. Also never been comfortable. Loved them. You think they're comfortable? I have them, but I like, they're not comfortable. I don't want smooshy. I don't like smooshy shoes that much. Sometimes I do, but most of the times I like it where it's very, it's very little rubber. That's all it is. It's like you may imagine that those guys played basketball and those things back in the day. It's kind of crazy. Yeah, that's weird. It seemed like a lot of support, but maybe that's that they had stronger ankles that way or something. My mom tried to convince me that Chuck's were cool and she was right. This was when I was in the sixth grade. Oh, they weren't? It wasn't.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       No. This was when Chuck's had the, you know, Congress was at the absolute bottom. They fucking, there's not that happened. Here's the thing, it's cool again, but it's not, I think I feel like Chuck Taylor, 27 bucks. I feel like Chuck Taylors were always in style. A little converse. Like just as a general brown. If you had to just converse sneakers, dude, you look like a jerk off quicker. You're definitely your family better be Porsche. I have other problems like with your pants and shirt before we even get to those [inaudible] sneakers if you're wearing [inaudible] time, but that period of time is gone. Right? They, they, they have the dope leather and Suede ones. They have all kinds of different, what's that guy that now it's like the look now it's like the, so if someone makes feel us back somehow. Tongue feelers in the back for kids.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       Yeah. Like for kids is their one, we don't know. We're so out of the loop, but is there one brand that's like, is it still Nike? Like what is Nike and Jordan? My daughter is 17 so yeah, that's still still, yeah. Yeah. Nike is my cake timberlands. My kid has, sure. Yeah. If it's, if it's boots at the timberline gotta be like the most successful sneaker campaign in the history of the known university. Yeah. Without a doubt. There's nothing that has the kind of cache as Jordan. The only thing I'd say maybe probably that sells more than the Jordan is the Air Force One. But their per unit cheaper though, right? That's no. Michael Jordan, Nike, Nike Air Force One. I think of him now. Now the air force ones are the bottlers at their basic. Yeah. Doesn't the Air Force One have a dude flying through the air?

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       Duncan? No, that's just the Jordans. I'm so white. Nike's are fucking uncomfortable. Every time I wear Nike, they hurt my feet. Like a feat to Vegas to Vegas statement. These are uh, what are these? You're in the skate shoes, right? Minimalist sort of. Yeah. There we go. So the flexible, I love shoes. Yeah. Yeah. And then I wear new balance. I wonder balance a lot. Yeah. Like an old white guy. Yeah. That's a wide foot shoe. Yeah. You take a bold risk when you wear those five finger shoes, even though they're good for you. Oh, those, those good. I've never showed a pair on there to walk around in life though, or just at the gym. My friend Kyle Kingsbury does it, but he was also life. He's also a gorilla. He's an enormous guy, so he's daring you to say that or he's going to climb a tree.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Super Nice Guy, but he's a former UFC fighter. Super Nice guy and wears those fucking five finger shoes. Kyle on Instagram. He's hilarious. He's great. Great, great to call. Is He a white guy? Yeah, I say that only there was a thing. I saw a clarity ring girl. Right? What's her name? Tasha smoking. There was a clip the other week. You have two guys, two black guys at a tow truck company, I think it is that start filming this white guy that called them gorillas and as he fell, but the white guy backing down as they're coming at him and it's so funny why this guy would have said this. Like, I almost believed the white guy's excuse, but he has lost cause he was, I guess he said something like, have one of these two gorillas, bring it around. And he definitely met there, big guys. So he definitely kind of made it like that, but it just doesn't look good.

Speaker 1:          00:52:26       So him explaining like, you called me and my black friends here, girl, he's like, no, I mentally strong gut. But he just goes out and I'm a strong guy. She goes, my dentist is a black fella. He just starts giving. So now he goes, now that's where you're going. Wrong brothers talking about y'all. Dentists being blessed tend to mailman's a black fella. He comes way too far removed. That's not even I hive high five Tim several times. I don't even believe them until later. Yes, I do. Sweet. So wheat. So, uh, I saw the thing where Milo said you guys cooked out on the show the first time. That's why we're going hard on new balances this time. It was worth it to have already went already said fuck you to all three of us was the hardest. I laughed and [inaudible] fucking fucking national treasure.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       National Dude Orients Gang fasted, rich vos and Bonnie Mcfarlane do a show where they, they, it's cold. You Bang him and they have like four or five female comedians on stage and then a male comedian comes out and does a set at the end of it, the girls have to decide whether or not they would fucking base off of, you know, a multitude of things and the set, right. So Ari does his, he just gets naked. It's like literally take his clothes. I was like, oh, it is set naked. And then he starts chasing the female Korean comedians around the stage with his Dick and trying to happen, hold on, listen, listen. Before you say anything more, but just be aware that other people are going to listen to this. Yeah. People are listening. He's like, got it. Then he held her down against her will.

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       Then no, this isn't for this on camera. This is not unknown. That was all, it was all part of the theatrical performance. So it was planned and agreed to and consented in advance cabaret. So he's chasing, he's chasing these girls around and really wink, wink, nudge, nudge. He could catch them if he was really chased. Obviously he's a man or a woman likes, oh my goodness. He's chasing them around the stage with his Dick and Louis C K is, they're watching from the sidelines and he goes, I'm the problem. I think it did a lot to let Louis know he was in a safe space. That was okay. Here. There's a lot here. A lot of people gather their panties in a bunch when a, no pun intended. When he went on stage. Oh yeah dude, his set was fucking killing the, they're so happy to see him, man.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       Man, I'm, I mean people outside of the people that were there. Some people never, I mean maybe they feel that the guy didn't do what they wanted him to do, but I mean how long do you want someone to suffer? Well, the bomber is also the venue saying that like their workers were like afraid to stop it or do anything about it and that they were upset and it's like me walk through word static. They don't have to say that they were jumping around. They didn't throw, because a business doesn't need to have an opinion. They could just not say anything for two days. Nobody was going after this venue and going like, oh, you need to release a statement. Nobody gave a fuck. Here's the thing is those people are Tori for businesses. But to understand that the, the idea of reacting to a journalist is not new, but the idea of reacting to thousands and thousands of people make comments on your Instagram page that is new.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       And for a business that's, you know, that that's a big deal. They, they, they're worried about being boycott, but that's not what happened. But the people who are pissed off that Louise there, those people will not like, they will boycott, they will tweet every day. They, their thing is to try to ruin someone for, you know, committing a like woke crime or whatever and there, so that's what they deal with is that people like us who are like, ah, that sucks that they fucking wrote that letter. We don't do anything. We're not boycotting because they wrote that letter. We're not like the, the other side isn't putting as much pressure on them. And that's why all of these companies, that's why Gillette's making those razor commercials and shit cause they're scared of that side. You see the Gillette Razor commercial? Where the, is it the Gillette one where the two firemen kiss? I don't think, I don't think I said that. That will the cross [inaudible] Army National Guard. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       two firemen. I wrote it down shit commercial with who are you going for? Like do they do gay guys are gonna go, you know what, we want to fight fires now. But it was like, I get it, you're progressive. It's like these, this God damn it. I wanna know what the commercial offensive though, isn't it like, dude, if you buy into that like, like, oh my God, I'm so happy this company is, is, is woken you just a mark. They're just taking advantage of you. They're just trying to make money off of you sorta. But it's also hot. This is like a hot firemen and [inaudible] friend and they're making out and they, you know, the guy comes back from a fire and he's ready to get some Dick, right? Yeah. Holla. It looks fun. It's a hero. As long as that lesbians, they're trying to sell you insurance or whatever the fuck they're selling.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       I don't remember who did the commercial, but I remember saying, oh, okay, we're being progressive. I love it. Why not? I don't give a shit. Go for it. I just find it weird. I find it strange, the woke capitalism thing that people, that companies will take a position that you think would turn off like 50% of the people who buy from them. They do it to prove they're there. I don't know. Goodness, but it doesn't hurt. Does it hurt? Like does anybody go, Fuck Blue Cross, I'm getting my fucking insurance from Spanish, broad, whatever. Whatever the cheapest option is. They're buying that. It's like the equinox thing that just happened. Nobody's fucking leaving equinox. Let me tell you something. There's no other option. It's convenient. You got your fucking gym membership. A handful of people are virtue signaling, but all the people complaining saying, boycott Equinox on line.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       They're not fucking equinox members, so they're fucking fat. [inaudible] cod equinox, Steven or one of the owners was a Trump supporter. He gave him money. Oh, that's right. He held a fundraiser last week for Trump. So people were freaking out saying to boycott the brand, but it's like, where else are you going to go? There's not another high end gym that's all over the place like that. Do you know the phrase on the exact same political beliefs? Weird runs a business? Like if I go to, if I go to buy a sandwich, do I have to go like, so where were you on the Iraq war? No. Okay. Let me check about this. A company that praise on your laziness is the insurance that you get through. Like Sag-aftra. They like it's, you know, you get it for free if you qualify and then when you don't qualify for it, you're still enrolled in it and it's like the most expensive insurance.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       Does that make sense? You know what I mean? Like, and they kind of praying that kind of got me almost in that way where a year where I, it wasn't taken care of. I was like, well, I don't want to switch out and then have any doctors saying, you know what I mean? Like we should be different. So they kind of get you like that to this Trump thing is if you support anything that he does, even just as business practices, then you're racist. Like everything that you support, if he supports it, you're racist. Yeah, that's crazy. You're, you're a Nazi, you're racist. And when somebody calls you a racist or a Nazi, even people that don't believe that, they don't want to stand with you and defend you because then they're being perceived as defending a racist or a Nazi. And it's a trick and it's very effective.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       It was a juicy soap opera. I don't know why this guy supports Trump, but maybe he could explain it. Right. And he's a real estate guy. He's a big real estate guy, related properties. It has nothing to do with this gym. Okay. This has to do with the fact that he probably has real estate deals for a very, very long time with Trump and his, his, his gym is inconsequential compared to the billion dollar company that he runs. Well that makes sense then. That makes sense why he would support Trump, especially if he knows Trump, but it's uh, if you, you can't see that. I mean if you have a problem with that and many people would, right. Many people would have a problem with that. Like that's a different thing. But if you, if you, if you hear what people are saying, they're saying if you support Trump that you support racist.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       So you support white nationalists. You put, and I think you're leaving so many people out of the conversation when you do that. Oh yeah. I mean the guy got, what was it, 62 million people to vote for him. So if you're saying anyone who supports him is some type of Nazi white nationalists, then we got bigger problems. Definitely break up. No one knows definition of those things anymore. When my, we used to be about Milo when he came up to the things he was called that just like, yeah, on paper couldn't even apply to B, right. Would never be accepted into being a Nazi or a white supremacy. Do you guys remember when we were kids, we read about McCarthyism and the red scare. We only always thought like, God, we're past that. That kind of Shit's never going to happen again. But what that is is like a symptom of people worried about people defecting from their tribe or turning on their tribe.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       And we have this like built in fear of this kind of shit happening. Well, there's that aspect to it, right? It's the people who are worried about people defecting and then you have the opportunists who can play off that instead of having a win an argument or having to, you know, like convince people, I'm just going to say, you're with the other tribe. You're in this bad group so you're don't even talk to that person anymore. Don't even listen to what they have to say. And if you're in some tribe on every issue, you're a fucking adult. I was going to say, why do you have to be so defined by your choice? You know what I mean? Like I would love to hear the argument about the, the what, what it does good for him for his real estate ventures. I would love to hear it like an honestly laid out argument of why someone like Trump's better.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       If you're a real estate developer and it might be a significant part of his business. I'm like, I'm not being an apologist. People all people also will just like, there's this weird thing where people, people think that business owners and people that make a lot of money are inherently bad, but it's like, I don't know dude. Just cause somebody who's really good and really successful. He's got kids, he wants to feed, he has grandkids. He wants to watch, grow up and go to college. It's like, I dunno, I don't think this isn't necessarily just bad people that have a lot of money. I think that there's a lot of good people that have a lot of money as well. And I think they do a lot of good shit. Well, I'll just, you know, whenever someone gets really upset about an issue, you always have to wonder like how much of it going in there was, I mean, what, what is upsetting to you is upsetting to that.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       Anyone who supports Trump, like Trump rep represents all the things that are wrong with America today in terms of like white nationalists and terrorist attacks and mass shootings and, and, and, and massage and keeping the massage. They keeping the immigrants out and being mean and being in America first like, fuck, it's, uh, it's one of those things today where if you, if you support any part of that, any part of, even if it's good for your business, you're just a magnet for fucking people who are angry at all the things that whole list chick-fil-a, McDonald's like, yeah, man, epic businesses, successful businesses, lightbulbs numbers, crazy, right? People, electricity diseases. A lot of big businesses support Trump, but it's so weird how people like project their own thing. Onto the situation. Cause even like that, you just said like what everyone hates about Trump, but the people who support Trump, they're not even on the other side of those issues.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       It's not like they're like, no, we are pro white nationalists. They just see him as a completely different thing. They're like making the country great and jobs and draining the swamp and all these other things. Like they f people are looking at the same thing and seeing very different realities. Yeah. Yeah they are. And people are going in with their preconceived bias and getting them confirmed, you know, with everything. I mean, even the way you looked at the Mueller report, like the Republicans looked at it as a victory and the Democrats looked at as some sort of a like a, an open door to impeachment. Yeah. But that was, I don't know if fucking, if the thing starts off with, uh, every day you're hearing on the news that the president is colluding with a hostile foreign power. He's a Russian puppet. He's working with Vladimir Putin and then by the Andrew, like we have to impeach him because he thought about obstructing the investigation that he was declared not guilty.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       And it's like, ah, this is getting weird. You guys were going to be upset no matter what you found a hundred percent Dave loves Trump. It's dating. I'm trying to say. Sounds like he does. He goes, Trump, I'm going hard Nazi this time and I'm not coming back on the show. I'm going hard this time. It's the fucked up part is only having really two choices. Like we're scrambling to see who's choice number two, who's going to be the one that opposes Trump? And you've seen people starting to crack under pressure or [inaudible] like re-entry pressure. [inaudible] they're trying to figure out who's going to be [inaudible]. Maybe. Imagine. Imagine we all get doubted him.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       It gets through and becomes president won't be fucked. When you look at the people that are in line though, does anybody stand out that you would think that would be able to, I don't, I don't know how much of a realistic shot, but who I uh, I love Tulsa Gab and I sent her money twice already and I disagree with her on like 80% of her shit. She was real interesting person. She very, she really is. And her, she's dead on about the war stuff and she's, you know, yeah. About Medicare. Um, she, she's dead on about a lot of things. She's kind of hot. Fuck yeah. Dave didn't agree with something that Medicare, no, I don't like her medicare stuff, but I do like a, the most important thing that she leads with is the war stuff. And she's, she's got a great position where she's like, did two tours in Iraq.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       She's still active duty. And so, you know, like the, the normal like comeback is like, oh, you're against the wars. It's like, well, you're just kind of a wimp or you're, you wouldn't want to protect the country. And she's like, no asshole. I actually went, I'm the one who's willing to go die for this and I'm telling you we shouldn't be dying for this. And what did she do? What was her job over there though? Oh she was, it was serious. She was like in a medical unit so she was like dealing with the people who actually [inaudible] a tree though. She was making practice. She cr the results of edge. It was the edge of tomorrow to Tom Cruise. It was her job to clean up the DVDs. That's a hot subject, right? Women in combat. Yeah. I got a bunch of shit about st making jokes about saying I don't understand what a girl, I watched the show cops a lot and I don't understand what a good girl cop has ever done in a situation.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       It's hostile except for make the, the perp get much more hurt. Shot or tased because she's in the way of it happening and people got really upset about me saying that but it really, I don't understand why you'd send like a woman to a major fight happening at the mall. Get down there ladies. It really is like a puzzle. The physical PR with some cops, the physical aspect of an altercation is like, it's going to be a real problem with plenty of guys. Plenty. You got cops, the female thing, you can just say you can't have 110 pound person. Go and be the physical authority in a situation. That element, I'm going to call you a chick officer chick. Here's a terrible video of this guy getting pulled over by this lady and his daughter's in the car and the guy was a criminal apparently, and the cop was calling in and the guy punches her and gets her down on the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       She knocks her out, coats it all video. Yeah. And starts punching her face and while she and the daughter screaming, stop it Daddy, stop it daddy. And he beats the fuck out of this lady car. And you're like, this is why it's problem. This lady cops by herself and she's got a gun, but she doesn't have the gun out of the holster polling at the guy. She's, it's a routine traffic stop and that guy pummels her man. It's horrible. Yeah, it's a really shit and me saying the idea's not like fuck chicks. I'm just like, don't send them out to get hurt in the suits. I don't understand why it's not necessarily as your daughter and you saw your daughter beaten. Oh my God. Because someone thought it was okay for her to be by herself amongst, you know, big giant criminals. Typically they don't match up female cops though. Right? I'm assuming most of the time they put a girl by herself. [inaudible] you can be on patrol by yourself lives just like walking around the neighborhood or something for sure. But I've seen videos where it's like a dude and a chick partners and the cop gets in a fight with another guy and it's basically just two men fighting with this woman kind of grabbing an arm here or there and it's almost a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       She might try to hit the guy with a brick and hit you. That would be boring and Mace it herself. But there's a lot of men that would fall apart in that job too. Yeah, sure. Oh definitely. Definitely. I've seen, I think any small, whether it's a woman or a man, any person who's, you know, not a large person who's not physically strong is by themselves as a cop. It's in danger. Any one, doesn't matter if you're male or you're 150 pound male, same deal. You're in trouble unless you're really good martial artists who can grab a gun, quickly, know how to respond to pressure. [inaudible] 99% of women, I could take a gun right out of their hands. I have no, I have no training, but like give me your check. You can point a gun right at my head. But that said time, I'm fucking taking it and putting it right back at her.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       That said, I should make clear that I myself, I know where I'm nowhere near as tough as I think you should. You should need to be to be a cop. Oh yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like I would never assume that of myself either. So I'm not like saying, dude, I've been doing martial arts my whole life. I wouldn't want to be a cop. I don't want to be a cop. It's a crazy situation. It's hard. It's a hard job. It's dangerous. You're supposed to have to be brave. Well not only that man. Do you know how much PTSD those guys are dealing with that is unrecognized. If every day you're pulling people over, that might shoot you. Every day you're dealing with someone who's robbing something or stealing something or trying to kill somebody or did kill somebody every fucking day. You're going to see a lot of cops ain't doing shit though.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       Some of them are. But look, you are wearing a uniform that makes you the enemy. You're also the person with power and you've got to realize how fucking corrupt that is that you're able to yell at people and force people in these situations and cuff them and fuck with them and you've got no window. Just gentle public like nastiness because they can guys what you guys do, here's their way. I get a personal way. If you're just blocking their path where a normal person would go, excuse me guys, because they're where the walk guys walk cause it turns out, oh shit. But sometimes they don't have t luckily benefit of the doubt right there. They're in Times Square. They're dealing with a lot of people. There's just not time for the [inaudible] circumstances I'm talking about in just a thing like that. The same way they put on their lights to go through a red light just to get, cause they don't want to wait at the opportunistic like that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       Of course it's shower beings. Human beings don't do well with authority mixed with impunity. So like a cop can say that to you and nothing happens to them if there's no repercussions and you have power 10 [inaudible] Guy Jimmy justice. I had a job as a security guard for a brief moment in time when I was like 19 years old and there was an us versus them mentality between the security and the people with the concert goers. That was clearly evident. One of the first days I was working there, this guy, his name was Allie cat, so to brand security and some dude had stole one of the golf cards, so the golf card, one of them electric golf carts for security. So they tackled this dude off the golf cart and he smashes him in the head with a fucking walkie talkie. It's like a crazy fight with some drunk asshole who's like violet and stole a golf cart. Uh, that was like the first day, their first or second day there on the job. I was like, oh, okay. So this is what's going on. And it became people trying to sneak booze, integrate woods and then us. And then so it was this us versus them mentality and everybody was lying to you. And that was the silliest job. I'm doing security at a fucking bill Cosby show. Literally, I was doing security. I was taking people's boobs and you know, what did you let happen?

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       You could have stepped in and sucked them talking about falling asleep on the job. Hilarious. It's such a, you know, it's such a simple little job. It's easy. There's no criminals there. There's no bank robbers. There is no murders there. That little situation of us versus them with the liquor and them trying to smuggle in pot and liquor. Just that led to this huge fucking rift between the security people and the way they thought was funny because it's too much of a human emotion in it. That's something that should be a job because even if you don't care if people, when you're not working, you're trying to get beer and weed into a concert. It's just that these are your opponents right now and they're trying to fuck with you. Even though some of you were like, you go like, I don't care if you guys smoke weed.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       You're like, no, but I have to say you can't smoke weed and then when they do it anyway, like I just fucking said, you can't smoke weed. It's like testing your manhood almost. It's a too much human emotion in there versus on Netflix. I can't, I bet that experiment will college was that. It's like a famous story. It's Princeton, the Princeton prison or no, Stanford. I'm still going to Stanford prison experiment. You know, I read something debunking the, yeah, they said the methodology was all wrong on it or something like it's not a legit study. They also said that people were doing things just to end the study quickly because they wanted to go home. We did that in the movie though. They broke that down. They showed that side of it where they were like the, they said, I guess the guy who made the experiment said, yeah, it's a wash.

Speaker 1:          01:13:16       The end of it was like, it wasn't actually good data, but it was interesting and I do believe that Stanford was the Stanford prison experiment. Students pretended to be some pretend to be criminals, San Pitocin, and they started getting cars to power positions. Got I came up. The interesting things is that the professor becomes like the warden, he gets into it too, like they cut that, they show, they got it on video and stuff and he's like walking around with his chest out and he's all in. It's just people get, they fall into these roles, into these camps and the authority goes to people's head. It may, it creates a weird dynamic about how many dickhead cops people have met. Right. That's just a thing that happens, but it also makes it very nice when you run into friendly cops. Well, that's trout. What a good dude.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       It's almost like training the human interaction so they're there when they act like a Dick and people act a certain way and they move and they get a little bit nervous. It's like, oh, that's like intoxicating and they're like, all right, that feels good. That power right there said about no repercussions for your behavior, the way you talking with d. You could just do that with impunity. That's, you just nailed it. That's exactly what it is. That's not a normal situation for people. That's all. I mean it's state verse business. If he asked, here we go. You walk into some, my Gosh, look, if you walk into the apple store or you, they can't do that because you're a voluntary customer, so if they treat you the wrong way, there's a repercussion right there. You're like, well, I'll walk out here dark stores with the black dudes.

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       How their homeless camps now [inaudible] at least they're not shooting people, but cell phones has become the great equalizer because now you see cops there, they're on it walking on eggshells. Dude, pay out their cell phones now and they're like, what up bitch ass pussy cop and the cops like, well I guess I'm a bitch ass pussy. You see the [inaudible] is the battery runs out on that cell phone. I'm going to shoot you in the stomach. Dude. Did you see the video in New York where they're throwing water on the cops and the cops just aren't doing shit? I Dunno. I think it was. It might've been in Harlem. I say, isn't it like a black neighborhood in New York? They're dumping water on the cops and everyone's got a cell phone camera on them and you know, in any other period of time or today beating the shit out of everyone. They're throwing water balloons at him and shit and they're just sitting there like, we know I'm going to be in the news tomorrow. I'm going to be, you know what I mean? Like I'll be a famous, that cop definitely goes home that night and like shadow above with two nightsticks just practicing like the last dragon fight that he was in that day. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       she had a box for two hours of homeowners. Pour water on me. Here's some water for you. [inaudible] a lot of them have been on the forest for 15 years, 20 years today. They've just been doing things a certain way for so long and I'm so close to [inaudible]. Do you guys ever see the seven five Oh yeah. Excellent. [inaudible] you interviewed Him Dad. Yeah, he's is he likable? Yeah. Very nice guy. What's his name? Michael Dowd. Is that my clo doubt? Michael Dowd. I didn't see it. It's an excellent documentary. It's doubt. Doubt, doubt. Yeah. You know, he's great. He's a really nice guy and he's super open and honest about what happened in the documentary. He's fucking compelling shit. And you realize that. How much of it was true when I think he's not remorseful at all. What I find, that's where I find unlikable. He's not remorseful.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       I think he's remorseful. He just look, he just has that voice just doing coke all day long, every day as a cop and you know, making all this money and driving a corvette. He was out of control and he was on the, uh, the area where he was the 75th precinct, I think it's east New York, Brooklyn at the height of like the New York. This was like the murder neighborhood capitol. Like it was, it was a wild team were in the chain of shove a lot of those murders. That's what I think is like crazy. But like they were never, they were never convicted of a murder. Right. And there was no, admittedly that he was cuddled. He's like, let me, of course, like talk about doing one right. Yeah, never happened. The whole thing is crazy, but what it tells you, I mean forget about pers are judgments on, you know, the people that were in it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       What it tells you is that this can happen to someone who just becomes a cop. You get on the force. If it's a bad force word like it was at the time with him and he seen corruption from day one. I mean, it was just like he was roped into it. Like right away, when you listen to his story, it's pretty fucking compelling. This is like the first day on the job, like something happened. They threw a guy off a building or something like that, but took it personally. I don't remember. Yeah, but it was, and then there's just that personality chart that you could take. Yup. You're like, I can just have them. No one will know there's 50 gs here. I could just take this home. And they're like, oh, we didn't find anything. It's very easy. It's very telling of the personality.

Speaker 1:          01:17:50       That becomes a cop though, because they're not even worried that people are getting, it's amazing that no one whistleblowers so much earlier than that because one person comes in and goes, no guys, we're supposed to be fucking believing in this badge and what we, you know what I mean? No. They all go, what are we doing? We good cups are bad cups. He goes, ever Robyn? Drug dealers like, alright man, I still do that with the guys. She said, we'll do that. I got a phone call and lost this fight though. So I don't think that, honestly, to be honest, I have almost no problem with cops skimming off the top from drug dealer money. What do you want me to fucking say? We're just giving it to the government. Why does the government get to have the money and these cops who are putting their wives, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Not if they're arresting people for drugs. Yeah. Look, if you're going to do that and you're going to just ignore everyone else who selling coke. Okay, but if you're going to do that and arrest people for selling coke, then you're a criminal, then you're like arrested. Yeah, that's, that's the repercussion. I don't have a, almost a moral issue with it. If say if he found $50,000 only reported 40,000 put $10,000 in his pocket, brought her home to his wife and kids, I don't really have a moral issue with that. If he brought it home to just fucking pay for is backed up like porn bill or something because we just brought him the fuck around Jay. They won't let you go that long if you want to get reinstated, there's fees. If he got arrested, I wouldn't go, Oh, poor fucking guy. I go, yeah dude, that's the price you pay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       You committed a crime that that, but from my personal perspective, I don't think he's a piece of shit. I don't think he's a bad person. I think it's probably stupid if he doesn't look the cycle of people and drugs is never ending. It will go on to the end of time. The cycle of making drugs illegal and propping up gigantic criminal enterprises because of that is also as old as we've had laws. As long as we've had laws, vet people breaking those laws. And if those laws exist because someone wants to control people's behavior in a way that people don't want, folks are going to find a work around. But no drugs are [inaudible] empowers the Mexican cartels right now. And some Mexican cartels are a huge source of, of fear for people that live in the border towns is a huge source of fear for people that are forced to be in communities and it's propped up because drugs are illegal.

Speaker 1:          01:19:57       Nobody seems to want to recognize that. It's one of those ugly things about being a human that like people want drugs and you can't tell them they can't have what they want. Yeah. Especially since immigration became such a huge thing that everyone's talking about and that's like the biggest part of it that no one talks about. It's like the violence and it's like, well there's people on this side of this line who want the drugs. There's people on this side of the line who have the drugs and even with all the shit you're doing, they're still trading them to each other. So do you really think maybe we should just let them do it? We're in, but here's the thing. We don't want anybody to do it rightly so. I mean, look, we know you don't want anybody run around doing heroin. Nobody gets through that and goes, it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:20:36       It was my best, one of my best moments in life was when I was addicted to heroin. Yeah. But even if you do it one time, I bet it's pretty fucking dope. It's amazing. Just one hard too to let it go. Once you've experienced it, it's probably fucking incredible. Lenny Bruce had some crazy description of it, about something about being hugged by an angel or something like that. Michael Stephano, who died a few years ago, New York comic had a joke. He was like, he was like, you know, great heroin is, it's like taking a bath in a pool full of kittens.

Speaker 1:          01:21:04       Metzker Metzker had that joke about it where he says, uh, when the families of people go, he goes, I don't understand why he would do heroin. He's got a family that loves him and kids who look up to them and love him, like, why would he do heroin? He goes, oh, I want to tell that family like you're just so close to the answer. Heroin is better than all those things. That is hilarious. Yeah, but I mean, I don't think people should do it, but if you make it illegal, it's not, they're not going to stop doing it. The question would be, would people do more of it if it was legal, if you could just go to a drug store the same way you go to a liquor store and the drug store was actually a drug store where you could just go buy coke and they might, well, look in La, I do think more people are smoking weed for sure. Since we became legal like I, that'd be my guess. I don't know what the date is. I'm sure that's fine, but, but even if that's the case, I don't know if that's the answer because let's say even slightly more people did heroin. Hold on. Wait, less people got murdered. What's that year? Heroin. What?

Speaker 1:          01:22:05       Jamie? Just [inaudible] more. Do people smoke weed more since legalization? Well, that was the most hilarious. Not Remember when we were talking about it's gotten cheaper. It's easier to get, it's better. It's more fun. It's in candy form. It's in fucking 1818 year old is more likely to definitely give it a try versus maybe would have. When I had gotten weed for the first time I was 17 years old, I had to have my uncle Raymond buy it for us. He skimmed off the bag. I remember and he brought us a fucking dime bag and me and my two best friends, we smoked a joint before we were going to see system of a down and cubis and Mr Bungle at snow court, Puerto Rican. So your uncle like two years older than you, one of those deals. Is that why he did that? But to me bro, we the night before we want it to smoke and it took us, we, there was no way to get it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       We were trying to find weed for so long because we weren't in that world the first time you go to get weed, if you could just go to a store and pick it up and it's fun and you know, it's like I'm at a mall. I mean, yeah, I mean astronomical. But you know, I love weed, so I'm on Hayden. It's great. Well, it was hard to get on the east coast. It's just trickier out here still. But since the nineties once the past, those laws from medical, everybody had a medical card. It's not hard to get it. All the doctors were extremely unscrupulous and their prescriptions. So everybody's had weed out here since the fucking nineties yeah, like strong, strong, easy to get women now. They really don't give a shit. If you smoke like outside, you could smoke a true smoker like a cigarette now.

Speaker 1:          01:23:38       And none of those. No, I don't think you get smoking outside. It's still think you have to be indoors. I think smoking outside, the problem is other people can smell it and you're not supposed to do that. I think in Denver it's like nine feet from an entrance. You can smoke weed. I smoke vape. I mean everywhere inside of a movie theater. As I'm walking through a mall, I go to the bathroom at the airport and I smoke. Yes. That's what ethnics do. They challenge everyone by being big in Alpha in a place like Starbucks. I'm buying anything. Yeah, I'm smoking. What definitely keeps me around so we can be racist. I go, what do you mean my dentist is black, Blue Shit. Black dancers to be hilarious. Gold teeth. Snoop's got diamond, lower teeth. Now what am snoop Dogg these diamond stud or like them creative Donald Grill diamond things.

Speaker 1:          01:24:30       He's in this video. He's driving around on his Instagram in a Lamborghini with diamond lower teeth 50 years ago. Right. I love it. 50 years old. Diamond teeth. He's living it, man. Oh, for sure. He doesn't give a fuck. He spends most of his time getting furious video games online. Does he? Yeah, he just yells about Madden like [inaudible] for a minute. Right. He was commentating like, uh, with your wife or your neighbor. They would drink and watch the fight. So he was drinking like tango, rained smoking joints and watch all the fights. Oh, these wackos tough because what it was was there was some commentary that he did just independently on one fight and it was so hilarious because he's so animated and screaming and yelling about this fight that, uh, everybody thought like, wow, wouldn't it be great if there was an option to watch the snoop Dogg commentary on demand? You could click over to the snoop dog version. That's right. And it was probably, I don't know, I've never watched it, but I assume it was fucking horrific. Oh, let's go go one north south. He's got his diesel in this middle. [inaudible] yeah, just the, uh, I guess they got bored with it there. You got bored doing it or something. I Dunno. It stopped. Maybe Snoop's fucking busy. He doesn't have time to be doing that volunteer. He's like Mike Tyson too, in the sense that I just, I remember when he was like, scary. I hear this. Let's listen to this mother fucker. Mother fucking ne. Oh, that's right. It was Colby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Tyrell show up, N***a. [inaudible] he thought it was called [inaudible]. He thought it was called because he thought it was cool, but it was

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       a man from a completely different part of the world. Yep. Yeah. Fuck Donald Trump. That is hilarious. Thought it was coldly. That's so fun. Holy Shit. He was getting some booze the other night, Huh? Dude. DACA hears touching. Yep. When those people are booing [inaudible] emotion, dude,

Speaker 5:          01:26:19       emotion. You want to get the emotion out of people, whether it's good or bad, it doesn't fucking matter. They want to see him fight and they want to see him lose.

Speaker 4:          01:26:25       He's going, he'll, he went, he'll listen. He's a good guy. I'm telling you. I know that guy. I've met him outside of this crazy thing that he's doing and this crazy thing that he's doing came about when he was, uh, like on the verge of getting cut and people didn't like to style. And so he went hard. He'll, when he fought Damien mind, he went hard. Yeah. We'll chill to dissimilar thing. Shell wasn't the big mouth guy back in the day. No, he was not.

Speaker 5:          01:26:51       Yeah. And he just made a decision one day that he's going to be that dude. It wasn't right at the Anderson Fife fucking great marketing decision. Smart. Very smart. And Colby too. It's like, oh, but also Colby, he, something happened as well. He's really exciting. The, that last fight, Ooh, that last fight was incredible dude. Um, but yeah, call me is definitely, it's contrived.

Speaker 4:          01:27:09       I appreciate the effort. Um, but he's not effective. See the thing about it being contrived is it makes it obvious that he's putting on a show. But the thing is that putting on a show is fucking, he's ruthless. He fucks with people's heads legitimately like they do not want to lose to him. And then when you get inside the AUC gun, he's really fucking good. Like really far. I didn't realize how good he was until the fight. You see the amount of strikes at that guy,

Speaker 5:          01:27:35       no volume. And then he's an unbelievable wrestling. It's a really, really, really tough matchup for anybody. And Colby is, it is a, uh, you know, an act and it is pro wrestling. He puts on the Trump hat and people, I mean people just see that hat and they lose their fucking mind and he trolls half the country and it's a similar thing with the other, with when businesses do it, I'm going like guys, don't be rubes like it's very obvious that it's just an act and if you're a fan of mixed martial arts, you have to appreciate the fact that some guys are taking chances and trying to generate interest. You can, every guy can't just be put on a suit and be straight for showcased and I respect my show

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       at some point. You want to go a little story? Yeah, yeah. I mean he makes juice here, but the bottom line is we put all that shit aside and just look at what he's doing. You look at it, he's doing it like that guy's extraordinary. Like the fact that he could do that to Robbie Lawler completely shut down his off offense and just put a beating on him. Just stay on top of him. Never give them any air. I never give him any air. The pace is smothering and it's striking. Looked really good. Very good. I mean very, very, very takes a shot. Takes the shot. Great. And his cardio is off the fucking charts. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:28:38       it's a that, that whole one 70 right now. That whole division is looking crazy right now. Yeah. Nate Diaz being back in the mix and a Mazda, Mazda and Nate seems like, just like if you're a fan of just like if you're from a poor neighborhood that is like the superstar match. I like where I grew up. It's just shitty like environment. It's like that was like the perfect who hood rat fucking guys who are going to talk. They're going to go

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       in there and fight it. God, it's so awesome. I love so much money. That's why it's going to be so giant. While it was cool that Dana White at the post-fight press conference he got asked, cause you know he had famously said, I think once that Nate Diaz doesn't move the needle or something like along those lines negotiated. But he, he basically said, he goes, I think Nate, besides, uh, Connor and Ronda Rousey is like about as big a star as MMA has. Like, they did crazy good numbers. Everyone, the arena was going nuts for him. He was, he walked out yesterday or Saturday night when he walked out the fucking place. Roared, I mean as loud as anybody as loud as any main event person, whether it's Steve Bay or DC. Nate Diaz got the biggest roar and then he had a great performance, I believe in leading up to it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:45       People were talking about Nate coming back more than they were talking about the heavyweight title. I don't think, I don't think some people in the UFC realize how big a star he really is. I think they thought that the Conor fight, Connor was the big star. Nate beat him. The Conor won the second fight. Connor still remains the big superstar. I think Nate is equally as big as star, but I think that Scott is, Connor's maybe an old worldwide's like, but in America, Nate Diaz is a giant fucking star. Not as big as Connor, but a tier below maybe the credit Connor levels. You have to say he won the two fights. I mean, if you take, who would you rather be in the two fights? I mean, he choked Connor out face down in the first one and then had like a raise our clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       Unbelievable. Great fight the second time. So I mean he comes out of that looking pretty good. Yeah. But I think it's a testament to how popular Connor is because that's the fucking Connor shine and it was a dance and Nate brought it and Nate has that story. The one on one fight. It's turning into this star button. If he never danced with Connor, would he be that big to know? I don't know know that cause Nate was, but that's him for years before. He's always, he's the fucking like do the double middle fingers. Like there's so many moments where you could, where you're like, I get goosebumps thinking about nasal fine. That's your favorite part. When he's like, these are the fingers that take [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       He said fuck you a, you're in the triangle. You got in the triangle and fucking best him double fingers and flexed and he was losing that fight too. Yeah. And then he tried was grassed. Oh and then yeah. Then the Donald Serone fight third round, they come out. They're so fucking good dude. Nate's, once again, it's just, you don't have to be a mixed martial arts fan and you got to be a human and go like that's a fucking fighter. That is something that everyone wants to watch. I hope he makes it an actual belt cause he's saying he's got the baddest motherfucker in the game belt. Then who wants to defend, you know, who wants to be next to challenge for the baddest motherfucker in the game belt and a, I love that. I love that. That's his marketing strategy. He should really legitimately get a belt made up bad as motherfucker in the game. I'm sure the old UFC belt, UFC isn't using that old belt anymore. I'm like you have a bat, UFC baddest mother fucker in the game belt and just, just, just change the outside a little bit. Was He smoking weed for real in the uh, in open workouts?

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       Is he going to get in trouble for no, no, no. It's totally legal in California. And when you task, do you have to literally be high while you're fighting for you to test positive? You saw it dropped it all way, way down. Well but so many people use it to sleep. So many people use it for pain relief. Particularly with CBD when it's one to one. This is like these are, these are one to one THC and CBD and they think that it's actually more effective for both. It actually calms you down a little bit with the CBD along with the THC. So it may, it might actually alleviate some anxiety that's associated with getting to high when that makes sense. Cause that's how it comes in the plant, right. Is like both parts. Well yeah. Yeah, I guess, except it's, I think CBD, it doesn't come as big.

Speaker 4:          01:32:42       So to get one in one, you know. Okay. You smoke a joint, how much CBD you're smoking. I have no idea. I have no question. Do you even get CBD when you just smoke a joint? You have never heard of CBD until it wasn't in the joint anymore by itself. Well t THC is one of many, many cannabinoids, right? Isn't there like 19 of them or something crazy like that? Is that what it was, Jamie 18 yeah, that's a, okay. I don't know. I think the plant itself is what's magic. It's a crazy goddamn plant that we're finally getting to appreciate and it's still, there's a lot of places where you still have to buy hemp from Canada. I'm like large scale hemp production hasn't really caught on with a good percentage of his country cause I used to be like one of one of the major crops that people would grow.

Speaker 4:          01:33:27       You can make clothes out of it, you could eat it. It makes this shit called hempcrete. It's like this insanely durable concrete that's made with hemp to fucking nutty plant man. It really is like the stock of a hemp tree. Like got my friend Todd McCormick had one sitting on his desk once and you pick it up. It's like, what is this from another world? It's hard like hard, but light is Balsa Wood. Lightest Styrofoam. Wait, does that have any sense than weed? No, no. I mean there's just the, the differences. Hamp is not psychoactive. It's like a psychoactive form of the same sort of a kind of plants. But regular marijuana also is hemp, right? Because what hemp is is the fibers. So what we're using to get high is the buds, right? The stems and all the other leaves and shit. But that fiber of the plant itself is insanely durable and really light.

Speaker 4:          01:34:18       And that's the shit they turn into clothes and to string and to all this and to paper canvas. The first canvas was made with hemp, all that stuff. That's why it was can that then the word cannabis or canvas comes from cannabis. That's, that's why it's called canvas. But they did everything with him. But it's just hard to do, man. They just have to beat it down like these slave labor most of the time. And then the 1930 some dude came up with something called a decorticator in is a, a machine where you can effectively process the hemp fiber. And that's when they started going crazy with the reefer madness shit. It was all an economic slave shop, jazz and jazz. They already had, everybody was already doing it. I mean, that was, that was something that was a normal thing with people. It was a, it wasn't until they decided to make it illegal that it became this weird fucking thing that nobody could, uh, nobody could do something that they'd been doing for so long before.

Speaker 4:          01:35:13       Where are they made there? Aren't they making mushrooms and acid legal somewhere, by the way? They were [inaudible] fucking heavyweight champion. The world just called. Sorry. Oh Shit. Name-Dropping yeah, he looks good. One fuck would a crazy fight. Wow. Did I read that somewhere? They're going to be their donut. Maybe. I mean, that guy who's like a rocky movie. Just the change. Yeah, the turn and that fight was so crazy. Look, DC's my very good friend. I love him to death. I love that guy. It's hard. It's hard watching a friend that you really love a get his ass kicked and that's what happened. He was looking great. Yeah, he was a really great look. He's, he's an awesome person, man. I love that dude. And doing commentary with him is the most hilarious, fun time. He's such a good guy. He's great commentary. He's very, very articulate and smart.

Speaker 4:          01:36:00       He's one of the best that does it, Andy. Uh, yeah, dude, it sucks. It's just you see that, you see the pain on his face when he loses a fight. He does not like losing. He is not, it doesn't, but neither the steeper, you know what I mean? And this is what, that's what it's all about. Those two guys I have deep respect for Steve Bay too. I've been, I was saying forever that I thought it was fucked up, that he was not going to get a title shot, not going to get a rematch. Instead they were going to have him fight Brock Lesnar. I'm like, look, the fight is supposed to be Steve Bay. He was the most successful heavyweight ever won four title fights, won the title and then defended it three times. No one's ever done that before. Right? So that was the giant in the guys he beat.

Speaker 4:          01:36:36       We're fucking really good. And it's not just like you gave it prime, it'd be one thing if you said, you know, uh, he got knocked out in the first round so we're going to give the first crack to this number one contender who's like on a, on a tear or something. But to just say Brock Lesnar, because this is a big, it was, it was the most naked example of this is just for pay per view buys is that kind of sucks for steep bay. Yeah. It sucks for Steepbank and I'm glad it didn't, didn't happen. I'm glad that Steve Pay got his chance. Cause just out of respect for the sport and respect for the, the true champions of the sport, like did some matter what marketability or not, that guy is the best champion that's ever been in the game. He's the best heavyweight champion of all time.

Speaker 4:          01:37:19       So like to not what recognize that and not like that should be a big deal. No, I agree with you. That should be the fight. But the money of the Brock Lesnar fight would have been so immense that if you're a company that makes entertainment, this is why it's kind of like UFC in some ways. There's a marriage of entertainment and of sport because debate, I mean the people are the ones who are buying the paper views and showing for it. So if more of them, what's good for the goose is good for the gander because you get Brock Lesnar to come on a card, you get massive, massive eyes on it and then you get, every time you do that, there's a percentage of people who stay

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       fans and become hardcore fans and tell people about it. And then there's, there's real value there for everybody. So, um, yeah, but the heavyweight championship of the world is supposed to be the most procedures and you don't see that in any other sport where a guy will be coming off a loss before years removed. You know, test positive for steroids and then just get a title shot. Um, and you know, that's the way of putting it. Yeah, that is a good, very good point. I what I want to see more even than the DC thing, I want to see Francis and [inaudible] to cause Francis and [inaudible] just destroyed Cain and junior dos Santos who if you guys were met just a few years ago, those were the guys, Kim Call Him God zealous, the heavyweight division and he just destroyed both of them. He looks like he got his confidence back. He looks at, you know, like I want to see that rematch. Yeah. I'm a, I'm terrified for everybody who gets in the octagon every time he fights somebody. I'm like, cause I remember, I remember I still have like shell shock for watching Alster Overeem get hit with that left hook. I remember that was the hardest knockout I've ever seen ever. No one's gonna survive that. It looked like the back of Ellisor. Overeem's head touched his ankles.

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       I was like, no one, everyone's going out from that. Everyone's going out cold. That's the payload. The heavyweights. You just have to like have so much respect because it's like holy shit dude, like you're getting in there and it's just like at any moment you're just gone. I'd rather fight a heavyweight than like 135 pound or though just to be hitting a thousand times in the head. That's the punch bro. That should be a tee shirt like just the silhouette. It's interesting you say that with the DC we're like, I just know him and he's like as little as we know Mickey Gall as much as like we've been friends with him for a short amount of time. Even like when he fights there's some different like stakes on it but as a buddy you're like Tommy and you must see that a lie and you're calling it like you can't really put my chart for me when cowboy fights I root against this bar.

Speaker 1:          01:39:52       Actually that was really hard when Brendan was widening. I was really hard cause I'm real tight with him. We're really good friends. And when, when he wasn't really doing it anymore, it was, he was still in it, but he wasn't really like 100% in, he was thinking about other things he was thinking about when he gets out. It wasn't, it didn't have the same focus and intensity and trainings used to. That's hard. That's not the sport to do that. And you know, it's hard when whenever you thinking about getting out, get out, get out because there's people that aren't thinking about getting out and you got to think about what we were talking about earlier. Like Mike Tyson is prime angry at everything. Like if you, you're thinking about getting out and you've run in front of a guy like that, you know, or a girl like that. There's this female kickboxers that are like that too. They're just fucking vicious man. And they're waiting. You think you're, you're half in half out thinking about cheerleading, wham Shin to the face. You know, you gotta be all saying at the end for anything could've been beaten by a woman. Yes. Am I following you correctly? The fucking highest levels of any combat sport. You have to be all in. I don't think. I don't think

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       that's something you could dabble in.

Speaker 5:          01:40:55       Yeah. It's a hard thing though, because I think in MMA, you know, Luckily Brendan is a, you know, podcast or comedian. I think a lot of other guys, they don't have the same,

Speaker 4:          01:41:03       but they could do other stuff like Tyron Woodley's wrapping Tyron Woodley as businesses. I know he's doing something with CBD. I know he's got a, he did a record with Wiz Khalifa. I know he does a lot of TMZ stuff. He's a funny dude. I think you have to become the [inaudible] look tyrants champion, smart champion though. It's like he has a huge name was, but he's still, he's working. See, he lost his title. That was gone, but yet he's still doing all these other things.

Speaker 5:          01:41:25       Of course, but I think it's easier when you, when you have that name, you're a former UFC champion. I think that alone will probably sort of set you up as long as you're not an idiot for the rest of your life. But they're guys that never get to that very, very top. And if they don't sort of set themselves up for afterwards, they're going to, you know, when you think about getting out, you're like, Shit Dude. The reason they take those fights there was, what was that one documentary I saw where the guy was like, you've got like crazy brain injuries and, and his family was just like, dude, don't take another fight. And he still had to take it. He's had to pay the bills. And it was just like, there was just no other option. He was like barely making money at a gym.

Speaker 5:          01:41:57       So that's the thing where it's like is a sport where you're all in. And then once it kind of shit hits the fan, I said it reminds me of comedy. Cause like it takes a minimum five to 10 years to figure out if you're gonna even be good enough to do it professionally. Right. And then at that point it's your whole life. So this way university people quitting, nobody quit school. You see a lot of people that maybe they started like 20 and like by 30 they're 10 years in and if it's not working out for you, you took the 10 years when you were supposed to be figuring out where the trajectory of like everyone you knew from high school figured out a job, got a house, got mad or whatever, you know, age that now, because you could do comedy for six months and have a youtube video that makes you a a where you can make 25 grand on a Sunday doing one Sunday show at an Improv.

Speaker 5:          01:42:43       But have you watched that guy's youtube channel? That's rare. That doesn't happen too often. I think it's rare that there's, you know guys who are doing comedy for six months that are making six months. Sure, sure, sure. The extreme example. Yeah, for sure. It should mean thing does. It doesn't. I'm just saying, I'm just making a point that it's not really, there's so many alternatives now, but even with food, like Lewis said, like I agree technically in like the, the, the growth of someone like 10 years in, they, they got their legs under them like good nick. Now they can start figuring out what their is going to be exactly. And find their market. That's what you become like a honed great comic. Hopefully, you know, but like you can get popular and have to work into the pressure of a soul deaf theater it three years in the comedy. That is crazy. It's crazy. I couldn't, I couldn't Charlie my possibly imagine that doing Charlie Murphy a

Speaker 4:          01:43:35       d d did it even more insane way. He was famous first and then he became an open miker. That's, that's gotta be challenging. Lot sold out shows all he practices only is doing giant shows right. Where everybody's coming to see him and Don l and all these other Connell's like killer by the way. He's, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       he's going up with like monsters in the Chappelle show. Right. Jeremy Pivot. Hello Jeremy Pivot and stuff. He's Brandon. Brandon was a star when he started doing comedy. He was already known, very know Sue's already known as a UFC fighter. Yeah. But what Charlie Murphy did was do like these sold out fucking shows and he was practicing. Yeah. Like I mean I don't think, I don't know how much time he spent before he went ups on stage the first time, like knowing that he was going to do stand up. I think it was also famous from the Chappelle show and from two of the greatest comedy sketches ever done that Dave Chappelle was acting out for them and they were so funny. And so the is visitation fee. He's going to be fucking, so any expectation when you go in is like, I'm going to see like the greatest comedian in the country and he's doing like his third set that he's ever done.

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       That's crazy. Comedy is the only art form that you practice in front of the audience. There's nothing else or you ha and you have to, the only way to do it is practice in front of painters apartment in Washington. Everyone else gets a master of their craft by themselves in a fuck, whatever. It's, it can be mixed martial arts in a gym. It could be in a garage or in a band, whatever it is. Everyone else gets to figure it out. But we from moment one is this naked thing where like, all right, well let me, and it's so douchey. I think back to the first time, like what fucking type of asshole would even give it a shot the first time? It's like going, hey, I just wrote this song today and they go, well fucking sucks. I'm not going to clap for that terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:45:20       You just wrote next. They wouldn't, they would just go at the end of it, they'd go, yeah, you played a song, you can make a song in a vacuum. I mean you can just guys who have created the most amazing fucking songs and then they let you play them or let you listen to them and you're like, whoa. Like how long have you guys been working on this? Like if you have friends that are in a band and they're like four months, like holy shit. They can do it all. It put it together from start to finish without anybody else involved other than the producers in them. We can't do that. No we can't. Anybody tries. It's crazy. Did somebody to, somebody tried to do a studio stand up album? I didn't somewhat know. Well there was this special Carmichael directed draw Michaels and that's right.

Speaker 1:          01:46:03       No, no audience con show. Yeah, hang on. No, that room just got quiet. Everyone trying to not shit under Michael now. You know, I was just doing question of his audience. I was quite confused. I was like, it was confusing. But what are you doing? You're drew Michael. You're a young comic. 10 years in HBO. You're like, I gotta deal with fuck, I gotta do it. Drunk HOK wants to produce it and no audience. Let's see what happens. You could feel anything other than weird doing standard that you used to doing in front of an audience to know audience. You would be fighting feeling weird the entire time you were talking. Cause you know you're, there's no one there. So you just taught me into a camera. You gotta tell. So there's two audiences watching to be honest with you, needs a laugh track. The reason laugh tracks exist on TV shows is because the the audience, sometimes they just need to be told die.

Speaker 1:          01:46:51       Here's the moment they don't go Caribbean enthusiasm doesn't have a laugh track. It's one of the funny shows them all the time. I don't know if you need the, it's not the laugh track, it's what's the energy that creates just that. You're watching like this before, like you're part of something. Everyone's like, you're supposed to be laughing along with them. Like laughing. If a guy, if, if, if drew Michael came to you in person and started saying those funny things to you, like with that tone you'd be like, this is uncomfortable. Even the funny thing you took away from me, dude, you feel weird doing, you feel we already hit a punch on the go. If there's like just you and him as too, it's too intimate, right? You're not even, but it's not a you when you do in standup like you and one person, I couldn't, right.

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       Who the fuck would ever talk like that? That whole works in front of large people. So you taking something that only works in front of groups of pms. Do you ever go to a convenience store and the guy working there is looking at you like you're not gonna but why are you saying it like this? This is so weird. So I says, I says comedy is not just talking. It is using the pauses and using the timing and using the moments where they're supposed to laugh. There's so much more to it than just sang the jokes. You know that that's the side of what, where you go. It's like I just don't as an experiment, I get it as like a youtube video. I get it. But as as your first big special, I would want there to be an audience there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:06       Probably upset. But I think Daraja is just a creative guy and he had this idea and they just ran with it. I heard he wants to do it for himself. Where do you see as the disease one where Spike Jones on stage and the whole time and they filmed it where Lee could see like the back behind the stuff. People like sweeping people mulling around in the back. I found it distracting six strangely distracting. Just I didn't understand why that would be a good idea. You don't have to get like you happened to be filming all we up in the film as he's working out here and you see a bunch of people in the backyard but it doesn't matter. The material's good. You'll enjoy this. This is a fucking scratch. You're intentionally making it with concepts. If you want of concept to the thing or concept like kind of bookend the show, like the show.

Speaker 1:          01:48:52       It seems like it's all like, Hey, look over here to be like, I really didn't have like a an hour. I'm super happy with, I'm not even, I haven't seen the material of it to know. I'm not saying as he's, it's not a good hour. I just feel like when you're throwing flour, I would want less fluff to draw, to draw, to like, hey, listen to these jokes. Like please don't pay attention that like we have the first ever overhead three d camera like on the shot like Jones. So I think you don't get it. I think it's one of those things where it's like, hey man, I'd love it if you directed it. And he'd be like, okay, but I want to do something different. Right. And then you're like, I trust you. You're a master at what you do. I'm a master when I do, let's collaborate.

Speaker 1:          01:49:25       And I get it. It was like, um, when, uh, Steve Jobs, he, the, the first apple logo, he just paid $250,000 for and the deal was he didn't get any revisions. He got to like have a conversation about what he wanted to feel. And then this weird fucking artist went and created the logo and was like, here it is. And that's that. Hmm. Okay. That's a bad deal. Maybe Steve Jobs is not the business man we imagined because a lot of money, if you, he trusts it each may or may not use your fucking desires. He to see it [inaudible] paint Drexciya sketch. He was going to do thousand dollars not even successful yet. We don't even have a logo that people using $50 and if I like it, can you create it? You create a logo for my company. What's it called? Apple. Yeah, that Bitch Woo. She took a quarter mill and bang that out in six minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:50:22       Fucking thing to divides this country more than right. Left. It might be android versus iPhone. Yeah, but people aren't like a boycott and businesses over it. No, they're not. But that people look down on people with android phones. They sure do. They're less time. That's it. It's just one of those things. It's like if you have an iPhone you're in and if you have an android phone, you're on that other fucking team. The bare minimum. If you don't have an iPhone, you, you're a fucking loser. That's what it is. A guy for years and I used to, I used to be one of the guys, what's the big difference? Who gives a shit? And then I got an iPhone and I was like, oh, it's the differences. Just the way your fingers, I don't know. I'm going from one piece, one thing to the next.

Speaker 1:          01:51:08       If you're opening up a tax or going to a phone, everything is just very seamless and it's smooth and it feels very natural and very nice. And android because somebody, different people use that sort of android platform. It's always clunky and it's not exactly the same, so it never feels as smooth once you get used to your iPhone. That's that. And Yeah, I agree. I know very successful people that stick by Android, the newest android phones are pretty fucking smooth. If you, if you picked up like um, um, galaxies, whatever, that's like a galaxy s 10 does those a smooth fucking phone man, those things are as good as anything. There's a bunch of phones now on the, the side of android that rival or are better than iPhones. Some of the technologies, a hit 10 the note 10 that just came out. Is there one that's not android or iPhone that's like dope that people just don't know about. That's like their operating system, which is really weird. It's like, yeah, you have three operating systems. You have a, you have iPhones, you have android, and there's still a few people that have windows phones, believe it or not blackberry. Who the fuck uses that? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:52:13       Thompson. I think that's a joke. Well, I think that's a gag. If I text him and he goes blue, he's got a fucking iPhone, pretends to not have a fucking real phone or he's got multiple phones. Pageants, fucking phony asshole. I talked to him that one time. He does have it, but he doesn't use it. Oh, okay. Yeah, he's got it. I think it was a joke though. Okay. I think he really did miss those little w. If you had a blackberry back in the day, the thing that texting people you knew where everything was buttons where you can text pretty quick, that little ball would break. It was so annoying. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       that thing would break, but uh, the difference between that and an iPhone is pretty substantial, but the difference between iPhones and android is not substantial anymore. But don't you like [inaudible]? It's pretty fucking [inaudible] iPhone. I can't go back. I just know it. I don't want to relearn a new phone. I sat down and [inaudible] phone. Now since Steve Jobs is gone, that iPhone is catching up on the technology to android. The Android's like getting a lot of things. You go look on my iPhone does now. Some of those android goes, but we've had two generations of that era would be that they wait until the technology is out and all the bugs are knocked out of it and then they give you a superior version of it. Yeah. That's the argument. I mean, look, it's the most successful company in the fucking history, the known universe. They have its shit.

Speaker 4:          01:53:29       Fuck tons of cash. I can't believe they didn't get like the folding phone first. I don't think that thing is worth a fuck. I couldn't even guess. It looks like it's weird making it fatter or gummy. How to just give me this. This is a good shape. You folks stopped. They just constantly, we've got to figure out how to extend a brick. Roll it up. Like a little, like a little fortune cookie worried about is the Elon Musk thing. The neurolink you hearing about that? I'm not sure what the next step to integrating computers with your fucking brain that's it's going to happen. Right? If it's not this Elon Musk's thing doesn't do that, then the next thing we'll, but the ultimate goal is going to be, we're going to have pieces in our body. One thing, some computer, what the word of like merging with the the body.

Speaker 4:          01:54:18       Yeah. Symbiotically Cyborg. Cyborg. The child Cyborg. Yeah, but that's true too. [inaudible] that's what, that's what I was thinking about. The singularity is what they think would be the ultimate, uh, technological innovation that radically chance forms mankind. And they moved that number around and I think the singularity, they think for artificial intelligence. There was a symposium in New York a few years back that Ari and I and Duncan Trussell went to. It was like the 20 I think it was like 2045 that's when they think they think at 2045 these things are going to go alive and there'll be robot just like x mocking that type people walking around with us.

Speaker 5:          01:54:55       Oh for sure. I mean I think I heard part of the conversation you had with the Elon Musk and it was one of the most interesting things because for a while I was going, yeah dude, if you just put your phone down, people don't really give a shit. You go to the supermarket. People aren't arguing about politics, but eventually what's going to happen is the phones are going to be in our fucking brains and you're never gonna be able to put the phone down and it's going to be, that's the world we live in where we are just at war and that's where it's fucking scary. That's what, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:55:18       [inaudible] jump in too quick too. Hasn't already been like a whole bunch of like self driving car accidents. Terrible things happen. More human accidents. Yeah, it's better. Is it more human accidents per amount of cars though? You know what I'm saying? Like self driving cars. Really A, you're not supposed to just sit there. You supposed to hold on to the wheel. I keep a hand on the wheel. It makes you do that. You can't just uh, drive it. It [inaudible] you can't

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       just sit back. It needs you to be engaged. Like the little Duvall who just takes videos of him like taking a nap and smoking. Joe, what's out the window? He's not involved at all. So you get that like blocked where the sensors like to take 'em all calm. Assuming it's a sensor type, is there anything that you can do that's actually like a uh, iPhone mount? Like a cell phone mount. It sits on the handle and it keeps pressure on the handle. So the handle thinks that you're holding onto the handle and you have your iPhone robots an iPhone colder. So they sell it as an iPhone holder. But really what it is is something that squeezes on the handle, but they can't sell it as that because that would be illegal. It should be illegal. It's pretty God damn good. That thing that eventually drive shit eventually I way more trust auto-drive.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       I trust them to be able to come up with the technology where they have everything on perfect grids where we all get in our cars and the absolute fastest way for us to get from point a to point B is already mapped out traffic, all that shit that that's not that crazy. I feel like that has to be within, you know, 2030 year changes lanes and everything. Oh yeah. Yeah. It changes lanes. Did it blow your mind the first time you were on highway where those [inaudible] that's common. All that's coming [inaudible] never suck. Your Dick would probably just give you the experience in a chip while your click 3d Hologram lady appears and starts bone feels like it's real, but nothing's there. Whitney Houston, your celebrities. Remember how they made the future in eighties movies though where the Dick Sucking car would actually be like a hose would come out of the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:57:13       That would be the field. Look at the a mouth hose. Would you really trust that mouth? Always with your cock and what? I want to wait until the third or fourth version. I watched, I watched total recall recently, which is like, you know the new one, the old one and got to that total recall. The one a the running man. Oh Wow. And it was like when he was holding the girl hostage, she was in the house like let's look up what flights are right. And it's just such obvious like Atari graphics on the screen and at the year 2050 the music that really has good ideas of what the future's going to be. Even minority report when they're moving stuff around on the screen. Like maybe, maybe someday, but no one's done anything where you go, wow, that would be amazing if that was that.

Speaker 1:          01:57:52       Was it sort of the apple thing though, is it? Apple tries to make their stuff live up to what they made like 1950 space movies being everything's like very like metal metallic and sleek looking like the Gattica the uniform package. I'll do that. Apple is a great company. They really are. But when you open up an iPhone or an apple product, the packaging, they, it has like an air thing. We're in lifts naturally and it's all based off the experience. Like when you open it, you, you go, I've never opened another product like this. And if they do that on purpose and it's this subconscious thing that they fucking put into your mind and that's why you go, dude, just, I don't know what it is, dude. iPhone, I can't put my finger on it. Sweat chicks buy expensive bags. Yep. Same thing. Ooh, yeah. Quality lasts forever. If you write though, if you write a lot and type a lot, they're the shittiest. They're fucking keyboards

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       are dog shit. The new ones that they're clearly clickity clickity there's no travel, they're just clickity clickity clickity clickity and shit gets stuck in them. And they're trying to figure out how to fix.

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       Mostly this part doesn't work on my apple so I, I've copied the space so whenever I right after not comfortable

Speaker 4:          01:58:57       both for typing on like the whole like how much fucking thinner doesn't have to be Jesus Christ. I know you guys are trying to make them thin but make them so they're comfortable to type on it does make it thicker. Like just make it, it doesn't have to be that thin male. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:59:10       Big Old Gray keyboard is the most comfortable thing. The old school thing that we love, but I think it's because we learned how to type on that.

Speaker 4:          01:59:16       No, it's because they're mechanical. Your fingers feel the tactile sensation of pushing in those springs. So it was like click, click, click, click could cook your fingers. Know where the keys are. When you don't get into any feedback, you make a lot of errors. Like it's not as easy. It takes a long time to get accustomed to that short travel keyboard that you get on those really thin Mac books. I have a 2015 mac book. I went and got an old one refurbished because I hate the fucking new keyboard. It's like I don't know what I'm touching. Yeah, it's not, it's not moving. It's so, so shallow. But apparently they gotta fix that dude. I have an IBM or not an IBM and Lenovo thinkpad. That thing is like the old IBM think pads with Lenovo bought the company and now they make them, they, you feel the keys. It's like as you're typing, you know, they have like 1.5 millimeters of travel, which was like,

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       I bet you the next time I call bet I'm going to, me and Joe, we're gonna have a uh, typing competition. I think I could, I have none big no mistakes. And the new apple, it's fine. I think once you're used to it, you're used to it. How did you, you need to let yourself go to the new technology,

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       both of them. But I liked the typing way better on the Lenovo. It's just theirs. This is not like just me. This is a big thing that people who write a lot say is that you want something that has a lot of key travel because 1.5 you know, preferably maybe even 1.8 millimeter or something like that. When you're doing that, you you get a real good feel of where the keys are. You don't, you also feel like you've hit the bar, you know you've hit the button, you say see this feedback and you don't think about, what I find is that I'm writing on one of those things. I don't think about the keys as much as I just am concentrating on writing where I was like, oh, otherwise I'm like, oh, did that, that little extra thing where you gotta look down. Oh, I fucked up and I hit that instead of that. That doesn't happen as much [inaudible] way less

Speaker 1:          02:01:06       you guys washing your keyboards because I feel bad every time my son touches my computer and it's probably keeping them healthy. Dude, it's funny. There's so much fucking bacteria on that computer for cover and they use that dust blasts thing is great. I don't use any of that. Just blown. Come right in your circuit board. Gross your fucking kitchen tables. Gross. Everything's gross. I know. Do you think about like homeless people touching guardrails? It's like you go and touch that like Ah, homeless people. The subway, the subway rails must be just, oh, it's brutal. The amount of times I've, I've done this in New York City, like I'll be going to put my hand on the hand. I just don't touch handrails anymore and I make sure that my son does and, but I've just been putting my hand on the rail and then I just pick up a bugger like a human booger and I'm like, okay, that's my week. The story just ruined my hour. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:01:57       and then it gets stuck in your thumb. You flick it again. It get stuck on that finger. Something about other dudes boogers. It's really, there's no way that that would end my day. And your own kids booger. I'll pick my son's nose in a heartbeat. It's just a random stuff. That's your own son. I mean he's six now. You should stop, but definitely stop picking his nose. How old is it when you'd be really concerned if your son is still sucking their thumb? Nobody. You're saying shit, I wanted to deck wait thumb anymore until you confirm and they go, okay, well now I know my son never sucked his thumb. So yeah, like if you had a kid though, if he had a boy, I have a girl. If you should never stop. She loves second thumb. You don't have any kids. I got an eight month old.

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       Oh, you do? [inaudible] last time I saw you were out there breeding. I am. Congratulations. Now you become even more libertarian, correct? Yeah, but not with her. I'm going to throw this carry. I'm with my baby. I make the decisions there. That's a good move. Don't let babies call the shots now that'll be just sugar and guns, but I'm teaching a baby how to shoot a gun. Let if a baby could actively shoot a gun, like you know how much of a fucking giant problem that would be like if a baby was just like, dude, dude, now I'm feeling like I'm not enough of a libertarian. Yeah, because here's a gun. Go homestead some land. Their body can't really hold a gun and shoot it. Right. It would go flying. There's no way. But if they could, do you know how what a great time they would think it would be to shoot fucking baby and you let it gotten just like, dude, dude, dude.

Speaker 1:          02:03:29       Right. They love it. That projectiles, my son has, there's nerf guns. That's how I know he's not gay. He loves to shoot things and the lot of gay people that shoot things now, that's how I know he's not good. Like he kept shooting his friend in the face. The other guy you think about bears and then he was talking the bullets in his book. If you had a bunch of bears that you couldn't take them out to like a shotgun range and shoot clay pigeons like 15 minutes before they started fucking each other. Yeah. Eventually. Oh my God, this shit. But this kind of gave me some warning. The guys, they're just guys with like guys, they got the wacky winery, the gay kids that I grew, I'm sure. Yes, there are gay guys who like to do doodly. Dude things, right? Oh definitely. But doodly do you know, not often.

Speaker 1:          02:04:11       I mean the how many gay friends you have, they're like, we should really go shooting guns right now. Let's go hunt. I bet there's a bunch of shop and that's fine. They do. They want to do them. But isn't it like girls? Like there's girls that are like Woodsy, girls, girls want to live in the woods and shit. Yeah. I think these are exceptions. If you're a gay like mountainy guy and you're another mountain, he guy's probably going to have an all right life. That's all. So also pretty hot. Gay mountainy guys alone. Just fucking Bolton down the door before they bought Fox looking out to issue. Yeah, sure. The neighbors don't know why. So are you fell as brothers and sisters or what? Brother and brother, what's going on? And they wrote a seasonal marina and then they just suck and fuck in the off season.

Speaker 1:          02:04:51       Yeah. You go down the road where those two homos live,Z , homos, there's a couple of what it is as a couple of dudes living in the oil efficient house, don't get me wrong. Great guys, great guys. All they do is chop with them, but fuck, that was the Bagel boss guy when he said that. He goes, I got a problem with gay people. He goes, just don't touch me, you know, especially in the private area. Then we'll have the problem. I go, is that what your life's worried about? You don't want to hang out with [inaudible] I property is going to start grabbing viciously at your Dick. Do you think that guy's a, he's going to stick in there. You think he's going to be uh, like Joe the plumber or do you think it's going to have some legs to him? No, I think this is going to, Lenny Dykstra is going to knock him out unconsciously.

Speaker 1:          02:05:33       He's five, 10. He's a former, I know. He's like, he ain't got alcohol problems and shit, but he's got those big hands. I see the videos getting arrested. The other day he's going to hit the Bagel boss. He left. She was fighting Bagel boss boxing. No, it's terrible. It's like she was, you know, older now, but I mean he's Lenny Dykstra. He's a lunatic. He's only 55 so I'm like that. He looks like 70 but he's, he's still a fucking stocky dude, man. Like four foot eight. He's, I mean five was, he fell, he's four. He's really small. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:06:07       down. You've seen that guy. I've seen. He went to one of, uh, someone's MMA gym and he was hanging out with a bunch of fighters and he's throwing punches and dancing around the ring. I think. I want to say Matt Serra, was it Matt Serra? Chris Weidman. He was long island guy. Yeah. So he was out there. It's like, he's not like, he doesn't have a background in martial arts. Like you could tell that really fight shape. Its probably shape and he's a tiny little fellow by like a butterfly. Sting like a butterfly. There's, yeah, there's no good, there's no learning how to fight, getting in shape, doing it all like it. Yeah. He's too small. It looks like he's been in a bunch of fist fights. He used to be arrested language jacked at a point in his life. I mean like shredded and you're losing that strength. You're not going leave. Even if he's out of shape. Even if he's still a strong like Boltsy Guy, I'm sure even conversation is going to kill him because he was saying they heavy play heavy on Lenny.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       Push it off. Lenny Dykstra crazy. He was fucking pro. I think there's no way. There's no integrity in celebrity boxing though. I don't know if you could bet like a zillion dollars. The top, yeah, Tim now, so he's only 55 that's crazy. Now he's her. That isn't, he is. It'd be a little bit older. He's older. I just looked it up the other day. He's not that old. He was a legit wild man. Yeah. When he was at right there. He looks like Mike. I can. Yeah, he was fucking, that guy was a legit wild man. Look at that. Lenny Dykstra indicted for drugs, threats, falling arrest in May. Who? Yeah, he's winning. This fight is Uber driver. He was high on ecstasy and coke and got into an argument with his Uber driver and then threatened his life when the cops come. Yeah, the cop. Yeah. The cops come and they're like, yeah. This guy's saying, his fear for his life. He's like, well, for me it's the base, please. So innocent. It's hilarious. Oh, that's funny. And then they start checking his bag and he starts freaking out about them going through his bag. 56 yeah. Wow. Wow. I thought he was older than that. Even these days, living them hard years, son ahead of celebrity fight. Lenny Dykstra, it says, Bagel boss has one inch penis. That was shit outrageous. Click on that, please. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:08:13       click this. So rude. The world we live in, Lenny Dykstra went on Howard stern and did like a, he said like he had girls come on to say how good he pussy and they were like swearing down. There we are. Then it was a comic. So he brought comedians from La and then the community immediately just used it for like a credit and that's just a bumped as whole thing. So he flew them in for nothing. Oh, that's funny. It's a crazy that he's going to hit that little guy because that's so, so wrong. I guess the Little Guy, I wonder if he is going to down quick. Yeah. I in celebrity boxing it doesn't usually get too brutal. I think, you know, I think what's his hunch him once and it might kill [inaudible] Bonaduce used to go for it though. Headgear doesn't help you at all. Head gear sometimes makes it worse because you got all this extra weight and your head snaps more like you can get if you get head gear on, that's more shit that you have to control.

Speaker 1:          02:09:07       Like one of the things about having a strong knack is when you get punched you can kind of control your head from moving around too much and some guys can take it better. But if you have a head gear on, it's like extra weight and your brain sloshes around inside your head. I made it protects you from cuts more than anything. This, there's an argument that it would protect you from cuts but the protecting it from the thud cause it's not, it's the fucking rocking of your brain. You know, like it's in some ways it's, it's a real mixed bag. In some ways it's better to have had gear on cause there's a little more cushioning. But in other ways like it's [inaudible] it makes me [inaudible] cause I was surprised you did that but you're like it just fucked. I didn't want to fight with the head guy.

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       Tried to change it at the end because I started sparring with it and it fucking sucks. Dick did, you can't breathe. Can't see that good. You can't see when you start grappling you start feeling like you're being smothered right away no matter what. As soon as they touch your head you feel like the starts moving up in your face. So I tried to get them to take it off and they wouldn't and then my head gear broke like in the first minute of the fight and they were like, all right, fuck you take it off. Cause it was a shit show. So we both took off our head gear and I was like, Huh, where's the rules? Yeah, head care's a tricky thing. You know, it's like they think that about football helmets too, that they would actually be a safer game if they couldn't clash heads with a helmet on that they wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:10:21       They wouldn't play like that. That's just not true. Them clashing skulls, just not safer to match it. But the idea is that the only reason why they played that way is because of the helmets in the foot shoulder gear. If you took that stuff away, they wouldn't play like that. Yeah. Back in the day they had, they barely had any pads and you know, thirties or forties or whatever when they were playing with those little tiny helmets, that game, if you were an outsider, like if you didn't know how big it was, like if you didn't understand anything about the cultural significance of football and they showed you all the brain damage and they showed you what it is, he'd be like, Oh yeah, make that illegal. Yeah, probably. If anything, it should be illegal. Stop doing that. Kids constantly run into each other and they'll smash heads.

Speaker 1:          02:11:01       That's crazy. [inaudible] defensive offensive line. Just the idea that it's the funniest thing. Susie say go just clunk heads with another human beings. We want it to be illegal and it's fun thing to watch and it's a great way for some guys to make a fuck load of money and weigh the risks versus the rules. Yeah. But then a bunch of middle schoolers are snapping their necks and my kid will never play football. [inaudible] get stopped. They could then they could illegalize MMA with that justification. I don't want that to happen because we punching and kicking is so inherently violent. That's what we see it as being this violent act, right? That it's, we go, oh shit fighting. That's like crazy. That's the most violent sport, but it's so much less of a dangerous sport than football. Football. These guys are just running head first at each other and every one of them, every one of them has major, major issue.

Speaker 1:          02:11:49       You also get blindsided in football. You know, you'll have your eye on someone and then you get head to head taken out from someone else. That doesn't happen as much in MMA, but I mean when people get like head kicked, knocked unconscious, that's not good for your brain. [inaudible] players being concussed, just like just smashed each at time. Yeah. And then they get up and they just do it again and again and again. They're a little bit stricter I think on like if you get a concussion, they won't put you back in. At least the way they used to like when I was a kid. But it's still fighters. We're getting concussed once every, if you know, once a year, if, if they're getting knocked out once a year. I mean, you know, but there's a also sub-concussive trial. It seems to be the problem with CTE.

Speaker 1:          02:12:31       It's not just the knockouts, it's just the thumps over and over again over and over and over and training, sparring, you know these guys. So that's the real problem. That's why also soccer players are getting it and soccer players are starting to get CT. What's worse? Like getting like a Conor McGregor one punch knockout or fighting Nick Diaz and just getting like [inaudible] for five rounds probably. You're probably better off getting one punch better than hey you probably up better off getting dropped. Getting beat up by Nick Diaz for 15,000 to suck wasn't, this wasn't the initial argument about MMA being safer than boxing is that it's not so much. So, you know, with the gloves being bigger in boxing and all that stuff, that's actually worse cause you're gonna keep taking too many shots count as well. You can get knocked down and then get up and go right. You're be concussed and like, right. Keep on fighting. Um, where's in MMA? They'll stop it if you, if you're not defending yourself. So that's probably definitely better. Yeah. The thing about eight counts and 10 counseling, the people who've gotten off the deck and had amazing performances, so you'd ever want to stop it. Like, look at Tyson fury gets off

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       the deck twice against Deontay wilder and MMA. That fight would've been stopped. Right. So it's like one of those, particularly the last round when he dropped him, he would've definitely punched him a few times and he would have been out cold cause he was flat on his back. Um, in MMA that would be the end of the fight. And we are lucky. It wasn't cause he got up like a fucking superhero and even won the rest of the round. He outbox him for the rest of the round. You survived the initial barrage and then started catching him as he was coming in and as Deontay was being reckless, he caught him one time like stung him and you're like holy shit, he's winning this round now that he's winning the rest of the round after getting almost obliterated. So there's an argument that that's better, that crazy thing, entertainment value.

Speaker 4:          02:14:14       But the crazy thing from the CTE like perspective about boxing to me is that your people will get hit and then they get hit and grab someone. Cause that's just everyone's instinct and they grabbed them and then you have a little [inaudible] no, no, no, no, no. Keep, keep punching. Like don't do anything to avoid from it. No, no, no, no. Step it back out. And then they do that in MMA, you'll see a lot, someone get hit and then you know, they get into a clinch and you get a few minutes in a clinch where they're kind of like, okay, I'm not taking all the damage right now. But the smart thing about that is that's how you're supposed to fight. Like you're giving people options to defend themselves. It shouldn't be, you can't defend yourself other than punching back. That seems seems kind of crazy. Like, but I could grab them and just stop these punches.

Speaker 4:          02:14:53       No, no, no. Against the rules. And what kind of rules do we have? Like you can only beat me up if I let you beat me. That was one of the points. [inaudible] dance around for an half hour. But do you remember the original, there was like Gracie videos that they'd make an early UFC inaction. And what they used to say all the time was, and it's so true, it was so interesting, is that if two boxers just have a street fight, they're going into a clinch and it's probably going to end up on the ground at some points. I'm playing because the ref has this break up a clinch over and over and over again to make boxing happen. Like even when, even when you're a professional boxer and you don't know anything about wrestling or grappling, you still end up grabbing the other guy cause that's just like the only time that doesn't take places.

Speaker 4:          02:15:31       When one guy knows how to strike and the other guy doesn't. And you see a lot of those videos online where two dudes decided to get into some sort of a street altercation and one guy actually he's like a boxer and co and he catches the guy and the guy falls and bounces his head off the concrete out called. There's a bunch of those things that's bad. That's different. So the thing about the Gracie Jujitsu is like you got to always be aware of this. People like that out there. There's, there's always guys who can punch you in the face and if they know how to wrestle too and they can keep you away and just keep punching you in the face, you better know how to take them down. You're still no dude. Fuck the 2019 you have [inaudible] people, Shit, you got to look at their ears.

Speaker 4:          02:16:07       You got to look for the little signs, like look in their eyes [inaudible] next to infuse it. Skinny necks aren't getting choked as far as like skill like definitely, yeah. You don't know weird time for fighting. You know it's like, and we, we both, I like both kinds. I like just stand up only fights. I like watching those and I like mixed martial arts fights but I think like a tans Crawford's coming on next. And I think watching someone like him box, like when you see the skill level that that guy has switching stances, doing all kinds of befuddling people getting their range, figuring them out and then just teeing them up with perfect timing. Like that's almost only possible that kind of artistry. If there's no wrestling right, there's no leg kicks. If there's only the boxing, that's the only way you see that like that, that kind of like beautiful comedy cause otherwise you would do other shit too.

Speaker 4:          02:16:54       You would leg kick, you would try to take them down. And that, so like the, the level of dominance that are real Floyd Mayweather, a real world champion boxer has with their hands. It's hard to really appreciate until you see it live. And you know, like what you're seeing. Like if you're in the building with a guy always beating somebody up when they're sparring, it's like, oh, like this is, you guys are playing two totally different games by boxing. It's like, I literally look at boxing as like very much a sport and I think MMA is the closest thing that we have. Two competitive fighting 100% that's sort of like the difference. It's, you know, all things considered, it's still not fighting. You can't grab somebody's fucking balls and Yank him off their bodies to bite their nose. I know. [inaudible] the Joe son who good got a, you couldn't buy it and you couldn't, I gouge, hit him with a fucking trash can.

Speaker 4:          02:17:42       Lid. We can't, we can't fish hook and then, but you used to be able to punch the balls. There was a fucking great video of Keith Hackney Fighting Joe Song. Joe Sohn got up, got him in a headlock and Keke fat and he's just hammering his deck. I mean full bloods and hunches over and over and you see like Joe sounds like going into shock. He takes a few of them and he's like, I'm not letting go with this joke. [inaudible] fourth, Fifth Dick Punch. It's like this is all over man over. He was a drained head. Was it chemo? Was He head budding hoists? Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, that was fucking brutal. Brutal. There was a lot of head button back in the days. It was an effective weapon and it makes us like, oh, that's awful. But small finger locks in there. All these other bones. How come you're allowed to hit with these bones but you can't hit with that bone.

Speaker 4:          02:18:29       You also, I would rather be headbutted by a guy that I don't give a shit of what there's no, there's not much technique and headbutting. I would rather be headbutted then be head kicked by a dude who knows how to head kick. You think there's no tech, but there really is. There's guys that spar and they fight and left way and left the way is a type of uh, Moitai where they put ropes, uh, over their knuckles. That's the only thing they have. And they're allowed to head butt and it's some wild ass shit. And they do headbutt combinations on the pad. Like they'll do tap, tap bang. They'll like use their head and train it. Wow. Learn how TV and find that left way. W E I t l. U. T. H. D, You know, does commentary for it is our friend Robin Black. He does, uh, he does commentary for the left way, but this is a brutal form of [inaudible] where you're allowed to head butt cause they already elbow. And I think, you know, they're thinking, well, if I can need and find any content, I can do all these things. Why can't I head button? It's right there. He's fucking faces right

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       there. Ah, well you remember what, uh, what Mark Coleman used to do? Like he got a full year of season before the headbutts were illegal.

Speaker 4:          02:19:34       Do. And he would, he would smash people with the headbutts. So here we'll be this dude with this combination [inaudible] so this is a Robin, Robin black breakdown when he, he goes, this dude goes off to the side, pushes the dude's head away and then immediately comes in with a perfect head button. Boom. It just slamming him in the face on purpose with the top of his head. So he's trying to hit like his eyes and his nose and the soft tissue. He's trying to hit that with the hard part of his forehead.

Speaker 1:          02:20:00       Yeah. I think they do a lot more damage than a fist. But he only works one out of every thousand times.

Speaker 4:          02:20:07       Lynn. No, no, no, no. This dot guy does it a lot and if you do it this way, the way he's doing it, you taking a really hard part of your forehead and you're smashing against a soft part of the eyes and the nose. This part of your forehead is hard as fuck man. Most guys who break their hand and fights break their hands

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       top of the head. Yeah. Especially boxing. The Tila Tequila reality show is two guys were fighting over and that was like a reality show that, oh, he broke his chin, opened a thing, and like it's separates his teeth. He takes the head butts to the mouth. It's a spitting out. The blood's not turning. Uh, you ever see someone get covered? The blood's not turning red yet. It's black. Black. He was like, yeah, he's playing. What happens is his jaw splits down the middle where you literally see his teeth separate because it's cracks in half like that. It's the most horrific thing I've ever seen. This VH1, by the way, I saw that video. Whole classics. Talk about it. A woman's fight. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It was a Randy couture, his wife Kim coture. Oh yeah. She fought, she got her job broken and it was separated and she went out and fought the next round with the jaw separate touch, a Predator, the the asshole inside and inside.

Speaker 1:          02:21:18       He was moving around and then she had to get it wired up and fixed after the fight was crazy. In the sixth grade. Uh, he was, he got into a fist fight with this other kid and this other kid had brass knuckles and Breslin was a wreck. You'd buy him at like the mall when I was a kid. Martial arts shy. You'd give get like butterfly knives. Nunchucks flying stars. Yeah. Brass sounded like you could just go in and start 12th and by deadly weapons. Yeah man. They, those little stores that would sell nunchucks the size all the time. Number two buttons. So this kid had brass knuckles and he fucking drilled this kid in the face and broke his jaw. And for the whole school year, like half school year, he had to have a wire jaw who should drinking chocolate milk at lunch every day. What happened? They can't even tell the story. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:22:07       punched him. He was a kid. So it wasn't like Juvie or anything that it was just like he got in trouble, but that's it. Now you got arrested? No, no. Didn't get it. Didn't get arrested to go to school together after that, remove the brass copper kid from the school. Didn't happen at school. It happened to add a school. I don't think that the kid who did it, I know the who did. I don't think he went to the same school, man. Sorry for hitting you with brass knuckles. The math homework, dude, that's who's cool. That's just, but that's terrifying. That's where it's like you just don't want to fuck with people like, well, kids would get beat up at home too. The kids, the kids who get beat up by their parents, they're ready to beat people up. Of course be, it's becomes a part of your, your everyday life.

Speaker 1:          02:22:45       You're mad at people, you hit them mad at people that are smaller than you didn't get away with it. You hit him. Yeah. I don't think people talk about that enough. They talk about all the violence in the world and nobody's talking about the fact that since kids are toddlers, they're being hit by the people that are supposed to protect the most and that fucks them up psychologically and it does something to them. It's awful. And it's a cycle, right? You hit your kids because your dad hit you and that's what made you the man that you are today. That kind of horseshoe. But it's so weird that it's the only relationship where if you bring up this topic, people will justify headache. It's the only like no one will publicly justify hitting their chick or hitting their grandfather, taking personally. Like you're attacking their parents.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       They take it like they know, like my mom's not a bad, my mom's a good mom. She, you know, I deserved it. They'll tell you that I deserved it. It's crazy. Isn't it so weird that if anyone, if you said publicly like, uh, you know that you give your girlfriend a slap, if she acts the wrong way, everyone would universally be like, that is just pure evil. But if you say the same thing to my two year old, my three year old, everyone's just kinda like, whoa. And then even I would do like conventional questions, daughter, if you say, if you grow, if my man talks too much shit, I smack him in his face. Girls would be like, you go girl. Sure. Yes, that's true. But I also don't care. That's like love on the fucking know. But that's because the power dynamic is the opposite.

Speaker 1:          02:23:55       Right. You know, like you're talking about the, I'm not dating Cyborg. You may [inaudible] give a shit. That's a serious problem. If you're dating sideboard, she's hitting me. Whatever her hands are, the fucking real issue we, we catch. She's gone. Huh? Out of the UFC man, they fucked up. That sucks. They made a video where it made it look like Dana White was saying that they just docked a added words that he didn't say that was stupid. So dumb. Do you think it was malicious or do think it was a legitimate mistake in terms of translating? There's no way it could be anything other than stupid. Whoever purpose, if it was done on purpose. So it was just a stupid idea. That's all it is. And it's really this timing, whatever it is, whoever did it, it just, that's just a terrible error and it's, it's really bad timing cause she was almost uncomfortable last year, but now Amanda Nunez came and kind of took that juice and now it's like she's damaged goods if she decides to leave EOC without a Nunez rematch, she beats Nunez.

Speaker 1:          02:24:52       She gets it all back, you know. But she still say enough about the star. She's, she'd go to one FC, she'd go to bell tour, she'd go to a lot of places and she'd still be welcomed with open arms. She's, she's a walked down the street and get to huge pop star. Like, like she, she shows up at those weigh in shows and like the crowd flock star. I remember just thinking that about her. I saw her one time and there was, I forget what this garden show and just sat in like the front row of the UFC at the garden and the place was like you, you're so excited for just like turning around and waving or because she was the first like female terminator. Yeah, Gina Carano. And that was the bell watching her beat up. Gina Carano gives me nightmares to this day. It's crazy fight and the end of it when there's a photo that we played on this podcast before of her sideboards hand palming gene has had with black fingernails and she's punching her in the face at the same time. She's holding her head, slamming her fist in the face. You're like, I want out Jana. Gina was queen when it was like three minute rounds. They're like, we all fought three minute rounds back then for women. Yeah. Was half tops also.

Speaker 1:          02:26:00       You know, she was taking some stuff, you know? For sure. For sure. Yeah, for sure. That this, that's part of the issue in [inaudible] positive for some stuff. It's a, you know, that's part of what it is. It's part of what it is. The build up to the Gina Carano fight was when she choked out the news guy, right? That was kind of viral was her. I got news guy being like to put her in like a rear naked choke and she had choked him unconscious. It comes back to, it's like very uncomfortable and weird shrubs don't want to do it. And then he was like, you could see you could do it, it's fine. And then he just looks like he was like, it was one of those bands on gas for, you'd get up and and make noises believe that they're really gonna go out like that.

Speaker 1:          02:26:37       They don't believe they're going to go out so quick. Yeah. In the sixth grade we used to do the thing where we would hyper Glendale game. Yeah. So you bend over and you just breathe really heavy for like a minute, as hard, as hard as you can. And then when you come up really fast, you're already light-headed. And then your friend puts his hands, his palms and your carotid arteries and just presses kinda light. And then within three seconds you just slide down the wall. Whoa. It was my first time I ever got high. Yeah. But your friends will let you fall and hit your fucking head. Yeah. No, you fall, bounce your hook and head off a curve. You gotta catch him. I gotta knock him out. I got to get Jim. I don't think that's necessarily that bad for you, but it's definitely not good for you, especially when your [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:27:21       Yeah. 11 developing your brown probably shouldn't do it. Don't be choking out, but it's a, it happens all the time in the gym and no one, no one stops that. They get choked unconscious. They wake up and they go back to rolling again and they, the way they talk about it like it's a garden hose, the garden hose shuts off the power to the brain. Then everything's fine, but I'm like, man, you ain't a doctor. God knows how to choke people. Show me some long term studies on dudes who've been choked unconscious multiple times. Show me a doctor making garden hose analogy. Call me a bitch. I'll tap quick. I'm not going unconscious, man. Stop. That's silly. I don't want it. Yeah, I'd go an unconscious thing. Who knows what that's doing? You're going into the Netherlands. He might come back a totally different person. Totally different. Life. Should have been a hundred years. You come back with a false memory of the past. Totally new dementia. Lived a hundred lives since then since I was knocked out. Dad had that happens to guys because when they get hit and knocked out, when

Speaker 4:          02:28:21       they come to, they do not know what happened and they have to be reminded over and over and over again. Uh, I mean it must feel like you woke up and you have the dimension, like it must feel surreal. [inaudible] told me a story after the Dan Anderson fight. He literally had no idea what happened. It was like he had no idea where he was. He didn't even thought he, he thought his fight was a few weeks out still. Yeah, that's what it was. Scary Shit Ben asking. We're saying he has no memory of like anything in the arena. After that, Dan was one of the worst. That's what I was [inaudible] out of the arena. So slow. That was one of the worst knockouts of all time. The amount of power that your flying knee has when you're ducking into it is accentuated because he's going in for the take down and he's got a strong take down.

Speaker 4:          02:29:06       Right. So he's going in with everything he has face first and [inaudible] running at him. Oh my God. It's the hurt. That's the biggest impact I think on sports ever seen as we're talking about football players crushing other. That's the moment of impact. What were the dangerous thing about two football players crashing their bodies into each other. It's exactly that. And they are super athletes creating that momentum. I mean, yes, it's nuts. How crazy is it to be undefeated? Never to lose to anybody. And then that's your one. Your one blemish is like the biggest nonsense. So much shit that it sucks cause I like Bam. I'm a big fan. He's really funny. I then too, he talks so much shit and when you talk shit like that and then you fucking Louis, he's got it. He's got to eat those words. No, he's marketed himself amazingly.

Speaker 4:          02:29:50       And then that's part of the marketing himself is like he has his own down-home version talking shit. You know, like even as boom roasted thing. Like you could tell it's like he's almost kind of playing a doofus character, but he's a very smart guy. Like I had him on the podcast and he sends me book recommendations and Shit. He's like a really well read, interesting guy. He just, that's his character and his in his part of his strategy is to know the fuck out of you. But when you flatlined him like that, after a note, him annoying the fuck out of, you know what's that word? Shodan fraud hasn't, what does that word? Just desserts. What does that call did? I don't know. Something like the [inaudible] the pleasure that you feel from someone else's obvious demise, right? Is that how that sounds right? Is that pleasure derived from another person's misfortune and there you go.

Speaker 4:          02:30:42       That's what it is. Because with that it's like, it's almost like in a weird way, that's what he was trying to get mouse but all to do like go crazy. So the takedowns are there, but if it doesn't work out it goes very bad. Well Mossville doll just took that chance with that flying knee entry and he practiced it over and over and over again and he kind of knew what the way he circled. See the, we circled the circle off to the side and then came out on that way. We'll see. We knew he would go at him with feeding into him that way and so it perfectly taught cause he was coming down from the side. He knew he was going to lean in that way, but he also mounts with all said, he was like, I w I was real confident if he took me down I was going to get back up.

Speaker 4:          02:31:17       And that does kind of demonstrate that like if you're a real concerned about the takedown, you're probably not going to open with sprinting into a flying name, which is one it goes. Mazda doll is not even a dude who is known for being this unbelievable wrestler. But first time I saw Mazda doll was an old school Kimbo slice a Miami backyard fighting video. Yeah, he did those dude [inaudible] he came out and he fought this guy, I think his name was big ray and was guy was like 230 pounds and it was George and it was like 180 pounds. And he can not just boxes dude up. And it was so bad. Like all the kids were followers, like chickens running around the backyard. It was so hardcore. And then he ends up being a, someone to I think Strikeforce a few years later is when I saw him in MMA and uh, he's had a pretty crazy trajectory to be where he's at right now.

Speaker 4:          02:32:00       He is right on the cusp of being, you know, if he, if he give him the title, he'll be one of the biggest stars in the sport. He's one of the best motherfuckers in the sport for sure. There's no doubt about it with everything. He's super well-rounded. He can do everything. His take down defense is amazing. He's got some of the best hands in the division period. I mean, you look at him knocking out Darren till with that leap in left hook. The way, the way he did it, the way he set it up, he landed it earlier and then he landed again. He figured it out. He figured out a spot with this guys open. There's like this dip in what he does. And he found that opening, he's gotten better, right? Like he's definitely like, he's decimal syndicated, he's more dedicated, you know, and now he wants a big payday and so they're probably talking about doing that.

Speaker 4:          02:32:40       Nate Diaz, he'll get a big pay down on that one. That's a big fight. That fight will be huge. Isn't it? Fucked up that it was one is the one that I'm almost out of all of the guys we're talking about, I'm least intrigued to watch fight next. Oh Man, I'm not, I fucking love watching that guy fight cause he's got this marauding relentless style that's very similar to Colbys except he hits harder and he'll, he'll try to take people out. Like Colby Colby just keeps that heat on you. Yeah. But Colby striking technique might be a little bit better. It doesn't hit quite as hard. But the stuff he was showing against Robbie Lawler, those jabs and body kicks and stuff, I mean that was pretty impressive. So he's friends with my buddy cam Hanes and they trained together and uh, can't Cam's description of him. He said, listen, the guy talks all this crazy shit.

Speaker 4:          02:33:22       Right. He's doing it, but he never stopped training. He's just constantly training. That's why he's got that insane cardio. He knows that's as big as weapon. His biggest weapon is he's like, he's like, ready, keep up. Wait, hey, you got to try to keep up and he's fucking going and going and going and going and everybody wills. That's why I'm so interested to see who spawn fight cause he's gonna fight him and Ooh, smog does the same thing to people. That's what he did. I think Tyron, I think there was issues with Tyler and going into that fight. He looks like a shell of himself. It wasn't firing back, but some of that you got to give credit to Ou Swan, that fucking pressure, that relentless pressure is striking, which is just, he knows how to fight long. He's got an incredible fucking ground and pound game.

Speaker 4:          02:34:03       He's got real knockout power and Colby did a similar thing to Robbie Lawler where it kind of looked like, why isn't he firing back? Why isn't hit because he's caught, his back's on the cage getting taken down. He's getting jabbed constantly. I never has a moment to just reset and take a deep breath cause like he's just on you. The whole fight guys didn't use to fight that way. And I, I talked to Colby about this, we were talking about the principle of like how like how hard do you do when you punch in, how already punching. He's like 70% so he just hit him with a steady stream of 70% you never see him bite down and fucking, you never see that those would, DC always likes to call big actions, those big actions, those cost a lot of energy and you've got to figure out when to do those.

Speaker 4:          02:34:42       Maybe you're Francis and Ghana and those big actions lead to ouster Overeem getting knocked into the Netherlands. But if not, then you're going to blow out your gas. Like we saw him with steep Emile church, lifted them over the head in the first round. And how cool does that look that you're holding this huge guy over your head and dropping them. But then after that you kind of just get to take down and he gets back up to his feet. And then by the fourth round you're kind of wondering, is that really good strategy to be lifting these guys over? [inaudible] paid when Steve Bay fought Francis and Ghana. Oh, that one. I managed to avoid the big actions of in Ghana and then wear them out and then take it down and beat him up and retain the title. The only guy that's been able to survive in Ghana, the DC fight is a hard one to watch man, because he's the best guy in the world.

Speaker 4:          02:35:24       He's so nice. I love that guy to death, so watching him get his body destroyed because he kept digging those left hooks the body. I was like, Ooh. Part of me was like, damn, that's a pretty powerful album. Those fucking loud, but it's, it's, it wasn't, it was the crispness of it. He was, he was standing in front of him, popping them and then sliding back and he would just stick that fucking left hook into the liver and he kept hitting it. Part of me was like, man, that is a beautiful left hook, nasty body shots, but pardon me? He's like, damn, DC, you got to get away from that. You got to get outta there. You got to take this guy down. It's hard when you're, when you really love a guy and you watched him fight, it's hard. It's very, very difficult to do commentary.

Speaker 4:          02:36:04       Just what's the pain on the, on the liver punches. What could that or what's the damage that can do this shut shoe that makes you like, I've seen people crumble on, I'm going to hit you with one punch, but show me on a little, you don't want it. It's a horrible feeling where like, like shocks your body, your body goes like it's or show. How about that show Dave, where to hit right here. It's right. You're almost getting shocked. Like electrical lower. If you, if you, if someone is standing in front of you and they hit you with a left hook, most likely they'd be hitting you in the liver. And it's like right where these floating ribs are tucked in. And when you slam someone hard like right around the low, you know, it was um, one of the masters of it is Canelo Alvarez show Canelo Alvarez body shots.

Speaker 4:          02:36:50       Like maybe there's a video we could look, he's got a beautiful one. We steps in and just fucking rips that left hook to the liver and just your body just goes d it just fucking shots down. It's the weirdest feeling man. It's like your legs stop working. Everything stops working your whole body. Just see it looks like it didn't happen to them until that last one. Um, I think he was playing poker face. I think he was playing poker face. [inaudible] Canelo is a fucking master at this shit. He would just dig this thing, look at this. Whoa. That one's only going the kid side and that's going into the side. But most of the time it's go into the liver. Most of the time it, well he's going to anything that's open. Right. But that's the liver. She's going for the liver against Golovkin but Koloff Ken's got that lower, that low guard with his right arm.

Speaker 4:          02:37:32       He's blocking it from happening. The guy was coming up next toxin. So much fun. Like it's a fun sport to do. Well when these kinds of guys are fighting, when triple g and Canelo are fighting like fuck. It's like if you're a fan of the sport, you've seen the highest level two champions in their prime going after it. It's, it's amazing to watch, but that punches a t like and getting hit there is a terrible feeling. And DC got hit there multiple times and he was from like the second round on, he was at, you were talking about it when he was there, but he was just putting his hands down and kind of letting Steve Bay hit him as hard, dangerous way to fight steep Emile church. Like I think he just wanted to put pressure on him and make steep a feel like he didn't deserve to be in there with them.

Speaker 4:          02:38:14       I think maybe in that approach he was, uh, trying to wear him out, which keep the pressure on them and make them discouraged. Or maybe he had genuine disdain for his abilities. Maybe he really didn't think too steep it could hurt him. And he was just eventually going to catch him. And then there was a lot of people that thought because of the way he knocks DP out, maybe Steve Bay isn't as durable as he used to be, right? Because Steve Bay used to take tremendous shots from everybody, but then he got knocked out in one punch by DC after taking tremendous shots in the Ingando fight. So the question would be like, how much damage have they taken that in Gando fight? But then he came back and he ate everything that DC had offer him. He just kept beating him to kid to take it on the Chin and eating it.

Speaker 4:          02:38:53       And eventually he started taking over the fight. And when he started ripping the body in the fourth round, it was like, whoa. He, it was perfect. I mean, I've never seen anybody have better body punches in a championship. That was, that was the thing. There was like a corner call or you think he just like improvise and saw that that was open and he knows how to fight. He saw an opening. Everybody, everybody knows. I mean that's such a standard technique. That's like a corner call. Someone's throwing a leg kick. So it was working. So yeah, it never got blocked. Once he didn't have an answer, it didn't have an answer to it. He didn't duck it. He didn't block it. He didn't, he didn't try to take him down. He just Kinda got stuck stance. The problem with those liver shots too is they SAP your energy so bad and you, you can't make a big move anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:39:35       So you have to kind of pretend like everything's okay. And then Bam, he hits you again and you're like, oh shit, we're in trouble here. But still you're looking like nothing's wrong, but your gas tank is, fuck, everything's on empty and you're fucked. You really can't fire back. That's why DC didn't fire back and he kept getting shot to that body bang. And every time bang, he gets shot to that body. You see it in us. And then Steve [inaudible] got him against the cage and started uncorking punches and DC just didn't have anything. His body was shutting down, didn't have anything in him to stop that onslaught. I mean, it's amazing that guy's the, this deep is the most successful heavyweight in the history of the sport. And during the Cormier, whether he fights again or not, he'll go down.

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       He's one of the greatest ever, you know? But he also is, what is he 42 it's 40 40 40 is that true? I was 48 so that might be two. It could be 42 yeah. You asked 42 when you look at like, you know, do you see what he's done? It's incredible. I mean, and nobody else has ever done that. It's just, it's Kinda, it's probably hard to convince him of that.

Speaker 4:          02:40:38       The big fight is the Steve Bay fight, honestly, because beating guys for the vacated crown with enlight heavyweight is not the same as beating Jon Jones. But beating Steve pay is like being the heavyweight version of Jon Jones. Yeah. That's, that's the biggest accomplishment ever. And I'd liked him at heavyweight because he wasn't getting drained. But I just don't think that was, I mean I don't think, I don't know, maybe couldn't have fought him any other way, but I don't think that was the best strategy, the dropping of the hands and the moving toward him with the stain, but me maybe that would have worked on some guys and maybe that has worked on other guys like rumble Johnson and worked on him. You know, he mean he eventually puts that heat on you and so many guys crack under that heat. Do you want to see as a friend, do you want to see him fight a third fight that is entirely dependent upon where his head's at?

Speaker 4:          02:41:24       I mean if he, first of all, I'm sure he's a very intelligent guy with a lot of years of competition under his belt, whether it's Olympics, PR, you know, wrestling at the highest level, whether it's UFC strike force before that he's fought for a long time. Nobody needs to tell him when to make decisions when not. He's emotional right now. I'm sure he's going to take some time off and he'll probably consult with his family and probably figure out what he wants to do. But I bet if I had to guess his competitive instincts are going to tell him that he could have at least one more fight and that it would be a rematch with Steve Bay because he was dominating the first round and he let it get away from him and he wasn't listening to his corner, you know, crazy. Bob Cook was yelling in his corner, keep your damn hands up.

Speaker 4:          02:42:08       You know, he didn't like it. Bob Cook didn't like it. He respected [inaudible]. He's a giant man. He's a fucking big motherfucker. Big Long, tall Croatian. And he's tough as shit man. And I think because Daniel knocked him out in the first round and the first fight, you know, uh, he, he believed he could knock 'em out again, but Steve Bay could take a Goddamn shot this time. You know, I mean, yeah. You never know why a guy gets knocked out that way with one punch. I mean, it was a perfect punch for sure. I mean, the way he threw it, it was beautiful the way he threw it from inside the clench. It comes over the top of the shoulder blam and lends that perfect punch, that chaos. I mean it was amazing. Yeah. But

Speaker 5:          02:42:46       it was also such a competitive fight that I'm super intrigued to see a third fight. You know, it's not like it's not a foregone conclusion. The CPA is going to be able to do that again. Daniel could be adjusted and come out with a better game plan. 100% he could win that fight. Um, and it's, in my opinion, the best fighter heavyweight competitively. I don't think, I ain't gone, it'd be a good fight, but I think the CPA wants that. Again, I'm not convinced. I mean I think in gone who might be the next guy? I mean, I think he might be the champ for while he's definitely

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       got what it takes because he's got one thing that 100% one punch knockout power, 100% not a fucking humans going to be there if he full-on connects and smashes one through your guard. Everyone goes, night-night everyone, 100% of the humans that have ever walked here, if that guy punches you full blast, but it's whether or not he's gonna be able to do that to steep back. We all thought he had a chance of doing it the first time, but Steve, I shut it down and you know, maybe, maybe he's better now, but maybe Steve Bay is going to come into this fight even more energized ever after beating DC and winning his title back. I mean, maybe he's gonna. Maybe he saw something from that fight that if he had to do it again, he would have implemented really quickly. You know,

Speaker 5:          02:43:56       Deep Abd Dude, he did not want to take another fight. He was do whatever place he was in. He was fucking in his firehouse list, hit up his boots. Everybody's thinking about getting that title back. He does not want to lose that title again

Speaker 4:          02:44:07       for ignore. No Man was weird. Everybody was so concentrated on the Brock Lesnar idea that they were ignoring them.

Speaker 5:          02:44:14       It was, it's weird because when somebody said that the other day, whatever publication was talking about CBD being the greatest heavyweight of all time, this is before the fight. Um, I remember going like Izzy and then you start listing off his credentials and you realize that he has the most defenses. He's also fought the most competitive, um, titled Defensive as title defenses as well. Um, then u s it becomes a little more apparent, but I kind of under, I almost understand it because even as the, and I'm a pretty big fan of the sport, but I remember just, I wasn't like chomping at the bit for the rematch for him. It wasn't like I was like, oh I really want to see that. Steepy damn corny. I remember mentioned, I can't even put my finger on why.

Speaker 4:          02:44:52       Oh I did. I wanted to see it bad. I wanted to see real bad cause I wanted to see, and I liked the fact it was 13 months later. So I think it gave his body some time to heal up. I think you fight in Ghana, it's like getting hit by a train. I mean, you might live

Speaker 5:          02:45:06       Michael [inaudible] wine into a fucking tree and come down a day later. What happened? Like when DJ Jazzy Jeff will get thrown out of the club. Yeah, but I think he's,

Speaker 4:          02:45:20       if he keeps it together, he's the next guy. I mean he's the next guy in line to be the champion. I mean he has everything to lose his, he has the championship to lose if it steep bay retires. When Steve Bay's done, Frances is the fucking man and maybe, maybe Francis beats him in a rematch. Who knows? Again, all he has to do is connect. He'd be a different guy in the rematch. He would understand what it's like to go five hard rounds with the guy who could take you down and beat you up. He would understand that his wrestling has to be on point. His Cardio has to be on point and there's not going to be times where he can 100% unload and know for sure the guy's not gonna be there because the guy survived and he didn't have the gas tank for the remaining four rounds.

Speaker 4:          02:45:56       And so this is going to be a new guy that Steve Bay fights and he might very well just play it smooth and just stay on the outside and pick his shots. And then when he gets him hurt then uncork. I mean we don't know, but we know Steve Bay might take them down quicker this time. Maybe CPA mid say fuck all this standup dude, let's just wrestle. You know, he just like come at him a couple, pump a few jabs and shoot a fucking double on him and take it down. Dude, he took down D C Steve paid took down d c that's giant. The only other guy I've ever, who's ever done that as John Jones and Steve, I did it more emphatically, you know? I mean it was pretty God damn impressive. Well that's the other one at uh, at heavyweight. I want to see I before John John's retires.

Speaker 4:          02:46:34       I want to see him play at heavyweight. Yes. That's what I want to see. Sean John's at 235 pounds. Fuck yes. Steroids to the gills. Graham's fallen on his ass. Just fucking monster. Dude. I would love to see if he could handle steep a m or if Cormier one of that fight I if day in court, me and John Jones wanted to fight again, I'd want to see that fight at heavyweight. Well I guarantee you if John Jones fights at heavyweight, he'll probably be at just what he walks around at because the word around Jackson's was that he would wrestle with heavyweights and just ranked all of them. That he would throw people around the gym. I mean when I talked to Tate Fletcher when he was down there and other guys who trained with John when John was down at Jackson's a as a light heavyweight champion was just ragdoll and heavyweights.

Speaker 4:          02:47:18       He's a phenomenally powerful guy and you really saw them, the Cormier fight like I think for me it was shocked in that first fight of how fucking strong John Is. I mean he's a long thin guy, but he is ridiculously strong and I think as a heavyweight EBL fuck load to handle for a lot of guys. I want to say and I think he actually, he has a star power too. I think that puts the UFC on the map in a weird way cause they haven't really had the major star as a heavyweight champion. Like that fucking dude who is like best in the world, pound for pound, best as a heavyweight champion as the heavyweight champion. But if John could be [inaudible] that would be that. Cause he's, he's definitely the best pound for pound fighter in the UFC right now. Definitely. You look at his accomplishments, it's arguably he's the best pound for pound fighter ever.

Speaker 4:          02:48:02       Cause he's really never lost that one. Matt Hamill fight to try to reverse that cause it was a bad decision. It was a bad decision. Dude was a bad decision. This is a bad decision. There's disqualify. Yeah, make it a no contest. So he's still undefeated. That's what it really should have gone. My only problem with it is it really should be a victory. Crushed him. Oh yeah. It was ridiculous. She doesn't feel like it's a waste. The thing is like the guy's never really lost. So if you look at his, his career, like who the fuck can say that? Who the fuck has fought like Leo Machida, Rashad Evans, rampage Jackson, the top of the food chain over and over generations, three generations, four different generations of the best guys. Gustafson, everybody look at that. There's actually a number like there, the, that one loss on his record.

Speaker 4:          02:48:43       If you could really break it down. There was some sort of like statistics that could come in and really look at it. There's a number, an amount of money that he's lost because he has that loss on his record. Whether whatever, is it more marketability? Maybe? Who knows? There's something. It definitely, there has to be some things. Otherwise I have to go. You do have to go to shit or wrap this pitch up. All right gentlemen, thank you. As always, you cucked out again until now. That was good. I was going to come in Bob face, they wouldn't let me so we stopped it, so I appreciate you guys. I appreciate it. Gang fest. I think it's awesome what you guys are doing for comedy. I really do. You're right. You're just going for it and that's what we need more of. We need more of people that are doing real comedy, and you guys do it. I appreciate the fuck out of it and I support you at every turn. Oh, thanks. [inaudible] the man. We really appreciate it. Love you buddy. Bye fuckers.

Speaker 6:          02:49:32       That's fine.
