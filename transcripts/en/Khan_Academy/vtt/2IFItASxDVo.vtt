00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.439
Voiceover:What I want to
show you in this video is

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.371
what could be described
as, I guess, a trick for

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.374
finding binomial expansions, especially

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.167
binomial expansions where
the exponent is fairly large.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:11.777
But what I want you to do after this video

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.105
is think about how this
connects to the binomial theorem

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.311
and how it connects to Pascal's Triangle.

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.306
Now let me show you the trick.

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:22.635
I'm going to take (X+Y)^7.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.435
That's going to have eight terms.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:25.167
How do I know that?

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.370
Well (X+Y)^1 has two
terms, it's a binomial.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.306
(X+Y)^2 has three terms.

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:32.714
(X+Y)^3 has four terms.

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:34.694
So this is going to have eight terms.

00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:37.774
Let me just create little
buckets for each of the terms.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:38.978
This is the bucket, these aren't the

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:40.513
coefficients these are just the buckets.

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:45.971
1st term, 2nd term, 3rd term, 4th term,

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:53.442
5th term, 6th term,
7th term, and 8th term.

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:58.109
Now lets write out the actual X's and Y's.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.106
The first term, we're
going to start with X^7.

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:07.312
Then each term after that our degree or

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:09.709
our power on the X goes down by one.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:19.706
So you go X^6, X^5, X^4, X^3, X^2, X^1,

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:20.973
we could just write that as X, and this is

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:24.310
going to be X^0, which
is just going to be one.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.844
Now lets think about Y.

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:27.313
This is going to start at Y^0,

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:28.846
which is just one so I'm
not going to write it,

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:40.235
Then it's going to be Y^1,
Y^2, Y^3, Y^4, Y^5, Y^6,

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:43.233
and then Y^7 and you can
verify you got it right

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:47.173
because for each term, the
exponents should add up to seven.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.108
You see that even here.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.312
This is X^1 times Y^6.

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:53.637
Those add up to be seven.

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:55.781
Now, lets get to the interesting part,

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.842
which is actually
calculating the coefficient.

00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:02.577
And the algorithm is for
each term right over here,

00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:04.168
so lets just start, we
know the coefficient

00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:07.041
right over here is going to be one.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.236
Actually, let me write that down.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:12.514
The coefficient over
here is going to be one.

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:16.703
So for each term, the
coefficient right over here,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.977
I'm going to try to color-code
it so we can see it,

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:24.836
the coefficient is
going to be the exponent

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:28.634
of the previous term, so the
exponent of the previous term

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:33.447
in this case is the seven, the
exponent of the previous term,

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:41.772
times the coefficient of the
previous term, divided by

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:45.646
which term that actually
was, so divided by the term.

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:47.711
That was the 1st term,
so now the coefficient

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:49.634
on the 2nd term is seven
times one divided by seven,

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:59.309
which is going to be equal to seven.

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.436
Now what about this one?

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:03.635
We use the exact same process.

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.439
The exact same process.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.178
It is going to be the exponent
on the X term, I guess

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:15.505
you could say the exponent on
X, I guess we could go with.

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:18.647
The exponent on the X, which is six, times

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:21.239
the coefficient of the previous term,

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.104
so times seven, so we're
taking the X power times

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:29.770
the coefficient of the
previous term, so times seven.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.912
So the X part of the previous term,

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:32.707
times the coefficient
of the previous term,

00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:35.033
divided by the actual,
I guess you could say,

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:39.100
index of the previous
term, so divided by two.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.238
So what is that going to be?

00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:43.112
So this is the equivalent
to three times seven,

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:47.313
so this is going to be equal to 21.

00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:51.641
And now lets go to this
term, exact same idea.

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.976
Go to the previous term,
what's our exponent on X?

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:56.644
It is five.

00:03:56.644 --> 00:04:00.107
Lets multiply it times the coefficient,

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.772
so lets multiply it times
21, and then lets divide it

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:08.965
by which term that is,
so that was the 3rd term.

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:12.443
So this is going to be, lets see,

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.443
five times 21 over three is seven,

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:18.911
so this is going to be
35, five times seven.

00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.038
And we can keep going, or we can

00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:24.303
recognize that there's a symmetry here.

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:27.910
If this is one, then the last
term is also going to be one.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.179
If the second term is seven, then

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:35.378
the second-to-last term is seven.

00:04:35.378 --> 00:04:38.768
If the third term is 21, then the

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:41.378
third term to the last is 21.

00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:44.441
And then if the 4th term is 35,

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.913
then the fourth from the last is 35.

00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:48.909
And just like that, we have figured

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:55.833
out the expansion of (X+Y)^7.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:57.888
Pretty neat, in my mind.
