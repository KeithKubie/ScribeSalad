1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,770
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,930
N y. S. C. H. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,630
All right. K. Yup. I want to start
with a parental daydream for a second.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,710
It's an idea that's been kicking around
for me since my kids were born. Okay.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,370
Actually the idea itself is pretty
old. It goes back to the 18 hundreds,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,730
right around Napoleon's time to a
fellow by the name of John Baptist,

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,193
Pierre Antwan, Monisha Bulgaria,

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,880
the Lamar Lamarck Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
who according to writer, same keen.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,870
He was really, uh, one of the
first grand theorists in biology.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,970
He actually coined the word biology
to really? Yup. His big idea,

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,871
as you might know,

12
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,310
is that what a person does in their
lifetime could be directly passed to their

13
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:52,270
kids very easily. His famous
example was giraffes. Lamarck said,

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,380
do you want to know how a giraffe
got his long neck one day?

15
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,000
This giraffe mother draft,

16
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:01,650
let's say he was looking up into tree
and saw some fruit and had to stretch her

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,920
neck and stretch again,
whole lifetime stretching.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,110
And then when she had a baby stretching,

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,690
got into the baby and then that baby
would stretch and stretch and stretch and

20
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:13,260
him give a little more stretching to its
baby and eventually over the millennia,

21
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,100
what you'd get is a creature with a very
long neck because they're reaching for

22
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,610
the tops of trees. It makes a
kind of common sense really.

23
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,010
It does and it does make
kind of a folk sense.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,090
He thought it worked with humans to his
example with humans was a blacksmith.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,150
He thought that because they're
swinging hammers all day,

26
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,540
they got big bulky muscles and then
they would pass the muscles to their

27
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,374
children.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,490
The sneaky idea here is that
the blacksmiths, the giraffes,

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,970
they made it happen. They
will the neck to get longer,

30
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,840
the muscles to get bigger,

31
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,800
and the key point is that it
wasn't something in born in them.

32
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,680
It was something they acquire
during their lifetime,

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,660
which they passed to their kids. Right,

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,200
and that's wrong. That's not how it works.

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,050
We're telling you now know that that's
not the case, but, but it'd be nice

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,600
if that's how it worked. Let's,
let's read the book first

37
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,020
because you know, now that I've
got these two kids right now, I'll

38
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,060
find myself thinking like, okay, I know
these kids have their jeans half for me,

39
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,420
half for my wife, and I know
I can't change those genes.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
I know fate is going to give them a
couple of random mutations in those genes

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,580
that I have no control over that.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,160
It's just the cold logic of Darwinian
evolution. What's offensive?

43
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:37,550
I mean the idea that they could
be constrained by their DNA,

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,450
maybe one of us gave them a bit of
DNA that's going to hold them back.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,520
It's a terrible thoughts. This letter
right here. How about this one?

46
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,340
And so what you do, I
think all parents do this,

47
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:53,870
is that you slip into this Lamarckian
delusion that knows what you do with your

48
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:57,380
kids could somehow rewrite all that that
you can somehow by just being nice them

49
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,130
reading them stories or
whatever, that you could break

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,150
them free of all that. Rewrite
their, their, their blueprint. Like,

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,180
I dunno, you don't really say it
to yourself that way, but yeah,

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,650
you can make a deep difference. Yeah.
Like you can help them overcome you.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,940
Is that cool? Hello?
No, you can't. I know.

54
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,090
That's what Darwin says.
You can't, I know, I know.

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,660
[inaudible]

56
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,261
once they're born,

57
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:26,760
their genes are fixed and change does
not happen in a generation or two.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,200
It happens in really,
really, really slowly.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,060
Gradually. Achingly slowly one parents
stretching isn't going to do anything.

60
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:40,560
See that's the bummer of
Darwinian evolution. As a
parent, you are a tiny blip

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,670
and a very, very long story.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,033
[inaudible]

63
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,780
but this hour we're gonna fight this
sort of sad sack feeling of inevitability

64
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,890
and impotence and rewrite the so-called
rules of genetics. That's right.

65
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,370
Today on radio lab, we are going to
lick some rat, starve some Swedes there.

66
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,670
Realized some women. I mean we're
not going to do that ourselves. No,

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,820
but we're going to play the stories
where these things actually happen. Yes.

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,490
I'm Chad. I Rod, I'm Robert Krulwich
this is Radiolab. Stick around.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,073
It's gonna get messy.

70
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,290
[inaudible]

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,710
okay, so let's get going. Uh,

72
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,660
and stick with your boy to the
mark just for a second. Okay.

73
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,860
Cause we were talking to science right
across Zimmer and he told us that back in

74
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,060
the early 19 hundreds, this, um,

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,310
tension between the mark and
Darwin got extra tense. Yeah.

76
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,420
In a sort of fascinating way.
Right. And it all started in Vienna

77
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,350
at this really marvelous
place called the vie varium.

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,460
[inaudible] yeah,

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,190
this was a really radical place at the
time because you have to remember that

80
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:00,530
people studying animals up til
now, they were basically, you know,

81
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,500
studying a preserved specimen and so on
at the Vive varium as the name suggests,

82
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,363
they have

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,210
man, it was like a zoo.

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,230
Well it was a zoo where there was
all sorts of experiments going on,

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,380
you know, the fact is that
taking care of animals,

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,200
trying to keep them alive in a
building is not an easy thing,

87
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,270
especially if it's 1903.

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,470
But Luckily for the vive and
for our story, they had a guy,

89
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,030
Paul Kammerer, who was he?
Um, so he, and when was he?

90
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,320
He was born in 1880 in Vienna,
Jewish family, by all accounts.

91
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:38,960
A pretty good looking guy
in, in pictures. He has that,

92
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,700
you know that crazy Einstein fuzzy hair
thing. Virginia's cut. Yep. He's 22,

93
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,710
23 and you already had this reputation
for being amazing at keeping animals

94
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,870
alive that otherwise would just die.

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,420
His reputation was, did he could get
inside the mind of say a salamander.

96
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,310
I know just

97
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,570
what it wanted to eat or how much
humidity it preferred. Right.

98
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,560
He was a born nurturer and he adored
animals. He actually named his daughter,

99
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,440
uh, less Serta, which
is a genus of Lizard.

100
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,020
That's the Kinda guy he is.

101
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:17,021
So of course the folks at the varium
asked him to build these terrariums and

102
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,700
aquariums and stock them with animals,

103
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,860
including a particular in fib Ian, that
plays a very big part in this story.

104
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,470
The midwife towed the midwife
towed, right? That's right.
You're Sam Kean again.

105
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,890
And here's, he says what you need
to know about the midwife tote.

106
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,210
Basically the midwife toad has a strange
habit for toads. Most toads, he says,

107
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,410
love to stay in the water.

108
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,770
They like to hang out in the water and
the females like to lay eggs in the

109
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,240
water. But with the midwife toad,

110
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,660
the female lays her eggs on land and
then the male midwife toad comes along,

111
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,030
grabs the eggs and actually kind
of sticks them to his back legs,

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,160
like a bunch of whitish grapes and then
hops around with them basically until

113
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:03,940
they hatch. So he's got to live his life
as a towed with all this baggage on him

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,540
just until they hatch and then til
they go off still it's a burden if he's

115
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,790
carrying a big burden there. Is
your wife going to hear this?

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,910
She cares your kids for nine months
and you're like that par mail toad.

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,060
Anyhow, so you've got this Guy Paul
Camera, who's good with animals.

118
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:23,980
You've got these toads who hate water
and in one day we can imagine he gets

119
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:28,080
curious as he's doing his rounds,
he stops by the midwife toads where,

120
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,240
and he looks down at that little mail
towed with a grape stuck to his legs and

121
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:36,220
he wonders how adaptable is that
little guy. I mean, he hates water.

122
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,030
Females seem to hate laying eggs in the
water, but is that the end of the story?

123
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,580
What would happen if I
made them go in the water?

124
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,360
Could they adapt? I know what I'll do.

125
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,890
I'm going to set up a terrarium for
them and I'm going to make it hot,

126
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,970
really uncomfortably hot, but I'm
going to give them a base and a water.

127
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,530
Nice, cool water, and he would
basically turn the heat way,

128
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,550
way up in music aquariums until
they had to go under water.

129
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,820
You can imagine these tilts are
like, dammit, fine. All right,

130
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,160
I'll get in the water. Maybe
they'd try and jump back out,

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,090
but it was still hot so they'd
have to jump back in and sit.

132
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,690
The camera kept the heat up.

133
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,910
Toads basically had to stay there in this
watery place that they had not evolved

134
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,640
for. Darwin's theory
would have said, you know,

135
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,650
90% of the toads are going to die.

136
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,110
There's going to be this massacre of
toads and only a few lucky ones are going

137
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,320
to survive. And those lucky ones,
according to Darwin's theory,

138
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,030
they would've had to have been born
with some random mutation in their genes

139
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,120
that gave them an
advantage in this situation

140
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,770
and that advantage, whatever it was,

141
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,300
because it starts with one individual
and then it gets passed onto the kids and

142
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,500
then onto their kids.
It would take a long,

143
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,130
a long, long time to
spread through the whole

144
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,600
population because generally that's
how evolution works. It takes awhile.

145
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,070
But according to camera, here's
what happened. When he heat it up,

146
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:09,480
the toads little cage that hit spend
more time in the water as expected.

147
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,200
And when it came time to mate,
the males and the females,

148
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,730
they would meet in the water and at first
didn't go so well because you know if

149
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,430
you're Atlanto and you trying to have
sex in the water, it's kind of hard.

150
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,770
Your slippery partner's slippery.

151
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,170
You just have it evolved for
this and there's no way you can,

152
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,230
at least not quickly,
but according to camera,

153
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:33,090
shortly after these toads got into the
water, they did begin to evolve fast.

154
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,850
They began to grow these little
puffy things on their hands,

155
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,300
the these kind of rough scratchy pads,

156
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,290
what's known as a nuptual
pad, nuptial path, right.

157
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,100
It was just what the males needed so
they can grab onto the female and hold

158
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,890
tight while they're mating. And
they didn't have these on land? No,

159
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,050
they did not have them on land. They
just appeared in the water. Yup.

160
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,630
And how long did it take right away,
Willie? In just two generations.

161
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,430
These toads seem to have done something
that should have taken, I dunno,

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,010
50 a hundred generations maybe
more camera thought. Wow.

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,060
They can respond to the environment.
Do we revealing it with experiments?

164
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,920
They're not trapped by their genes.

165
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,350
Around 1908 he starts publishing all of
these results and it's big news and he

166
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,960
grabbed his toads and he hit the road.

167
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,090
He hit the lecture
circuit and he hit it big.

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,830
He was known for going around and giving
what he called his big show lectures

169
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,950
where he would wow whole
audiences of people.

170
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,730
And in 1923 he actually comes to England.

171
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,070
There was a newspaper
called the daily express,

172
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,750
and they have these headlines that
come out. It says race of Superman.

173
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,660
That's the headline for his
doc race. And below that,

174
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,730
right below the headline it says,
scientists, great discovery,

175
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,240
which made change as all what's
he talking about? I said,

176
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,360
we're just talking
about a tote. I thought,

177
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,920
it's not just talking about toads anymore.

178
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,510
He's gone way beyond toads key
extended this idea to people.

179
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,010
He thought that you could kind of
engineer societies by changing the

180
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,540
environment. I just have
to read this to you.

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,200
The results make it probable that our
descendants will learn more quickly.

182
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,034
What we know well,

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,060
we'll execute more easily what we
have accomplished with great effort,

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,480
we'll be able to withstand what injured
does almost to the point of death where

185
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,870
we sought. They will find where
we began. They will account

186
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,800
and this idea won him a lot of fans,
including not surprisingly the Soviets.

187
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, it was a very attractive theory
to them in Moscow because the Soviets,

188
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,770
they believed in Karl Marx's idea that
human beings are an improvable species.

189
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,160
That if you can change the conditions
around people, you change the people.

190
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,150
Your camera was saying, you know,
you can do this even on a physical,

191
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,793
but

192
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,401
you know,

193
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:50,500
there are a lot of skeptics and there
were from the beginning when Cameron

194
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,220
published his results initially
a bunch of immediately began

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,420
to say, wait a minute, hold on here.
It'd be nice if life was like that.

196
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,690
But life isn't like that. Life is hard.

197
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,940
People can't just will themselves into
a more perfect form according to Darwin,

198
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,800
life and changes are ruled by chance
and fate and to believe anything else

199
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,640
that's naive. So this whole toad
thing to the Darwinian faction,

200
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,080
it didn't scan really.

201
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,000
So some scientists began to ask camera
if they could look at his totes and just

202
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,350
take a little peak for themselves
and every time Canberra or said, no,

203
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,620
they were his specimen, get your own.

204
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
It was kind of this
struggle for a few years.

205
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,930
Then world war one came and that
kind of disrupted everything.

206
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,310
Camera for one was sent off to work as
a sensor for the Austrian military and

207
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,780
his lab ended up getting
destroyed, including all his toads,

208
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
except he had one,

209
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,423
one,

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,640
he had one remaining midwife

211
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,130
towed to this whole debate, two
totally different ways of seeing life.

212
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,050
It all came down to this jar with his
towed in it and you have to bear in mind

213
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:59,410
that at this point it
only had one hand left

214
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,320
the right and had been cut off
for, for microscopic slides.

215
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,710
And so you could only see one nuptial
pad and it all comes down to this and

216
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,090
all of it was just about to fall
apart. What happened? Well there was a,

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,480
a uh, expert on reptiles
named g Kingsley Noble

218
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,840
Gladwin Kingsley Noble [inaudible] sounds
like trouble. And he was for camera.

219
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,020
He was mighty skeptical. So he, uh,

220
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,240
he actually went to Vienna,

221
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,490
visited cameras lab when camera wasn't
there and he makes a very careful study

222
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,570
of this hand. Andy, when he examined it,

223
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,530
he noticed that there
was a syringe hole there.

224
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,790
And he says, this isn't a nuptial pad.

225
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,170
It looks darkened, but that's just ink.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,410
What do you mean ink ink? Like the big no,

227
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,890
like India ink. What?
Yes, he doctored the toad.

228
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,950
That was the implication except camera
or tried to defend himself by saying,

229
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,560
do you think I'm a dumb cop or an idiot?

230
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,070
Because that's what I would have to be
if I left a forgery with ink standing

231
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,910
around openly in the laboratory where
so many of my enemies would have entry.

232
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,590
So how did he explain it? Well,

233
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,840
he thought it might've been an assistant
trying to frame him because he was

234
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:35,140
Jewish and you know, there was kind
of antisemitism growing at this time.

235
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,210
So he thought that someone had framed him.

236
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,330
And six weeks after a noble
published his results in nature,

237
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,740
camera rose sent a letter to Mascoutah
turning down a job that they'd offered

238
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:52,220
him because it would reflect
badly on the Soviet. And then

239
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,370
following day camera puts on a suit and
he walks off into the mountains outside

240
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,910
Vienna on a rocky mountain trail, and

241
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,663
he shoots himself.

242
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Chase Lamarckism

243
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,690
pretty much died there.

244
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,840
Uh, uh, uh,

245
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,303
uh,

246
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,040
uh,

247
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,470
so then over the next 70 some odd years,

248
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,360
lamarck basically became the poster
boy for like the big dumb idea.

249
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,000
The idea that you want to believe in,

250
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,780
but that, you know, isn't true,
but, but, but there's, but there's,

251
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,220
there's like some hope here because, um,
okay. All right. This is interesting.

252
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,720
Then Carl told us about this
research that showed that if,

253
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,120
if a mother really couldn't quite
remember the details, does what a mother,

254
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,580
a mutual for Carl mouse or rat, I'm trying
to remember. Was it rats or mice? No,

255
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,560
it's rats. Rats, Yup. We ended up
talking to the guy who did the work.

256
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,870
Michael Meaney I think.
Yep. I'm a professor in

257
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,703
the Faculty of Medicine at McGill
McGill University in Montreal.

258
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,810
So here's the backstory. About 30
years ago I was in undergraduate,

259
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,910
Michael was in school and he got
interested in a very, very basic question,

260
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,530
but how things get passed down. Like,

261
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:30,530
have you ever had one of those moments
where you suddenly are your dad and it

262
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,200
catches you off guard? Oh, of
course. I mean it's pretty common.

263
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,370
But like here's a, for instance,

264
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,850
my dad from my entire life had this
thing where if someone was whistling,

265
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,780
he'd be so, he would like,

266
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,660
they could be whistling six tables over
to a restaurant and he would turn around

267
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,210
and be like, stop that. Like it was like,

268
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,230
it was scraping his very nerves and the
other day someone was whistling and I

269
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,730
was like, stop it. And it just hit
me. I was like, Oh God, that was hit.

270
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,890
It's never appeared until now. And you
went to like weird. Did that come from,

271
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,430
is that a genetic hatred of whistling
that I just had or did I somehow learn

272
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:02,060
that that in a sort of ass backward
way, it was Michael's question,

273
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,810
how does that happen? How do these
simple little traits get passed forward?

274
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,750
So, so we started looking at
maternal care. Many years later he,

275
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:15,320
and this woman, Francis Champagne,
who now works at Columbia University,

276
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:18,680
they decided to explore this
question looking at in rats.

277
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,370
So we have our rats in
the lab and they thought,

278
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,330
let's just see if we can figure out how
it is that rat mothers pass down their

279
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:29,750
parenting skills. That's right.
If you were a great rat, mommy,

280
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,860
what would you be doing with your baby?
You would be looking them quite a lot.

281
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,890
Uh, that's what good rat mothers
do. They look their babies a lot,

282
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:41,240
but she says you can tell right away just
by looking at some rat moms don't look

283
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,610
their kids a lot. There's a
normal distribution, right?

284
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,610
You got your good parents and your bad
parents would they decided to do first

285
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,310
was to try to figure out which rat
was which, which meant interestingly

286
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,130
counting all the licks,
putting this into context,

287
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:58,131
you know you have a rat mom and they
have about 16 to 20 babies all at once at

288
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:02,550
once and we're watching 40 litters
at a time. How do you count those?

289
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,290
That's 40. That's too hard. You have to
look at one cage say, are they licking?

290
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,730
Yes. No. Okay. Move on to the next cage.
Yes, no, move on to the next cage. Yes.

291
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,630
No. You have to do that for five
hours a day for six consecutive days.

292
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:19,410
Move on to the next cage. Yes. No,
move on to the next cage. Yes. No.

293
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,280
See, this is the story of science
that that doesn't get told.

294
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,700
Just mind crushing tedium. Yes.
Yeah. The next day. Yes. No.

295
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,190
Yeah. It drifts into something like
a shopping channel. In any case,

296
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,460
what they saw the end of all this
counting was, well, first of all,

297
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,970
what they saw was this pattern that rat
pups who got licked a lot as babies when

298
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:39,804
they grew up,

299
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
they lick their babies a lot and the rat
pups who didn't get licked a lot when

300
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,860
they grew up, they didn't
look their babies a lot.

301
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,940
So the great rat nightmare comes true
with the females become their mothers.

302
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,493
Okay.

303
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,510
I think that makes a lot of
sense actually. It's kind
of obvious, right? Right.

304
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,750
Yeah. I mean, we all kind of know this,

305
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,330
that there are cycles of
abuse or whatever. You know,

306
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:07,300
like if you're abused as a kid, you
were more likely to abuse your kid.

307
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,530
It's still, you've got a wonder

308
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,790
why. Why would that happen?
How do those cycles perpetuate?

309
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
I mean like with the licking,
is it a teaching thing

310
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,640
where you know,

311
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,110
the babies become good mothers because
they've learned it by watching their

312
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:23,170
mothers, they've seen it and
they've repeated the experience,

313
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,290
or does it get passed on such a deep
level that doesn't even require teaching?

314
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,780
What do you mean? So that's
the reason of course,

315
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,600
that we work with rats because
we can get inside the brain.

316
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,270
So Michael and Francis looked
inside the brains of these rats,

317
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:40,390
and what they saw was that the rats
had been licked a lot as babies.

318
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,830
They had more stuff in their head. What
do you mean? One more brains up more.

319
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,660
What kind of stuff brings us more up?

320
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:50,470
More of this particular kind of protein
that activates maternal behavior.

321
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,620
When rats have more of this protein,
they will act more motherly. And they,

322
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,330
they had more. So we'll think
about what makes proteins

323
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,840
DNA. Well, yes. Genes and
DNA. Yeah. Don't you see some,

324
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,000
how the mother's tongue is getting all
the way down in there and going messing

325
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:10,040
with the baby's DNA? Is
that what you're saying?

326
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:14,830
That the leaking is changing the
baby's DNA. That's what I know.

327
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm quite saying that because
you know that that's out. Again,

328
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,460
that's the rule against the rules.
You can't change your DNA. Yeah.

329
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:21,020
You can't touch that. It's off limits.

330
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,960
But that tone is doing
something to the DNA.

331
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,033
So what is [inaudible]

332
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,580
the licking doing that,
that's, that's our challenge.

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,590
Do you have any theories for how this
tongue is tickling the DNA or whatever

334
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,830
it's doing? Um, well so then,

335
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,230
so what Michael just
launched into this thing.

336
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
What happens when moms lick their
pups is that the puppy comes aroused.

337
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,100
The reason they're more
aroused is that the mom's

338
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,933
licking

339
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,110
activates the release of adrenaline
and noradrenaline in the pop.

340
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,630
He says those two chemicals
kick off certain hormonal
systems and one of them is

341
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,190
called the thyroid system.

342
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Irate hormones then get into the brain
and they turn on certain neurochemical

343
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:10,724
signals.

344
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:16,050
And the neurochemical signal that gets
activated during licking is Serotonin as

345
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,520
in the mood chemical. Yup.

346
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,580
So mom's looking activates serotonin and
it's released onto brain cells in the

347
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:26,080
hippocampus. You still with me?

348
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,640
I think I'm with you started with
the tongue four or five steps later.

349
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,380
We are in brain cells,

350
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,130
so almost instantaneously the mother's
tongue has reached into the baby's brain

351
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,964
cells.

352
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,760
Now inside the cells in the center
coiled up little spools is the DNA,

353
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,970
so we're getting close to the
moment of truth. It's there. It is.

354
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,750
That's the stuff that makes you you,
but that you supposedly can't get to.

355
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,340
But here's what I did not know
about DNA. According to Francis,

356
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,770
it's not just sitting off.
They're perfectly preserved.

357
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,720
It's in the middle of
the cell, it's crowded.

358
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,100
You've got all these chemicals
around racing by, you know,

359
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,830
in the south and very often
one of them will just go

360
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,280
crashing into the DNA

361
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,710
and it'll stick there like a, like a
barnacle or a glob of peanut butter.

362
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,750
Exactly. Peanut butter. There we go.

363
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,530
What will happen is it'll get stuck to
one little part of the DNA and now that

364
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,080
little bit of DNA is
very difficult to get at.

365
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,890
It's basically unusable because it's
got the thing stuck to it. Yeah,

366
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,840
and these things are called
apparently methyl groups.

367
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,460
Methyl groups are pretty sticky.
They're hard to get off. So

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,450
imagine the DNA in that brain cell,

369
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,690
all of these chemicals racing by
crashing into it, sticking in.

370
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:42,010
One of the bits that gets covered up is
that little bit that makes the proteins

371
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,110
that create a maternal instinct,

372
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,240
the bit of DNA that we'll give this baby
when it grows up instincts to be nice

373
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,350
to its baby and lick them. And you're
saying that part of the DNA is covered up?

374
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,870
Yes. And when methyl groups
stick to that part of the DNA,

375
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:58,330
the maternal instinct is
effectively turned off.

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,060
But if you've got a mom who licks you,

377
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,680
mom's looking activates serotonin.

378
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,440
Serotonin gets into the brain
cells and according to Michael,

379
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,880
unleashes a whole series of
molecular events inside the cell.

380
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,960
The critical part of this is
it all these changes wake up,

381
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,710
this little gang of proteins
known as transcription factors.

382
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,940
And if they see methyl groups sitting
on that bit of DNA, they are pissed.

383
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,020
And so they bring water friends to the
party, they all go down to the DNA,

384
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,450
surround that methyl and just

385
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,290
knock it right off the DNA. That's it.

386
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,950
And then they're going to basically
revel at that particular spot.

387
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,440
Turn on that gene.

388
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,190
So now the genes can make the proteins
that make the rats a good mom. Exactly.

389
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,150
Exactly. That was awesome. Wow.

390
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,770
That was amazing. Why? Why are you
so thrilled? Well, think about it.

391
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,670
This is nature and nurture slamming into
each other. Like you know when people,

392
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,930
smart people say, you know,

393
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,480
there's no such thing as nature nutrients
on the interaction with the team and

394
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:04,880
you're like, what the hell does
that mean? Well, this is it.

395
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,910
This is real physical chemical
interaction between what's going on in the

396
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,960
environment and what's
going on with the DNA.

397
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,040
Because you begin with a mothers
lick that ends up with a deep,

398
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,190
deep change in the baby, not just
the good, warm, fuzzy feeling,

399
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,750
but a fundamental shift

400
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,480
in who that baby is and
who that baby will be.

401
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,110
You're now hearing the Mark's name invoked
these days because there are things

402
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:36,710
beyond genes that we pass
down to our children. Now,

403
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:40,160
according to Carl [inaudible], Jeez are
still fixed. We can't rewrite our genes.

404
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,900
That is impossible so far as we know.

405
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,320
But there seems to be this
layer on top of the genes,

406
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:49,130
this second channel of heredity.
If the genes are the bottom floor,

407
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,610
then this layer on top is
sometimes called the epigenome.

408
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,060
And that thing can change
based on your experiences,

409
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,170
which when you think about it, it
has a very lamarckian flavor. Yeah.

410
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,670
I think that's where La Mark's ideas
can be woven in and make some sense.

411
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,990
So do you call yourself a Lamarckian?
Not usually because it upsets people.

412
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,200
And I'm Canadian. I don't
like to, plus, you know,

413
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,680
the mark didn't get all the
biological details right.

414
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,160
Had no idea about DNA or very many
of them right at all. But you know,

415
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:23,280
his basic idea seems to be true.
I mean, when you think of camera,

416
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,740
there was a report in science, um,

417
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,980
outlining a theory about how cameras,

418
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:33,090
toads got these characteristics
that invoked the,

419
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:36,810
these epigenetic inheritance
and, and imprinted genes.

420
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,670
And it made it plausible. Oh,
so redeeming him. Yeah. Maybe

421
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,670
or maybe not.

422

00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,930
technology in the modern world.

433
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,800
More information about Sloane at
[inaudible] Iga, the adapt sloan.org

434
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,970
hey, what's up? I'm Jessica
Williams and I'm Phoebe Robinson.

435
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,310
We are back this spring, an all new season

436
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,570
of our hit podcast, two dope queens
from w NYC studio. It's comedy.

437
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,850
It's conversation with your fave celeb.

438
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,560
It's me and Jess telly tribe stories
about my bottom up session. Gross Dude,

439
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,330
why are you even bringing
that up right now? Anyway,

440
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,590
this season you'll hear from John Hamm.

441
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,610
Carrie Bronson did your Tyro gave her
union and more. My pits are sweating.

442
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:05,250
Just thinking about [inaudible] girl,
come on over to two dope queens.

443
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,860
Wherever you get your
pocket Bon, I'll call me.

444
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,243
Yeah.

445
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,890
And Go, Hey, I'm Jen. I boom, rod.
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

446
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:20,670
And today it's inheritance today. Yeah.
We're exploring questions of like, uh,

447
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:24,510
what can you pass down to your
kids in their kids? What can't you,

448
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,900
how much of you will echo into the
future and how much of you won't?

449
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,610
And I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good
about this show so far because well,

450
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,010
if, uh, if, if a mother,

451
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,820
a little rap mother licking her baby
can have such a profound effect,

452
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,300
basically change the expression of the
genes in the baby. Well that's you.

453
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,250
You'll think you can get deep down.
Look, in the end, what do I know?

454
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,140
I take it that we have more control over
our destinies and our kids' destinies.

455
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:56,690
And we would've thought, well, let's not
get too excited too fast because, uh,

456
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,490
we own it. We have a story
to tell. And this, this one,

457
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,350
this tale leaves me a little
queasy. Oh, there was a contact.

458
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,970
Hello? Hello. Yup, it's me. Oh, this
is Oola. Hi. We'll let you get in.

459
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,380
I'm in public health,

460
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,520
the Karolinska Institute in Sweden
where he studies population data,

461
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,010
looking for patterns in cardiovascular
diseases, high blood pressure and such.

462
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,640
But the story he told us
begins around 25 years ago,

463
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:28,420
way up in northern Sweden
that Sam keen again,

464
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:32,710
he's the guy who told us about all his
work in our little community called over

465
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,010
Calix. What does it look like? Is
it a big town? A little village?

466
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,090
It's a small forest area. Very beautiful.

467
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,770
But this was a really, really
tough place to grow up.

468
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,920
Very isolated and very cold.

469
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,210
Are you near the Arctic circle or north
of it? North of the Arctic Circle. Yeah.

470
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,770
My home village grows 10 miles
north of popular circles. Oh,

471
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,260
so you grew up in uh, over Kaylin's.
Yeah, we had uh, an expression here.

472
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,550
Dig where you stand.
And it just so happened

473
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,120
cause this town is a perfect place today.

474
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,890
Okay. I'm here.

475
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,060
Fix Our keep at the kingdom
archive because there is more data,

476
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,810
more information about the people of
overkill is going farther back into the

477
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,960
past. And you could find almost
anywhere else on earth. Yeah,

478
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,660
we are really data rich. This
is the era of colleagues. Yes.

479
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,010
Church parish. Yes it is.
Because here's the thing.

480
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,970
The churches up and over Calix
kept incredibly detailed records.

481
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,540
We actually sent our friend pike off skeet
to the archives in Stockholm to check

482
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:43,210
it out. Vicky Easter Register.

483
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,110
In those books you can meet everything
about the citizens of over calyx going

484
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:51,010
back hundreds of years. What's his name?
You know their names? Yes, yes, yes.

485
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,870
[inaudible] what year they're born?

486
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,910
1814 1881 she was born 1904 and this is
everything happening in the family is in

487
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:07,630
these books and they listen. Who was
an idiot? He was an idiot. It's, sorry,

488
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,830
what does that mean? He was an idiot, I
guess. Yeah, he was, you know retarded,

489
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,660
right? Yeah. ELN the at score that
he was, he was miserable to look at.

490
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,370
It's not very politically
correct. In any case,

491
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,070
these books tell you when
each of these folks died,

492
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,590
how they died from disease,

493
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,690
from a pneumonia accident.
She drowned. Oh my God.

494
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,160
A lot of diagnosis actually. I mean
influence cancer, heart disease,

495
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,420
brain disease,

496
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,930
[inaudible]. The church is also kept
track of the farmers, crows crops,

497
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,050
lifestyle, how much they
were growing each year,

498
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,870
which turned out to be kind
of an interesting thing
to look at because at time

499
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,330
the people in over calyx who were farming
trying to make a living out of the

500
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:56,780
soil, we have 'em how much they harvested.

501
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,950
They would experience these wild
changes from harvest to harvest.

502
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,210
What you see in the records is that
one year potatoes crops to do great a

503
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,790
hundred liters. Wow.
That's a lot of potatoes.

504
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,850
A few years later there'd be a harsh
winter and the crops failed and when the

505
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:17,030
crops failed. Fabulous.

506
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,300
Yeah, so sad. They basically start,
I mean when you look at the records,

507
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:25,200
you don't see huge spikes in mortality,
so they didn't starve to death.

508
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,780
They suddenly had to get [inaudible]

509
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,910
tiny fraction of the food that they
were used to. It didn't have grains.

510
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I mean they didn't tell the partridge
until they just had to hold on for the

511
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,000
entire winter, but then a few years
would pass. Craps would bounce back,

512
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,810
but we have a lot more grain
here and suddenly plenty of food.

513
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,800
I could eat twice, three
times as much then oh no.

514
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,500
Total crop failure

515
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,570
fam. And again, these changes
would just bounce back and forth,

516
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,760
famine these salmon

517
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,273
east again

518
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,680
and looking at these swings and Fortune
Oola realized what he had here was a

519
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:10,580
nice natural experiment
because with all this data,

520
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,460
he and his team could follow families
forward in time through the generations.

521
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,500
So if they saw somebody who was starving
as a kid in 1820 they could then see,

522
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:24,610
well, when those people had
children and grandchildren,

523
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,270
did anything change? Were
there any consequences?

524
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,300
They wanted to see basically the effects
of starvation on multiple generations.

525
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,990
What did you discover?

526
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,190
Whether it was very interesting in

527
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,950
this gallery, that's a little odd
actually. Here's what was a says. He,

528
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,460
he found in the data, if
you were a boy in overkill,

529
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,800
it's between the ages of nine and
12 years old. So that's the window,

530
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,360
nine to 12 year a boy,

531
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,930
and then we have one of those terribly
rough winters and you're eating much less

532
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:57,620
than normal,

533
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,910
assuming that you can survive the ordeal
and you grow up and you have kids of

534
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:02,630
your own.

535
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,630
The data seems to say that your kids
will benefit from your suffering.

536
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,723
Yeah,

537
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,540
better if you have a starving daddy.

538
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,690
It turns out that the baby actually
gets some sort of health benefit really.

539
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,040
And these effects in fact were so
strong that you could trace it to the

540
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,220
grandfather, the
grandfather, two generations.

541
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,190
It seemed to have been passed
down from multiple generations.

542
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,670
You mean if you had a
starving grandfather,

543
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,490
you would be a healthier
grant boy for the,

544
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,260
because you had a starving grandfather,

545
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,680
you got a health boost. If you
had a starving grandfather,

546
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,740
what sort of health boost? Well,
um, we'll have told us, uh,

547
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,730
take heart disease or disease.

548
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,430
You said if you were a boy and you starve
between the ages of nine and 12 and

549
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:57,140
then you went on to become a father,
then a grandfather, your grandkids,

550
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,850
they were protected. Meaning that they
had less incidents of heart disease,

551
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,100
much less how much less, whether it's um,

552
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,110
one fourth of them can receive
one fourth. Let me say this again.

553
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,440
If you're a starving boy between
nine to 12 years old now,

554
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,420
it doesn't matter a whole lot.
What happens to you after this?

555
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,200
Your grandchildren will have one
quarter of the risk of heart disease.

556
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,620
And if you were eating a whole lot
between nine and 12, one quarter,

557
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,620
not only that, apparently those
grandkids were less prone to diabetes.

558
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,970
They lived longer lives. Something
like 30 years on average.

559
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,900
This was a [inaudible] effect. Instead
of dying at 40, I'd live to 70.

560
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,640
That kind of 30 years.
Yes, exactly. I just don't,

561
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:44,490
I wonder, it's such a surprising result.

562
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:48,800
I wonder how much you believe
in it so that it's solely a,

563
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,070
the mechanisms are not so clear,
but the results are very clear.

564
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,700
The results are obvious to you and there
it is. The results are quite obvious.

565
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,120
Just to be sure. We asked Francis
Champagne, which she thinks of this data.

566
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,000
I believe it. Oh you do? And
I'm Michael Meaney as well.

567
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:07,140
I think the Swedish data are, are
really, really strong and very reliable.

568
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,960
Everybody we talk to seems to think
there's something really interesting going

569
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:13,440
on here, but what exactly, maybe
you can explain this to me, Robert.

570
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,610
What exactly happens between nine to
12 that makes this big difference? Wow.

571
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,200
So here's the thing. How
old are your boys right now?

572
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,610
Three and eight months. Okay, so
here's what you're going to notice.

573
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,570
Your boys will first grow taller
and taller for the next few years,

574
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,900
and when they get to be up
about nine 10 years old,

575
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,010
they're gonna stop growing just for
a few years. This is what's called

576
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,990
the slow growth period.

577
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,000
Just for those years. That's
nine 10 11 just before puberty,

578
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,720
they won't grow much on the
outside, but on the inside,

579
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,390
that is the time where the
sperms probably developing

580
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,430
what's happening during this time is
that you're setting aside the stock of

581
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:04,930
cells that you're going to draw on
in the future to make sperm cells.

582
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,320
So they are pre sperms.

583
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,800
So the thought is when those little
boys in over cakes were really,

584
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:12,970
really hungry,

585
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,180
their hunger started a chemical process
that reached all the way down to the

586
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:21,940
DNA. Inside the boys' sperm.

587
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:26,720
Something happens on the
molecular level. What exactly?

588
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,030
Well, uh, the DNA,

589
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:32,250
the RNA micro RNA is a histone.

590
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,920
Anyway, that's it that you're just renamed

591
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,950
methylations phosphorylation
and so on that this just judo,

592
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,070
that's all this is because we don't know

593
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,150
no precisely how this happens,

594
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:47,500
but somehow the experience
of starvation marks the DNA.

595
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,700
Maybe like those methyl things we were
telling you about with the rats. Yeah.

596
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,790
Telling some genes to turn off
now or the genes to turn on.

597
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,740
And the incredible thing is

598
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,480
those marks stick around.

599
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,510
This sperm carries these marks to the
next generation and then the next one

600
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:06,560
after that, right.

601
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,220
[inaudible]

602
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,610
so somehow by some kind
of chemical mechanisms,

603
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:17,560
starving grandpa back when he was about
nine to 12 years old turned out to be a

604
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,690
good thing. So it's like, um,

605
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,910
GRANDPA's struggle is sort of jumping
forward and giving me a leg up. Well,

606
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,470
that's the good news. But
unfortunately there's, um,

607
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,470
there is some bad news here. Yeah.
If your grandpa didn't starve,

608
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:36,880
instead he lived through great times.
He stuffed himself silly nine 10,

609
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:41,150
11 years old. So he's a happy
grandpa. You the grandson, you then

610
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,280
would have high frequency.

611
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,990
So heart attacks as to
diabetes. It was uh,

612
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,750
a fourfold risk

613
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,540
for four full 400% greater. Yeah.

614
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,160
Can I say this is spooky. This is spooky
because it's like it does get, yeah.

615
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,620
It's like what if GRANDPA has a bad day?
Suddenly you're marked. Yeah. Frankly,

616
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,180
this makes being nine, 10, 11,

617
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,860
12 like a rather crucial and at a time
and you're not making the best decisions

618
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,590
anyway cause grandpa's just
nine. I should add to that.

619
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:14,520
They have found very similar
affects for smoking. For instance,

620
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,050
if you start smoking when your, you
know, 10, 11, something like that,

621
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,170
you end up having children
with more problems.

622
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,910
I initially felt very hopeful and excited
about this research because it seems

623
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:31,440
to suggest that that w a body one body
can respond to an environment and change

624
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:34,140
and be flexible in a way we
didn't think was possible.

625
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,220
But this you're telling me about Sweden

626
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,190
feels very, um, grim in
a certain way. You know,

627
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:43,240
sometimes that your grandfather's
suffering helps you, even if it helps.

628
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:45,370
It's horrifying claim
makes me claustrophobic.

629
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,540
You feel kind of hemmed in by what your
grandfather did? A little bit, I guess.

630
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,320
I guess the way I would I
would look at it is that, um,

631
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,160
you can change your environment a lot
more easily than you can change your

632
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,713
genes.

633
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,250
[inaudible]

634
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,850
I think is, what's weird here is
that, is that we started trying to,

635
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:12,110
to make a difference in our children and
our surprise attack by our grand plan.

636
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,710
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
though. When a meal gets to be eight,

637
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,100
I'm cutting him off. He's not eating it
at all. This may hurt you, my friend,

638
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,190
but I'm doing it for my grandchildren.

What you can move on to the next
generation and what you can't.

665
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,930
Now the sweetened story
from our last segment,

666
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,750
leftists both fill a little strange. Yeah.

667
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,550
Because while you might
have a lot of influence,

668
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,010
no genetically speaking over
your kids and their kids,

669
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,770
you don't seem to have
a lot of control. Oh.

670
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,040
So we're going to leave you with a
story from our producer, Pat Walters,

671
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:34,100
about one woman's radical,
even troubling attempt to

672
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,780
regain that control. [inaudible]
come on in again. Few months ago,

673
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:42,890
pat made his way down to North Carolina
to a small suburb outside of Charlotte

674
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,630
to visit this family memos
Dublin. I'd come to see,

675
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:50,260
she and I snuck away from the
children into our office. Right.

676
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,040
This is nice and quiet.
Um, well I guess, um,

677
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,360
I was thinking we could just start
at the beginning. What year was it?

678
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,253
Where were you?

679
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,000
Okay. Um, 1989.

680
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,580
So this is Barbara, Barbara Harris.

681
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:10,250
I'm the founder and director
of project prevention.

682
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,380
And in 1989 when the story
we're telling now started,

683
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:17,220
she was living in California in
Orange County, and I was a waitress.

684
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,570
I worked for I for over 30 years.
And she was a mom to six sons.

685
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,900
She and her husband really
Harris. What'd he do for a living?

686
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,530
Surgical technician, six boys. There's
a lot of boys. But at that point,

687
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:31,830
just two of the six boys were
living at home, Brian and Rodney,

688
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,480
and they were seven and eight at the time.

689
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,260
And Barbara found herself returning
to a thought she'd kind of always had.

690
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,650
She started to wish again that
she could have a daughter. Yeah.

691
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,140
And by this point, she's 37 years old.

692
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,760
And I knew the only way I was gonna get
a daughter was if I went and became a

693
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:49,000
foster parent and asked for one

694
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:50,740
[inaudible].

695
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,720
So she did, she filled
out the forms [inaudible]

696
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,370
through all the training that we had to
do and first aid fingerprinted and had a

697
00:42:58,371 --> 00:42:59,290
background check done.

698
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:00,790
[inaudible]

699
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,650
and then they waited for the call.

700
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,350
I already knew that if I ever got a
little girl, I was gonna name her destiny.

701
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,110
[inaudible]

702
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,920
and um, that summer it was, um,

703
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,460
July they got the call, I
had asked for a newborn.

704
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,470
So when the social worker
called me, she said,

705
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:21,220
I had this cute little baby girl
for you, but she's eight months old.

706
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:24,130
Is that too old? And I said, no,
no, that's okay. She said, well,

707
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:28,930
she's just beautiful. And she
has lips that like a baby doll.

708
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,460
That's what I remember her saying.

709
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,740
So Barbara and her son got in the car
and drove across town to the foster home

710
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:37,770
where destiny had been living for
the past eight months since birth.

711
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,240
We went to the foster home and went in.

712
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:43,290
The lady knew why we were there
and destiny was in the other room.

713
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,040
I'm sleeping or something, I'm not sure.

714
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,470
So we talked to her for a little while and

715
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,580
there's a certain point,

716
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,110
the social worker pulls out a
stack of papers with a child.

717
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:56,350
They give you a whole folder full of
information. It tells you all about them.

718
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,850
And she told Barbara, there's something
you need to know about this baby.

719
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,500
And she is born and tested
positive for PCP, crack and heroin.

720
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,563
And um,

721
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,800
doctors would later explained to Barbara
that Destiny's mom had been addicted to

722
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:15,010
drugs while she was pregnant. And
the psychologist who gave destiny,

723
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:18,340
her first checkup told Barbara that she
was delayed and she was always going to

724
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:22,750
be delayed because of her
prenatal neglect. Did that
scare you at all as like,

725
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,520
I mean that would seems like a thing
that would be kind of frightening. No,

726
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,410
it didn't scare me because she
says as soon as she saw destiny

727
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:37,370
and sat her in my lap with her little
dress on and her look curly hair,

728
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,650
she just knew this is my daughter.

729
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,250
A couple of days later I had
already bonded with her so much.

730
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,170
It was as if I gave
birth to her. Honestly,

731
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:50,250
I think it never seemed like she
was anything but my real mom,

732
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,570
if that makes sense.

733
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,640
This of course is destiny.

734
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,460
She's 22 now and she never
even met her birth mom. No, no.

735
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,720
Barbara says they've reached
out to her many times,

736
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:04,320
but they never heard back and
destiny says she doesn't really care.

737
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,030
I mean at all.

738
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,020
I got these jeans from somewhere,

739
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,580
but I kind of feel like
she was a surrogate.

740
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,500
Like she carried me for my real mom.
That's how I've always looked at it.

741
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:23,320
You know, my mom needed a girl
and she got one. It's just,

742
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:24,154
that's just how I've always, yeah,

743
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,390
and even though they look basically
nothing alike. I mean, for one thing,

744
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,250
Barbara's white and Destiny's black.

745
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,840
They both say that they actually often
forget that they're not biologically

746
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:39,190
related. They told me a bunch of
these stories. One of them involving,

747
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,440
well,

748
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,250
yeah, so I don't have the
biggest boobies in the world.

749
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,440
You can't see that on the
radio, but it's a fact of life.

750
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,120
And destiny says, one day she and her
mom were in the car and her mom said,

751
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,450
she said, I don't know.
You know, maybe. I mean,

752
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,330
maybe they'll grow picker like
mine, minor, bigger, and you know,

753
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,010
and then she goes, oh wait,
I didn't give birth to you.

754
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:06,440
That doesn't matter. Nevermind.
You're stuck with small boobies. Okay,

755
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,980
now I just had to accept it,

756
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,800
but we're getting ahead of ourselves
here because even that really sets the

757
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:13,634
story in motion.

758
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,050
The set of events happened a few months
after Barbara had brought this to me

759
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,640
when they got another call from the
social worker saying that same mother,

760
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,240
Destiny's birth mother had
given birth to another child.

761
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,580
Yeah. The social work call and told
me the mother had given birth birth.

762
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:34,020
Mother's name was actually the same
as me. So Barbara, really? Yeah,

763
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,250
she has the same name as me,

764
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,140
so I should tell me Barbara had had
another baby and a boy did we want it.

765
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,080
So I went to the hospital
and picked them up.

766
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,440
And you picked him up right
from the hospital? Yeah,

767
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,960
and as soon as she got
there to pick them up,

768
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,850
she could tell that something was wrong.

769
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,020
It wasn't little happy baby because
when a woman uses heroin while she's

770
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,530
pregnant, the fetus gets
hooked on it to two fries.

771
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,220
They're being born with like just
being cut off and he was going through

772
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:03,690
withdrawal.

773
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,490
Light bothered him, noise bothered him
as a beat it out. This is Smitty again,

774
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,150
projectile vomiting because
he couldn't hold formula down.

775
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,080
He'd fall asleep and just wake up
screaming. And he was just Nyla,

776
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,360
you know, most babies, Ocala peaceful.
He was nowhere really peaceful.

777
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,880
And Day after day, literally for months,

778
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,350
Isaiah would sleep and he would
scream. That was it. It was just,

779
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,090
you know, should have to come
into the world like that.

780
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,820
And nobody has a right
to do that to a baby.

781
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,890
But a year later, the
social worker called again,

782
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,410
Sam, the mother had given birth
to a baby girl. Did we want her,

783
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,460
this is the same birth mother. Yeah.
And again, Barbara, thanks. Come on.

784
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,440
But this little girl is here.

785
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:50,890
She should be with her brother and
sister and so she should be with me.

786
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,500
And I called my husband
again at work and said,

787
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,380
they want to know if we want to
take the baby and he's a barber.

788
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:59,860
I'm not buying a school best because we
had already had to upgrade from a car to

789
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:04,210
a van, from a condo to a
home. And um, so I said, okay,

790
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:06,400
well this will be the last
one. We'll just get one more.

791
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,480
But a year later, no.
She gets another call,

792
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,110
another little boy. That's how
we ended up with four of them.

793
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:19,380
These are four kids from the same
birth mother? Yeah. Wow. So by now

794
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,440
it's 1994 and Barbara is thinking,
I just don't get it. You know,

795
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,270
like how did this happen?

796
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:29,380
How was this woman allowed to walk into
the hospital and drop off a damaged baby

797
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:32,560
and just walk away with no
consequences over and over again?

798
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,250
How dare you do this? The way she sought
the state, the federal government,

799
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,230
somebody should say,
you're not doing this.

800
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,960
You're not leaving this hospital
unless you have longterm birth control.

801
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,840
Barbara tried to get a law
passed requiring just that,

802
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,820
but it failed and when I found out
the bill didn't pass, I just thought,

803
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:50,770
I have to come up with something
else. I have to be creative.

804
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,570
And she says one day this idea
just came to her. She was thinking,

805
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,130
everybody's motivated by money.

806
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,800
So

807
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,540
can I offer these women
money to use birth control?

808
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:07,010
Any other words? Could I pay women who
have drug problems to stop having babies?

809
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,260
I decided to have a press conference
in my front yard to announce what I was

810
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:19,850
doing and my naive mind, I didn't
have a clue what a big deal this was.

811
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,340
The story exploded.

812
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,410
Barbara Harris, his solution is
simpler than anything else out there.

813
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,310
Instantly she's offering
$200 $100 200 bucks.

814
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,360
It's 300 down to any drug addicted woman
who will agree to have no more babies

815
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,130
and I'm going to go out into the streets
and offer addicted women money to use

816
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:40,550
birth control. This could
mean sterilization. It
could mean getting an IUD

817
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,330
if she gives the woman a choice.
If you've already had a kid,

818
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:45,700
you can be sterilized and if you haven't,

819
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,960
you can choose to have an IUD or an
implant put in which will last for several

820
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,710
years. Wait, and when you say
they can choose to be sterilized,

821
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,660
do you mean permanent? Yeah,
permanent like tubes tied.

822
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,020
Wow. Sounds bizarre, but it's a
solution here. It says her program,

823
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:04,700
children requiring a caring community
or crack crack can prevent thousands of

824
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,510
unwanted births to drug addicted women.
I'd like to everybody to meet please.

825
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,670
Barbara Harris, please
welcome Brian [inaudible].

826
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,670
As Barbara made the rounds on the
daytime talk shows the reaction was split

827
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,740
right down the middle and the one hand,

828
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:19,260
she says immediately
check started arriving

829
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,610
25. This is 50 from all over the country.

830
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,640
This is 750 and it's 200 all over the
political spectrum from Hollywood to

831
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:28,310
social

832
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,180
conservatives

833
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,460
together pledge more than $150,000 to her

834
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:36,440
program. And that number, by the
way, has grown a lot. That 1 million.

835
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,680
Uh, yeah. Over the past five years.
If you look at our tax return. Wow.

836
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,500
But along with the support came attacks,

837
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,290
particularly as drug addicted
women began to sign up.

838
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,770
Barbara Harris says she's convinced
more than a dozen women, 14 women,

839
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,400
25 women have accepted her offer to
be sterilized in return for money.

840
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,861
Right away.

841
00:50:55,861 --> 00:51:00,360
People accused her of targeting women at
their weakest moment and enabling their

842
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,190
drug abuse.

843
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,610
You know what they're going to go do
with that money. You get them $200 each.

844
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,430
I can spend on crack
and that's their choice.

845
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,800
But the babies don't have a choice.

846
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,280
Barbara started finding herself on panels
with women who used drugs during their

847
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:16,230
pregnancies and that's when things
would start to get out of here.

848
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,070
I feel that they should all be sterilized.

849
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,200
Sterilize, like you said,

850
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,530
you were like your head when you
ran your advice and like she is.

851
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:27,880
I didn't say I'm glad she asked my
opinion. Okay. This lady right here is,

852
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,190
you know, taking drugs and
try and be pregnant again.

853
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,960
First hear about this. What
goes through your mind?

854
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:40,210
I think I was really horrified and
terrified. That's Lynn Paltrow.

855
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,810
I'm executive director and founder of
national advocates for pregnant women.

856
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,860
Lynn has become one of Barbara's
fiercest critics and full disclosure,

857
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:49,940
she's Robert Sisters. Yes.

858
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:51,303
Well her,

859
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,780
her explanation is that
these women are having,

860
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:56,891
in her terms,

861
00:51:56,891 --> 00:52:01,630
litters of damaged babies and society
forever will be responsible for them.

862
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:02,883
She said litters

863
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,870
in this magazine Article Barbara Even
said, quote, we don't allow dogs to breed.

864
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,270
We spay them, we neuter them.

865
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,120
I'm not saying that these women are dogs,

866
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:15,510
but they're not acting anymore
responsible than a dog in heat.

867
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,550
Are there people whose drug use is so
out of control, they can't parent. Yes,

868
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,760
but creating an assumption that there is
a class of people who don't deserve to

869
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,070
procreate who aren't worthy.

870
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:32,390
Appropriating the human race leads you
down a path that is is we should have

871
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:36,050
great concern about that path
is basically called eugenics.

872
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:36,461
Well,

873
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:40,030
I mean Hitler thought that if you were
Jewish that you had given up the right to

874
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,760
be mother and he sterilized
people as well. Well,

875
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:46,150
I just want to eliminate drug-addicted
babies from being born. I mean,

876
00:52:46,151 --> 00:52:48,520
I don't think that puts me in
the same category as Hitler.

877
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,580
What's the worst thing you've been
called by one of your critics?

878
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,720
Probably Racist.

879
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,660
I mean, I'm married to a black
man, so that was just funny to me.

880
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,450
And according to Barbara, the majority
of the women she pays are white.

881
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,550
Do you think like,

882
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,900
but ask Barbara about some of the things
that she'd said because to be totally

883
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:11,010
honest, they kind of turned
my stomach. I like you.

884
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:14,040
I get the sense that like you have,
there's a lot of warmth in you.

885
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:18,570
You're obviously a great mom,
but that feels cold to me.

886
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,740
I was just pissed and what
they'd done to my children.

887
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,980
Now babies I had seen and all the
people that have me and tell me about

888
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,540
their babies that were damaged.

889
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,070
I had everybody's abuse on my back and
I didn't care how he said it or how we

890
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:32,401
did it.

891
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:36,090
Just don't have any more children because
at that point I didn't really know any

892
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:39,600
of them so I didn't see them
as people. I just saw them as

893
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,640
child abusers might be a mixture,

894
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,580
but she says she doesn't
feel that way anymore.

895
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,260
After I've gotten to know
so many of the women.

896
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,420
Barbara has this drawer in your desk
and Ms. Harrison staff are filled with

897
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,460
dozens of letters from
women that she's paid.

898
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:01,110
I want to thank you for your support
and kindness as always. She said,

899
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:04,500
thank you so much for the gift. I
bought my son an excavator track,

900
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:06,690
remote control and some summer outfits.

901
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,990
This is from 2000 to whom it may
concern. I have been doing very good.

902
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,790
I just got custody of my eight year old
son and I'm so proud and I have four

903
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:21,030
years clean and I anyways,
God bless you sincerely,

904
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,200
Jennifer [inaudible],

905
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,520
have you ever had someone call or write
you and say that they regret their

906
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:31,590
decision? No,

907
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,560
I've only had somebody call and say they
regret that they didn't stay on birth

908
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:39,330
control, which I find kind of
hard to believe. But then again,

909
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,380
I must've read at least a hundred news
articles as I was reporting this story

910
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,520
and I didn't find a single case of
someone saying that they regretted what

911
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,354
they'd done.

912
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:50,850
[inaudible]

913
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,550
how many women have you paid?

914
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,960
We have paid,

915
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:04,000
um, 4,000, 266. That's a lot of people.

916
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,100
That's a lot of people. Yeah.

917
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,500
She actually emailed me afterwards and
adjusted that number down like a hundred.

918
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,870
Um, and so in the end of, you know,
where do you come down on this?

919
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,510
I ended up finding myself
really conflicted about it,

920
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,030
but the, the,

921
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:24,730
the like I agree with Lynn that this
program does perpetuate a stereotype.

922
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,510
Tell me what your image of a drug
using pregnant woman is. Who are they?

923
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,050
It will be wrong to assume the women
Barbara talks about on TV and these women

924
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:35,860
don't just have one and two babies.
They have six, seven eight, 10 14.

925
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,340
All these women who have so many babies
and never try to seek drug treatment.

926
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,400
It would be wrong to think that they
represent all women who use drugs while

927
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:42,910
they're pregnant.

928
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,800
The women who I've worked with who've had
a history of drug problems aren't like

929
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:51,460
the examples that she gives. These
are women who loved their children,

930
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:55,630
who sought help and she says oftentimes
the women who want help have a really

931
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:58,570
hard time finding it. And
Barbara's not offering that.

932
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,510
She's not offering treatment.
She's not offering counseling.

933
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,370
And there are programs that do that.

934
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,120
But I said this to Linde Bite,

935
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,580
all the things that troubled
me about Barbara's program,

936
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:14,350
I feel like what she's
trying to do is to stop it.

937
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,690
To stop a kid from getting born into
a childhood that's going to suck.

938
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,250
The fact that you're motivated
by a really beautiful,

939
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,650
important, um,

940
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,600
value that we want healthy kids doesn't
mean the mechanism you're using is going

941
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,030
to end up helping those kids.

942
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:35,980
Because the truth is you have no idea
how these kids are gonna turn out. Yeah.

943
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,680
Like nobody's arguing that women
should do drugs when they're pregnant.

944
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,810
That is a bad way to start a kid's life.

945
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,860
But that's just the
beginning of the kid's life.

946
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,570
So much can happen after that. Once you

947
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:54,760
[inaudible] you and for me,

948
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,680
this whole story really
shifted or you and Jesse,

949
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,270
when I started spending some time with
destiny, Barbara, 22 year old daughter,

950
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,130
you know, as you can see, I like to talk,

951
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:08,680
even though Destiny's mom was doing all
sorts of drugs during her pregnancy and

952
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:12,340
the doctors told Barbara that destiny
was going to be mentally and physically

953
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:16,480
delayed, not feeling the way
I'm supposed to, she just isn't.

954
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,740
Could you just tell us like what you
are doing now? You're finishing college,

955
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,603
right? Yes.

956
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,170
I'm almost done. I'm
graduating in December.

957
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:29,000
It's exciting and right now I'm
student teaching, so that's fun.

958
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,140
But the moment I really felt like, Whoa,

959
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:35,530
was it when we started talking about the
little baby that we keep hearing in the

960
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:37,000
background. Okay. Everything.

961
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,830
That's my little girl,
she's 20 months old.

962
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:44,831
She'll be two in January and so her
name is Kalia and she's a complete nut.

963
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,270
I don't know where she gets that
from. Oh hell yeah. She keeps me busy.

964
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,380
Were you planning to have clean?
Nope. She was an oops kid.

965
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,410
She was totally new skid. See, we'll
just be honest. We just didn't think,

966
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:03,170
I just didn't think, you know, you know,
they say it only takes one time. All.

967
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,010
Yep. That is so true. One
time, and I'm one fighter,

968
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,550
so yeah, that's embarrassing.

969
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:15,551
But I believe everything happens
for a reason and I think that no,

970
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:17,990
I didn't plan on it,

971
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:23,740
but I wouldn't take her back for
anything because she made me better.

972
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,030
I want her to be able to look
back on her life one day.

973
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:33,980
Maybe when she's getting interviewed,
I don't know. And be able to say that,

974
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:37,850
yes, my mom was there for
me 100% without a doubt.

975
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:42,920
And I'm going to have straight A's and
I'm making it work and I'm going to

976
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:46,610
graduate with honors and one day I'm
going to be able to tell her, look,

977
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:51,080
I did this. You can do this. Like
push yourself and you got it.

978
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,170
That's really impressive.
I mean, you're just,

979
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:58,760
you're saying a lot of things that are
really impressive to her. Like I matter,

980
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,370
like I make a difference to her.

981
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,680
Okay. All right. We can stop.

982
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,840
So we did stop and I packed up
my stuff. It's pretty much done.

983
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,560
And Barbara and destiny walked me
out to my carb. Kaliyah came too.

984
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,200
They had a little basketball for her. My

985
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,683
goodness.

986
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:27,950
Loving is here and at a certain point
I noticed like over my shoulder,

987
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:31,580
Barbara is crouched down and she's got
her phone out and she's taking a picture

988
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,310
of this just perfect little scene.

989
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,850
You can get her in here. All
right, you're going to kick in.

990
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:44,030
And I just felt like I was in one
of those moments that like, look,

991
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:47,930
I'm going to contains everything that's
good about us as people. You can do one

992
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,630
buddy, you're watching this. I
couldn't help but think that destinies,

993
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:58,810
very existence is probably
the most interesting argument
against what Barbara is

994
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:01,190
doing. You're,

995
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:05,930
I can it back because if Barbara had
gotten the Destiny's birth mom, destiny

996
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,180
CLIA this moment, none of it would exist.

997
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,320
Yeah. And I told destiny I was thinking
about this and asked her about it.

998
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,973
[inaudible]

999
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:27,710
my situation turned out positive. Like,

1000
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,250
I mean as far as you
know, positives can go.

1001
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,710
Like I think I hit the Jackpot.

1002
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,360
A lot of times that's not the case
and you just had to have to weigh it.

1003
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:43,260
Like is it worth it? Like I could have
turned out like some of the other kids,

1004
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,030
destiny says before she was born,
her mom had four other girls.

1005
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,790
These were kids that didn't
end up with Barbara. Yeah.

1006
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,330
Three of them ended up in other foster
homes and seem to have done pretty well.

1007
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,160
But one of them,

1008
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,900
okay, well one of them don't
really know what happened to her.

1009
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,190
She's somewhere, but it's not
good. From what we've heard

1010
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,050
last, they heard she was
living on the streets in La

1011
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,860
and that could've very easily
have been one of us. Yeah.

1012
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:11,210
I mean,

1013
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,930
yes I might get a great
family but I might not.

1014
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,710
The question that was stuck in
my head right then was like,

1015
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,330
if you could choose between being born
knowing that your life might end up like

1016
01:01:24,331 --> 01:01:28,230
that and not like it is now
or not been born at all,

1017
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,810
what would you have done?
Um, not been born at all.

1018
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:40,290
I wouldn't want to put it up to chance
because what kind of life is that?

1019
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,830
You mean that I do mean that.
Yeah, I'll check the side.

1020
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:50,060
I know I've been joking a lot in this
interview, but I mean with all that I am,

1021
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,493
see

1022
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,990
she wants to see it Gaffin

1023
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,950
back together. What's she saying there?

1024
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:10,680
Taylor swift's never getting
back to you. You say never ever.

1025
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:15,760
Oh no baby. Be careful
just saying, okay. She's,

1026
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,570
do you want to say bye bye. Say Bye.

1027
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,100
Aw, you blew my kids. That
was nice. Okay. That was

1028
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,373
good.

1029
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,210
Remind me this destiny has, uh,

1030
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,340
what three brothers and sisters
that also were raised with her?

1031
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,160
Two brothers and one sister.
What happened to them?

1032
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,800
Isaiah is in college and
Taylor and Brandon W I met
them at Barbara's house and

1033
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,880
they, they seemed to be, uh, to be fine.

1034
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,430
And what about the four kids
that weren't raised with Barbara?

1035
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:58,290
Do you know anything about the other,
the other four at just a little there?

1036
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,660
There were four girls,

1037
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:03,470
and Barbara and destiny told me that a
few years ago they found three of them

1038
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,730
and they all either were in
college or had finished college.

1039
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,050
So then the one that's in trouble
is just one of one. One of eight.

1040
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,140
Yeah. One of it. So I guess
you could say to yourself,

1041
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:19,430
seven out of eight of these kids did it
right. [inaudible] that's interesting.

1042
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,110
I mean, that's, that's a different
kind of odds, but it's, yeah.

1043
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:30,100
L Walters.
