I had just gotten my ears pierced and as
 

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.000
I had just gotten my ears pierced and as
you can see this black and white when I

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.010
you can see this black and white when I
 

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.950
you can see this black and white when I
when I first started doing comics it was

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960
when I first started doing comics it was
 

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.730
when I first started doing comics it was
in 95 96 it was Netscape one point 0 and

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:24.740
in 95 96 it was Netscape one point 0 and
 

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.520
in 95 96 it was Netscape one point 0 and
most people were using modems and if you

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:27.530
most people were using modems and if you
 

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.370
most people were using modems and if you
wanted your images to be seen quickly

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:30.380
wanted your images to be seen quickly
 

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.350
wanted your images to be seen quickly
and your target audience for me which

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:32.360
and your target audience for me which
 

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.300
and your target audience for me which
was teenage girls were probably using

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:34.310
was teenage girls were probably using
 

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.370
was teenage girls were probably using
the older computer which had even the

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:36.380
the older computer which had even the
 

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.920
the older computer which had even the
worst modem you wanted people to be able

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:38.930
worst modem you wanted people to be able
 

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.080
worst modem you wanted people to be able
to look at your your images quickly and

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.090
to look at your your images quickly and
 

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.880
to look at your your images quickly and
so black and white was the easiest way

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:42.890
so black and white was the easiest way
 

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.290
so black and white was the easiest way
to do that and that's why I started out

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:44.300
to do that and that's why I started out
 

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.850
to do that and that's why I started out
in black and white now it's just that's

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:45.860
in black and white now it's just that's
 

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.270
in black and white now it's just that's
that's the style that I'm known for and

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280
that's the style that I'm known for and
 

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.220
that's the style that I'm known for and
that's another scene of you went on when

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.230
that's another scene of you went on when
 

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.650
that's another scene of you went on when
I was a teenager and I'm just I was I

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:53.660
I was a teenager and I'm just I was I
 

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.510
I was a teenager and I'm just I was I
spent a lot of time in clubs and so I

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520
spent a lot of time in clubs and so I
 

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.640
spent a lot of time in clubs and so I
didn't go to college and did a lot of

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:57.650
didn't go to college and did a lot of
 

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.440
didn't go to college and did a lot of
stuff in the east village and that's

00:38:59.440 --> 00:38:59.450
stuff in the east village and that's
 

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:02.260
stuff in the east village and that's
just I think you wouldn't maybe get that

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:02.270
just I think you wouldn't maybe get that
 

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.670
just I think you wouldn't maybe get that
if you were growing up in the suburb

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680
if you were growing up in the suburb
 

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.380
if you were growing up in the suburb
where you could just go to clubs and be

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.390
where you could just go to clubs and be
 

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.300
where you could just go to clubs and be
out until five six in the morning and

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:07.310
out until five six in the morning and
 

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.910
out until five six in the morning and
then dancing all night and getting your

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920
then dancing all night and getting your
 

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.770
then dancing all night and getting your
tattoos and going to piercing clinics

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:11.780
tattoos and going to piercing clinics
 

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.230
tattoos and going to piercing clinics
and doing all the things that I did that

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240
and doing all the things that I did that
 

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.240
and doing all the things that I did that
are very maybe I don't even know if

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.250
