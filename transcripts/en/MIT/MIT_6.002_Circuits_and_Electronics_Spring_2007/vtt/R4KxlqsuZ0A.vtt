00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.623
We have put some of the quiz
stats here.

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:15.455
The mean was about 75%.
And I must tell you that that

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:19.823
is very impressive.
I guess MIT undergrads never

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:24.283
cease to amaze me.
And this was not an easy quiz.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:28.000
This was a relatively hard
quiz.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.641
And that average implies that
you guys did well on a

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:38.027
relatively hard quiz.
Good.

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:45.581
Let's get back to our final
lecture on amplifiers and small

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:51.702
signal circuits.
And as always let me start with

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:56.000
a review.
Very quickly --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.225
-- we came up with a notation
to represent small signals.

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:13.483
And our notation looked like
this.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:20.967
Our total variable was small
and capital, and this was a DC

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:26.000
bias and this was a small
signal.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.120
This is also called the
operating point.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.249
And the small signal is also
called the incremental signal.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.954
In general, if you have some
function, some variable of

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:53.343
interest in the circuit,
say a total variable V out,

00:01:53.343 --> 00:02:00.000
let's say it relates to some
input variable as F of VI.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.314
So mathematically we can find
out V out by simply finding the

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:15.659
slope of this function at the
operating point and then

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:23.003
multiplying it by the
incremental change in the input.

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:29.239
Gold standard math.
So we do the slope of this

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:37.000
function and evaluate it at the
operating point.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.574
So this would give us the slope
of the function.

00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:44.984
And multiply that by small VI,
which is incremental change.

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:48.634
This is standard math.
What this will tell you is

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:52.437
given a small change in VI this
function gives you,

00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:57.000
this expression gives you the
small change in V out.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.319
And in lecture we have pretty
much used this method so far,

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.204
used the math to get to where
we wanted it to be.

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:20.381
And then the way we provided
biasing and so on was for our

00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:26.836
amplifier in particular we had a
bias voltage,

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:32.000
some small signal value,
VS.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.800
And this was output which was
also given to be some output

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.599
operating point plus a small
change, which was a change in

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.557
the output voltage.
So what we have done here is

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.505
mathematically computed small V
out.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:53.557
And what I am showing you here
is to get the same effect in a

00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:58.357
circuit is you build your
circuit and replace what used to

00:03:58.357 --> 00:04:04.000
be a total variable with a DC
bias plus a small change.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.019
And then you will get your
output here.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.413
And this output will relate to
this input using this

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:15.000
expression.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:34.695
So this is more review.
To continue on with the math

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:45.260
review, for our amplifier VO was
given to be VS-K/2(vI-VT)^2 RL.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:54.484
So this was the output versus
input relationship for the

00:04:54.484 --> 00:05:00.210
amplifier.
And mathematically I could get

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.416
the small change in the output
VO by simply differentiating

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:12.623
this function with respect to
VI, evaluating that function,

00:05:12.623 --> 00:05:18.509
at capital VI and multiplying
by the small change in the

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.147
input.
And the resulting expression

00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:26.000
that we got for small VO --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.811
-- was simply minus K,
this was our DC value,

00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:44.547
and RL times small VI.
So we derived all of this the

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:48.773
last time.
So nothing new so far.

00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:55.509
So my small signal output was
some function given by

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:03.152
K(VI-VT)RL times small vi.
And notice that this is how VI

00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:07.461
relates to VO.
And this is a constant with

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.559
respect to VI.
V capital I is a DC bias,

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:17.128
so this is a constant.
So therefore this is the linear

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:21.227
relationship that we had set out
to get.

00:06:21.227 --> 00:06:25.955
This term here,
for reasons we will see today,

00:06:25.955 --> 00:06:31.000
this term here K(VI-VT) is
called gm.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.208
Transconductance.
We will look at it in more

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:36.000
detail a little later.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Even more review.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So I can draw the transfer
function and plot VO versus VI.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.636
Another way to graphically view
what is going on is by plotting

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:12.272
the load line curve for this
circuit, so this is VI.

00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:17.000
And I said we draw that by
first plotting the --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.912
These were our MOSFET curves.
And we know that at some point

00:07:30.912 --> 00:07:37.029
the MOSFET gets into saturation,
so this curve was iDS=K/2 VO^2.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:41.883
And to the right side of the
curve the MOSFET is in

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:45.766
saturation.
And we said we will adhere to

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:50.815
the saturation discipline and
operate in this regime.

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:56.252
When the MOSFET gets into this
region it is in its triode

00:07:56.252 --> 00:08:01.693
region.
And then we could draw the load

00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:05.981
line here.
The load line codified the

00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.628
following relationship,
iDS=VS/RL-VO/RL.

00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:16.584
This was a load line.
So I have superimposed a load

00:08:16.584 --> 00:08:20.635
line on the device
characteristics,

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:27.425
and I am going to show you a
little demonstration based on

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:33.675
that at this point.
So these curves were drawn for

00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:38.491
increasing values of VI.
And if I choose some operating

00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:43.486
point here then this point would
correspond to some bias,

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:48.213
this bias point would
correspond to some input voltage

00:08:48.213 --> 00:08:53.654
VI, a corresponding output bias
VO and a corresponding current

00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:55.437
iDS.
So iDS capitals,

00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:58.737
VO capitals,
VI capitals represent the

00:08:58.737 --> 00:09:04.000
operating point values for our
little circuit.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.642
So far there is nothing new.
One thing we stopped the last

00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:18.480
time by pointing out that the
gain of our amplifier,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.368
this is the gain,
-K(VI-VT)RL.

00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:28.000
That is the gain A of the
amplifier.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.263
That gain related to VI.
A gain was proportional to

00:09:33.263 --> 00:09:37.157
VI-VT.
So therefore if I increased VI,

00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:42.421
I would get more gain.
So the question is how do we

00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:47.684
choose a bias point?
And in our particular example,

00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:52.315
let's say we are free to play
around with VI.

00:09:52.315 --> 00:10:00.000
So we play around with VI and I
can choose various bias points.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.947
So where do you set the bias
point?

00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:07.283
What are the various
characteristics of the circuit

00:10:07.283 --> 00:10:10.838
that relate to my bias point?
Well, first,

00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:14.653
of course, is gain.
The gain depends on how I

00:10:14.653 --> 00:10:17.687
choose VI.
I will show you that in a

00:10:17.687 --> 00:10:20.635
moment.
The second important thing,

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:24.450
in other words,
if I choose a bias point that

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:30.000
is a small VI then my gain is
going to be smaller.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.255
If I choose a bias point that's
at a much higher value of VI,

00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:38.759
I get a bigger gain.
The second important

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:42.000
consideration is operating
range.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.114
Notice that if I choose a bias
point here then as the input

00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:01.668
changes --
Notice VI in this graph goes up

00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:05.715
or down, and I would be
traversing and following

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:09.847
different lines here in my
MOSFET characteristic.

00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:14.324
And as VI increases the
operating point would come up

00:11:14.324 --> 00:11:17.854
here and so on.
So if about this operating

00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:23.278
point I varied my input voltage
VI then, so let's say about this

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:25.947
operating point,
if my input VI,

00:11:25.947 --> 00:11:30.165
my small signal VI varied about
a small range then

00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:35.675
correspondingly the output value
would vary about this part of my

00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:39.931
load line.
So notice now that the

00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:43.969
operating range,
how far can VI vary before the

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:47.832
MOSFET goes out of its
saturation discipline?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:52.133
Well, on the low side my VI can
come down to here.

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:56.874
And we looked at the operating
ranges for an amplifier.

00:11:56.874 --> 00:12:01.000
And I can come all the way down
to VT.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.632
At that point the output will
come here.

00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:07.481
Similarly at the high end VI
could get up to a high value.

00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:10.586
And we computed that value in
the last lecture.

00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:14.232
And the corresponding value of
the input would be here.

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:18.282
So in some sense I can traverse
all the way from here to here

00:12:18.282 --> 00:12:20.983
and have the MOSFET remain in
saturation.

00:12:20.983 --> 00:12:24.561
Remember we are not talking
about linearity right now,

00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:28.476
just about the valid operating
range based on my definition

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:33.000
which is that the MOSFET should
stay in saturation.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.653
So if I chose my operating
point here then I get this range

00:12:37.653 --> 00:12:39.899
here.
And, on the other hand,

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:44.151
if I chose my operating point
to be here, for negative

00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:49.206
excursions of the input signal I
have a very small amount before

00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:52.335
I hit cutoff.
So if I chose my operating

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:56.667
point here then for negative
traversals of VI about the

00:12:56.667 --> 00:13:01.000
operating point I very quickly
hit cutoff.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.357
So if I want symmetric swings
then this is the best that I can

00:13:05.357 --> 00:13:09.285
do in terms of the valid input
operating range if I want

00:13:09.285 --> 00:13:12.785
symmetric swings given that this
is my bias point.

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:15.785
On the other hand,
if I chose my bias point

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:19.071
somewhere here,
or very carefully chose my bias

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:23.357
point then my input can vary on
a much wider region and still

00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:27.000
get symmetric swings.
And so therefore the choice of

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.357
bias point also influences the
maximum swing range of my input

00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:36.358
signal.
I shouldn't call this operating

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:40.041
range.
I should call it input swing

00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:43.508
range.
We defined the valid input

00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:50.116
operating range as the range for
which the amplifier satisfied

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:55.316
the saturation discipline.
So the two key issues,

00:13:55.316 --> 00:14:02.211
gain and the input swing.
Let me show you a quick demo

00:14:02.211 --> 00:14:09.437
and try to point out on a graph
some of the characteristics that

00:14:09.437 --> 00:14:15.630
relate to the matter we have
been talking about so far.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:21.480
So what I show here are these
curves for the MOSFET.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.870
This is VO and this iDS.
This is the zero point.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:33.134
Ignore this line down here.
This line up here corresponds

00:14:33.134 --> 00:14:37.110
to the output voltage VO.
What I am going to do now is,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.453
through some careful circuit
hacking, I'm going to show show

00:14:41.453 --> 00:14:46.165
you a load line and show you the
bias point, and show you how the

00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:50.288
bias point can be moved up and
down by changing the input

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:55.000
voltage which changes the
corresponding output voltage.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It is hardly visible out there.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.191
Is it there?
OK.

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:13.321
It is not really clear,
but notice that as I increase

00:15:13.321 --> 00:15:16.021
my input, I am increasing my
input.

00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:20.389
My output keeps coming down.
And I hope your eyesight is

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:24.440
better than mine because I don't
see a dot up there.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.855
I am amazed.
This is the first time this has

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:30.887
happened to me.
That's OK.

00:15:30.887 --> 00:15:33.104
All right.
As you can see,

00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:38.604
as I change the input value the
output operating point changes,

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:43.040
and the dot out there
traverses, articulates a load

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.145
line.
I guess I have to believe that

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:51.112
there is a dot out there.
Next what I will do is show you

00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:55.370
some more fun stuff.
What I will do is instead of

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:00.870
having just a dot by having a DC
voltage, let me apply an input

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.498
sinusoid.
So if I apply an input sinusoid

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:09.689
at some bias then I should see
an articulation of the

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:14.847
corresponding region of the load
line corresponding to the input.

00:16:14.847 --> 00:16:18.394
So, as you can see here,
now the bottom line,

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.456
here is my input and this is my
output.

00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:26.211
And notice that this the region
of the load line articulated

00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:30.000
when the input is of this
magnitude.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.425
Now let's have some fun.
As I increase my input,

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:37.216
you can see that a larger
portion of the load line is

00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:39.548
articulated, right?
There you go.

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:43.849
And as I decrease my input a
smaller region of the load line

00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:46.765
is articulated.
Let's leave it here for a

00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:49.025
moment.
And what I will do next,

00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:52.378
this is the region here that we
are looking at,

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:55.876
let me increase the bias.
If I increase the bias,

00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:59.375
if I increase VI,
what do you think should happen

00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:04.040
to this line here?
Well, if I increase the bias,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.010
the line should go up,
right?

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.668
Because remember the dot?
The dot is in the middle of

00:17:09.668 --> 00:17:12.693
this thing here.
If I increase the bias this

00:17:12.693 --> 00:17:15.648
should move up here.
So that line moves up.

00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:19.165
Do you expect anything else to
happen to that line?

00:17:19.165 --> 00:17:20.572
Pardon?
It increases,

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:23.316
exactly.
If I increase the bias point to

00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:26.974
here then this must also
increase because my gain has

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:30.000
increased.
Let me do that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.952
So let me increase the input
bias.

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:38.321
Indeed notice that the region
of the load line articulated is

00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:41.542
larger now.
Let me decrease the bias.

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:46.284
And notice that because the
gain is smaller the little

00:17:46.284 --> 00:17:51.652
segment shown is also smaller.
I have shown you two things so

00:17:51.652 --> 00:17:54.694
far.
One is that I as I increase my

00:17:54.694 --> 00:18:00.063
bias the line indeed rises up
corresponding to a higher value

00:18:00.063 --> 00:18:06.765
for the input operating point.
And the second is that I get a

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:11.283
larger swing in the output as I
increase the bias.

00:18:11.283 --> 00:18:16.078
Just to show that for those
like me who were visually

00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:21.148
challenged in terms of viewing
that little dot up there,

00:18:21.148 --> 00:18:26.680
let me get some audio so you
can actually hear the sinusoidal

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.000
tone.
It is a big annoying.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.289
As I reduce the bias the gain
is decreased.

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:45.417
As I increase the bias you can
see that the gain is increased

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:50.625
and the tone is louder.
Let's have some more fun and

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:56.446
let's play some music now.
And what I am going to show you

00:18:56.446 --> 00:19:01.513
with the music --
The reason I play the music is

00:19:01.513 --> 00:19:05.116
not just for fun.
Well, it's 85% fun and 15%

00:19:05.116 --> 00:19:08.467
learning.
Can we turn it on for a second?

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:12.489
What I would like to do is,
as we play the music,

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:17.432
the reason I am playing the
music for that 15% is so you can

00:19:17.432 --> 00:19:21.454
listen to distortion.
I want you to listen to the

00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:24.805
distortion.
That is when the articulation

00:19:24.805 --> 00:19:30.000
is here you are not going to get
much distortion.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.552
But as I get into cutoff you
should be getting a bunch of

00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:37.886
distortion.
Similarly, as you get into the

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:42.926
triode region you should also be
getting distortion because the

00:19:42.926 --> 00:19:47.398
amplification from being
somewhat nonlinear here becomes

00:19:47.398 --> 00:19:50.325
highly nonlinear at those two
points.

00:19:50.325 --> 00:19:54.390
So let's just play the signal.
So volume increases,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.455
or rather the amplitude
increases by increasing the

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:02.777
bias.
Now you should hear the volume

00:20:02.777 --> 00:20:05.000
go down and distortion.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.758
So notice now that the bias
point is way down here.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.737
So the gain is very low,
and plus there is a distortion

00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:23.386
because of cutoff.
Now what I will do is blast it

00:20:23.386 --> 00:20:26.751
up here, and you will see that
the volume has gone up but then

00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:29.786
you see distortion again.
Let's see if you can stand the

00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:31.000
volume here.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Even the CD doesn't like that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.917
Notice that as I went up here
the volume kept increasing

00:21:05.917 --> 00:21:09.479
because the gain kept
increasing, but as I got into

00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:12.969
the triode region I began to
lose my gain because,

00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:17.386
remember, the amplifier doesn't
have gain in the triode region,

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:21.232
MOSFET in its triode region,
and we also get a bunch of

00:21:21.232 --> 00:21:24.794
distortion out there.
Finally, it turns out that as

00:21:24.794 --> 00:21:28.000
people are building amplifiers
--

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.863
I think this was in the mid to
late `50s and `60s and so on.

00:21:33.863 --> 00:21:38.037
They said man,
electrical engineers are not

00:21:38.037 --> 00:21:44.099
going to get their thing right.
So they invented a new kind of

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:48.869
music which was much more
tolerant to distortion.

00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:52.248
And I will play that music for
you.

00:21:52.248 --> 00:21:57.416
It is called hard rock.
I challenge you to tell me it

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.000
is distorting.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Sounds good to me.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.428
OK.
All right.

00:22:31.428 --> 00:22:34.064
That'll do it.
Thank you.

00:22:34.064 --> 00:22:40.655
I hope there are no hard rock
musicians in here who will come

00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:45.159
and beat me up after lecture or
something.

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:49.553
All right.
Believe it or not most of that

00:22:49.553 --> 00:22:53.617
was review.
There is nothing new today

00:22:53.617 --> 00:22:59.000
besides some fun and games and
so on.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.227
I will give you a breather for
five seconds before jumping into

00:23:03.227 --> 00:23:05.000
something even more fun.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.099
I want you to look at the
middle board here.

00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:33.272
And, as I told you in the
beginning of 6.002,

00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:36.444
engineering is about building
useful systems.

00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:40.265
Engineering is not about
showing off at math or saying

00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:43.076
man, I am really cool in math
and stuff.

00:23:43.076 --> 00:23:46.248
Engineering is about building
useful systems,

00:23:46.248 --> 00:23:49.276
and you want to find the
simplest, easiest,

00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:53.241
cheapest way to get there.
Unlike deep areas of math and

00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:55.909
theory and so on,
the beauty is in the

00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:59.521
simplicity.
So the aesthetics are in how

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:02.673
simply can we make things and
still get to where we want to

00:24:02.673 --> 00:24:04.864
be?
All through the course what you

00:24:04.864 --> 00:24:08.291
will be seeing happening again
and again and again is when

00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:11.238
things begin to get too grovelly
in terms of math,

00:24:11.238 --> 00:24:14.124
we will step back and say oops,
we are engineers,

00:24:14.124 --> 00:24:16.409
remember?
Let's find a much simpler way

00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:19.536
to do it and use intuition.
So time and time and time

00:24:19.536 --> 00:24:23.144
again, I am going to take you on
a simpler path where you can

00:24:23.144 --> 00:24:25.790
solve things by inspection by
pure intuition.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.000
Most circuit designers do that.
So take a look at this.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.500
I don't like this nasty
differentiation here.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.875
That's getting into late high
school calculus and so on.

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:42.409
Let's avoid the math and let's
see if you find some way of

00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:45.511
doing it that is even much more
simpler.

00:24:45.511 --> 00:24:50.443
And that is what I will do next
and show you what is called the

00:24:50.443 --> 00:24:54.340
small signal circuit view.
A purely circuit way of

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.000
developing the small signal
model.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.519
So let me just start by drawing
the large signal equivalent

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:06.181
circuit for you.
I will draw it here for reasons

00:25:06.181 --> 00:25:10.000
that will be obvious at the end
of the class.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.966
All right.
This is the large signal

00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:54.683
equivalent circuit model for our
MOSFET amplifier.

00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:59.000
VS and here is my current
source.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.387
iDS relates to the square of VI
minus VT.

00:26:02.387 --> 00:26:06.877
So stare at that for a second.
And that is a nonlinear

00:26:06.877 --> 00:26:10.180
circuit.
iDS relates to the square of VI

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.144
minus VT.
Let me start by making the

00:26:13.144 --> 00:26:17.040
following claim.
Let me shoot from the hip here

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.038
and make the following grand
claim, and then I will show you

00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:26.781
how I can prove that claim.
The grand claim I am about to

00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:32.628
make says the following.
A bunch of little devices here.

00:26:32.628 --> 00:26:37.461
It is a nonlinear circuit.
Just suppose for a moment we do

00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:41.701
a Gedanken experiment.
Suppose I replace each of my

00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:46.789
circuit elements here with its
linearized element equivalent.

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:49.757
In other words,
here is a VS source,

00:26:49.757 --> 00:26:54.760
here is a dependent current
source, let me replace them with

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.000
their linear equivalent circuit
models.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.229
In other words,
with their corresponding small

00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:05.960
signal element models.
And I will show you what those

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.400
are in a second.
The resistor has a

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.840
corresponding small signal
element.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.145
The dependent current source
has a corresponding small signal

00:27:15.145 --> 00:27:18.949
behavioral element model.
And what I am going to do is

00:27:18.949 --> 00:27:22.680
keep the same circuit
connections and simply pull out

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.914
the large signal model for the
element and replace it with a

00:27:26.914 --> 00:27:31.704
small signal element model.
And by the nature of the small

00:27:31.704 --> 00:27:34.204
signal model they are all going
to be linear.

00:27:34.204 --> 00:27:37.500
So what I am going to be left
with is a linear circuit with

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.715
simple linear circuit elements
in there.

00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:42.954
And then once I have a linear
circuit, I should be able to

00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:45.397
analyze that linear circuit
using methods 1,

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:48.295
2 and 3, superposition,
Thevenin, node method and so

00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:50.000
on.
And certainly the intuitive

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.465
methods like superposition and
Thevenin, which make life a lot

00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:56.420
easier for me with linear
models, and thereby get the

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.000
function that I am looking for
very quickly.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.677
Again, my claim is that I can
replace each of these large

00:28:04.677 --> 00:28:09.604
signal models by just small
signal equivalents and then just

00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:14.449
analyze the resultant circuit.
And I claim that I should be

00:28:14.449 --> 00:28:18.040
able to get the same answer.
That's a claim.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.297
All right?
So what I will do is give you

00:28:21.297 --> 00:28:24.555
an informal proof for why I can
do that.

00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:29.316
And I also ask you to refer to
Section 8.2.1 of the course

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:33.909
notes to go through the
foundations of the small circuit

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:39.075
model in more detail.
The intuition is that,

00:28:39.075 --> 00:28:43.698
remember KVL and KCL?
I can write down KVL and KCL

00:28:43.698 --> 00:28:49.452
for every loop in that circuit
and every node in that circuit.

00:28:49.452 --> 00:28:53.981
If I do KVL and KCL,
I will end up with something

00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:57.471
like this.
For the input loop I get VI

00:28:57.471 --> 00:29:00.773
something or the other applying
KVL.

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:07.000
For the output loop I get V out
something or the other.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.909
And then applying KCL I get
some other equation in iDS.

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:16.727
So here are my KVL and KCL
equations for that circuit.

00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:22.181
Now, KVL and KCL are simply a
different representation of the

00:29:22.181 --> 00:29:27.909
circuit because within those KVL
and KCL is encoded the topology

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:32.058
of the circuit.
Remember each KVL equation

00:29:32.058 --> 00:29:36.730
represents a loop and each KCL
equation represents how nodes

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:41.005
are connected together.
So KVL and KCL equations encode

00:29:41.005 --> 00:29:44.014
within them the topology of my
circuit.

00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:47.656
What I do next is,
say, I replace each of these

00:29:47.656 --> 00:29:52.249
with the bias plus the small
signal, so I get the bias plus

00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:57.000
the small signal and keep the
equations the same.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.035
All I have done in my big set
of KVL, KCL equations,

00:30:14.035 --> 00:30:18.388
I have simply replaced the
total variable with the large

00:30:18.388 --> 00:30:21.949
signal variable and the small
signal quantity.

00:30:21.949 --> 00:30:26.064
Then comes a key trick.
The key trick is that because

00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:30.258
the bias point variables,
they are a valid solution to

00:30:30.258 --> 00:30:33.588
the circuit.
The circuit is in this

00:30:33.588 --> 00:30:36.838
quiescent state,
and those are valid solutions

00:30:36.838 --> 00:30:39.799
to circuit.
So therefore I can cancel them

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:42.038
out.
So the VI, the large signal

00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:45.794
values can be cancelled out
leaving just small signal

00:30:45.794 --> 00:30:48.322
variables in there.
So from the KVL,

00:30:48.322 --> 00:30:52.222
KCL equations I can cancel out
the large signal values,

00:30:52.222 --> 00:30:56.122
the DC bias points because they
satisfy the KVL and KCL

00:30:56.122 --> 00:30:59.247
themselves.
In other words,

00:30:59.247 --> 00:31:02.906
I could have written VI plus V
out and so on.

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:07.729
Since they are satisfied I just
strike out the large signal

00:31:07.729 --> 00:31:11.970
variable from both sides of each
of these equations,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.460
so what is left is the same
KVL, KCL equations but with

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.202
small variables in place of the
big variables.

00:31:20.202 --> 00:31:24.942
What that should tell you,
this informal proof should tell

00:31:24.942 --> 00:31:29.682
you is that the small signal
variables should then satisfy

00:31:29.682 --> 00:31:34.089
the same form of the KVL,
KCL equations that the total

00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:38.583
variables satisfy.
And because the KVL,

00:31:38.583 --> 00:31:43.413
KCL equations are a reflection
of the topology of the circuit,

00:31:43.413 --> 00:31:48.005
what that says is that the
small signal variables must also

00:31:48.005 --> 00:31:52.043
satisfy KVL and KCL.
And since these arrive from the

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:56.557
small signal elements that says
that I can replace the big

00:31:56.557 --> 00:32:01.387
elements with the small elements
and KVL and KCL will hold for

00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:06.387
the resulting circuit.
This is a very quick breeze

00:32:06.387 --> 00:32:11.693
through, an informal proof to
show that I can replace the big

00:32:11.693 --> 00:32:17.088
elements with the corresponding
little element models and then

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:22.571
simply apply linear techniques.
Refer to Section 8.2.1 for more

00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:28.142
foundations and more discussion
about the foundations for why we

00:32:28.142 --> 00:32:34.221
can do this.
That brings up the small signal

00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:40.076
circuit method.
The circuit method for small

00:32:40.076 --> 00:32:47.429
signal analysis has three steps.
The first step is find

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:55.055
operating point by using LS.
First you analyze your large

00:32:55.055 --> 00:33:02.000
signal circuit and find the
operating point.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.730
You have to do this,
because remember,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:14.401
the small signal models depend
on the operating point values.

00:33:14.401 --> 00:33:21.305
Remember the gain of our
amplifier depended on the bias

00:33:21.305 --> 00:33:25.652
point.
Second step is develop small

00:33:25.652 --> 00:33:34.173
signal models of elements.
Second step is take each of the

00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:41.576
elements in your circuit and
find their equivalent small

00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:46.692
circuit model for each of the
elements.

00:33:46.692 --> 00:33:55.038
Third step is replace original
elements with their small signal

00:33:55.038 --> 00:34:01.638
model elements.
Third step is simply take the

00:34:01.638 --> 00:34:08.414
large elements and replace them
with their small signal

00:34:08.414 --> 00:34:14.562
equivalent models.
Then analyze resulting circuit,

00:34:14.562 --> 00:34:19.707
and that circuit will be a
linear circuit.

00:34:19.707 --> 00:34:26.231
So let's do an example.
I will just use the amplifier

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:34.264
as an example of this method.
And convince you that you are

00:34:34.264 --> 00:34:40.569
going to get the same expression
at the end, but just so,

00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:46.986
so simply without even the
smallest amount of grubby math.

00:34:46.986 --> 00:34:51.602
Three steps.
The first step is to find the

00:34:51.602 --> 00:34:56.556
operating point using the large
signal model.

00:34:56.556 --> 00:35:01.622
And let me just do that here.
I get my V out =

00:35:01.622 --> 00:35:07.313
VS-K/2(VI-VT)^2 RL.
Let me just write down that out

00:35:07.313 --> 00:35:09.925
here.
Don't worry about copying that

00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:12.537
down.
It is on the last page of your

00:35:12.537 --> 00:35:15.074
notes.
The first step of the method

00:35:15.074 --> 00:35:19.776
simply applies the large signal
model and finds out the behavior

00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:24.104
of that circuit to find out what
the bias point values are.

00:35:24.104 --> 00:35:28.358
The second step is to develop
the small signal model of my

00:35:28.358 --> 00:35:33.006
elements.
How do I go about developing

00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:36.765
the small signal models of
elements?

00:35:36.765 --> 00:35:42.993
Let's start with the MOSFET.
The large signal model for the

00:35:42.993 --> 00:35:46.000
MOSFET looks like this.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.144
Here is my Vgs.
This is my gate.

00:35:56.144 --> 00:36:00.000
This is my drain.
This is my source.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.267
And I know my iDS to be
K/2(Vgs-VT)^2.

00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:07.507
So this is the large signal
model for the MOSFET,

00:36:07.507 --> 00:36:12.011
again in saturation.
I am talking about all of these

00:36:12.011 --> 00:36:15.720
models are under the saturation
discipline.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.754
So Vgs relates to iDS in the
following way for the MOSFET.

00:36:20.754 --> 00:36:24.287
That is iDS,
is K/2 and that is my square

00:36:24.287 --> 00:36:28.085
law relationship.
So what is a corresponding

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:34.222
small signal model?
I go ahead and start with this.

00:36:34.222 --> 00:36:40.043
The corresponding small signal
model simply says that iDS

00:36:40.043 --> 00:36:43.681
relates to Vgs in the following
way.

00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:49.605
All I have to do is find a
small signal equivalent where I

00:36:49.605 --> 00:36:54.179
need to find out,
given a small change in the

00:36:54.179 --> 00:37:00.000
input Vgs, what is the small
change in the iDS?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.935
So I can apply my standard
trick to a much simpler

00:37:04.935 --> 00:37:08.561
expression here,
which is iDS simply,

00:37:08.561 --> 00:37:14.000
I differentiate this function
with respect to Vgs.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.152
So I don't completely eliminate
the math here,

00:37:24.152 --> 00:37:28.389
but it is a much simpler
problem here.

00:37:28.389 --> 00:37:34.000
At Vgs equals the bias point
times small vgs.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.616
I can find the small change in
iDS corresponding to a small

00:37:41.616 --> 00:37:47.000
change in the input using this
expression.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.383
That gives me iDS as simply
K(Vgs-VT) vgs.

00:37:52.383 --> 00:37:58.030
I call this gm,
and I will tell you why in a

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:02.264
second.
So what does this expression

00:38:02.264 --> 00:38:05.013
say?
This expression says that if I

00:38:05.013 --> 00:38:10.026
have a small change in Vgs then
this will be my small change in

00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:12.857
iDS.
Notice that the resulting small

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:16.657
signal model is also a dependent
current source.

00:38:16.657 --> 00:38:20.781
It is a voltage controlled
dependent current source.

00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:25.471
So the output is the current,
and it is a dependent current

00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:30.000
source and it depends on the
input voltage.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.941
The good news is that notice
that this one,

00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:39.197
this expression here gm is a
constant related to the bias

00:38:39.197 --> 00:38:42.857
point values.
Therefore, notice that the

00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:47.268
small signal model for the
MOSFET in saturation,

00:38:47.268 --> 00:38:51.679
not surprisingly,
is a linear voltage controlled

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:56.559
current source according to the
following expression.

00:38:56.559 --> 00:39:01.440
So iDS=gm Vgs.
Gm is a representation for

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.381
K(Vgs-VT) and is called a
transconductance.

00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:10.731
It is called a transconductance
because it, in some sense,

00:39:10.731 --> 00:39:15.893
deflects the conductance
properties of this based on the

00:39:15.893 --> 00:39:19.084
input.
So it is a transconductance.

00:39:19.084 --> 00:39:24.152
So this value is called Vgs.
Therefore, I can build the

00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:32.456
small signal model as follows.
Vgs is a voltage controlled

00:39:32.456 --> 00:39:38.893
current source and iDS is simply
gm Vgs.

00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:45.000
So this is my gate,
drain, source.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.433
So that is the small signal
model for my MOSFET.

00:39:59.433 --> 00:40:05.000
As a next step what are the
other elements in my circuit?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.779
Let's see.
I have a voltage source and I

00:40:08.779 --> 00:40:12.461
have a resistor,
so let me find out the

00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:17.403
corresponding small signal model
for a DC supply VS.

00:40:17.403 --> 00:40:21.860
This is Page 7.
I will do it mathematically for

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:27.480
you, but often times it is
always good to do a sanity check

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.846
using intuition.
Let me ask you,

00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:38.000
the large signal for a DC
supply looks like this.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.915
The element law for a voltage
source is VS equals some capital

00:40:49.915 --> 00:40:52.630
VS.
It is a constant voltage.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:58.739
So what do you expect to be the
small signal model for a voltage

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:01.324
source?
In other words,

00:41:01.324 --> 00:41:05.564
for a small change,
suppose I have a small change

00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:09.450
in the current,
by how much should the output

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.099
VS change?
It shouldn't change.

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:16.868
It is a voltage source.
So what does intuition tell you

00:41:16.868 --> 00:41:20.931
is a small signal model for the
voltage source?

00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:23.846
A short.
So the key here is that a

00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:28.438
voltage source behaves like a
short circuit for small

00:41:28.438 --> 00:41:32.445
perturbations.
In other words,

00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:38.130
if I change the current flowing
through it by a small amount

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.755
somehow, the output is still
going to held at VS.

00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:47.091
In other words,
small signals are simply going

00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:52.968
to scoot through this voltage
source without having any impact

00:41:52.968 --> 00:41:58.364
whatsoever on the voltage.
Or mathematically I could also

00:41:58.364 --> 00:42:04.242
do small vs is del by del IS of
VS evaluated at IS equals some

00:42:04.242 --> 00:42:10.784
capital IS times small IS.
And therefore VS equals zero.

00:42:10.784 --> 00:42:15.775
What that means is that the
small signal model for my

00:42:15.775 --> 00:42:20.000
voltage source is simply a short
circuit.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.939
So in a small circuit voltage
sources appear like a short

00:42:31.939 --> 00:42:37.199
circuit.
Finally, I have a resistor,

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:42.333
my resistor R.
Let me find out its

00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:47.311
corresponding small signal
model.

00:42:47.311 --> 00:42:54.155
The large signal model looks
like this R, VR,

00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:58.977
IR.
And I know that VR is simply

00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:04.098
RIR.
And to find the small signal

00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:09.632
equivalent I do del of IRR
divided by del IR for IR

00:43:09.632 --> 00:43:14.944
calculated at some constant
value times small IR.

00:43:14.944 --> 00:43:21.474
What I am looking to do is to
find out what is the change in

00:43:21.474 --> 00:43:29.000
the voltage across R for a small
perturbation in the current?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.010
Again, let me exhort you to
rely on intuition to at least

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.663
sanity check your answers.
So what do you think this

00:43:36.663 --> 00:43:39.885
should look like?
It's a resistor and I have a

00:43:39.885 --> 00:43:43.681
small change in the current,
by what do you expect the

00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:45.830
voltage to change?
Think about,

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.912
for the next five seconds,
what the small signal model for

00:43:49.912 --> 00:43:54.496
this should look like and then I
will go ahead and write down the

00:43:54.496 --> 00:43:56.000
answer.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.991
So differentiating I simply get
RIR.

00:44:09.991 --> 00:44:15.236
In other words,
for a resistor the small signal

00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:19.000
model is the resistor itself.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.087
So what I have done so far,
let me just take you through

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:37.101
where we are right now,
give you the big picture there.

00:44:37.101 --> 00:44:41.337
I began by suggesting that
looking to find an even simpler

00:44:41.337 --> 00:44:46.020
way to do small signal analysis.
I gave you an informal proof to

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:50.405
show that if I had small signal
element models for all of my

00:44:50.405 --> 00:44:55.087
elements, I could simply replace
them in the circuit and then do

00:44:55.087 --> 00:44:59.695
a corresponding linear circuit
analysis phase to get the result

00:44:59.695 --> 00:45:04.020
I am looking for.
There are three steps to the

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.474
method.
As a first step we began by

00:45:06.474 --> 00:45:10.226
finding small signal models for
each of our elements.

00:45:10.226 --> 00:45:14.484
For the nonlinear MOSFET the
small signal model was a linear

00:45:14.484 --> 00:45:18.020
dependent current source.
For a voltage source the

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.773
corresponding small signal model
was a short circuit.

00:45:21.773 --> 00:45:25.381
Again, that makes sense
intuitively if I change the

00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:30.000
current through a voltage source
by a small amount.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.658
By how much does the voltage
change?

00:45:32.658 --> 00:45:34.860
It is a voltage source,
silly.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.582
The voltage doesn't change.
So the small signal V,

00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:43.139
the small change in the voltage
is zero, and that is the same

00:45:43.139 --> 00:45:47.392
thing as a short circuit.
For a resistor by how much does

00:45:47.392 --> 00:45:51.949
the voltage change if I change
the current by a small amount?

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:55.746
Well, it will change by R times
the current change,

00:45:55.746 --> 00:46:00.000
and that is the property of a
resistor, R.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.761
As a final step what I would
like to do, on Page 8,

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:10.571
I'd like to very quickly draw
for you the small signal circuit

00:46:10.571 --> 00:46:14.761
and then analyze it.
This is the large signal

00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:18.476
circuit.
That is a large signal circuit.

00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:22.285
And let me draw the small
signal circuit.

00:46:22.285 --> 00:46:27.428
And the method says simply
pluck out, gouge out each of

00:46:27.428 --> 00:46:32.445
these elements.
And simply replace each of

00:46:32.445 --> 00:46:37.899
these nasty nonlinear elements
with the corresponding small

00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:41.943
signal linear equivalents.
So let's do that.

00:46:41.943 --> 00:46:47.115
Remember, for the input you
replace input with its small

00:46:47.115 --> 00:46:52.664
signal voltage because I am
telling you that it's sourcing a

00:46:52.664 --> 00:46:55.768
small change in VI.
So that is VI.

00:46:55.768 --> 00:47:00.000
And then I replace a short for
VS.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:10.517
I replace an R for RL because
it is an RL itself for the small

00:47:10.517 --> 00:47:17.241
signal model.
And then for the dependent

00:47:17.241 --> 00:47:27.413
source, we discovered that the
dependent source was a linear

00:47:27.413 --> 00:47:35.000
dependent source given where
ids=gmvi.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.608
Remember, this was my small VO.
Here you go.

00:47:38.608 --> 00:47:43.727
I have a small signal circuit
here where I have simply created

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:48.006
that by replacing each of the
big elements by little

00:47:48.006 --> 00:47:51.699
rinky-dink elements.
Now these are all linear

00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:56.062
elements so I can do a really
simple linear analysis.

00:47:56.062 --> 00:48:01.480
What method shall we use?
Well, this is so simple.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.026
I will just go ahead and use
the node method.

00:48:06.026 --> 00:48:11.710
So applying the node method at
the node with voltage VO,

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:17.393
what I will do is the current
going up, VO divided by RL

00:48:17.393 --> 00:48:20.803
equals the current going down
iDS.

00:48:20.803 --> 00:48:27.210
And so the current going up is
VO divided by RL and the current

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:33.613
going down is --
Oops, I should have done this.

00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:41.080
The total current going out is
zero, so the sum of these two is

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.416
zero.
That is my good old node method

00:48:45.416 --> 00:48:49.510
here.
And I know that iDS is simply

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.569
gmvi equals zero.
So right there I have the

00:48:54.569 --> 00:49:03.000
relationship between VO and VI.
So VO is simply minus gmviRL.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:11.000
And remember gm was simply K VI
minus VT.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.111
We are done,
OK?

00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:21.370
What have we here?
I created a linear circuit

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.814
which simply comprised small
signal models for each of my big

00:49:25.814 --> 00:49:28.185
elements.
And then I simply did a

00:49:28.185 --> 00:49:32.481
straightforward linear analysis
using any one of the linear

00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:36.925
techniques I knew about.
This is simple enough so I

00:49:36.925 --> 00:49:40.627
apply the node method.
And I've got the equation at

00:49:40.627 --> 00:49:44.625
this node, simplified it and I
directly got the answer.

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:48.623
In one or two steps I directly
gave you the output as a

00:49:48.623 --> 00:49:52.103
function of the input.
It can't get any simpler.

00:49:52.103 --> 00:49:53.103
Thank you.
