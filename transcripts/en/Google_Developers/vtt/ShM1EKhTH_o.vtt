00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.690
Belly's digital loyalty program.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.384
We work with retailers to create
a custom unique loyalty program

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:11.800
and give their
members the ability

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.020
to have one card
or app that they

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.936
can use at all of our
participating locations.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.930
We were working on
a Friday afternoon

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.550
and finally got the app
ready that we actually

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910
thought we could
put it in a business

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.910
and actually have it work.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.050
And so we went out
selling that afternoon,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.910
found a local comic book
shop here in Chicago

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.550
on a late Friday
afternoon and sold them

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.330
on the idea of trying Belly.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.080
They installed the
loyalty program,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.170
and we sat back for the
rest of the night watching

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.420
to see if anyone would use it.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.040
And that night, 17 of 20 of
their customers signed up.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.411
We saw two customers come in.

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:49.910
One of the girls
bought a comic book

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.276
her friend wasn't going to,
and she heard about the reward

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:54.650
through the loyalty
program where

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.710
you could come in 50
times and then punch

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.795
the owner in the stomach.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:00:59.170
So she walked back
into the store

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.869
to buy a comic book
just to sign up.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.160
That's when I think we knew
that we are onto something.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.730
For our product, we
put a tablet customer

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.640
facing at the point of
sale of small businesses.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.510
And so for us, when we started,
that tablet app was all native.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.220
And we ran into a number of
different scaling problems

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.550
having a native app that's
customer facing inside

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.080
of retail businesses, especially
as we started to scale.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.270
And so some of the things
that we've evolved to is--

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.510
know that app has now
gone to a hybrid app.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.890
There's a base layer of native
code for some of the hardware

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.096
interactions, but the
majority of it's HTML5.

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:40.470
Our infrastructure,
our back end,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.080
is all built on Ruby, Napa.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.840
We started to use
some new technologies

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.870
for some of our web and
command center services

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.090
that our merchants
use built on Angular.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.670
So we continue to
iterate and continue

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.500
to evolve based on some of the
problems or challenges we run

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.970
into and new technologies
that arise-- better ways

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.870
to use new tools.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.027
But I think that's kind
of the primary stack.
