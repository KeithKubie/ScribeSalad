00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.330
Notice that I frequently use the expression left of the dot

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.920
to discuss the idea of finding a focal object during method indication.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.880
But this is just an expression that I use to keep things simple.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.920
But all the same rules would apply,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.340
if you used brackets instead of dots to get access to the method.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.690
Now that we've taken a sidetrack,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.500
the question from before is even more interesting.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.990
If there is no dot,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.000
then how can we determine what the parameter of this would be bound to?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.790
What do you suspect it might get bound to in this situation?
