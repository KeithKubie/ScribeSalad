00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.705
Now that we found the factors of our constant term and our leading coefficient

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.150
for this polynomial inside parentheses, let's use these in the rational zero

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.836
theorem. Please write out for me, all of the zeros that the rational zero

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:16.210
theorem says this polynomial might have. Separate your answers by commas and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.983
don't forget the negative versions of your roots.
