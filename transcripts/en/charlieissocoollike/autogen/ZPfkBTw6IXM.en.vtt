okay let's start with a really basic
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.610
okay let's start with a really basic
stuff this is what Saturn looks like

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
stuff this is what Saturn looks like
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.140
stuff this is what Saturn looks like
it's the second largest planet in our

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
it's the second largest planet in our
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.670
it's the second largest planet in our
solar system the sixth furthest away

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
solar system the sixth furthest away
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.530
solar system the sixth furthest away
from the Sun it's predominantly made of

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
from the Sun it's predominantly made of
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419
from the Sun it's predominantly made of
gas it as a nice big ring around it and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
gas it as a nice big ring around it and
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.970
gas it as a nice big ring around it and
that is everything that I ever learned

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
that is everything that I ever learned
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.039
that is everything that I ever learned
about Saturn when I was in school not

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
about Saturn when I was in school not
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.540
about Saturn when I was in school not
very much it was a pretty good starting

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
very much it was a pretty good starting
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070
very much it was a pretty good starting
point but when it comes to astronomy

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
point but when it comes to astronomy
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.019
point but when it comes to astronomy
personally I find that the closer you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
personally I find that the closer you
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269
personally I find that the closer you
look the more interesting stuff gets and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
look the more interesting stuff gets and
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.859
look the more interesting stuff gets and
so here are my favorite things about

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
so here are my favorite things about
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390
so here are my favorite things about
Saturn that I have learned since I

and not only that but if you view the
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250
and not only that but if you view the
moon again but with heat vision the

to its rings it sort of doesn't really
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969
to its rings it sort of doesn't really
look like that much however the fact

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
look like that much however the fact
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.590
look like that much however the fact
that there actually isn't that much to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
that there actually isn't that much to
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.569

Saturn is one of the most interesting

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
Saturn is one of the most interesting
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010
Saturn is one of the most interesting
things about it because although it is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
things about it because although it is
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080
things about it because although it is
massive it's about 10 times as big as

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
massive it's about 10 times as big as
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.179
massive it's about 10 times as big as
Earth is because it's mostly made of gas

Earth is because it's mostly made of gas
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609
Earth is because it's mostly made of gas
it's actually the least dense planet in

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
it's actually the least dense planet in
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380
it's actually the least dense planet in
the solar system which means it just

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
the solar system which means it just
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090
the solar system which means it just
isn't very much stuff that makes it up

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
isn't very much stuff that makes it up
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.469
isn't very much stuff that makes it up
now what this means for the planet is

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
now what this means for the planet is
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749
now what this means for the planet is
that because it also rotates incredibly

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
that because it also rotates incredibly
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030
that because it also rotates incredibly
quickly much faster than I could do of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
quickly much faster than I could do of

the whole thing is actually squashed by

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
the whole thing is actually squashed by
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.600
the whole thing is actually squashed by
about 10% which on that scale is insane

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
about 10% which on that scale is insane
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069
about 10% which on that scale is insane
but even more crazier than that is the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
but even more crazier than that is the
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.139
but even more crazier than that is the
fact that Saturn the planet is actually

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
fact that Saturn the planet is actually
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.809
fact that Saturn the planet is actually
less dense than water which means that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
less dense than water which means that
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.830
less dense than water which means that
if you were to find

big enough swimming pool to put it in
satin would float it is a planet that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
satin would float it is a planet that
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.360
satin would float it is a planet that
would flow on water like a friggin

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
would flow on water like a friggin

years ago by Galileo but due to the
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.390

exactly what he was looking at it was a
 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.690
exactly what he was looking at it was a
bit blurry basically he made tons of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
bit blurry basically he made tons of
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.309
bit blurry basically he made tons of
observations and drawings of them and

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319
observations and drawings of them and
 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.020
observations and drawings of them and
was just incredibly baffled remember

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
was just incredibly baffled remember
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.089
was just incredibly baffled remember
this is the first time that anyone had

this is the first time that anyone had
 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.280
this is the first time that anyone had
ever seen a ring around a planet ever he

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
ever seen a ring around a planet ever he
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.720
ever seen a ring around a planet ever he
even once described the planet as having

know that not only is a ring system
incredibly intricately complicated but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
incredibly intricately complicated but
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.619
incredibly intricately complicated but
it's actually made up of millions and

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629
it's actually made up of millions and
 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.559
it's actually made up of millions and
millions of blocks of ice which is by

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
millions of blocks of ice which is by
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.119
millions of blocks of ice which is by
the way the reason that we can even see

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129
the way the reason that we can even see
 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.369
the way the reason that we can even see
Saturn's rings from so far away because

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379
Saturn's rings from so far away because
 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.620
Saturn's rings from so far away because
the light from the Sun travels and hits

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
the light from the Sun travels and hits
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.930
the light from the Sun travels and hits
the ice in Saturn's rings and the ice

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940
the ice in Saturn's rings and the ice
 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360
the ice in Saturn's rings and the ice
reflects that light back causing the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
reflects that light back causing the
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.150
reflects that light back causing the
Rings to shine that's why we can see

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
Rings to shine that's why we can see
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.800
Rings to shine that's why we can see
Saturn's rings because they are

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
Saturn's rings because they are
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.599
Saturn's rings because they are
literally shiny now although there's no

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
literally shiny now although there's no
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.370
literally shiny now although there's no
current consensus on how the Rings

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
current consensus on how the Rings
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.910
current consensus on how the Rings
formed

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
formed
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.259

why they're actually there one thing we

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
why they're actually there one thing we
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.030
why they're actually there one thing we
do know for certain about them is that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
do know for certain about them is that
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.379
do know for certain about them is that
they are not going to be there forever

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389
they are not going to be there forever
 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.930
they are not going to be there forever
eventually they will just drift away

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
eventually they will just drift away
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.089
eventually they will just drift away
which is pretty sad sure but to me it

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099
which is pretty sad sure but to me it
 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.319
which is pretty sad sure but to me it
just makes it all the more special that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329
just makes it all the more special that
 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.449
just makes it all the more special that
we are alive now at a time when we can

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459
we are alive now at a time when we can
 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.190
we are alive now at a time when we can
truly appreciate the Rings for what they

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
truly appreciate the Rings for what they
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.569
truly appreciate the Rings for what they
are and one of my personal favorite ways

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
are and one of my personal favorite ways
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.640
are and one of my personal favorite ways
to appreciate Saturn is with this photo

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650
to appreciate Saturn is with this photo
 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860
to appreciate Saturn is with this photo
taken by the Cassini spacecraft of a

just that as well it's a picture a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810

see that little white speck there in the
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800

background sort of looks like it could

background sort of looks like it could
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.539
background sort of looks like it could
be one of Saturn's moons that's earth

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549
be one of Saturn's moons that's earth
 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.159

just happen to be caught in the

photo bobbing right there so there you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190
photo bobbing right there so there you
 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.270
photo bobbing right there so there you
go that's everything I love about Saturn

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
go that's everything I love about Saturn
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.410
go that's everything I love about Saturn
the no wait then that's that's a case

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420
the no wait then that's that's a case
 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.450
the no wait then that's that's a case
just had the almost imponderable joy of

just had the almost imponderable joy of
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.570
just had the almost imponderable joy of
watching Charlie is so cool like which

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
