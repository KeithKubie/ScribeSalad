only told you that it went through a
 

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.000
only told you that it went through a
gantry not not the time that it left

gantry not not the time that it left
 

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.210
gantry not not the time that it left
only said that this cop car went and you

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:09.220
only said that this cop car went and you
 

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.200
only said that this cop car went and you
used the transponder number you want to

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.210
used the transponder number you want to
 

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.270
used the transponder number you want to
show that okay so there it is that's

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:18.280
show that okay so there it is that's
 

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.010
show that okay so there it is that's
what it looks that's exactly the raw

data we got for city of Miami and if you
 

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.330
data we got for city of Miami and if you
look at it it doesn't show when they

went through the gantry to go but this
 

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.299
went through the gantry to go but this
doesn't do it for you and also what it

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:45.309
doesn't do it for you and also what it
 

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:47.970
doesn't do it for you and also what it
doesn't do is doesn't have mileage so

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:47.980
doesn't do is doesn't have mileage so
 

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.790
doesn't do is doesn't have mileage so
right away we knew we had a problem we

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800
right away we knew we had a problem we
 

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.650
right away we knew we had a problem we
call it called the state and said can

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
call it called the state and said can
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.900
call it called the state and said can
you give us the mileage between these

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:54.910
you give us the mileage between these
 

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.639
you give us the mileage between these
toll gantries and they said well we can

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:56.649
toll gantries and they said well we can
 

00:12:56.649 --> 00:13:01.350
toll gantries and they said well we can
give you the mileage mile marker which

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360
give you the mileage mile marker which
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.619
give you the mileage mile marker which
just just mile marker 13 mile marker 18

just just mile marker 13 mile marker 18
we knew that wasn't good enough because

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639
we knew that wasn't good enough because
 

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:09.299
we knew that wasn't good enough because
this information we had to have it very

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:09.309
this information we had to have it very
 

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:13.619
this information we had to have it very
very accurate so after wondering how to

00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:13.629
very accurate so after wondering how to
 

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:16.049
very accurate so after wondering how to
do that for a little while we we call

00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:16.059
do that for a little while we we call
 

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:19.290
do that for a little while we we call

garments alley called Garmin the GPS
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.840
garments alley called Garmin the GPS
manufacturer and garment said we've got

just the thing for you it's a little

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:23.529
just the thing for you it's a little
 

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:25.919
just the thing for you it's a little
thing about the size of a matchbox and

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:25.929
thing about the size of a matchbox and
 

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:29.369
thing about the size of a matchbox and
it's extremely accurate it's runners and

00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:29.379
it's extremely accurate it's runners and
 

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:32.609
it's extremely accurate it's runners and
bicyclists use it for for timing

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:32.619
bicyclists use it for for timing
 

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:35.309
bicyclists use it for for timing
themselves and so we got that one

00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:35.319
themselves and so we got that one
 

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:36.629
themselves and so we got that one
hundred forty dollars in something like

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639
hundred forty dollars in something like
 

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:39.780
hundred forty dollars in something like
that and and and so that's we set out to

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:39.790
that and and and so that's we set out to
 

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.929
that and and and so that's we set out to
drive ultimately ended up like 2,500

00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:42.939
drive ultimately ended up like 2,500
 

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:44.910
drive ultimately ended up like 2,500

miles that we drove going gantry to
 

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.289
miles that we drove going gantry to
gantry in the dead of night and and

gantry in the dead of night and and
 

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:51.210
gantry in the dead of night and and
collecting all this data for mileage so

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.220
collecting all this data for mileage so
 

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.160
collecting all this data for mileage so
then once we had that it was simple math

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.170
then once we had that it was simple math
 

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.049
then once we had that it was simple math
really how long did that take you just

00:13:58.049 --> 00:13:58.059
really how long did that take you just
 

00:13:58.059 --> 00:14:01.069
really how long did that take you just
two of you collecting for each country

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079
two of you collecting for each country
 

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:04.019
two of you collecting for each country
the mileage record it turned out to be a

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:04.029
the mileage record it turned out to be a
 

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:05.519
the mileage record it turned out to be a
lot more time-consuming than we

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:05.529
lot more time-consuming than we
 

00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:08.850
lot more time-consuming than we
initially envisioned partly because it

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:08.860
initially envisioned partly because it
 

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.249
initially envisioned partly because it
was impossible to not get run over by

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:11.259
was impossible to not get run over by
 

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.319
was impossible to not get run over by
another aggressive South Florida driver

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:13.329
another aggressive South Florida driver
 

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:15.059
another aggressive South Florida driver
and do it yourself because you had to

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:15.069
and do it yourself because you had to
 

00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:17.129
and do it yourself because you had to
slow down enough to mark the exact spot

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:17.139
slow down enough to mark the exact spot
 

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:19.769
slow down enough to mark the exact spot
underneath the toll Gendry and it was

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:19.779
underneath the toll Gendry and it was
 

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:21.419
underneath the toll Gendry and it was
too much to do for one person so it was

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:21.429
too much to do for one person so it was
 

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:23.549
too much to do for one person so it was
a two-person job one person drove and

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:23.559
a two-person job one person drove and
 

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:25.949
a two-person job one person drove and
the other one would mark the the

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959
the other one would mark the the
 

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:27.329
the other one would mark the the
beginning of the route in the end of the

00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:27.339
beginning of the route in the end of the
 

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:28.859
beginning of the route in the end of the
route with the GPS and record the

00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:28.869
route with the GPS and record the
 

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:32.579
route with the GPS and record the
mileage so that ate up a lot of time and

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:32.589
mileage so that ate up a lot of time and
 

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:34.559
mileage so that ate up a lot of time and
it took us probably about six weeks I

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:34.569
it took us probably about six weeks I
 

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:36.359
it took us probably about six weeks I
guess we at one point recruited an

00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:36.369
guess we at one point recruited an
 

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:38.789
guess we at one point recruited an
editorial assistant and the newsroom to

00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:38.799
editorial assistant and the newsroom to
 

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.859
editorial assistant and the newsroom to
be our driver the other thing we

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:40.869
be our driver the other thing we
 

00:14:40.869 --> 00:14:43.259
be our driver the other thing we
realized was it wasn't good enough to

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:43.269
realized was it wasn't good enough to
 

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.500
realized was it wasn't good enough to
just go one direction from one

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:46.510
just go one direction from one
 

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.900
just go one direction from one
booth to the next you could not assume

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:48.910
booth to the next you could not assume
 

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.540
booth to the next you could not assume
it was the same distance in the opposite

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:51.550
it was the same distance in the opposite
 

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.550
it was the same distance in the opposite
direction and a lot of that had to do

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560
direction and a lot of that had to do
 

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.030
direction and a lot of that had to do
with exit ramps you know you might enter

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040
with exit ramps you know you might enter
 

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.740
with exit ramps you know you might enter
with a just a straight shot onto the

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:58.750
with a just a straight shot onto the
 

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.230
with a just a straight shot onto the
highway or you might go through a loop

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240
highway or you might go through a loop
 

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.120
highway or you might go through a loop
and that really affects the distance so

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.130
and that really affects the distance so
 

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.140
and that really affects the distance so
we had to measure each way both ways and

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.150
we had to measure each way both ways and
 

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.600
we had to measure each way both ways and
it was we got reimbursed for I think

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:09.610
it was we got reimbursed for I think
 

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.230
it was we got reimbursed for I think
2,500 miles on driven on our cars so

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240
2,500 miles on driven on our cars so
 

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.090
2,500 miles on driven on our cars so
finding the evidence of the speeding was

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.100
finding the evidence of the speeding was
 

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.280
finding the evidence of the speeding was
one part of the story the other part was

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:17.290
one part of the story the other part was
 

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.780
one part of the story the other part was
finding evidence of the damage to

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:18.790
finding evidence of the damage to
 

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.580
finding evidence of the damage to
speeding it costs how did you go about

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.590
speeding it costs how did you go about
 

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.450
speeding it costs how did you go about
doing that Oh Sally is great about every

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:24.460
doing that Oh Sally is great about every
 

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.230
doing that Oh Sally is great about every
time she does a story she won't say okay

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240
time she does a story she won't say okay
 

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.230
time she does a story she won't say okay
we've proved wrong doing but who are the

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240
we've proved wrong doing but who are the
 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.260
we've proved wrong doing but who are the
victims who are the victims here and and

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:34.270
victims who are the victims here and and
 

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.610
victims who are the victims here and and
so what she basically set out to do was

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620
so what she basically set out to do was
 

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.020
so what she basically set out to do was
basically find out people who had been

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.030
basically find out people who had been
 

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.760
basically find out people who had been
killed by cops going at high rates of

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:41.770
killed by cops going at high rates of
 

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.860
killed by cops going at high rates of
speed and it happens to turns out that

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:43.870
speed and it happens to turns out that
 

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.050
speed and it happens to turns out that
there's quite a few of them and not only

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.060
there's quite a few of them and not only
 

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.640
there's quite a few of them and not only
that but sometimes the cops kill

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:47.650
that but sometimes the cops kill
 

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.520
that but sometimes the cops kill
themselves how did you find these people

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.530
themselves how did you find these people
 

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.900
themselves how did you find these people
who say a combination of just searching

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:54.910

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.000
who say a combination of just searching
actually google searching for certain

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.010
actually google searching for certain
 

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.370

ones around florida that had had gotten

00:15:59.370 --> 00:15:59.380
ones around florida that had had gotten
 

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.170
ones around florida that had had gotten
media coverage but we you know wanted to

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:01.180
media coverage but we you know wanted to
 

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.460
media coverage but we you know wanted to
do something more comprehensive than

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:02.470
do something more comprehensive than
 

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.640
do something more comprehensive than
that and for years john and our data

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:05.650
that and for years john and our data
 

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.220
that and for years john and our data
folks had collected florida highway

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.230
folks had collected florida highway
 

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.030
folks had collected florida highway
safety motor vehicle crash records so we

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040
safety motor vehicle crash records so we
 

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.220
safety motor vehicle crash records so we
had all but about i think the last two

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.230
had all but about i think the last two
 

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.980
had all but about i think the last two
years worth so we ordered those from the

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:16.990
years worth so we ordered those from the
 

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.720
years worth so we ordered those from the
state and then we were able to just

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.730
state and then we were able to just
 

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.040
state and then we were able to just
search i think we ended up searching

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.050
search i think we ended up searching
 

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.610
search i think we ended up searching
about 1.7 million crashes looking for

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:23.620
about 1.7 million crashes looking for
 

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.790
about 1.7 million crashes looking for
any that involved police officers and

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800
any that involved police officers and
 

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.060
any that involved police officers and
when those vehicles were cited for or

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.070
when those vehicles were cited for or
 

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.790
when those vehicles were cited for or
when excessive speed was a factor so

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800
when excessive speed was a factor so
 

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.490
when excessive speed was a factor so
that's how we were able to find the 320

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:35.500
that's how we were able to find the 320
 

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.009
that's how we were able to find the 320
and then the deaths and the

00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:38.019
and then the deaths and the
 

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:39.479
and then the deaths and the
you know the it really just helped

00:16:39.479 --> 00:16:39.489
you know the it really just helped
 

00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:43.139
you know the it really just helped
convey the the danger that this posed

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.149
convey the the danger that this posed
 

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:46.499
convey the the danger that this posed
and and the just tragic consequences so

00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:46.509
and and the just tragic consequences so
 

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:48.179
and and the just tragic consequences so
one of the most immersive things about

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:48.189
one of the most immersive things about
 

00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:50.400
one of the most immersive things about
these stories is your database you built

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:50.410
these stories is your database you built
 

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.900
these stories is your database you built
a searchable database can you show us

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:51.910
a searchable database can you show us
 

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.350
a searchable database can you show us
how you went from this to the actual

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360
how you went from this to the actual
 

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.609
how you went from this to the actual
database um basically there's a I won't

00:16:59.609 --> 00:16:59.619
database um basically there's a I won't
 

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:00.989
database um basically there's a I won't
go into the details but there was

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:00.999
go into the details but there was
 

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:03.150
go into the details but there was
problems with actually do building the

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160
problems with actually do building the
 

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.850
problems with actually do building the
data to get the accurate readings

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:05.860
data to get the accurate readings
 

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.980
data to get the accurate readings
because this thing the way we had to put

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:07.990
because this thing the way we had to put
 

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.260
because this thing the way we had to put
to get data together we got many many

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:10.270
to get data together we got many many
 

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.579
to get data together we got many many
false readings and we basically it

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:14.589
false readings and we basically it
 

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.460
false readings and we basically it
bloomed up from 1 million 24 million

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.470
bloomed up from 1 million 24 million
 

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.590
bloomed up from 1 million 24 million
records and that's it there was nothing

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600
records and that's it there was nothing
 

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.939
records and that's it there was nothing
we could do about that we just had to

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:20.949
we could do about that we just had to
 

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:23.250
we could do about that we just had to
figure out a way to fix it so that we

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:23.260
figure out a way to fix it so that we
 

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.049
figure out a way to fix it so that we
got really true and accurate numbers and

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:25.059
got really true and accurate numbers and
 

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:27.029
got really true and accurate numbers and
and that's that's what it looks like in

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039
and that's that's what it looks like in
 

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:29.820
and that's that's what it looks like in
the end and you can see now the plaza

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:29.830
the end and you can see now the plaza
 

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.370
the end and you can see now the plaza
one plaza to that's a start and stop and

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:32.380
one plaza to that's a start and stop and
 

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.529
one plaza to that's a start and stop and
then the distance and then the speed

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:34.539
then the distance and then the speed
 

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:36.750
then the distance and then the speed
calculation so you had a million 4

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760
calculation so you had a million 4
 

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.430
calculation so you had a million 4
million records like it ended up for

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440
million records like it ended up for
 

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.500
million records like it ended up for
basically when I say false reading sort

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:40.510
basically when I say false reading sort
 

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.450
basically when I say false reading sort
of like a house of mirrors when you go

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.460
of like a house of mirrors when you go
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.799
of like a house of mirrors when you go
in and there's all these mirrors which

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:43.809
in and there's all these mirrors which
 

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:45.810
in and there's all these mirrors which
is the real person which is the real

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:45.820
is the real person which is the real
 

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.060
is the real person which is the real
number that that's how it ballooned up

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.070
number that that's how it ballooned up
 

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.620
number that that's how it ballooned up
to 4 million and and this is how it

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:52.630
to 4 million and and this is how it
 

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.600
to 4 million and and this is how it
looks like on the website this this

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:54.610
looks like on the website this this
 

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.820
looks like on the website this this
actually this is something we always do

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:56.830
actually this is something we always do
 

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.610
actually this is something we always do
these days this is a searchable database

00:17:59.610 --> 00:17:59.620
these days this is a searchable database
 

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.129
these days this is a searchable database
that the user can use it's really no

00:18:02.129 --> 00:18:02.139
that the user can use it's really no
 

00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:05.120
that the user can use it's really no
good for me for my analysis i'm using

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.130
good for me for my analysis i'm using

those that you know that in excel but

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:10.899
those that you know that in excel but
 

00:18:10.899 --> 00:18:12.090
those that you know that in excel but
this we always want to build something

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.100
this we always want to build something
 

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.010
this we always want to build something
that people can go to our website and

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.020
that people can go to our website and
 

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.070
that people can go to our website and
play with basically and so this is that

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080
play with basically and so this is that
 

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.600
play with basically and so this is that
where you could plug in a police station

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:21.610
where you could plug in a police station
 

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.870
where you could plug in a police station
agency or a county or even though you

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880
agency or a county or even though you
 

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.750
agency or a county or even though you
could type in a transponder number and

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760
could type in a transponder number and
 

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.220
could type in a transponder number and
the site got a lot of traffic and we

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.230
the site got a lot of traffic and we
 

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.169
the site got a lot of traffic and we
think it was probably cops looking at

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:31.179
think it was probably cops looking at
 

00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:33.030
think it was probably cops looking at
their fellow

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.040
their fellow
 

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.100
their fellow
because the transponder doesn't actually

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.110
because the transponder doesn't actually
 

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.440
because the transponder doesn't actually
identify the cup right no and and one

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.450
identify the cup right no and and one
 

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.790
identify the cup right no and and one
thing we wanted we initially thought

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:38.800
thing we wanted we initially thought
 

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.700
thing we wanted we initially thought
we'd get the names of all the cops that

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.710
we'd get the names of all the cops that
 

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.800
we'd get the names of all the cops that
proved too difficult really we got we

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:43.810
proved too difficult really we got we
 

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.470
proved too difficult really we got we
knew one speeder the guy that started

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480
knew one speeder the guy that started
 

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.990
knew one speeder the guy that started
the whole project we were able to

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000
the whole project we were able to
 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.710
the whole project we were able to
identify him pretty quickly but we when

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720
identify him pretty quickly but we when
 

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.360
identify him pretty quickly but we when
we went to the agencies and started

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:54.370
we went to the agencies and started
 

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.250
we went to the agencies and started
saying can you give us all the all the

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:56.260
saying can you give us all the all the
 

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.070
saying can you give us all the all the
names who's got that transponder we were

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080
names who's got that transponder we were
 

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.170
names who's got that transponder we were
running into too much difficulty and it

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.180
running into too much difficulty and it
 

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.550
running into too much difficulty and it
really in the end it really didn't

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:02.560
really in the end it really didn't
 

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.960
really in the end it really didn't
matter we really had the one guy and so

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:06.970
matter we really had the one guy and so
 

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.730
matter we really had the one guy and so
it wasn't worth spending more months

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:08.740
it wasn't worth spending more months
 

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.300
it wasn't worth spending more months

data or they were giving other reporters
 

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.200
data or they were giving other reporters
problems with it and and we live in a

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.210
problems with it and and we live in a
 

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.200
problems with it and and we live in a
state with great public access public

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.210
state with great public access public
 

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.480

records laws so you know I think that

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:57.490
records laws so you know I think that
 

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.180
records laws so you know I think that
would be an obstacle for for reporters

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:00.190
would be an obstacle for for reporters
 

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.710
would be an obstacle for for reporters
in other states you know might not be

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720
in other states you know might not be
 

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.350
in other states you know might not be
able to get the data at all but I think

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360
able to get the data at all but I think
 

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.060
able to get the data at all but I think
it's a wonderful idea anybody that can

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.070
it's a wonderful idea anybody that can
 

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.840
it's a wonderful idea anybody that can
I'm certain this problem is happening in

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:09.850
I'm certain this problem is happening in
 

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.510
I'm certain this problem is happening in
a lot of communities it's not just a

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520
a lot of communities it's not just a
 

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.700
a lot of communities it's not just a
uniquely South Florida problem so I

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:14.710
uniquely South Florida problem so I
 

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.980
uniquely South Florida problem so I
think any other kinds of stories would

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:16.990
think any other kinds of stories would
 

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.120

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:38.490
agency where the officer was working so
 

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.970
agency where the officer was working so
and they were you know pretty clear

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980
and they were you know pretty clear
 

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.159
and they were you know pretty clear
patterns it was somebody kind of going

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:43.169
patterns it was somebody kind of going
 

00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:46.159
patterns it was somebody kind of going
back and forth the same route day in day

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:46.169
back and forth the same route day in day
 

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.899
back and forth the same route day in day
out so it appeared it was people

00:23:47.899 --> 00:23:47.909
out so it appeared it was people
 

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:49.779
out so it appeared it was people
commuting going back and forth the work

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:49.789
commuting going back and forth the work
 

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:52.070
commuting going back and forth the work
they weren't in their city limits so

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080
they weren't in their city limits so
 

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.750
they weren't in their city limits so
they really didn't have a justifiable

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760
they really didn't have a justifiable
 

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.539
they really didn't have a justifiable
reason to be going those speeds there

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:56.549
reason to be going those speeds there
 

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:58.549
reason to be going those speeds there
were certain countywide agencies and the

00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559
were certain countywide agencies and the
 

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.230
were certain countywide agencies and the
Florida Highway Patrol where we couldn't

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240
Florida Highway Patrol where we couldn't
 

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.760
Florida Highway Patrol where we couldn't
tell because their jurisdictions are

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:01.770
tell because their jurisdictions are
 

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.730
tell because their jurisdictions are
much larger and we did we didn't say one

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740
much larger and we did we didn't say one
 

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.620
much larger and we did we didn't say one
way or the other if that was off-duty we

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:06.630
way or the other if that was off-duty we
 

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.960
way or the other if that was off-duty we
just said many of them appear or most of

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:08.970
just said many of them appear or most of
 

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.340
just said many of them appear or most of
them appear to be off duty because

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.350
them appear to be off duty because
 

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.380
them appear to be off duty because
they're outside their cities and then

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:12.390
they're outside their cities and then
 

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.600
they're outside their cities and then
when the internal affairs investigations

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:14.610
when the internal affairs investigations
 

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.350
when the internal affairs investigations
came back after we had had published it

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360
came back after we had had published it
 

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.080
came back after we had had published it
they did verify that that they were off

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.090
they did verify that that they were off
 

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:26.810
they did verify that that they were off
duty yes hi I was curious at what point

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820
duty yes hi I was curious at what point
 

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.310
duty yes hi I was curious at what point
in the reporting process you knew that

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320
in the reporting process you knew that
 

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.600
in the reporting process you knew that
this was a big story because it

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:29.610
this was a big story because it
 

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.850
this was a big story because it
obviously took a lot of time and effort

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860
obviously took a lot of time and effort
 

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.389
obviously took a lot of time and effort
to nail it down and second I was curious

00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399
to nail it down and second I was curious
 

00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:37.549
to nail it down and second I was curious
about your decision to go to Garmin were

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559
about your decision to go to Garmin were
 

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:38.930
about your decision to go to Garmin were
there any concerns and going to a

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940
there any concerns and going to a
 

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.490
there any concerns and going to a
private company with their scoop and

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500
private company with their scoop and
 

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.220
private company with their scoop and
what you're trying to find a second

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.230
what you're trying to find a second
 

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.260
what you're trying to find a second
question first the the reason we went to

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:45.270
question first the the reason we went to
 

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.649
question first the the reason we went to
Garmin was we had we actually tried

00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659
Garmin was we had we actually tried
 

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:51.889
Garmin was we had we actually tried
driving it just in measuring distances

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:51.899
driving it just in measuring distances
 

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:53.870
driving it just in measuring distances
with our odometers and that's what we

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880
with our odometers and that's what we
 

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.340
with our odometers and that's what we
were originally going to going to go

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:55.350
were originally going to going to go
 

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.830
were originally going to going to go
with and we went out in my car a couple

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840
with and we went out in my car a couple
 

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.480
with and we went out in my car a couple
of times and then we went out in John's

00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.490
of times and then we went out in John's
 

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.370
of times and then we went out in John's
car once and we happen to measure this

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380
car once and we happen to measure this
 

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.980
car once and we happen to measure this
name one we got a different answer and

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:03.990
name one we got a different answer and
 

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.720
name one we got a different answer and
then we realize the odometers just

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:05.730
then we realize the odometers just
 

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.150
then we realize the odometers just
aren't as precise as we need them to be

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.160
aren't as precise as we need them to be
 

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.220
aren't as precise as we need them to be
because we had certain toll booths that

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.230
because we had certain toll booths that
 

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.510
because we had certain toll booths that
were only you know a couple of miles

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520
were only you know a couple of miles
 

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.220
were only you know a couple of miles
apart or even less than that so if

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.230
apart or even less than that so if
 

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.930
apart or even less than that so if
you're off by a tenth of a mile that

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940
you're off by a tenth of a mile that
 

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.810
you're off by a tenth of a mile that
really affects the speed so then we went

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820
really affects the speed so then we went
 

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.580
really affects the speed so then we went
to an engineer and we said this is our

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:19.590
to an engineer and we said this is our
 

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.310
to an engineer and we said this is our
problem you know what would you do and

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320
problem you know what would you do and
 

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.010
problem you know what would you do and
they said well GPS is is the way to go

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020
they said well GPS is is the way to go
 

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.300
they said well GPS is is the way to go
you know that's going to get you the

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:26.310
you know that's going to get you the
 

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.520
you know that's going to get you the
kind of precision and accuracy that you

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:28.530
kind of precision and accuracy that you
 

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.280
kind of precision and accuracy that you
need so then it just became you know not

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:31.290
need so then it just became you know not
 

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.170
need so then it just became you know not
I didn't have any concerns about the

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:33.180
I didn't have any concerns about the
 

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.510
I didn't have any concerns about the
private company we just wanted to know

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520
private company we just wanted to know
 

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.940
private company we just wanted to know
what would be the best model to achieve

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.950
what would be the best model to achieve
 

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.220
what would be the best model to achieve
what we were trying to and I'm sorry

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:40.230
what we were trying to and I'm sorry
 

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.140
what we were trying to and I'm sorry
what was your first question well our

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.150
what was your first question well our
 

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.540
what was your first question well our
heart Eureka moment we had a few of

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:47.550
heart Eureka moment we had a few of
 

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.140
heart Eureka moment we had a few of
those probably you know we we started

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.150
those probably you know we we started
 

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.670
those probably you know we we started
calculating the speeds we didn't wait

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:52.680
calculating the speeds we didn't wait
 

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.560
calculating the speeds we didn't wait
until we had measured everything you

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:54.570
until we had measured everything you
 

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.240
until we had measured everything you
know we did it at we would come back

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.250
know we did it at we would come back
 

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.610
know we did it at we would come back
after a day of driving around and John

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620
after a day of driving around and John
 

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.410
after a day of driving around and John
would plug a few of those distances in

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:00.420
would plug a few of those distances in
 

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.960
would plug a few of those distances in
and we started with the ones that the

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:02.970
and we started with the ones that the
 

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.580
and we started with the ones that the
routes that were the most traveled so

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:04.590
routes that were the most traveled so
 

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.920
routes that were the most traveled so
we'd get you know the biggest volume the

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:06.930
we'd get you know the biggest volume the
 

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.020
we'd get you know the biggest volume the
biggest bang for our buck and we started

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:09.030
biggest bang for our buck and we started
 

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.180
biggest bang for our buck and we started
plugging the distances in and you know

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:11.190
plugging the distances in and you know
 

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.850
plugging the distances in and you know
we started seeing speeds a lot of speeds

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860
we started seeing speeds a lot of speeds
 

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.820
we started seeing speeds a lot of speeds
like this over we made a decision later

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:16.830
like this over we made a decision later
 

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.010
like this over we made a decision later
on using 90 as a cut-off but we were

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020
on using 90 as a cut-off but we were
 

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.560
on using 90 as a cut-off but we were
seeing you know many many more in the

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:21.570
seeing you know many many more in the
 

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.990
seeing you know many many more in the
high 80s but then we were seeing 90s and

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000
high 80s but then we were seeing 90s and
 

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.630
high 80s but then we were seeing 90s and
100 and we thought yeah we're you know

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640
100 and we thought yeah we're you know
 

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.880
100 and we thought yeah we're you know
we're definitely on to something here

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:27.890
we're definitely on to something here
 

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.870
we're definitely on to something here
this would have to be our last question

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880
this would have to be our last question
 

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.930
this would have to be our last question
yes hi my name is Thomas I have a

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940
yes hi my name is Thomas I have a
 

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.740
yes hi my name is Thomas I have a
two-part question they're both based on

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:36.750
two-part question they're both based on
 

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.840
two-part question they're both based on
data one is when you were calculating

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:38.850
data one is when you were calculating
 

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.720
data one is when you were calculating
the speeds from sort of one toll plaza

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:41.730
the speeds from sort of one toll plaza
 

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.200
the speeds from sort of one toll plaza
to another did you take into account the

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.210
to another did you take into account the
 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.340
to another did you take into account the
deceleration and acceleration that would

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:46.350
deceleration and acceleration that would
 

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.770
deceleration and acceleration that would
have to happen and because that would

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:48.780
have to happen and because that would
 

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.260
have to happen and because that would
actually bring the whole speed down and

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:51.270
actually bring the whole speed down and
 

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.770
actually bring the whole speed down and
also for the Miami Police Department

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:54.780
also for the Miami Police Department
 

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.510
also for the Miami Police Department
whenever they were mentioned it always

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520
whenever they were mentioned it always
 

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.180
whenever they were mentioned it always
was mentioned that it was always outside

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.190
was mentioned that it was always outside
 

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.670
was mentioned that it was always outside
of sort of miami city boundaries whereas

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:01.680
of sort of miami city boundaries whereas
 

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.960
of sort of miami city boundaries whereas
for other departments it was often

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:02.970
for other departments it was often
 

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.210
for other departments it was often
outside so what was the distinction

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220
outside so what was the distinction
 

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.160
outside so what was the distinction
there why would the Miami cops always
