00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.350
So this last bit of code with the legend, we've put our circles in.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.260
Now we want to append text.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.510
For the text SVG instead of cy it's simple y, there's no center to the text.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.730
Instead of cx, it's simply x,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.570
since we only need to specify the y and the x of where we want to draw the text.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.280
In here, while it may seem somewhat arbitrary we've actually drawn the text

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.080
at the same position i times 30 as each of the circles, but

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.920
this is actually going to draw the text.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.200
Slightly higher, since it's going to draw the bottom of the text

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.050
at position i 30, and we actually want the center of

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.560
our text to be in line with the center of our circle.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.350
So in our case, the default text is 10 pixels tall, so half of 10 is five,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.760
and this will position it perfectly.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.310
In line with the circle, and for the radius what might seem arbitrary of five,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.879
we simply drawn it five radii over from the circle itself, and

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.760
again, for these values, they might seem hardcoded here.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.710
We can simply experiment and change them up or

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.560
down to achieve a different effect and once we visually are happy we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.540
can set them in our code or abstract them into variables higher up.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.060
The last bit here simply changes the text attribute of the text SVG element.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
And since we've bound strings as data.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.820
D, in this case, is simply a string, either home team or others, and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.970
we can just return the datum itself without any further transformation.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.110
Saving our file, let's go back to the browser.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.030
And voila, we now have proper labels, home team and others, so that our

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.010
readers know which the red circles represent, what the blue circles represent.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.390
It can draw their own conclusions given the information we've presented them.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.810
Well we may have seen red circles early on being much higher attended.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.130
Every reader might interpret this chart and find something different and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.196
new depending on where they're coming from.

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:10.820
What their pre-existing biases are, and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.770
what relation they might have to the data.
