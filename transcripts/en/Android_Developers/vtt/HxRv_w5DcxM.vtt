DAVE SMITH: The
Internet of Things

00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:03.720
promises big opportunities
for developers

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.224
to contribute to the huge growth
of devices hitting the market.

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:08.640
But have you ever
stopped to think

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.620
about what it really
takes to build

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.750
a connected product at scale?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.610
My name is Dave
Smith, and today, I'm

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.470
going to show you how
Android Things can

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.100
help you build smart,
connected devices for IoT.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.530
Android Things is an
extension of Android designed

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.090
to enable developers
to build high quality,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.900
secure devices, and
maintain them at scale.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.690
The platform is made up
of three core elements--

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.270
a variant of Android that
has been optimized for use

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.380
in IoT, secure and managed
updates direct from Google,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.810
and powerful hardware
that's accessible and easy

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.010
to integrate.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.584
Let's begin with the software
running on the device.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:45.000
With Android Things,
you can build

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
apps using the rich framework
provided by the Android SDK

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.940
and Google Play services,
including the same UI

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.540
toolkit, multimedia support,
and connectivity APIs used

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.520
by mobile developers today.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.370
Your apps can easily integrate
with popular Google services,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.940
like Firebase, TensorFlow,
and the Google Cloud Platform

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.210
using the many existing
Android client libraries.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.060
And of course, you can develop
using all the same languages

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.300
and tools supported for
Android development today.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.060
To improve the Android
experience for embedded use,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.270
we've tuned the platform for
faster boot times and lower

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.340
memory footprint,
including a smaller

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
variant of Google Play services
optimized specifically for IoT.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.330
We've also added new APIs
through the Android Things

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.490
support library to
better integrate

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.590
your apps with custom hardware.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
This includes expanded support
for peripheral interfaces

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.630
and device management.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
Android things does not
include user-facing apps,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.670
like a launcher or browser.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.190
Instead, it is designed
to boot directly

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.380
into the apps you've
built for your device.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.770
Google takes care of
providing updates and security

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.150
patches to the core
operating system

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.580
so you can focus on your app.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.630
This means you get to take
advantage of our ongoing work

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.130
on Android to keep your devices
secure and protect your users.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.050
System images are
signed by Google

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.660
and verified for
integrity on device.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.000
This prevents a corrupt
or tampered update

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.650
from being applied.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.050
Android's seamless
A/B updates apply

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.240
the image in the background
without interrupting

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.650
the application.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.650
Failure to boot
following an update

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.730
will roll back to
the previous version,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870
ensuring the system always
boots into a known good state.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.580
Updates are delivered
over the air

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.650
from the Android
Things console using

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.080
the same secure
infrastructure we use

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.390
to update mobile devices today.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.700
We can even push
updates automatically

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.060
when security patches are
available for the platform.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.420
Apps on the device are managed
exclusively through the console

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.400
and bundled with each update.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.290
This means that
Android Things does not

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
include the Google Play Store
because user-installed apps are

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.600
not supported.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.030
Building production
devices with Android Things

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.260
is a turnkey process thanks to
the system on module, or SoM,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.670
architecture.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.400
Each module is a fully
integrated component

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.397
that you can drop directly
into your final design

00:03:05.397 --> 00:03:07.230
the same way you would
integrate a framework

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.750
or library into your app.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.260
Modules are manufactured in
high volume by the chip vendors,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.900
enabling you to purchase
them at low cost

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.950
whether you need to
buy 1, 10, or 10,000.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.040
Android Things hardware
is pre-certified by Google

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.960
with a board support
package provided

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.700
by our vendor partners.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.180
These partnerships enable us
to deliver long-term support

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.230
for each stable release across
our entire hardware lineup.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.090
The hardware is
also pre-certified

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.030
with regulatory
agencies, like the FCC,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.400
simplifying the certification
testing required

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.430
to take your product to
market and further saving you

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.270
time and money.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.770
Android Things is so
much more than just

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.650
a cool new form factor
for building your apps.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.710
Secure system updates
and accessible hardware

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.640
make it a reliable platform
for connected devices at scale.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.930

how to get started,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.190
Also, join our community
so you can ask questions,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.820
share your projects, and stay
up-to-date with the latest

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.530
platform announcements.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.970
Thanks so much for
watching today,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.345
and I look forward
to seeing what

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:17.149
you build with Android Things.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.190
I'm Dave Smith, and
I'll see you next time.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.540
