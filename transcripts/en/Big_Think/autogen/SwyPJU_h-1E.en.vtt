was teaching this with biofeedback and
what we found was that some women who

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160
what we found was that some women who
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.090

urinary stress incontinence have weak
muscles and these women with the strong

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
muscles and these women with the strong
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700

from my urethra the tube you urinate

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900
from my urethra the tube you urinate
 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.520
from my urethra the tube you urinate
through during sexual stimulation and it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530
through during sexual stimulation and it
 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.499
through during sexual stimulation and it
seems to be an area of my in my vagina

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509
seems to be an area of my in my vagina
 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.080
seems to be an area of my in my vagina
that when it's stimulated it kind of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090
that when it's stimulated it kind of
 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.450
that when it's stimulated it kind of
produces this expulsion of fluid and so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460
produces this expulsion of fluid and so
 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.260
produces this expulsion of fluid and so
we looked at these women we identified

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270
we looked at these women we identified
 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.880
we looked at these women we identified
that this is what Griffin berg had or

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890
that this is what Griffin berg had or
 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.969
that this is what Griffin berg had or
others had called female ejaculation we

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979
others had called female ejaculation we
 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.889
others had called female ejaculation we
analyzed the fluid and found it was

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899
analyzed the fluid and found it was
 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.469
analyzed the fluid and found it was
statistically significantly different

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479
statistically significantly different
 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.609
statistically significantly different
from urine and it's about 3 to 5 cc's it

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619
from urine and it's about 3 to 5 cc's it
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.249
from urine and it's about 3 to 5 cc's it
looks like watered-down fat-free milk so

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259
looks like watered-down fat-free milk so
 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.260
looks like watered-down fat-free milk so
we identified the phenomenon of female

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270
we identified the phenomenon of female
 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.060
we identified the phenomenon of female
ejaculation and how the fluid that's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070
ejaculation and how the fluid that's
 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.580
ejaculation and how the fluid that's
expelled from the urethra is different

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
expelled from the urethra is different
 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.859
expelled from the urethra is different
from urine we then had nurse

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869
from urine we then had nurse
 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.740
from urine we then had nurse

examinations of 400 women looking for
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.480
examinations of 400 women looking for
areas of sensitivity in the vagina and

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490
areas of sensitivity in the vagina and
 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.520
areas of sensitivity in the vagina and
if a woman was lying on her back and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
if a woman was lying on her back and
 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.830
if a woman was lying on her back and
fingers were put into the vagina with I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
fingers were put into the vagina with I
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.259
fingers were put into the vagina with I
could come here motion just look at

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269
could come here motion just look at
 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.210
could come here motion just look at
different areas of the vagina like a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220
different areas of the vagina like a
 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.670
different areas of the vagina like a
clock and most women had sensitivity

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
clock and most women had sensitivity
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.860
clock and most women had sensitivity
between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock which is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock which is
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930
between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock which is
the area that we have named the Griffin

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
the area that we have named the Griffin
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.420
the area that we have named the Griffin
burg spot and this area began to swell

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
burg spot and this area began to swell
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.030
burg spot and this area began to swell
as it was

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
as it was
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.149
as it was
stimulated so we did more research and

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159
stimulated so we did more research and
 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.399
stimulated so we did more research and
this is what we found this is why we

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409
this is what we found this is why we
 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.679
this is what we found this is why we
named this after dr. Griffin burger

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689
named this after dr. Griffin burger
 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.990
named this after dr. Griffin burger

laboratory and we tested their responses

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630
laboratory and we tested their responses
 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.409
laboratory and we tested their responses
from imagery alone and from genital self

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419
from imagery alone and from genital self
 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.750

stimulation and we did that in a counter

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760
stimulation and we did that in a counter
 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.400
stimulation and we did that in a counter
balanced way so that one would not

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410
balanced way so that one would not
 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.010

influence the other and their orgasmic

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
influence the other and their orgasmic
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.290
influence the other and their orgasmic
responses were exactly the same in terms

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
responses were exactly the same in terms
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.200
responses were exactly the same in terms
of increases in blood pressure increases

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210
of increases in blood pressure increases
 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.510

in heart rate increases in the diameter

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520
in heart rate increases in the diameter
 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.000

of the pupil and their pain and tactile

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010
of the pupil and their pain and tactile
 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.890

thresholds there was no significant

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900
thresholds there was no significant
 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.260
thresholds there was no significant
difference and so we documented that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270
difference and so we documented that
 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.140
difference and so we documented that
women do indeed have orgasm from imagery

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150
women do indeed have orgasm from imagery
 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
women do indeed have orgasm from imagery
or thinking and then we have studied

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160
or thinking and then we have studied
 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.000
or thinking and then we have studied
some of these same women in the fMRI

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010
some of these same women in the fMRI
 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.740
some of these same women in the fMRI
unit to look at the areas of the brain

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750
unit to look at the areas of the brain
 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.320
unit to look at the areas of the brain
that are activated during the orgasm so

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330
that are activated during the orgasm so
 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.050
that are activated during the orgasm so
yes women can certainly have pleasurable

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
yes women can certainly have pleasurable
 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.020
yes women can certainly have pleasurable
sexual responses without hurt the one or

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030
sexual responses without hurt the one or
 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.650
