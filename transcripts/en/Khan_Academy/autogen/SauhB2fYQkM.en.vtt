00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
 From the previous video we know that at high concentration 

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.480
 From the previous video we know that at high concentration 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.040
 of calcium ions in the muscle cell, they 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.500
 bind to the protein troponin, which 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.140
 alters its shape in such a way that tropomyosin 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.580
 is offset, with myosin heads 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.310
 can move on the actin threads 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950
 and so the muscles are shortened. 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.140
 At high concentration of calcium ions 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.850
 we have a shortening. 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.560
 At low concentration of calcium ions the proteins 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.060
 troponin take their standard form, 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.600
 tropomyosin stands in the path of myosin 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.165
 heads and so the muscle relaxes. 

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:53.750
 High concentration of calcium - shortening. Low concentration - relaxation. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.140
 The next question we have to ask is: 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.850
 How muscle regulates high and low concentration 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.350
 and, accordingly, shortening and disbursement? 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 In fact, the better question is: 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.830
 How does the nervous system achieve it? 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
 How the nervous system tells the muscle to increase 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.550
 its concentration of calcium and shorten 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.010
 or reduce concentration and relax? 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.900
 To answer this question, we will be negotiating 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.790
 the lessons learned from neural clips. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.000
 I will draw one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 axonal terminal. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.540
 Instead of a dendritic synapse of another neuron, 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.890
 we will have a synapse with 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 muscle cell. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.145
 This is the synapse with the muscle cell. 

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:44.420
 You will soon see what this is. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.170
 This is a muscle cell synapse. 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 I will put names to keep you confused. 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.470
 This is Axon. 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 We will call it an axonal terminal. 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.610
 We will call it an axonal terminal. 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 This is the synapse. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.440
 I came out of the screen. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.150
 This is the terminology of the neural clips. 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.210
 It's a synaptic space. 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.650
 It is a presynaptic neuron. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.430
 This is postsynaptic 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.830
 cell. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.050
 In this case, it is not a neuron. 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.090
 This is it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.240
 membrane of a muscle cell. 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.540
 Perhaps in the next or next video 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.530
 I will show you the anatomy of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.610
 muscle cell. 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.230
 This video will be a little abstract, 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.300
 because we want to understand how to regulate it 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.810
 concentration of calcium ions. 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.060
 This is called a sarcophagus. 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:53.580
 This is called a sarcophagus. 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.120
 This is the membrane of the muscle cell. 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.070
 As you can see, this is a fold here 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.980
 in the membrane of the muscle cell. 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.000
 If we look at the surface of the muscle cell 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.850
 on top, it is covered with holes or 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.040
 dents, but here we have a cross section. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000
 As you can see, this is the fold. It's like 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.590
 the membrane is pierced 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.240
 with needle. 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.100
 A fold is formed in the membrane. 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.460
 This is called the T-tubula. 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.360
 We will negotiate the terminology. 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.100
 T is transverse. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.720
 It is located across the membrane. 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.060
 There is something very important here 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 for this video - 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.520
 the most important organel. 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.410
 In the muscle cell there is an organelle, 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.890
 called sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:54.740
 called sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.700
 It looks very much like the endoplasm 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.180
 reticulum. Somewhat 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.750
 is associated with it. Its main function, however 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.760
 is to store. 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.400
 The endoplasmic reticulum 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.470
 is involved in the development of proteins and has ribosomes attached, 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.860
 but this organel performs only storage. 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.500
 The sarcoplasmic reticulum has calcium 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:32.920
 pumps on their membrane that they are 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.530
 ATP-dependent - needing ATP molecules to function. 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.450
 ATP molecules are introduced. They attach to the organelle, 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:52.620
 as well as some calcium ions. When the ATP molecules are 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:01.470
 hydrolyzed in ADP molecules and a phosphate group, this protein 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.140
 will change its shape and calcium 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.700
 ions will be introduced. 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.230
 Calcium ions are introduced. 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.610
 The ultimate effect of all these calcium pumps 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.540
 on the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is that 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.700
 with a relaxed muscle in this organelle we have a high concentration 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.950
 of calcium ions. 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.630
 of calcium ions. 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.570
 You must think 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.980
 what next. 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.010
 When the muscle has to be shortened, the calcium ions 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.320
 are exported to the cell cytoplasm. 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.610
 Then they will contact the troponian here 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.120
 and it will happen what we talked about in the previous video. 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.180
 What we want to know is how the organelle knows 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.760
 when to bring the calcium ions into the cage. 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.140
 This is the inside of the cage. 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.370
 This is the inside of the cage. 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.360
 Actin threads, myosin heads, 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.350
 tropon and tropomyosin 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.230
 are exposed to this environment 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.320
 here. 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.280
 I can draw it, 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.530
 to make it clearer. 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.480
 This is the actin thread. 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.690
 My drawing is abstract. 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.480
 In the next video, we'll learn more about the structure. 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:38.650
 It is a myosin head, here is a wrapped tropomyosin that is attached to protein troponin. 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.870
 The drawing is abstract, but I think, 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.650
 that gives you a general idea. 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.510
 Let's say this motor neuron 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:54.380
 sends a signal for muscle contraction. 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.610
 First, we know how signals are moving in neurons, 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.100
 especially via axons with action potential. 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.460
 Here we may have a sodium channel. 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.410
 He is voltage-dependent, so here we have a little 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.500
 positive voltage. 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.420
 He tells the voltage-dependent sodium channel to open. 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.160
 This allows it to enter more sodium. 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.340
 Here the environment becomes more positive. 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.880
 This triggers the next voltage-dependent channel to open 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.010
 and so the signal travels to the axon membrane. 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.410
 Finally, when the positive voltage reaches the minimum, 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.590
 voltage-dependent calcium channels are opened. 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.060
 voltage-dependent calcium channels are opened. 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.680
 This is a review of what has been learned by 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.740
 videos about neurons. 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.760
 Finally, when the middle of the calcium channels 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.290
 become positive enough, through them are imported 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.300
 calcium ions. 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.060
 Once the calcium ions are introduced, they connect with 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.950
 special proteins up to the synaptic membrane or 

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.850
 presynaptic membrane. 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.010
 These are the calcium ions. 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.990
 They bind to proteins that are anchored vesicles. 

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:08.170
 Do not forget that the vesicles are just the membranes 

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.420
 around neurotransmitters. 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.250
 They contain neurotransmitters. 

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.500
 When calcium is bound to these proteins, 

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.840
 allows for exocytosis. 

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.850
 Allows the vesicle membrane to merge 

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.190
 with that of the neuron itself 

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.600
 and the content is released. 

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.670
 This is a review of videos about neurons. 

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.470
 There I explained everything in much more detail. 

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.490
 All neurotransmitters 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.500
 are released. 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.809
 We talked about the synapse between neuron and 

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.450
 muscle cell. 

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.059
 The neurotransmitter here is acetylcholine. 

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:47.130
 The neurotransmitter here is acetylcholine. 

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.320
 As with dendrites, 

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.990
 acetylcholine binds to sarcoma receptors 

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.410
 or the membrane of the muscle cell and opens it 

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.820
 the sodium channel of the muscle cell. 

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.330
 its membrane also has 

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.210
 a voltage gradient like a neuron. 

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.150
 When this pump receives acetylcholine, 

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:16.240
 this allows sodium to enter the muscle cell. 

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.580
 Here we have a plus and this gives rise 

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.990
 action potential in the muscle cell. 

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.510
 Then we have a little positive charge. 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.680
 If it gets high enough to the minimum threshold, it will 

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.100
 triggers this voltage-dependent channel that will 

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.380
 allow the entry of sodium. 

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.080
 Here the charge will be a little positive. 

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.035
 Of course, there is also potassium to reverse the effect. 

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.870
 Just like with neurons. 

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.970
 Here we have sodium 

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.170
 channel. 

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.780
 The channel is slightly positive. 

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.710
 When it becomes positive enough, it will open 

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.750
 and will allow more sodium to enter. 

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.250
 We have an action potential. 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.230
 This is the sodium channel. 

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.950
 The action potential enters the T-tubule. 

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.230
 The action potential is turning 

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.930
 in a chemical signal, 

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.370
 triggering another action potential, 

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.880
 which enters the T-tubula. 

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.560
 Here is the interesting part. We are entering an area, 

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.670
 which is still being investigated. You will 

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.860
 give directions if you want to read more about it. 

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.940
 We have a protein complex that connects 

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.010
 the sarcoplasmic reticulum with the T-tubule. 

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:28.600
 I'll draw it like a big box. 

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.180
 Here's the protein complex. 

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.970
 People think it in it 

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.270
 proteins are included 

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:44.170
 triodine, junctin, 

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:51.180
 calsecvestin and rianodine. 

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.290
 calsecvestin and rianodine. 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.550
 These proteins interact with the protein complex, 

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.550
 binding the T-tubule to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.720
 The big question is: What happens when the action 

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.880
 potential come to here? Here's the charge 

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:16.280
 positive enough and the protein complex 

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.610
 triggers the release of calcium. 

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.920
 Rianodine is supposed to be 

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.930
 actually releases calcium. Perhaps 

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.790
 is triggered here. 

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.330
 I will change 

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.010
 color. 

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.100
 I use too much purple. 

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.980
 I will use red. 

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.070
 The environment becomes a little bit 

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.260
 more positive because of 

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.920
 imported sodium ions. You can search 

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.100
 in the net these proteins. 

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.030
 Scientists are still trying to understand 

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.570
 how this mysterious box works. It triggers 

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.290
 opening a channel through which calcium ions come out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:03.870
 Then these calcium ions are released from 

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.610
 the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the interior 

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.230
 of the cell - in its cytoplasm. 

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.550
 What happens then? 

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.670
 As we said at the beginning of this video, 

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.390
 calcium ions are connected 

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.750
 with a troponin, 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.390
 displace tropomyosin 

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.520
 and using ATP molecules, myosin 

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.050
 can be moved by the actin. 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:35.030
 At the same time, once the signal disappears, 

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.290
 this channel closes and calcium pumps 

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.180
 will lower the concentration of calcium. 

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.070
 Concentration will also decrease muscle 

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.090
 will relax again. 

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.070
 The whole thing is that we have this container 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.440
 of calcium ions, which takes the ions 

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.330
 from the inside of the cage when 

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.830
 the muscle is relaxed so that the myosin can not move 

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.330
 by acta. 

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.190
 But when it receives a signal, it releases 

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.040
 the ions back and the muscle is abridged, 

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.280
 because tropomyosin is shifting away from the troponin. 

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.430
 It is 

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.090
 very interesting. 

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.160
 The more interesting is that all this 

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.200
 is not yet fully understood. 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.140
 If you want to deal with biology, 

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.360
 this is an interesting topic for 

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.330
 research. 

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.740
 It is not only interesting from a scientific point of view, 

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.900
 to understand how it works, 

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.630
 but as a result of malfunction 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.210
 of the proteins can be a potential disease. 

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.050
 You might try to get this complex to 

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.770
 works better or worse. 

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.960
 You can find its positive impact, 

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.750
 if you find out what is happening when 

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.440
 the action potential opens 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.490
 the calcium channel. 

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.770
 You have already acquired a general idea. 

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.770
 You already know how a motor neuron can stimulate 

00:13:53.770 --> 00:14:00.240
 shortening a muscle cell by allowing the sarcoplasmic reticulum 

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.490
 to allow calcium ions to pass through the cell 

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.590
 membrane in the cytoplasm. 

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.240
 Before this video, I read a little about this. 

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.740
 Pumps are very efficient. 

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.980
 After the signal disappears, this door closes, 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.900
 and the sarcoplasmic reticulum can recover 

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.070
 ion concentration for 30 milliseconds. 

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.100
 That is why we regulate the redundancies so well. That's why 

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.820
 I can stretch and fold my hand immediately 

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.870
 for parts of a second - because 

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.520
 we can stop an acronym for 30 milliseconds, which is less 

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.670
 of 1/30 second. 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.500
 We'll study the next video 

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.030
 the anatomy of the muscle cell itself 

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.840
 in some detail. 

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:41.947
 in some detail.
