00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here with Isabelle Stanton, who is a PhD student at Berkeley,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and she works on theory of computation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So what are you working on?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Lately I've been working in computational economics,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is this exciting thing that really Berkeley focuses on,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so looking at problems that economists face

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and see whether or not we can develop algorithms and ways to solve this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So particularly the thing that I've been working on has been computational social choice.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Social choice functions are ones that aggregate people's preferences.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So think about this as a voting mechanism.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Everybody gets to say, "I prefer Candidate A to Candidate B to Candidate C,"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then we take everyone's votes and we output some kind of winner.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And you'd really like this winner to be the one most people prefer or something.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The problem that I've been specifically looking at is that back in the 1970s

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Gibbard and Satterthwaite showed that for any kind of reasonable voting mechanism

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it's going to be susceptible to manipulation.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So is this like when someone doesn't vote for their preferred candidate

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because they think it's going to be better for them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
if they vote for sort of the more popular, less preferred candidate? &gt;&gt;Exactly.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So if you knew that your favorite person was the underdog

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and there was no way, you might change your vote

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so that way your second favorite person would be the one that's elected.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We've been specifically looking at Binary Cup voting protocols,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which are familiar to people as single elimination tournaments.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So how could someone manipulate a tournament like this?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The tournament organizer is allowed to pick the seeding of the players,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and that's the bracket, that's in each round who plays against who.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
For example, I can show you over here on the computer.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here on this slide we have actually the Women's World Cup.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The seeding is this picking of Germany versus Japan, Sweden versus Australia.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If I wanted something else to happen,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
maybe I could have picked a different initial seeding here,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
like maybe I have Sweden play England,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and that would end up with a different result out of the tournament.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's go over a simple example.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Everyone is familiar with the game rock, paper, scissors.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And in computer science we like things to be a power of 2,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
so let's add in hand grenade so that way we have 4 players.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we've got rock, paper, scissors, hand grenade.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now we can look at 2 different tournament brackets that have different winners.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So if we have rock, hand grenade, paper, scissors,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
first rock wins this match-up and then scissors wins here

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then rock wins the total bracket.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If, on the other hand, we have rock face paper and scissors face hand grenade,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
then paper knocks out rock, hand grenade still wins,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and hand grenade is the final winner.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So the tournament manipulation problem is to figure out if there's a bracket

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
so that your favorite player wins, like this,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
given information about the match outcomes.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm not sure if this explains how the US lost the Women's World Cup,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but we'll leave that as an open problem.
