Traditionally modern art has been organized, separated and discussed in great length by

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.320
time period and movement. We wouldn't be doing
that. These videos will instead look at art

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:34.260
by theme. Places &amp; Spaces. Art &amp; Identity.
Transforming Everyday Objects. And Art &amp; Society.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.269
These themes in an attempt to bridge the gap
between modern art &amp; you. I think that modern

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.150
art can meet you where you are and allows
you to work with what you already know. It

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.159
says, interestingly, as much about you or
me as it does about the artist himself. There's

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.180
going to be pictures, there's going to be
these people, there's love, there's death,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.070
there's this guy, there's this thing, there's
a chainsaw. This is why this museum, this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.440
is why this subject is so rich because there's
such diversity in it. If you find a foothold

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.900
and get started, you're never going to finish.
It's going to be another way to look at modern

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.990
art. Suddenly, it opens up a greater dialogue
about connections not only between works of

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.009
art but to things we already know. It just
gives you another entry point to really engage

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.860
with the art that you're seeing.
