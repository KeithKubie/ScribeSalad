00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.070
is multiply the numbers 352

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:05.741
and 481.

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.528
And we're gonna do it
in two different ways,

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.593
but realize that the
underlying ideas are the same.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.961
So first let's just appreciate that 352

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.633
can be rewritten as

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.300
300 plus 50 plus two

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:24.204
or we could think of it as

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:25.121
two plus 50

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:27.916
plus 300,

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:30.935
plus 300.

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:33.980
You add these three numbers together,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.534
you're going to have 352.

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:38.206
And same idea,

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:40.289
481 that's four hundreds,

00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:43.761
four hundreds, plus eight tens,

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.444
which is 80,

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:49.299
so plus 80,

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.878
and then we have one one,

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.433
so plus one.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.220
And you might have be
familiar with multiplying

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.449
like this in the past,
setting up this grid.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330
And it's essentially we're applying

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.351
the distributive property.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:01.930
We're gonna take the two
and multiply it times 400

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.254
plus 80 plus one.

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:05.530
So we're gonna multiply two
times each of those numbers,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.804
and actually I'm gonna just
draw some quick lines here.

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.336
So we have that,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.008
and then we'll have

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:13.099
let me do it like this,

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:14.599
then we have this,

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:18.631
and then let me set up my grid.

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.130
I'm having trouble drawing straight lines,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.709
okay there we go.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.705
Then one more in this direction.

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:28.819
There you go.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.236
And then in this direction,

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.163
let me draw some horizontal lines

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.181
to have a neat clean grid here.

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:36.551
There we go.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:38.989
Now first we'll multiply two times 400

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.056
plus 80 plus one.

00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.056
So two times 400 is 800.

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.906
Two times, let me do it
in that same blue color,

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:49.903
so this is 800.

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:52.295
Two times 80 is 160,

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:54.795
and then two times one is two.

00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:58.726
And then we can multiply 50 times these.

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.211
So what's 50 times 400?

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:03.463
Well five times four is 20,

00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:06.064
and then we have another
one, two, three zeros.

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:08.874
So one, two, three, so that's 20,000.

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:12.519
50 times 80, five times eight is 40,

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.795
and then we have two zeros,

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:16.420
just like that.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.696
And then we have 50 times
one which is of course

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:20.693
going to be equal to 50.

00:02:20.693 --> 00:02:22.179
And then we go to the 300,

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.641
which we will distribute and multiply

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.849
times each of these,

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.567
each of these numbers.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.191
300 times 400, three times four is 12,

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.584
and then we have four zeros.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.929
One, two, three, four.

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.508
We get 120,000.

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.364
300 times 80, three times eight is 24,

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:39.942
and then we have one, two, three zeros.

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:42.612
One, two, three, so we get 24,000.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:46.467
And then 300 times one is
of course equal to 300.

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.742
And then what we wanna do is add up

00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:49.973
all of these numbers.

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.388
So let's actually add up the rows first.

00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:54.756
So if we add up the rows,

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:58.866
let me draw another line
going straight down like that.

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.677
And so if we sum this up,

00:03:00.677 --> 00:03:02.860
this is going to be 962.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.739
800 plus 160 is 960 plus two,

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:06.989
so this is 962.

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.846
This right over here is 24,050.

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:12.679
24,050.

00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:18.812
And then this right over
here is what 100 and,

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:19.645
144,300?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.873
144,300.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.860
120,000 plus 24,000 is 144,000

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:31.049
plus 300, there you have it.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.648
And then you would add up
these numbers just like that

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.970
to get your final answer.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.804
Now I'm gonna hold off
doing that for a second

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:41.428
as we see the other way of
multiplying these numbers.

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:43.054
So the other way of doing it,

00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:44.656
we could've said,

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.406
481, and this is sometimes called

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.182
the standard algorithm,

00:03:50.182 --> 00:03:51.015
481 times

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:56.855
300 and 50, let me do the same colors,

00:03:59.006 --> 00:03:59.839
352.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.809
And in the standard algorithm,

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:09.803
the way that we do it is
we start with this two

00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:12.868
in the ones place and then
we multiply it times 481.

00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:14.772
So two times one is two,

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:16.605
two times eight is 16.

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.670
So we put the six here
and then we sometimes

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.690
we will say we carry the one,

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.244
but really regrouping that as hundreds.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:27.032
That's 10 tens which is hundreds.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.633
And then two times four is eight,

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.816
which is really 800, plus one,

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:34.323
so that's nine or really 900.

00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:35.809
You see a pattern here.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:39.873
This 962 is the exact
same thing as that 962

00:04:39.873 --> 00:04:40.871
right over there.

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.893
Why?

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:44.656
Well because we multiplied
the 200 times the one,

00:04:44.656 --> 00:04:47.628
times the 80, times the 400.

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:48.697
We saw that over here,

00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:50.368
and then we just added 'em
all together to be 962.

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:53.921
That's all the standard
algorithm did just now.

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.941
And then we move over to the five.

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.542
But this is really five tens or 50,

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.190
and that's why in the standard algorithm

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.700
we put a zero here

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.788
before saying all right
what's five times one?

00:05:04.788 --> 00:05:06.251
It's five.

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.039
What's five times eight?

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.872
It is 40.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.870
We regroup the four.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.449
Let's delete this from before.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.981
What's five times four?

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.564
Well that's 20 plus four is 24.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.434
Notice 24,050, that's exactly
what we had over here,

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:25.941
and it makes sense
because we're taking a 50

00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:28.588
and we're multiplying it times 481

00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:31.421
which is exactly what
we did right over there.

00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:33.047
And so you might guess what's gonna happen

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:34.742
when we take this three

00:05:34.742 --> 00:05:37.064
and we multiply it times 481.

00:05:37.064 --> 00:05:40.036
That's really a 300 times 481.

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.917
Let me delete that so
I don't get confused.

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.123
So because it's a 300,

00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:45.655
in the standard algorithm,

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:48.047
we put two zeros here first.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.393
And when I say algorithm it just means

00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:51.576
a method of doing something.

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:55.802
And so we'll say three times one is three.

00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:57.802
Three times eight is 24.

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:02.854
And then three times four
is 12 plus two is 14.

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:04.997
And so notice,

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.247
I have 144,300.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.291
And the standard way of
doing it at this point

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:11.429
we just add 'em all up.

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:12.706
So whether we're doing it here or here,

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.239
we just add everything up.

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:16.259
So two plus zero plus zero is two.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.674
Six plus five is 11.

00:06:18.674 --> 00:06:20.415
Regroup that one.

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:23.016
So one plus nine plus three is 13.

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.663
And then one plus four plus four is nine.

00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:27.288
Two plus four is six.

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.123
Then we have a one right over there,

00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:30.623
so we get 169,312.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.858
And so when you just learn this method,

00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:37.528
the standard algorithm we
some people might call it,

00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:39.293
it might seem like hey
this just seems like

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:40.268
a little bit of magic.

00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:42.521
But all you're doing is you're
going to each of these places

00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:44.146
and you're distributing it,

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:47.025
you're multiplying it
times 400 plus 80 plus one

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:48.047
to get this.

00:06:48.047 --> 00:06:51.507
Then you're multiplying 50
times 400 plus 80 plus one,

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:53.690
and then 300 times 400 plus 80 plus one,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.690
exactly what we did right over here.
