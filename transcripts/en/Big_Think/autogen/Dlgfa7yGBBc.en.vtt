come preassembled you have to learn how
to assemble it and you do that through

experience so if you're rewarded you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
experience so if you're rewarded you
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340
experience so if you're rewarded you
tend to repeat whatever you got rewarded

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
tend to repeat whatever you got rewarded
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.009
tend to repeat whatever you got rewarded
for if you're punished you tend to avoid

Wall Street if you make up some
cockamamie mortgage scheme and you get a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
cockamamie mortgage scheme and you get a
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.979
cockamamie mortgage scheme and you get a
billion dollars for it you go wow that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
billion dollars for it you go wow that's
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.170
billion dollars for it you go wow that's
really cool let's do that again which is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
really cool let's do that again which is
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630
really cool let's do that again which is
exactly it's a simplified version of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
exactly it's a simplified version of
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.650
exactly it's a simplified version of
what happened on Wall Street but

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
what happened on Wall Street but
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920
what happened on Wall Street but
essentially these guys saw a thing that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
essentially these guys saw a thing that
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350
essentially these guys saw a thing that
they could do these mortgage default

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
they could do these mortgage default
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.970
they could do these mortgage default

that every time they did it it rewarded

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
that every time they did it it rewarded
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720
that every time they did it it rewarded
them and so they did it again and again

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
them and so they did it again and again
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150
them and so they did it again and again
and again and it's like having fire

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
and again and it's like having fire
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610

because it can't pay everybody so that's
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600
because it can't pay everybody so that's
a very simplified scheme in which you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
a very simplified scheme in which you
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609
a very simplified scheme in which you
get rewarded and do again the wrong

systems that I talked about in the book
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350
systems that I talked about in the book
is the mental model system and I'll give

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
is the mental model system and I'll give
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570
is the mental model system and I'll give
you an example of a really bad mistake

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
you an example of a really bad mistake
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600
you an example of a really bad mistake
that I made using mental models when I

and I reached out to pick it up and then

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
and I reached out to pick it up and then
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.690

I saw its tongue come out and of course

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
I saw its tongue come out and of course
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670
I saw its tongue come out and of course
I realized the very stupid mistake that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
I realized the very stupid mistake that
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.559
I realized the very stupid mistake that
I've made because I had all this

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569
I've made because I had all this
 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.149
I've made because I had all this
intellectual knowledge that could have

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159
intellectual knowledge that could have
 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.369
intellectual knowledge that could have
prevented me from doing that but that

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379
prevented me from doing that but that
 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.349
prevented me from doing that but that
didn't because I was operating on the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359
didn't because I was operating on the
 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.140
didn't because I was operating on the
mental model the closest association I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
mental model the closest association I
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330
mental model the closest association I
had and it was stored away I hadn't

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
had and it was stored away I hadn't
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.220
had and it was stored away I hadn't
thought about it for decades and it was

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
thought about it for decades and it was
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.440
thought about it for decades and it was
my grandmother's ashtray so I knew

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
my grandmother's ashtray so I knew

my grandmother's ashtray so I knew
intellectually for example that the

intellectually for example that the
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.759
intellectually for example that the
chances of finding my grandmother's

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769
chances of finding my grandmother's
 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.929
chances of finding my grandmother's
ashtray anywhere in the known universe

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939
ashtray anywhere in the known universe
 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.819
ashtray anywhere in the known universe
were approximately zero

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829
were approximately zero
 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.729
were approximately zero
I knew also there that I was in the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
I knew also there that I was in the
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.500
I knew also there that I was in the
mountain wilderness where rattlesnakes

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
mountain wilderness where rattlesnakes
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.809
mountain wilderness where rattlesnakes
are really common in California I knew

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
are really common in California I knew
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.309
are really common in California I knew
that they liked to poke around in stone

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319
that they liked to poke around in stone

ruins cuz mice lived there I knew all
this stuff and it did me no good so this

this stuff and it did me no good so this
 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.699
this stuff and it did me no good so this
is what I mean when I say smart people

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
is what I mean when I say smart people
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280
is what I mean when I say smart people
do stupid things this is a the type of

do stupid things this is a the type of
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.080
do stupid things this is a the type of
mistake that certain scientists call an

mistake that certain scientists call an
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.599
mistake that certain scientists call an
intelligent mistake because all my

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609
intelligent mistake because all my
 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.490
intelligent mistake because all my
learning my most important learning

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
learning my most important learning
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.060
learning my most important learning
caused the mistake
