00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.922
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I multiply the left side by 10, I get 58a. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I notice 58a is on the left

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:08.018
side in all my answer choices, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So there's something else going on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice

00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:12.394
that I use brackets around the entire expression. That's because I already had

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:16.479
parenthesis here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I only need to distribute the 10 to the 2 and 1 10th and

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:20.682
the 2, because when we distribute the 10 will be applied to the 3a and the 2. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:24.623
And then of course on the end, I have 2 times 20. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So we know this one must be

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:28.586
correct. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; This was a really tricky quiz, so don't worry if you didn't get it

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:32.564
right on the first try. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hopefully you learned something about decimals and

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.681
the distributive property along the way.
