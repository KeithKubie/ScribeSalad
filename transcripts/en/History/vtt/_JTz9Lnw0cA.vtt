00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.380
NARRATOR: On June 23, 2016 the
UK voted

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.290
to leave the European Union.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.040
The decision is known as
Brexit, a shorthand way

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.540
to refer to Britain's Exit.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.460
The split between the UK and
the EU shocked the world,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.960
but it was actually
a long time coming.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.710
Why?

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.080
Well, it all goes back to the
1957 establishment of the EEC,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.000
or European Economic Community.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.830
In the aftermath
of World War II,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.750
Europe sought an
economic and political

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.580
partnership to pool
their resources

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.830
and secure a lasting peace.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250
Six nations signed
up, West Germany,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.830
Belgium, France,
the Netherlands,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.880
Italy and Luxembourg.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.000
The Brits were ambivalent
about the arrangement at first.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080
Once a mighty empire, the UK
wasn't used to collaborating

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.250
with the rest of Europe, but it
finally joined in 1973 as a way

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.080
to bolster its economy.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.710
Public reaction was tepid.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.420
The major ruling
parties at the time

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540
were mostly in favor
of England's membership

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.040
within the EEC, but a vote
was put to the people anyway.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.250
Should Britain leave or remain?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.040
67% voted remain.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460
One of those remain
votes came from a rising

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.250
star in the Conservative
Party, the Iron Lady

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.620
herself, Margaret Thatcher.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.960
It will be a splendid
and decisive yes

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
for Britain in Europe
for your generation

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.210
and the whole of the next one.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.540
NARRATOR: But by the
time she had become

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.290
Prime Minister in 1979,
Thatcher had grown

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960
critical of the arrangement.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.460
She complained that the vast
amount of money the UK paid

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.250
into the EEC's coffers
yielded little benefit

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460
compared to the return
of other countries.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.290
She demanded a rebate
and got one in 1984.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.750
Thatcher also believed
that England's independence

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.330
and prosperity suffered under
centralized European authority.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.960
She had no interest in being
a part of a United States

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.500
of Europe.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.620
The growing rift produced
two sides, the Europhiles,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.580
who embraced
integration with Europe,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.000
and the Eurosceptics, who
wanted an independent Britain.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170
In a now famous 1988
speech in Bruges, Belgium,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.000
Thatcher made her
views on the EU clear.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.620
Europe will be
stronger precisely

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.330
because it has France
as France, Spain

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.250
as Spain, Britain as Britain,
each with its own customs,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.620
traditions and identity.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.080
It would be folly
to try to fit them

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.330
into some sort of identikit
European personality.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000
NARRATOR: Her position
rankled the Europhiles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.580
within her own party and
helped lead to her resignation

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.330
in 1990.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.460
Throughout the '90s,
Thatcher's successors,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.000
John Major and Tony Blair,
pushed to unify with Europe.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.710
In 1993, the EEC's
members expanded the power

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.540
of their governing
bodies, folding

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.880
the various European communities
into the newly formed European

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.170
Union, and laid the groundwork
for a single currency,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.540
the euro.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.000
But tensions resurfaced
in the 2000s amidst

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.380
economic and political crisis.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.710
First, the global economy
crashed in 2008 hitting

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.670
the euro especially hard.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.620
Many workers in euro
depressed nations

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.710
fled to England for jobs.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.710
At the same time, unrest
in the Middle East

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.620
led to an influx of asylum
seekers to European shores.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.080
Native born Britons believed
these migrants took away

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.540
jobs and depressed wages,
and blamed the EU's economic

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750
regulation and border policies.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.670
Calls to exit the EU
reached a fever pitch

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.500
led by a right wing
nationalist party

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.080
called UKIP, the UK
Independence Party.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.420
Enter Prime Minister
David Cameron.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.330
In 2013, he gave a speech
on the state of the EU

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
that echoed
Thatcher's in Bruges,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.710
vowing reform if his
Conservative Party won a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.580
majority in the next election.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.420
We will give the British
people a referendum

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.420
with a very simple
in or out choice,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.040
to stay in the European
Union on these new terms

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.330
or to come out altogether.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.120
It will be an in out referendum.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.960
NARRATOR: The Conservatives
won the election.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.210
And under pressure
from UKIP politicians,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.290
Cameron held the second remain
or leave referendum in June

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.750
of 2016.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.790
And this time, nearly
52% voted leave.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.540
Cameron, who had pushed for the
referendum in hopes of a remain

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.120
result, resigned two
and a half weeks later

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.460
as Britain began the long
and complicated process

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.920
of separating from the EU.
