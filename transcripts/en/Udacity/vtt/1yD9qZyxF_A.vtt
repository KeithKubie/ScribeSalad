00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.310
DNS domains are structured as a tree.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.461
Domains such as google.com and
udacity.com do share something,

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:09.880
the com top-level domain.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.520
There's actually a collection of
servers who are responsible for

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.329
storing all of the records for
domains in com, and

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.040
in org and edu and
each other top-level domain,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.563
including country code demands
like uk and il and ua [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:31.607
Now, www.example.com Is
a subdomain of example.com.

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:36.598
And test.www.example.com
is a subdomain of that.

00:00:36.598 --> 00:00:41.620
Now, there's no rule that you can't have
hosts at any level of these subdomains.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.540
You can have a host with an IP address
and an A record on one domain and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660
then have a subdomain of that
with a different host on it.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.950
Now, early in the history of the web
it was common for an institution whose

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.780
domain was, let's say, stanford.edu to
have its web server at www.stanford.edu.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.310
And that would have typically been
a single machine that was the web server

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.150
representing the institution.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.780
But these days, since so many
domains are used almost entirely for

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.580
web traffic,
many organizations skip the www and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.720
just point their domain
directly to a web server.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.290
Like github.com for instance.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.420
The name www.github.com is a C-Name,
an alias, for the A record, github .com.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.725
Whether to use bare domains
like GitHub does or

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.790
www domains like Udacity does is pretty
much a style and branding preference.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.370
There's little technical difference.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.410
For computers within an organization,
it's pretty common for

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.210
them to also have
a configured search domain.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.190
This tells the resolver on that
computer to look up hosts inside that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.720
domain first.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.535
Like if you're on the network
of the university, example.edu,

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:52.970
you might have that in
your search domain.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.340
Then when you look up the DNS name www,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.300
the resolver will look for
www.example.edu first.
