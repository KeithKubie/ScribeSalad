00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:09.872
The year was 1816.

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:12.382
Europe and North America had just been through

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.276
a devastating series of wars,

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.258
and a slow recovery seemed to be underway,

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:20.759
but nature had other plans.

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.351
After two years of poor harvests,

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:26.289
the spring brought heavy rains and cold,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.274
flooding the rivers and causing crop failures

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.853
from the British Isles to Switzerland.

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:35.642
While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary,

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:40.486
famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued.

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:42.655
Meanwhile, New England was blanketed

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:44.347
by a strange fog

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.576
that would not disperse

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:47.494
as the ground remained frozen

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:49.410
well into June.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.790
In what came to be known as "the Year Without a Summer,"

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.328
some thought the apocalypse had begun.

00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:58.588
A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem "Darkness":

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:01.965
"I had a dream which was not all a dream.

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.715
The bright sun was extinguish'd,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.550
and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.672
rayless, and pathless,

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:13.935
and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.799
in the moonless air;

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.883
morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day."

00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:20.860
They had no way of knowing

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.777
that the real source of their misfortunes

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:27.000
had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.619
The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.331
on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.957
was what is known as a supervolcano,

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:38.960
characterized by a volume of erupted material,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.562
many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes.

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:45.246
And while the popular image of volcanic destruction

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.966
is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land,

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.514
far greater devastation is caused

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:52.849
by what remains in the air.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.200
Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.298
can blanket the sky for days,

00:01:57.298 --> 00:02:00.215
while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide,

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:01.841
react in the stratosphere,

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.519
blocking out solar radiation

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.509
and drastically cooling the atmosphere below.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.694
The resulting volcanic winter,

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.327
along with other effects such as acid rain,

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:12.952
can effect multiple continents,

00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:14.495
disrupting natural cycles

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.465
and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms,

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.503
including humans, depend.

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:23.515
Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:25.509
of rock, ash and gas,

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.304
the Mount Tambora eruption

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:29.762
was the largest in recorded history,

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:32.680
causing as many as 90,000 deaths.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.397
But previous eruptions have been even more deadly.

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:38.883
The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:41.219
is likely to have triggered the Russian famine,

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.317
that killed nearly two million,

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:46.739
while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events,

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.295
such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty,

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:52.298
the disappearance of the Minoan civilization,

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:55.228
and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.465
that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:01.544
being wiped out 70,000 years ago.

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:04.336
One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:06.556
is an explosive caldera,

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.926
formed when a volcanic mountain collapses

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.845
after an eruption so large

00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:12.846
that the now-empty magma chamber

00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:14.966
can no longer support its weight.

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.849
But though the above-ground volcano is gone,

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.937
the underground volcanic activity continues.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:22.715
With no method of release,

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.941
magma and volcanic gases continue

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.881
to accumulate and expand underground,

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.299
building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.465
becomes inevitable.

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:36.916
And one of the largest active volcanic calderas

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.631
lies right under Yellowstone National Park.

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:43.185
The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago,

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.123
it covered much of North America

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:47.965
in nearly two meters of ash and rock.

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.283
Scientists are currently monitoring

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:51.927
the world's active volcanoes,

00:03:51.927 --> 00:03:53.894
and procedures for predicting eruptions,

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:57.309
conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.465
have improved over the years.

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.549
But the massive scale and global reach

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.964
of a supervolcano

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:06.258
means that for many people there would be nowhere to run.

00:04:06.258 --> 00:04:08.716
Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:11.946
of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years.

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:14.492
But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable

00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:16.909
civilization-destroying apocalypse

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.370
caused by events half a globe away

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.957
will remain a powerful and terrifying vision.

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:24.376
Less fictional than we would like to believe.

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:27.755
"The winds were withered in the stagnant air,

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.630
and the clouds perish'd;

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.355
darkness had no need of aid from them --

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.883
she was the universe." - Lord Byron
