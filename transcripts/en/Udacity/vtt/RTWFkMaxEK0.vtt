00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.480
We saw in the previous example how sentences in a story can be ambiguous. For

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.220
example, by, could have referred to an agent, a conveyance, or a location.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.665
This is true, not just for prepositions, but is also true of other [UNKNOWN]

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:20.270
categories, like words. In fact, words often can have several interpretations.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.280
Let us consider the word take as an example. Take is a very common word.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.660
It has at least these 12 different meanings. Consider for instance to medicate.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.580
Ashok took an aspirin. Here, the meaning is that Ashok took

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.620
aspirin as a medication. Each of these meanings has a common meaning of take,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.730
as we will say in just a minute. But given a sentence in which take occurs,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.630
how do we know which of these meanings is intended by the word,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.810
take? So suppose the input sentence was, my doctor took my blood pressure.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.700
The taken in this sentence refers to, to measure and not to any of the others.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.010
Let us examine this issue further. So, for each of these 12 interpretations of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.900
take, we have a frame-like representation. So take 1 to take 12.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.950
Each of this frame-like representation specifies the thematic roles that go with

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.400
that particular meaning of take. So in this particular meaning of take, take 1,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.530
we have an agent and an object. In this meaning of take, take 12.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.950
We have an agent, an article, and a particle. Another word that typically occurs

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.400
with take which signifies this meaning, so to take clothes off from a body.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.210
Let us consider another example of particle. Let us consider take11.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.980
The meaning of this take is to assume control, as in to assume control of

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.570
a company, or to assume control of a country. When the meaning is

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.290
intended to be to assume control, then take typically occurs with the word over.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.780
Take over a company. Take over a country. So, over then is a particle that

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.340
signifies this eleventh meaning of take. To go deeper into story understanding,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.790
consider the simple story I took the candy from the baby. What is the meaning of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.070
the word take here? You and I get this immediately, but how can an agent get it?

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.500
To keep it simple, we have shown here just nine meanings of take, you could have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.050
added the other three as well. Although we started with bottom-up processing,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.010
we're now going to shift to top-down processing. Because there's something about

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.370
the background knowledge about candy that we have, which is going to eliminate

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.410
lots of choice. In particular, we know that candy is not a medicine, so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.290
this particular choice goes away. We know that candy is not a quantity, so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.320
this choice goes away. Several of these choices disappear,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.550
because of our background knowledge of candy. Just like some of the constraints

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.190
came from our background knowledge of the semantic category of candy,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.900
other constraints come from our background knowledge of the preposition,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.420
from. In the table showing prepositions earlier, from referred to a source.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.050
These three frames do not have anything to do with the source, and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.370
therefore we eliminate them. We're left only with this particular frame,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.480
which has source in it as required by the preposition from. And thus we decide

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.920
that the interpretation of took in this particular sentence is to steal from

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.840
a baby. And thus we infer the correct interpretation of take, in this particular

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.240
sentence. It refers to, to steal. This is the only frame that is still active
