00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.570
Voiceover: Let's say we have
2 people in identical jobs.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.937
Person A and Person B.

00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:08.604
This past year, they both got paid

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:10.070
in their identical jobs,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.710
they got paid $350,000 in salary.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.473
Now let's assume that
Person A has no deductions.

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:21.070
They just calculate their taxes,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.228
and for the sake of simplicity,

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:24.740
I'm just going to make up a number.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.939
I'm not going to go through all of it,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.405
especially because the tax
code changes every year.

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:33.072
Let's just say their
regular taxes are $150,000.

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:37.866
150,000 in regular taxes.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.609
Regular taxes, when you just file taxes,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.959
not the straightforward,
but just the regular way.

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.736
Let's say Person B, on the other hand,

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:47.551
even though they have the exact same job,

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.216
they donate a bunch to charity;

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.743
they have all of these deductions;

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:51.806
they have all of these things

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.805
that they can write off from their income,

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.807
and so Person B's taxable income,

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.070
let's say that it goes down,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.739
with all of these deductions,

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.067
the taxable income goes down to $200,000.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:08.629
On that taxable income of $200,000,

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:14.267
Person B has to pay
$70,000 in regular taxes.

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.136
Once again, I'm just
making up simple numbers,

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:18.635
just for the sake of simplicity.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:19.626
I'm just actually figuring out

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:22.134
exactly what Person B's taxes are.

00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:24.805
70,000 in regular taxes.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.475
Now, the US government, or the IRS, says,

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:29.805
"Hey, look; Person B
actually made a lot of money;

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:31.815
"made a similar amount
of money to Person A;

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:33.209
"they did all of these deductions;

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.137
"allowed them to pay a lot less in taxes.

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.741
"We don't necessarily like that.

00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:40.297
"This person's making a lot of money.

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:41.964
"We think that they should

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:45.540
"pay some alternative minimum tax."

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.397
The way that's calculated
is, for either party,

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:51.471
there's this completely separate tax code.

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:55.268
So, Alternative Minimum Tax.

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:57.629
You calculate your regular taxes,

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.675
so that's this number and this number,

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:01.934
and then in parallel you calculate

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:04.001
an alternative minimum tax,

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.071
and in the case of either of these people,

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:07.527
what happens is you don't get

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.935
most of these deductions right here.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.684
That's really done, basically,

00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:13.104
for simplicity purposes,

00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:17.011
on your gross income,

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.677
and it's a much simpler tax code.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:21.603
It's almost a flat tax.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:26.429
At the $350,000 level, you
get no standard deduction,

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.476
and it's really, it's 26% right now,

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:32.267
on the first 175,000,

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:36.141
and then it is 28% on the next 175,000,

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:37.680
if you're making this much money.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.603
You have a deduction if
you make less than that,

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:42.684
and all the rest; I won't
go into the details,

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.733
but the general idea is you calculate this

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.429
for either party, and in either situation,

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.350
the alternative minimum tax

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.019
for either of these people

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.806
is going to be $94,500.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:57.850
$94,500.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.765
This guy, Person A,
will calculate his AMT.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.678
He gets $94,500.

00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:05.541
He's like, "Well, my
regular taxes are $150,000,

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:07.676
"so I pay the higher of the 2."

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:09.516
He pays his regular taxes.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.469
This is just done, just to make sure

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.271
that his AMT isn't higher.

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.934
Person B, on the other hand,

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.432
his regular taxes, after
all of this deductions,

00:03:17.432 --> 00:03:22.185
came out to $70,000, so
he has to pay the AMT,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:25.350
because the AMT is higher
than his regular taxes,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.016
so this is what he pays.

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:29.544
The general idea, you
compute your regular taxes;

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:32.743
you compute the AMT; 2 separate tax codes;

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:34.933
you pay the higher of the 2,

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.269
and the whole idea of this

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.600
is to make sure that people
who have a certain income

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.539
aren't able to deduct it all away,

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.802
and pay a very, very low income tax.
