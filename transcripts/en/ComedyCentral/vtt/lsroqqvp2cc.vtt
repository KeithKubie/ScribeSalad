00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.070 align:end position:100%
Have any glitz?
Anyone have any...glitz?

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.873 align:start position:0%
The Salazito compound has
to be around here somewhere.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.541 align:start size:56% position:44%
Ugh! I need glitz.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.543
Poor bastards.
That bastard chemist

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.812
Jericho Becker got 'em addicted
to his wonder drug

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.214 align:end position:100%
and then stopped making it.
Heartless bastard.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:16.750 align:start size:72% position:28%
Aah!

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.152
[groaning]

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.821 align:end position:100%
No more screwing around,
Raduardo.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.322 align:start size:75% position:25%
Make it right this time.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.457 align:start position:0%
Uh...

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.459 align:end position:100%
Unless you don't know
how to make it.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.094 align:start size:81% position:19%
Maybe you're just a fraud.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.997 align:end size:97% position:97%
Maybe you're not
a powerful drug lord at all.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.098 align:start size:59% position:41%
If that's the case,

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.335 align:end position:100%
then you might
as well leave right now.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.805 align:start position:0%
[loudly] No!
[meekly] I am.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.507 align:start size:63% position:38%
Then make the glitz.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.177 align:start position:0%
I don't know
how not to make gliss.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.545 align:start position:0%
Glitz. Glitz.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.115 size:84% position:42%
I hope Rad isn't actually
trying to make glitzotrene.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
He knows nothing
about chemistry.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.286 size:84% position:42%
One wrong combination and--

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.289 align:start position:0%
Let's go!

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.460
[siren wails]
Firemen?

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.461
Oh, God!

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:04.464
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.299
No!

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.102
[Sizzle laughing]

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.104
[crowd cheering]

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:16.008 align:end position:100%
Those Dalmatian
diddling glory hogs.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.810 align:end position:100%
They're going
to hog all the glory.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:19.412
[Sizzle grunting]

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:24.917 align:end position:100%
(Mayor)
Look, Sizzle captured
Raduardo Glitzcobar.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.185 align:start size:47% position:53%
Go, Sizzle, go!

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.321
[Sizzle groans]

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.957
Oh, my chiseled face!

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.328 align:end position:100%
Well, at least
he was horribly burned.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.161
All those Sizzle groupies
are gonna be flocking to me now.
