there in Android studio and what's

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.110
there in Android studio and what's
 

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.329
there in Android studio and what's
important to note is that we use the

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:13.339
important to note is that we use the
 

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:15.640
important to note is that we use the
same rendering renderer on the device

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:15.650
same rendering renderer on the device
 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.530
same rendering renderer on the device
and inside Android studio so what you

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:17.540
and inside Android studio so what you
 

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.690
and inside Android studio so what you
see in studio will be what you see on

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:19.700
see in studio will be what you see on
 

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.200

have to use our fragment you can use the

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:21.650
have to use our fragment you can use the
 

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.350
have to use our fragment you can use the
view and therefore the scene directly

because they show AR through a webview
so they just put in their view behind a

so now let's build a solar system

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:29.260
so now let's build a solar system

we start off with the Sun node create a
 

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.400
we start off with the Sun node create a
new gnome and set its renderable to be

the Sun model that you had loaded next
 

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.110
the Sun model that you had loaded next
we create the earth node we set its

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120
we create the earth node we set its
 

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.110
we create the earth node we set its
parent to the Sun therefore building the

want it to display some information on
 

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.259
want it to display some information on
it so I've created this node that would

00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:32.269
it so I've created this node that would
 

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.650
it so I've created this node that would
hold the view renderable I've set it to

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:35.660
hold the view renderable I've set it to
 

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.530
hold the view renderable I've set it to
a planet and it will now float a quarter

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:38.540
a planet and it will now float a quarter
 

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.180
a planet and it will now float a quarter
of a meter above the planet wherever

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.190
of a meter above the planet wherever
 

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.870
of a meter above the planet wherever
that planet is you start off by building

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880
that planet is you start off by building
 

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.059
that planet is you start off by building
a view renderable but notice here that

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:46.069
a view renderable but notice here that
 

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:49.059
a view renderable but notice here that
instead of the res raw source for the

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:49.069
instead of the res raw source for the
 

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:52.329
instead of the res raw source for the
model renderable I've set it to the view

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:52.339
model renderable I've set it to the view
 

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:56.680
model renderable I've set it to the view
ID and that's all there is to it now you

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:56.690
ID and that's all there is to it now you
 

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.680
ID and that's all there is to it now you
have the 2d view just as you would have

00:15:59.680 --> 00:15:59.690
have the 2d view just as you would have
 

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.559
have the 2d view just as you would have
in any other application and you could

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:02.569
in any other application and you could
 

00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:04.840
in any other application and you could
do things with that view like set the

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:04.850
do things with that view like set the
 

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:11.170
do things with that view like set the
text and finally if you want to drag

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.180
text and finally if you want to drag
 

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.470
text and finally if you want to drag
scale and rotate objects we've made that

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480
scale and rotate objects we've made that
 

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.360
scale and rotate objects we've made that
really easy for you by creating a

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:16.370
really easy for you by creating a
 

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.850
really easy for you by creating a
transformable node the transformable

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:18.860
transformable node the transformable
 

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.660
transformable node the transformable
node is an extension to node but it also

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:21.670
node is an extension to node but it also
 

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.490
node is an extension to node but it also
understands touch events and gestures

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:24.500
understands touch events and gestures
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.769
understands touch events and gestures
like dragging and scaling and rotating

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:26.779
like dragging and scaling and rotating
 

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:29.590
like dragging and scaling and rotating
objects so in this case if instead of

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600
objects so in this case if instead of
 

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.480
objects so in this case if instead of
creating a Sun node I created a

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.490
creating a Sun node I created a
 

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.629
creating a Sun node I created a
transformable Sun node I would just do

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639
transformable Sun node I would just do
 

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:37.600
transformable Sun node I would just do
everything else that I did before but

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:37.610
everything else that I did before but
 

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.639
everything else that I did before but
now we can actually drag and move the

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:39.649
now we can actually drag and move the
 

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:43.600
now we can actually drag and move the
roll the solar system I should mention

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:43.610
roll the solar system I should mention
 

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.850
roll the solar system I should mention

idea behind it is that we are relying on
 

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:38.080
idea behind it is that we are relying on
physical principles to define all the

means that we have to take into account

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:52.190
means that we have to take into account
 

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.310
means that we have to take into account
laws of physics like the energy

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320
laws of physics like the energy
 

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.279
laws of physics like the energy
conservation we use physical light units

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:57.289
conservation we use physical light units
 

00:18:57.289 --> 00:19:00.070

new material you are actually trying to
describe and define a surface and to

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.190
describe and define a surface and to
 

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.950
describe and define a surface and to
define a surface you're gonna need three

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960
define a surface you're gonna need three
 

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.330
define a surface you're gonna need three
things and we're going to take them in

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.340
things and we're going to take them in
 

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.770
things and we're going to take them in
this order for very specific reasons

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:56.780
this order for very specific reasons
 

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.270
this order for very specific reasons
we're going to explain them in a little

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280
we're going to explain them in a little
 

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.730
we're going to explain them in a little
bit the first one is you need to define

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:00.740
bit the first one is you need to define
 

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.090
bit the first one is you need to define
the metallic property of the surface

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:03.100
the metallic property of the surface
 

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.380
the metallic property of the surface
often we talk about metallic Ness but

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:05.390
often we talk about metallic Ness but
 

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.770
often we talk about metallic Ness but
it's not even a word so metallic no at a

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:08.780
it's not even a word so metallic no at a
 

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.750
it's not even a word so metallic no at a
high level is whether object whether or

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760
high level is whether object whether or
 

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.050
high level is whether object whether or
not the object is a metal and

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:12.060
not the object is a metal and
 

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.940
not the object is a metal and
gonna see why this is very important to

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:13.950
gonna see why this is very important to
 

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.160
gonna see why this is very important to
us then you're going to define the color

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.170
us then you're going to define the color
 

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.990
us then you're going to define the color
of the object and we call it the base

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000
of the object and we call it the base
 

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.570
of the object and we call it the base
color as opposed to the diffuse color or

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580
color as opposed to the diffuse color or
 

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.520
color as opposed to the diffuse color or
the specular color those up terms that

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:22.530
the specular color those up terms that
 

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.840
the specular color those up terms that
you might have seen if you've used other

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:23.850
you might have seen if you've used other
 

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.700
you might have seen if you've used other
engines and again there's a reason for

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:25.710
engines and again there's a reason for
 

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.210
engines and again there's a reason for
that

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220
that
 

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.710
that
finally you need to define something

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720
finally you need to define something
 

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.630
finally you need to define something
called a roughness

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640
called a roughness
 

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.090
called a roughness
roughly it means how shiny the object is

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100
roughly it means how shiny the object is
 

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.460
roughly it means how shiny the object is
and if you want to go further there are

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:34.470
and if you want to go further there are
 

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.260
and if you want to go further there are
two other things you can define to give

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.270
two other things you can define to give
 

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.330
two other things you can define to give
your just refers your surface more

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340
your just refers your surface more
 

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.310
your just refers your surface more
detail more details a more natural

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320
detail more details a more natural
 

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.080
detail more details a more natural
appearance so the first one is the

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.090
appearance so the first one is the
 

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.330
appearance so the first one is the
normal or the normal map it just helps

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340
normal or the normal map it just helps
 

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.640
normal or the normal map it just helps
break the evenness of the surface and

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:46.650
break the evenness of the surface and
 

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.980
break the evenness of the surface and
the second one is called the ambient

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:48.990
the second one is called the ambient
 

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.330
the second one is called the ambient
occlusion or occlusion so first what is

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340
occlusion or occlusion so first what is
 

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.240
occlusion or occlusion so first what is
a non-metal I'll spare you the equation

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.250
a non-metal I'll spare you the equation
 

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.820
a non-metal I'll spare you the equation
this is actually fairly simple so here

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:58.830
this is actually fairly simple so here
 

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.230
this is actually fairly simple so here
at the bottom we have an object an

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240
at the bottom we have an object an
 

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.840
at the bottom we have an object an
orange object it's drawn in ingria to

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:02.850
orange object it's drawn in ingria to
 

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.000
orange object it's drawn in ingria to
make the diagram easier to read but we

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.010
make the diagram easier to read but we
 

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.260
make the diagram easier to read but we
have light coming from a light source

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:06.270
have light coming from a light source
 

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.450
have light coming from a light source
and hitting the surface of the object

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460
and hitting the surface of the object
 

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.940
and hitting the surface of the object
and the the the light that hits the

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:10.950
and the the the light that hits the
 

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.130
and the the the light that hits the
object gets split into two components

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140
object gets split into two components
 

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.980
object gets split into two components
the first one in white is the reflected

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:15.990
the first one in white is the reflected
 

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.530
the first one in white is the reflected
part so those are all the reflections so

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:18.540
part so those are all the reflections so
 

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.180
part so those are all the reflections so
in that orange ball that we saw before

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:20.190
in that orange ball that we saw before
 

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.040
in that orange ball that we saw before
at the edges you could see those

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.050
at the edges you could see those
 

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.800
at the edges you could see those
reflections that's the that's the part

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:24.810
reflections that's the that's the part
 

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.780
reflections that's the that's the part
of the light and then the other part of

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:26.790
of the light and then the other part of
 

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.730
of the light and then the other part of
the light is refracted in through the

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740
the light is refracted in through the
 

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.760
the light is refracted in through the
object and most objects around us they

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:31.770
object and most objects around us they
 

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.170
object and most objects around us they
absorb some of the light the light

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:33.180
absorb some of the light the light
 

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.510
absorb some of the light the light
enters the object it gets scattered it

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520
enters the object it gets scattered it
 

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.340
enters the object it gets scattered it
bounces around inside the object and

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:37.350
bounces around inside the object and
 

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.920
bounces around inside the object and
even some of the light will come out but

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:39.930
even some of the light will come out but
 

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.690
even some of the light will come out but
not all of it and this is what gives

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700
not all of it and this is what gives
 

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.120
not all of it and this is what gives
object colors in that particular case

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.130
object colors in that particular case
 

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.310
object colors in that particular case
because the object appears orange it

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320
because the object appears orange it
 

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.290
because the object appears orange it
just means that green and blue

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:48.300
just means that green and blue
 

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.760
just means that green and blue
components of the light have been

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:49.770
components of the light have been
 

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.470
components of the light have been
absorbed inside the object and that

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480
absorbed inside the object and that
 

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.690
absorbed inside the object and that
orange light that comes out is called

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700
orange light that comes out is called
 

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.690
orange light that comes out is called
the diffused light the white light is

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700
the diffused light the white light is
 

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.730
the diffused light the white light is
for the specular light so specular is

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740
for the specular light so specular is
 

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.950
for the specular light so specular is
for the reflections and diffuse is for

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960
for the reflections and diffuse is for
 

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.940
for the reflections and diffuse is for
everything else so this is an example of

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:04.950
everything else so this is an example of
 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.310
everything else so this is an example of
a non metallic orange ball and you can

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320
a non metallic orange ball and you can
 

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.890
a non metallic orange ball and you can
see those reflections if you look at the

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900
see those reflections if you look at the
 

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.110
see those reflections if you look at the
reflections here this is simulating an

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120
reflections here this is simulating an
 

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.790
reflections here this is simulating an
environment inside the classroom where

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:13.800
environment inside the classroom where
 

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.930
environment inside the classroom where
we have overhead

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940
we have overhead
 

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.910
we have overhead
white lights and you can see that even

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:16.920
white lights and you can see that even
 

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.280
white lights and you can see that even
though the object itself is orange the

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.290
though the object itself is orange the
 

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.920
though the object itself is orange the
lights appear white that's because they

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:21.930
lights appear white that's because they
 

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.420
lights appear white that's because they
just bounce off they don't enter the

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:23.430
just bounce off they don't enter the
 

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.170
just bounce off they don't enter the
object they don't take the two

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.180
object they don't take the two
 

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.510
object they don't take the two
take the color of the object into

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520
take the color of the object into
 

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.820
take the color of the object into
account and then the rest of the object

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:29.830
account and then the rest of the object
 

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.040
account and then the rest of the object
the non reflective parts are arranged as

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.050
the non reflective parts are arranged as
 

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.590
the non reflective parts are arranged as
expected now when you have a metallic

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600
expected now when you have a metallic
 

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.220
expected now when you have a metallic
object metals are conductors and they're

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.230
object metals are conductors and they're
 

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.290
object metals are conductors and they're
called conductors because when energy

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:40.300
called conductors because when energy
 

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.110
called conductors because when energy
hits them in this case lights the lights

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120
hits them in this case lights the lights
 

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.940
hits them in this case lights the lights
the part of the energy that's refracted

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:44.950
the part of the energy that's refracted
 

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.400
the part of the energy that's refracted
into the surface gets absorbed it just

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.410
into the surface gets absorbed it just
 

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.350
into the surface gets absorbed it just
gets transmitted into the object and

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360
gets transmitted into the object and
 

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.150
gets transmitted into the object and
does not get scattered outside so

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:51.160
does not get scattered outside so
 

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.110
does not get scattered outside so
there's no diffused light

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120
there's no diffused light
 

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.840
there's no diffused light
you only get reflections however what

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:54.850
you only get reflections however what
 

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.550
you only get reflections however what
happens with those reflections is that

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:56.560
happens with those reflections is that
 

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.250
happens with those reflections is that
they get detect the color of the object

00:23:59.250 --> 00:23:59.260
they get detect the color of the object
 

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.230
they get detect the color of the object
so you don't get those white reflections

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240
so you don't get those white reflections
 

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.060
so you don't get those white reflections
anymore you get the orange reflections

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.070
anymore you get the orange reflections
 

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.280
anymore you get the orange reflections
instead so if we take the same ball that

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:05.290
instead so if we take the same ball that
 

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.400
instead so if we take the same ball that
we just saw and we turn it into a Meno

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.410
we just saw and we turn it into a Meno
 

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.110
we just saw and we turn it into a Meno
if you look again at the lights at the

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120
if you look again at the lights at the
 

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.000
if you look again at the lights at the
overhead lights of that classroom you

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.010
overhead lights of that classroom you
 

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.920
overhead lights of that classroom you
can see that they now appear orange and

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:13.930
can see that they now appear orange and
 

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.420
can see that they now appear orange and
this is because the rest of the light

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:15.430
this is because the rest of the light
 

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.130
this is because the rest of the light
arised the rest of the specular light

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.140
arised the rest of the specular light
 

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.550
arised the rest of the specular light
was absorbed inside the object you can

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:20.560
was absorbed inside the object you can
 

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.330
was absorbed inside the object you can
also see another side effect of this of

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:24.340
also see another side effect of this of
 

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.190
also see another side effect of this of
the phenol law that we just talked about

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200
the phenol law that we just talked about
 

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.750
the phenol law that we just talked about
if you look at the edges of the sphere

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760
if you look at the edges of the sphere
 

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.610
if you look at the edges of the sphere
you can see that the reflections are not

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:29.620
you can see that the reflections are not
 

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.320
you can see that the reflections are not
orange anymore they take on the color of

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:31.330
orange anymore they take on the color of
 

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.540
orange anymore they take on the color of
the environment this is again a very

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:33.550
the environment this is again a very
 

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.370
the environment this is again a very
natural effect it feels weird when you

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:35.380
natural effect it feels weird when you
 

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.690
natural effect it feels weird when you

who are obsessed about their work comes
Christmas time they look at the

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:44.530
Christmas time they look at the
 

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.870
Christmas time they look at the
Christmas tree and they take a picture

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880
Christmas tree and they take a picture
 

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.100
Christmas tree and they take a picture
of one of the ornaments

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.110

I was holding one of my phones on the

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:49.450
I was holding one of my phones on the
 

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.960
I was holding one of my phones on the
side I was lighting the this green metal

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:51.970
side I was lighting the this green metal
 

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.760

ball with an orange light from the

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:53.770
ball with an orange light from the
 

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.650
ball with an orange light from the
wallpaper on my phone and you can see

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:55.660
wallpaper on my phone and you can see
 

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.360

that on the edge of the ball certainly

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:57.370
that on the edge of the ball certainly
 

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.530

the reflections are not green anymore

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:58.540
the reflections are not green anymore
 

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.870
the reflections are not green anymore
they take on the orange light coming

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880
they take on the orange light coming
 

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.150
they take on the orange light coming
from their light source so what we just

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:03.160
from their light source so what we just
 

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.730
from their light source so what we just
saw here can you keep weird when you sit

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:05.740
saw here can you keep weird when you sit
 

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.410
saw here can you keep weird when you sit

this is an effect that's perfectly
 

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.590
this is an effect that's perfectly
natural that happens everywhere around

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600
natural that happens everywhere around

you so the metallic property I mentioned

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.220
you so the metallic property I mentioned
 

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.440
you so the metallic property I mentioned
that this is the first thing you should

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:16.450
that this is the first thing you should
 

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.110
that this is the first thing you should
decide and you know Stan why because

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120
decide and you know Stan why because
 

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.670
decide and you know Stan why because
when you define the color of your object

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:20.680
when you define the color of your object
 

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.890
when you define the color of your object
when you find the base color is whether

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:22.900
when you find the base color is whether
 

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.480
when you find the base color is whether
or not depending on whether or not your

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:24.490
or not depending on whether or not your
 

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.490
or not depending on whether or not your
object is metallic or not it's gonna

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:26.500
object is metallic or not it's gonna
 

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.620

dramatically change the aspect of the
 

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.850
dramatically change the aspect of the
surface so you should always decide

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:29.860
surface so you should always decide
 

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.380
surface so you should always decide
first whether you're dealing with metal

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.390
first whether you're dealing with metal
 

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.110
first whether you're dealing with metal
or nonmetal so when it comes time to

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120
or nonmetal so when it comes time to
 

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.420
or nonmetal so when it comes time to
create the actual texture the metallic

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.430
create the actual texture the metallic
 

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.400

we defined as a grayscale texture so

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.090
we defined as a grayscale texture so
 

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.740
we defined as a grayscale texture so
values between 0 and 255 at 0 the object

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:43.750
values between 0 and 255 at 0 the object
 

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.170

white the object is a metal most of the

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000
white the object is a metal most of the
 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.180
white the object is a metal most of the
time the value should be either 0 or

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.190
time the value should be either 0 or
 

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.880
time the value should be either 0 or
either 1 all the values in between are

because you know your your texture could

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.260
because you know your your texture could
 

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.450
because you know your your texture could
contain maybe it's a metal that's

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:00.460
contain maybe it's a metal that's
 

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.310
contain maybe it's a metal that's
painted and the paint itself is not a

painted and the paint itself is not a
 

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.140
painted and the paint itself is not a
metal so the edges of the paints you

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.150
metal so the edges of the paints you
 

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.390
metal so the edges of the paints you
want nice fall off nice transitions from

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400
want nice fall off nice transitions from
 

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.140
want nice fall off nice transitions from

life happens to be a mixture and you can

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:12.310
life happens to be a mixture and you can
 

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.370
life happens to be a mixture and you can
use intermediate values as well but most

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:14.380
use intermediate values as well but most
 

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.390
use intermediate values as well but most
of the time you won't have to deal with

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:15.400
of the time you won't have to deal with
 

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.750
of the time you won't have to deal with
it you won't have to worry about it very

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760
it you won't have to worry about it very
 

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.990
it you won't have to worry about it very
quickly when a metal gets rusty it

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000
quickly when a metal gets rusty it
 

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.210
quickly when a metal gets rusty it
actually becomes nonmetallic so if

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.220
actually becomes nonmetallic so if
 

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.740
actually becomes nonmetallic so if
you're trying to create a surface that's

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.750
you're trying to create a surface that's
 

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.500
you're trying to create a surface that's
rusty the the rush stains will be

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.510
rusty the the rush stains will be
 

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.700
rusty the the rush stains will be
nonmetal yeah oh and very often so

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:32.710
nonmetal yeah oh and very often so
 

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.840
nonmetal yeah oh and very often so
that's something that again you'll see

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:33.850
that's something that again you'll see
 

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.610
that's something that again you'll see
tomorrow you don't have to use textures

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:35.620
tomorrow you don't have to use textures
 

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.720
tomorrow you don't have to use textures
for everything you can also use

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:36.730
for everything you can also use
 

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.880
for everything you can also use
constants and very often you can get

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:38.890
constants and very often you can get
 

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.680
constants and very often you can get
away with not having a texture for the

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:40.690
away with not having a texture for the
 

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:41.940
away with not having a texture for the
metallic Ness of your object you can

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:41.950
metallic Ness of your object you can
 

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.670
metallic Ness of your object you can
just say either it's a metal or it's not

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:43.680
just say either it's a metal or it's not
 

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.990
just say either it's a metal or it's not
ok next step you have to define the base

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000
ok next step you have to define the base
 

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.660
ok next step you have to define the base
color so the color of your object it

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:48.670
color so the color of your object it
 

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.450
color so the color of your object it
defines either the diffuse color of the

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:51.460
defines either the diffuse color of the
 

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.370
defines either the diffuse color of the
object for non metals or the specular

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:53.380
object for non metals or the specular
 

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.170
object for non metals or the specular
color or the color of the reflections

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:55.180
color or the color of the reflections
 

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.800
color or the color of the reflections
for metallic objects and what's quite

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:58.810
for metallic objects and what's quite
 

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.810
for metallic objects and what's quite
difficult to do when you create a base

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:00.820
difficult to do when you create a base
 

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.730
difficult to do when you create a base
color texture is that it must be

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:02.740
color texture is that it must be
 

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.740
color texture is that it must be
completely devoid of any lighting

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:04.750
completely devoid of any lighting
 

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.210
completely devoid of any lighting
information or any shadowing and we're

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:06.220
information or any shadowing and we're
 

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.980
information or any shadowing and we're
going to look at an example that can be

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:07.990
going to look at an example that can be
 

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.780
going to look at an example that can be
hard because as human beings we never

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:09.790
hard because as human beings we never
 

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.910
hard because as human beings we never
see the actual color of an object we

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:11.920
see the actual color of an object we
 

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.940
see the actual color of an object we
only see objects through lighting so

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:14.950
only see objects through lighting so
 

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.110
only see objects through lighting so
it's difficult to imagine what it looks

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120
it's difficult to imagine what it looks
 

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.510
it's difficult to imagine what it looks
like but you can quickly get used to it

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520
like but you can quickly get used to it
 

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.800
like but you can quickly get used to it
and whenever you use a tool like

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:19.810
and whenever you use a tool like
 

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.900

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:23.350
your textures make sure that you're
 

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.340
your textures make sure that you're
working in the sRGB color space and

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:25.350
working in the sRGB color space and
 

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.720
working in the sRGB color space and
which is what this tool should be doing

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:27.730
which is what this tool should be doing
 

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.370
which is what this tool should be doing
by default but just in case make sure

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:29.380
by default but just in case make sure
 

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.290
by default but just in case make sure
you and your artists work in that color

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:31.300
you and your artists work in that color
 

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.280
you and your artists work in that color
space so this is a quick guide of how to

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.290
space so this is a quick guide of how to
 

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.220
space so this is a quick guide of how to
build colors for objects based on

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.230
build colors for objects based on
 

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.710
build colors for objects based on
real-world data most of non metallic

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720
real-world data most of non metallic
 

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.070
real-world data most of non metallic
objects use most of the range of the

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080
objects use most of the range of the
 

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.140
objects use most of the range of the
brightness so whenever you pick a color

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.150
brightness so whenever you pick a color
 

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.420
brightness so whenever you pick a color
in the color picker for a nonmetallic

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:48.430
in the color picker for a nonmetallic
 

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.120

objective values of your

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.130
objective values of your
 

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.029
objective values of your
the colors between 10 and 240 and

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039
the colors between 10 and 240 and
 

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:55.279
the colors between 10 and 240 and
there's nothing as dark as zero there's

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:55.289
there's nothing as dark as zero there's
 

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:57.409
there's nothing as dark as zero there's
nothing as bright as 255 when when we

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419
nothing as bright as 255 when when we
 

00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:59.930
nothing as bright as 255 when when we
deal with nonmetals and mellows on the

00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940
deal with nonmetals and mellows on the
 

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.000
deal with nonmetals and mellows on the
other hand they're always fairly bright

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.010
other hand they're always fairly bright
 

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.940
other hand they're always fairly bright
so they are not dark metals basically

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:04.950
so they are not dark metals basically
 

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.650
so they are not dark metals basically

once we light the object all the

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679
once we light the object all the
 

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.830
once we light the object all the
contrast and saturation appears but all

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840
contrast and saturation appears but all
 

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.080
contrast and saturation appears but all
that information is not in the original

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:48.090
that information is not in the original
 

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.850
that information is not in the original
texture that we're using to create this

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860
texture that we're using to create this
 

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.850
texture that we're using to create this
material so again if you work with your

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860
material so again if you work with your
 

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.620
material so again if you work with your
artist make sure they are familiar with

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:54.630
artist make sure they are familiar with
 

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.240
artist make sure they are familiar with
the metallic the metallic roughness

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.250
the metallic the metallic roughness
 

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.799
the metallic the metallic roughness
workflow or make sure that it is

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:57.809
workflow or make sure that it is
 

00:28:57.809 --> 00:28:59.210
workflow or make sure that it is
understand that the base column

00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220
understand that the base column
 

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.549
understand that the base column
absolutely should not contain any

00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559
absolutely should not contain any
 

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:05.120
absolutely should not contain any
lighting or shadowing now I mentioned

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.130
lighting or shadowing now I mentioned
 

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.980
lighting or shadowing now I mentioned
this the third parameter is called a

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:06.990
this the third parameter is called a
 

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.720
this the third parameter is called a
roughness and defines how xiangjian

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:08.730
roughness and defines how xiangjian
 

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.940
roughness and defines how xiangjian
objectives so a very simple way to

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:10.950
objectives so a very simple way to
 

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.100
objectives so a very simple way to
define a surface is like this it's

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.110
define a surface is like this it's
 

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.039
define a surface is like this it's
infinitely smooth there is no object in

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:16.049
infinitely smooth there is no object in
 

00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:18.649
infinitely smooth there is no object in
the world that stays smooth and what

00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659
the world that stays smooth and what
 

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:20.380
the world that stays smooth and what
happens when you have a smooth object

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:20.390
happens when you have a smooth object
 

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.419
happens when you have a smooth object
light rays of light that are coming

00:29:23.419 --> 00:29:23.429
light rays of light that are coming
 

00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:26.440
light rays of light that are coming
parallel to each other bounce of

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:26.450
parallel to each other bounce of
 

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.340
parallel to each other bounce of
parallel to each other as well so you

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:28.350
parallel to each other as well so you
 

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.799
parallel to each other as well so you
get very sharp reflections rough objects

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:30.809
get very sharp reflections rough objects
 

00:29:30.809 --> 00:29:33.620
get very sharp reflections rough objects
on the other hand have what we call

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:33.630
on the other hand have what we call
 

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.450
on the other hand have what we call
macro facets at the surface you can

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460
macro facets at the surface you can
 

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.850
macro facets at the surface you can
think of those as very very tiny mirrors

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860
think of those as very very tiny mirrors
 

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.649
think of those as very very tiny mirrors
that may not be oriented in the same

00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659
that may not be oriented in the same
 

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:42.080
that may not be oriented in the same
directions so when light comes in you

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.090
directions so when light comes in you
 

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.029
directions so when light comes in you
have this parallel rails rays of light

00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039
have this parallel rails rays of light
 

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.830
have this parallel rails rays of light
they can bounce off in random directions

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840
they can bounce off in random directions
 

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.169
they can bounce off in random directions
and that causes the creates blurry

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179
and that causes the creates blurry
 

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:52.549
and that causes the creates blurry
reflections and those are examples at

00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559
reflections and those are examples at
 

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.610
reflections and those are examples at
the top you can see a ball a yellow

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620
the top you can see a ball a yellow
 

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.670
the top you can see a ball a yellow

and we increase the roughness from zero

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:58.990
and we increase the roughness from zero
 

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.990
and we increase the roughness from zero
all the way to one and at the bottom we

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000
all the way to one and at the bottom we
 

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.880
all the way to one and at the bottom we
have a non metallic ball and we increase

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:02.890
have a non metallic ball and we increase
 

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.230
have a non metallic ball and we increase
the roughness from zero to one and you

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240
the roughness from zero to one and you
 

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.060
the roughness from zero to one and you
can see the effect here we start with

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.070
can see the effect here we start with
 

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.070
can see the effect here we start with
very sharp reflection and as we get

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080
very sharp reflection and as we get
 

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.140
very sharp reflection and as we get
closer and closer to one the reflections

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.150
closer and closer to one the reflections
 

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.150
closer and closer to one the reflections
become so blurry that we can't even

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:12.160
become so blurry that we can't even
 

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.920
become so blurry that we can't even
perceive that there are reflections they

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:13.930
perceive that there are reflections they
 

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.420
perceive that there are reflections they
are there but they're spread over

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:15.430
are there but they're spread over
 

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.610
are there but they're spread over
basically the entire surface the entire

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:17.620
basically the entire surface the entire
 

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.400
basically the entire surface the entire
visible surface so this is a very

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.410
visible surface so this is a very
 

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.770
visible surface so this is a very
powerful feature because it lets you

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:22.780
powerful feature because it lets you
 

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.780
powerful feature because it lets you
again create things like polished metals

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:24.790
again create things like polished metals
 

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.710
again create things like polished metals
or you know a plastic that has been used

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720
or you know a plastic that has been used
 

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.360
or you know a plastic that has been used
for for quite a while and it's become

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.370
for for quite a while and it's become
 

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:35.400
for for quite a while and it's become
well basically rough so roughness is

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:35.410
well basically rough so roughness is
 

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.070
well basically rough so roughness is
very similar to the metallic property

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080
very similar to the metallic property
 

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.870
very similar to the metallic property
it's a grayscale texture use values

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880
it's a grayscale texture use values
 

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.680
it's a grayscale texture use values
between 0 and 255 at zero your surface

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:43.690
between 0 and 255 at zero your surface
 

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.480
between 0 and 255 at zero your surface
is going to be glossy or very shiny at

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.490
is going to be glossy or very shiny at
 

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.790
is going to be glossy or very shiny at
255 can be extremely rough and I'm going

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:47.800
255 can be extremely rough and I'm going
 

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.990
255 can be extremely rough and I'm going
to be able to see the reflections

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000
to be able to see the reflections
 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.510
to be able to see the reflections
anymore and just be aware that there may

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520
anymore and just be aware that there may
 

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.130

so if you specify a roughness of 100

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.350
so if you specify a roughness of 100
 

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.560
so if you specify a roughness of 100
let's send blender that some roughness

different engine because there are

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880
different engine because there are
 

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.830
different engine because there are
different ways of doing those

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840
different ways of doing those
 

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.720

and so it looks right instead of sim

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:07.510
and so it looks right instead of sim
 

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.780
and so it looks right instead of sim
form sometimes the roughness will be

is just the opposite value so you can

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.020
is just the opposite value so you can
 

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.020
is just the opposite value so you can
just invert the texture in Photoshop for

is just a black and white texture that
 

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.790
is just a black and white texture that
tells us where the shadows should be so

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:29.800
tells us where the shadows should be so
 

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.260
tells us where the shadows should be so
again that's called ambient occlusion or

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.270
again that's called ambient occlusion or
 

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.960
again that's called ambient occlusion or
occlusion it's very simple - oh sorry

going to go into too much detail so
 

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.430
going to go into too much detail so
anytime you create an object that has

best color the roughness the normal and

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:10.180
best color the roughness the normal and
 

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.120
best color the roughness the normal and
the mint occlusion and if you get them

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.130
the mint occlusion and if you get them

everything varies from pixel to pixel so
 

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.920
everything varies from pixel to pixel so
here we have a metal ball but for some

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:19.930
here we have a metal ball but for some
 

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.600
here we have a metal ball but for some
reason some of the tails are missing and

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:21.610
reason some of the tails are missing and
 

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.800
reason some of the tails are missing and
those are not metals anymore the

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:22.810
those are not metals anymore the
 

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:23.940

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.160
up the rendering as well alright so now
I want to talk about performance a

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.170
I want to talk about performance a
 

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.840
I want to talk about performance a
little bit so one of the features that

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:09.850
little bit so one of the features that
 

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.430
little bit so one of the features that
we have instead of our rendering engine

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440
we have instead of our rendering engine
 

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.810
we have instead of our rendering engine
is something called dynamic resolution

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:12.820
is something called dynamic resolution
 

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.900
is something called dynamic resolution
what we do is we always watch the time

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:15.910
what we do is we always watch the time
 

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:18.120
what we do is we always watch the time
spent on the GPU to render every frame

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.130
spent on the GPU to render every frame
 

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.680
spent on the GPU to render every frame
and instead of dropping frames when

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:20.690
and instead of dropping frames when
 

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.839
and instead of dropping frames when
too much to render we adapt the

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:22.849
too much to render we adapt the
 

00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:25.510
too much to render we adapt the
resolution of the of the rendering so we

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520
resolution of the of the rendering so we
 

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.609
resolution of the of the rendering so we
smoothly added the resolution both on

00:34:27.609 --> 00:34:27.619
smoothly added the resolution both on
 

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:29.589
smoothly added the resolution both on
the vertical and the horizontal axis

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599
the vertical and the horizontal axis
 

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:31.839
the vertical and the horizontal axis
sometimes with that first one axis then

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:31.849
sometimes with that first one axis then
 

00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:33.129
sometimes with that first one axis then
the other sometimes both at the same

00:34:33.129 --> 00:34:33.139
the other sometimes both at the same
 

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:34.930
the other sometimes both at the same
time so what this means for you is that

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:34.940
time so what this means for you is that
 

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.970
time so what this means for you is that

if you're building and they are seen if
you make it too complicated if you have

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:38.690
you make it too complicated if you have
 

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.180
you make it too complicated if you have
too many objects if you have materials

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.190
too many objects if you have materials
 

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.129
too many objects if you have materials
that are too complex we're not going to

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:42.139
that are too complex we're not going to
 

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.780
that are too complex we're not going to
drop frames were always been a favored

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:43.790
drop frames were always been a favored
 

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.510
drop frames were always been a favored
performance over anything else but we

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520
performance over anything else but we
 

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.550
performance over anything else but we
are going to lower the resolution of

your scene it works really well on our
 

00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:52.480
your scene it works really well on our
phones because we have really high

phones because we have really high
 

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.940
phones because we have really high
density displays so it's really hard to

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:54.950
density displays so it's really hard to
 

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.530

tell when this is going on and I'm sure

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:56.540

using that mini triangles it would be
 

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.609
using that mini triangles it would be
great and if use 10,000 triangle in one

00:35:57.609 --> 00:35:57.619
great and if use 10,000 triangle in one
 

00:35:57.619 --> 00:35:59.500

go into the details here because you
probably don't care but basically we

car every even pedestrian what we
 

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.099
car every even pedestrian what we
recommend is that at most you should

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:48.109
recommend is that at most you should
 

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:50.589
recommend is that at most you should
have maybe a hundred objects visible at

have maybe a hundred objects visible at
 

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:53.200
have maybe a hundred objects visible at
a time on screen and the reason here is

a time on screen and the reason here is
 

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.690
a time on screen and the reason here is
because we're gonna run into the CPU is

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:55.700
because we're gonna run into the CPU is
 

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.700
because we're gonna run into the CPU is
going to become a bottleneck so this is

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:57.710
going to become a bottleneck so this is
 

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.140
going to become a bottleneck so this is
not something that dynamic resolution

anything that's not on the screen we

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:03.170
anything that's not on the screen we
 

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.569
anything that's not on the screen we
have a lot of optimizations around that

00:37:04.569 --> 00:37:04.579
have a lot of optimizations around that
 

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:06.250
have a lot of optimizations around that
but if we have too many objects on

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:06.260
but if we have too many objects on
 

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.800
but if we have too many objects on
screen we're gonna be bound by the CPU

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:08.810
screen we're gonna be bound by the CPU
 

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.120
screen we're gonna be bound by the CPU
and there's not much we can do about it

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.130
and there's not much we can do about it
 

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.380
and there's not much we can do about it
and you're gonna start dropping frames

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:11.390

and one of the reasons why I like GL CF

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520
and one of the reasons why I like GL CF
 

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.599
and one of the reasons why I like GL CF
is because in the standard they pack the

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:37.609
is because in the standard they pack the

artists to give you gif models it's

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:48.859
artists to give you gif models it's
 

00:37:48.859 --> 00:37:51.250

we didn't show you how to do with the

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:56.390
we didn't show you how to do with the
 

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.870
we didn't show you how to do with the
idea is you can add lights in your sin

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880
idea is you can add lights in your sin
 

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.579
idea is you can add lights in your sin
and you can add many many many many

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:00.589
and you can add many many many many
 

00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:02.800
and you can add many many many many
lights this is an example of an early

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:02.810
lights this is an example of an early
 

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.809

demo of our rendering engine running on

00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:04.819
demo of our rendering engine running on
 

00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:07.059
demo of our rendering engine running on
my pixel - so here I think we had

00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:07.069
my pixel - so here I think we had
 

00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:09.940
my pixel - so here I think we had
something like 128 lights in the scene

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:09.950
something like 128 lights in the scene
 

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.980
something like 128 lights in the scene
so you can see that you can you can have

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:11.990
so you can see that you can you can have
 

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.569
so you can see that you can you can have
many many of them and we can still run

00:38:13.569 --> 00:38:13.579
many many of them and we can still run
 

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:15.640
many many of them and we can still run
at 60 frames per second what's very

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:15.650
at 60 frames per second what's very
 

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.740
at 60 frames per second what's very
important is that if you add many lights

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:17.750
important is that if you add many lights
 

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.300
important is that if you add many lights
in your scene make sure they don't

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:19.310
in your scene make sure they don't
 

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.980
in your scene make sure they don't
overlap or that they don't overlap too

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:20.990
overlap or that they don't overlap too
 

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.470
overlap or that they don't overlap too
much because if we have two lights on

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480
much because if we have two lights on
 

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.849
much because if we have two lights on
the same thing so we have to do the work

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:24.859
the same thing so we have to do the work
 

00:38:24.859 --> 00:38:26.890
the same thing so we have to do the work
twice so if you have you know 100 lights

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:26.900
twice so if you have you know 100 lights
 

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.190
twice so if you have you know 100 lights
on one pixel we're basically running one

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200
on one pixel we're basically running one
 

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.530
on one pixel we're basically running one
frames so use a lot of lights if you

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:31.540
frames so use a lot of lights if you
 

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.990
frames so use a lot of lights if you
want make sure they don't overlap and to

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000
want make sure they don't overlap and to
 

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.200
want make sure they don't overlap and to
do this in IPS you can give us a maximum

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.210
do this in IPS you can give us a maximum
 

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.920
do this in IPS you can give us a maximum
sphere of influence for each light

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:39.930
sphere of influence for each light
 

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.359
sphere of influence for each light
finally if you use the view run rebels

00:38:42.359 --> 00:38:42.369
finally if you use the view run rebels
 

00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:44.099
finally if you use the view run rebels
it's extremely convenient you can create

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:44.109
it's extremely convenient you can create
 

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:46.170
it's extremely convenient you can create
views the way you do it in the rest of

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:46.180
views the way you do it in the rest of
 

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.609
views the way you do it in the rest of
your application you can put them in the

00:38:47.609 --> 00:38:47.619
your application you can put them in the
 

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:50.730
your application you can put them in the
scene super useful but every view is

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:50.740
scene super useful but every view is
 

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.829
scene super useful but every view is
rendered in software and for every view

00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839
rendered in software and for every view
 

00:38:52.839 --> 00:38:54.630
rendered in software and for every view
we have to allocate what's called its

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640
we have to allocate what's called its
 

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.430
we have to allocate what's called its
surface texture and this is going to

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440
surface texture and this is going to
 

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.530
surface texture and this is going to
cost memory it's going to cast CPU time

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:58.540
cost memory it's going to cast CPU time
 

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.839
cost memory it's going to cast CPU time
and it's going to cost GPU time so try

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:00.849
and it's going to cost GPU time so try
 

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:02.490
and it's going to cost GPU time so try
to reuse the views as much as possible

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:02.500
to reuse the views as much as possible
 

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.470
to reuse the views as much as possible
don't try to put too many of them on the

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480
don't try to put too many of them on the
 

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.599
don't try to put too many of them on the
screen and not try to allocate too many

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:06.609
screen and not try to allocate too many
 

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:08.880
screen and not try to allocate too many
of them at the same time and finally all

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:08.890
of them at the same time and finally all
 

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.790
of them at the same time and finally all
