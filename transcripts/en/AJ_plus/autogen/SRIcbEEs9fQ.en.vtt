aluminum work really great and this is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

mason jar and we wanted to keep costs

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
mason jar and we wanted to keep costs
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.079
mason jar and we wanted to keep costs
low so that the parts that we use are

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089
low so that the parts that we use are
 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.799
low so that the parts that we use are
very inexpensive so the technology works

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
very inexpensive so the technology works
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.329
very inexpensive so the technology works
by running an electric current through

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.220
by running an electric current through
water and depending on what metals

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
water and depending on what metals
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.259
water and depending on what metals
you're using and what pollutants or

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269
you're using and what pollutants or
 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.029
you're using and what pollutants or
contaminants are in the water you can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
contaminants are in the water you can
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009
contaminants are in the water you can
sometimes separate those contaminants

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
sometimes separate those contaminants
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.800
sometimes separate those contaminants
with this current that's that's a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.670
with this current that's that's a
simplest way

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
simplest way
 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.810

out to maker spaces and universities

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250
out to maker spaces and universities
 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:35.149
out to maker spaces and universities
around the world

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.120
so in 10 years aleko will have a network

having with water and get a recipe that
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499
having with water and get a recipe that
will help them solve that and it could

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
will help them solve that and it could
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.870
will help them solve that and it could
be with our technology the coagulator or

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
be with our technology the coagulator or
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370
be with our technology the coagulator or
it could be with other open source

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
it could be with other open source
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.849
