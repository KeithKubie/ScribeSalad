00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.818
All right, let's get ready
for the worst TED Talk ever.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:20.087
(Laughter)

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:22.484
I mean it. We prepared 30 minutes ago.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:26.151
I want to have it clear --
I love to be here with you all,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.873
but I wanted to be here
not to tell my story

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:34.301
but to tell the story
of the amazing people of Puerto Rico

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.262
that came together
to feed the people of Puerto Rico.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.966
My name is José Andrés,
and you know I love to feed the few,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.199
but even more, I love to feed the many.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:47.435
Here, right after the hurricane,

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:51.901
like we'd done many times before
after an earthquake in Haiti

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:55.294
or Sandy or others,

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:58.466
I had this sense of urgency to be there

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.263
and to try to feed one person,

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:03.018
and always, you have crazy friends
that want to join you

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.779
in those impossible endeavors.

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:08.969
I'm always surrounded by amazing friends
that only help me to be better.

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:11.613
Nate came next to me.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.986
This was a Monday,
and this is what we found.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.184
The destruction you saw on TV,
one more hurricane,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.684
but this destruction was real.

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:25.981
More than 95 percent of the electricity
in the island was gone.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.860
Every single electric post was gone.

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:30.934
All the cell towers were gone.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.803
You couldn't communicate with anybody.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.066
You couldn't find anybody the moment
you moved away from San Juan.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.374
Even in San Juan, we had issues
trying to use our cell phones.

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:47.265
And what I found
was that the island was hungry,

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:53.152
and the people didn't have money,
because ATMs were not working,

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:57.604
or their cards, which are electronic,
for food stamps,

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.384
they couldn't use it
in their supermarkets,

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:04.053
or there was no food or gas
or clean water to cook.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:09.836
The need and the urgency of now was real,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.701
and I was just able
to get into a meeting at FEMA,

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:20.072
where many of the main
NGO partners were having a conversation

00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:23.797
about how to feed the island
in the weeks to come,

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.113
but the urgency was right now,
in this minute, in this second,

00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:32.125
and we almost had three million people
that needed to be fed.

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.863
So we began doing what we do best.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.583
We went to see the sources of food,

00:02:36.607 --> 00:02:39.749
and I was able to see that the private
industry actually was ready

00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:41.031
and prepared and thriving,

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:44.570
but somebody at FEMA was not able
even to be aware of that.

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.457
And what we did was use fine kitchens.

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.101
José Enrique, one of my favorite
men in the whole world,

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.185
one of the great restaurants in San Juan,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.876
where before landing, I began
calling all the chefs of Puerto Rico,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.689
and everybody was like,
"Let's not plan, let's not meet,

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.189
let's start cooking."

00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:03.245
(Laughter)

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.375
And that's what we did.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.587
We began feeding the people
of Puerto Rico, on a Monday.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.945
On a Monday, we did a thousand meals,
sancocho, an amazing stew

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.862
with corn and yucca and pork.

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.571
By Sunday, we were doing 25,000.

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:21.211
By Sunday, we already
didn't only use the restaurant,

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:25.753
but we rented the parking lot
right across.

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:27.897
We began bringing food trucks,

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.371
and a rice and chicken paella
operation, and refrigerators,

00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:32.877
and volunteers began coming.

00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:36.453
Why? Because everybody wants
to find a place to help,

00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:38.848
a place to do something.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:42.013
This is how we began our first delivery.

00:03:42.037 --> 00:03:45.935
The hospitals -- nobody was feeding
the nurses and the doctors,

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.846
and we began feeding our first project,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.418
Hospital Carolina.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:53.257
All of a sudden, every single
hospital was calling us.

00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:58.695
"We need food so we can feed
our 24/7 employees

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.645
taking care of the sick
and the elderly and the people in need."

00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:08.079
And then the place was too small.
We were receiving orders.

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:10.984
Every time we got one guest, one customer,

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:12.659
we never stopped serving them,

00:04:12.683 --> 00:04:15.954
because we wanted to make sure
that we were able to be stabilizing

00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:18.422
any place we were joining,

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:21.976
any city, any hospital, any elderly home.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.166
Every time we made contact with them,
we kept serving them food, day after day,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.523
so we needed to grow.

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:29.586
We moved into the big coliseum.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.412
25,000 meals became 50,000 meals,

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:36.974
became, all of a sudden,
the biggest restaurant in the world.

00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:42.491
We were making close to 70,000 meals a day

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.172
from one location alone.

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:49.300
(Applause)

00:04:49.324 --> 00:04:52.685
Volunteers began showing up
by the hundreds.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.051
At one point, we got
more than 7,000 volunteers

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:58.519
that were at least one hour
or more with us,

00:04:58.543 --> 00:05:02.809
at any given moment,
more than 700 people at once.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:04.920
You saw that we began creating a movement,

00:05:04.944 --> 00:05:08.738
a movement that had a very simple idea
everybody could rally behind:

00:05:08.762 --> 00:05:10.404
let's feed the hungry.

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:14.622
And we began making food
that people could recognize,

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:17.092
not things that come from a faraway place

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:21.727
in plastic bags that you open
and you cannot even smell.

00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:22.861
(Laughter)

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:26.009
We began making the foods
that people feel home.

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:31.024
People in these moments, they had
this urgency of feeling they are alive,

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:32.470
that somebody cares.

00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:34.035
One meal at a time,

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:38.202
it didn't only become something
used to bring calories to their bodies,

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:39.486
calories that they needed,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.018
but they needed something else.

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.757
They wanted to make sure
that you and you and you and you,

00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:45.014
that you were caring,

00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:47.707
that we were sending the message
that we are with you.

00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:50.518
Give us time, we are trying to fix this.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:53.953
That's what we found every time
we began joining the communities.

00:05:53.977 --> 00:05:55.636
Fresh fruit began coming,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.622
even when in FEMA, they were asking me,

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.035
"José, how are you able to get the food?"

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.599
Simple: by calling and paying and getting.

00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:05.313
(Laughter)

00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:10.043
(Applause)

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.097
We began feeding people in San Juan.

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:17.701
Before you knew, we were feeding the 78
municipalities all across the island.

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:21.272
We needed a plan. One kitchen alone
was not going to feed the island.

00:06:21.296 --> 00:06:26.516
I went to FEMA. They kicked me out
with eight armored guards and AK-47s.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.469
I told them, "I want 18 kitchens
around the island."

00:06:30.493 --> 00:06:34.848
Guess what? Three days ago,
we reached our 18th kitchen

00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:36.023
around Puerto Rico.

00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:40.127
(Applause)

00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:41.897
People began being fed.

00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:43.720
Volunteers kept showing up.

00:06:43.744 --> 00:06:47.910
We never had any system
to deliver the food, people would tell me.

00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:49.561
Sure, we had the system.

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:53.950
The entire island of Puerto Rico
was the perfect delivery system.

00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:56.101
Anybody with a truck wanted to help.

00:06:56.125 --> 00:07:00.494
Anybody going from A to B
was for us the way to be bringing hope

00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:03.097
and a plate and a whole meal to anybody.

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:06.883
We began finding amazing systems
to do these food trucks,

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:08.613
10 amazing food trucks.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:12.884
We began learning not to use
the place that needed the food,

00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:14.161
but the number,

00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.661
the number of the apartment:

00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:21.085
Lolo, a 92-year-old veteran
that was surrounded by water.

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:24.412
We began giving not only hope to people,

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:26.395
but knowing their names,

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.515
checking day after day,

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.512
making sure that those elderly people
will never, ever again feel alone

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:34.126
in a moment of disrepair.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.571
And we began going to the deeper areas,

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:40.825
places that all of a sudden,
the bridges were broken,

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.850
but we had to go, because it was easy
to stay in San Juan.

00:07:43.874 --> 00:07:47.610
We had to go to those places
that actually, they really needed us.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.149
And we kept going,
and people kept waiting for us,

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.676
because they knew
that we will always show up,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.927
because we will never leave them alone.

00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.597
(Applause)

00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.534
The food trucks became our angels,

00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:06.748
and the food trucks kept sending hope,

00:08:06.772 --> 00:08:08.122
but we saw we needed more:

00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:12.241
Vieques and Culebra,
two islands far away from the island --

00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:14.289
somebody had to be feeding them.

00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:17.873
We didn't only bring food and make
a hotel kitchen operation in Vieques

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.664
and bring daily food to Culebra.

00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:22.707
We brought the first
water purification system

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.992
to the island of Vieques,

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:26.937
where we could be filtering
one gallon per minute.

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:29.248
All of a sudden, big problems
become very simple,

00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:31.272
low-hanging fruit solutions,

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:35.645
only by doing, not planning
and meeting in a very big building.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.209
(Laughter)

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:38.932
And then we found creative ways.

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:41.582
We needed helicopters. We asked. We got.

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:44.439
We needed planes. We asked,
we paid, and we got.

00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:48.621
We kept sending food to those places
that really were in need.

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:52.689
And the simple ideas just become powerful.

00:08:52.713 --> 00:08:56.045
Volunteers will go
to the edges of the island.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.477
All of a sudden, it was a movement.

00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:00.121
The teams of World Central Kitchen

00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:05.726
will be received with prayers,
with songs, with claps, with hugs,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.248
with smiles.

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:09.954
We were able to connect
in so many corners.

00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:14.716
When I tell you that even
the National Guard began calling us

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.344
because our national poor guy's guards,

00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:20.606
big heroes in a moment of chaos,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.622
they couldn't get a simple
humble plate of hot food.

00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:28.433
And partnerships show up.

00:09:28.457 --> 00:09:30.045
Mercy Corps,

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.044
HSI from Homeland Security,

00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:36.199
partnerships that they
didn't happen calling the top.

00:09:36.223 --> 00:09:39.230
They happened in the hotel room,
in the middle of the street,

00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:41.350
in the middle of the mountains.

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.419
We saw that by working together,
we can even reach more people.

00:09:45.374 --> 00:09:48.064
Partnerships that happen by logic,

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:53.064
and the urgency of now
is put to the service of the people.

00:09:53.088 --> 00:09:56.712
When we have emergency
relief organizations,

00:09:56.736 --> 00:10:00.704
we cannot be planning about
how to give aid a month from now.

00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:03.236
We have to be ready to start giving help

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.823
the second after something happens.

00:10:08.133 --> 00:10:10.440
And children were fed,

00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:13.076
and all of a sudden, the island,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.141
while still in a very special moment

00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:20.751
where everything is fragile,

00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:22.940
we saw that an NGO like ours --

00:10:22.964 --> 00:10:26.410
we didn't want to break
the private sector --

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:29.863
that already, small restaurants
were being opened,

00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:32.625
that somehow, normalcy,

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.569
whatever normalcy means
today in Puerto Rico, was happening.

00:10:36.593 --> 00:10:38.692
We began trying to be sending the message:

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.828
we need to start moving
away from the places

00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:43.042
that are already stabilized

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:46.327
and keep concentrating in the areas
that really need help.

00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:52.290
(Video): People of Puerto Rico,
two million meals!

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:55.949
José Andrés OK,
let me translate this to you.

00:10:55.973 --> 00:10:58.749
(Laughter)

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.333
Almost 28 days later,

00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:06.048
more than 10 food trucks,

00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:08.369
more than 7,000 volunteers,

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:09.714
18 kitchens ...

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:15.473
we served more than two million meals.

00:11:15.497 --> 00:11:22.497
(Applause)

00:11:25.254 --> 00:11:26.404
(Applause ends)

00:11:26.428 --> 00:11:28.983
And you guys coming here to TED,
you should be proud,

00:11:29.007 --> 00:11:33.111
because we know many of you,
you are part of the change.

00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:37.539
But the change is only going to happen
if after we leave this amazing conference,

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:41.464
we put the amazing ideas
and inspiration that we get,

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:44.429
and we believe that nothing is impossible,

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:48.425
and we put our know-how
to the service of those in need.

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:51.973
I arrived to an island
trying to feed a few people,

00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:54.044
and I saw a big problem,

00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:59.469
and all of a sudden, the people
of Puerto Rico saw the same problem as me,

00:11:59.493 --> 00:12:01.583
and only we did one thing:

00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:03.242
we began cooking.

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:05.941
And so the people of Puerto Rico

00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:09.671
and the chefs of Puerto Rico,
in a moment of disrepair,

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.139
began bringing hope,

00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:13.956
not by meeting,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.131
not by planning,

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:18.987
but with only one simple idea:

00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:22.012
let's start cooking
and let's start feeding

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:23.885
the people of Puerto Rico.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.059
Thank you.

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.206
(Applause)

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.508
Dave Troy: Go back out.

00:12:28.532 --> 00:12:29.532
(Laughter)

00:12:29.556 --> 00:12:30.818
DT: The public loves you.

00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:37.519
(Applause)

00:12:37.543 --> 00:12:39.487
Nate Mook: A couple of quick questions,

00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:42.233
because I think some folks
would be interested to hear.

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.614
So as you said, you came the first time,

00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:47.940
got on the ground,

00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:50.314
went to the government command center,

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:52.361
started to have some meetings with people,

00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.772
and they weren't very receptive.

00:12:55.703 --> 00:12:58.616
José Andrés: This is great.
This is how good my talk was.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.084
(Laughter)

00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:03.124
It's the first talk with a follow-up
in the history of TED.

00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:05.109
I feel so good.

00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:06.458
(Laughter)

00:13:06.482 --> 00:13:08.975
NM: So tell us why,
what were some of the challenges,

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:13.039
and then when you noticed,
they started coming to you to ask you.

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:16.615
JA: We cannot be asking everything
from Red Cross or Salvation Army.

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:20.701
But the idea is, I donated before
to those organizations,

00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:22.679
and they are the big organizations,

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:26.682
and maybe the problem is
that we're expecting too much from them.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:30.869
It's not like they didn't do
what they were supposed to do.

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:35.052
It's that the perception
is that that's what they do.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:40.815
But all of a sudden, you cannot get into
a moment like this and wash your hands,

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:44.124
and you say somebody else
is going to be picking it up.

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:49.854
We had a simple problem
that had a very simple solution.

00:13:50.465 --> 00:13:53.133
This was not a faraway country

00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:54.822
or the Green Zone in Baghdad.

00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:57.339
This was American soil,

00:13:57.363 --> 00:13:59.958
a beautiful place called Puerto Rico,

00:13:59.982 --> 00:14:05.021
with hundreds, thousands of restaurants
and people willing to help,

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.284
but all of a sudden, we had people hungry,

00:14:07.308 --> 00:14:11.558
and we didn't have a plan
how to feed them in the short term.

00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:17.043
So yes, FEMA, to a degree, was thinking
about how to feed the people.

00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:20.171
Red Cross didn't have the right answers,

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:24.917
because Southern Baptist Church,
the biggest food organization in America,

00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:29.251
my heroes, they were never
called to Puerto Rico.

00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:32.657
When you see the Red Cross delivering
food in America after a hurricane,

00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:34.807
it's Southern Baptist Church doing it.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.029
We didn't have that in Puerto Rico.

00:14:38.053 --> 00:14:42.739
Salvation Army came and asked me
for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night

00:14:42.763 --> 00:14:44.863
for a local elderly shop.

00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:47.868
I love to help the Salvation Army,

00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:53.174
but in my world, they are the ones
who are supposed to be helping us

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:55.427
to answer those calls of help.

00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:59.725
Thursday morning
is when I wake up super worried

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:03.376
that actually we didn't have
the plan to feed the island.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.551
And some people will say
maybe you are making the problem

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:08.614
bigger than it was.

00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:12.259
Well, we had hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of organizations

00:15:12.283 --> 00:15:16.099
knocking on our door,
asking for a tray of food,

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:19.160
so if that's not proof
that the need was real ...

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:23.099
We cannot be feeding people
in America anymore with MREs

00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:25.662
or something like you open and, you know,

00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:30.162
I was giving to this little cat
a little bit of those same foods --

00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:31.209
(Laughter)

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:34.217
and then I gave them
the chicken and rice we made,

00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:36.186
and they went for the chicken and rice.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.567
(Laughter)

00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:39.523
(Applause)

00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.278
They don't even eat that themselves.

00:15:41.302 --> 00:15:45.781
We can feed humanity
for a day or two or five,

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:51.123
but those MREs cost, like, 12, 14, 15,
20 dollars to the American taxpayer.

00:15:51.147 --> 00:15:52.860
It's OK for certain moments,

00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:54.242
during battle,

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:58.171
but not to be feeding Americans
for weeks and weeks and weeks,

00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:03.493
when actually, you can be hiring
the local private business community

00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:07.382
to do the same job better,
creating local jobs,

00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:09.684
helping the local economy to come back,

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:13.318
and in the process making sure
that everything was going to go back

00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:15.975
as normal as quick as possible.

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:17.460
That's where we began cooking.

00:16:17.484 --> 00:16:19.323
You were there with me,

00:16:19.347 --> 00:16:23.944
and that's why we spent every single
dollar we had in our credit cards.

00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:27.449
If AmEx is listening to this, please,
a discount would be appreciated.

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:29.965
(Laughter)

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.172
Or Visa.

00:16:31.196 --> 00:16:34.791
NM: So what's the situation now?

00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:36.585
You know, it's been a month.

00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:39.339
You said there's been
some improvements in San Juan

00:16:39.363 --> 00:16:41.362
and focus on the areas outside,

00:16:41.386 --> 00:16:45.473
but obviously there are still
major challenges, and what's next?

00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:50.131
JA: There are. So what's next
is we slowly began going down

00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:52.418
after, more or less, FEMA let us know

00:16:52.442 --> 00:16:54.909
that they thought they had
everything under control

00:16:54.933 --> 00:16:57.640
and we were no longer needed,

00:16:57.664 --> 00:17:00.695
but you only believe everything so much.

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:06.281
We moved from the big place you saw,
60,000 meals a day,

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:09.885
to another one, as big,
but more strategically located,

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:12.194
also cheaper,

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:14.791
where we are going to be making
20-25,000 meals a day,

00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:17.806
and then we are leaving
four, five, six kitchens

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.458
strategically located around the island,

00:17:20.482 --> 00:17:23.911
very high up in the mountains,
in the poor areas.

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.824
We got a lot of data.

00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:28.856
We know who is using SNAPs,
who is using food stamps,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.444
the cards.

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.928
We know who has them
and we know who is using them.

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:38.053
So in the parts of the island
where nobody is using them,

00:17:38.077 --> 00:17:41.840
those are the parts of the island where
we are going to be focusing our efforts.

00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:44.973
So it's amazing how sometimes
simple data can give you a clue

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.781
of who are the people in need.

00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:51.151
So we went to a town called Morovis.

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.327
Beautiful.

00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:55.003
The best chicken restaurant
in the history of mankind.

00:17:55.027 --> 00:17:57.043
You should all travel to Morovis.

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:58.309
DT: Sounds good.

00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:00.857
JA: So I saw the chicken.
We were bringing sandwiches.

00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:03.506
I stopped. I was with
these Homeland Security officers.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.699
We ate the chicken.

00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:09.398
I left to drop these sandwiches
in this other place called San Lorenzo.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.103
San Lorenzo was critical,
because the bridge was broken,

00:18:12.127 --> 00:18:14.185
and so it was an island inside the island,

00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:16.345
a little community surrounded by water.

00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:19.091
Everybody told us,
"It's a disaster down there."

00:18:19.608 --> 00:18:20.948
We dropped the sandwiches.

00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:22.852
I went back to Morovis, and I thought,

00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:25.548
you know, if it's a disaster,
sandwiches is not enough.

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:27.464
I brought 120 chickens,

00:18:27.488 --> 00:18:30.257
with yucca and with rice,

00:18:30.281 --> 00:18:32.624
and we went back to that broken bridge,

00:18:32.648 --> 00:18:35.091
we crossed the river,

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.107
water up to everywhere.

00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:40.520
We arrived with the 120 chickens,

00:18:40.544 --> 00:18:41.798
we dropped the food,

00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:45.377
and the community
were very thankful, but they told us,

00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:47.353
"We're OK, we don't need more food.

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:49.829
We have gas, we have money,

00:18:49.853 --> 00:18:52.123
we have good food and our water is clean.

00:18:52.147 --> 00:18:55.773
Take care of the other communities
around us that are in more need."

00:18:55.797 --> 00:18:58.889
You see, communication is key.

00:18:58.913 --> 00:19:02.873
In these scenarios, we can be
relying on fake news

00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:07.318
or we can be having the real information
that we can make smart decisions

00:19:07.342 --> 00:19:09.904
to really take care of the true issues.

00:19:09.928 --> 00:19:11.269
That's what we are doing.

00:19:11.293 --> 00:19:16.079
(Applause)

00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:19.483
NM: It was an amazing operation,

00:19:19.507 --> 00:19:22.896
and to witness it firsthand
and to play a small role --

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.245
JA: You made it happen.

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:28.118
NM: At its peak, I think
you were up to about 150,000 meals

00:19:28.142 --> 00:19:30.355
per day, across the island,

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:32.308
which is pretty incredible.

00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:35.896
And I think, at the same time,
really sort of setting a model

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.486
for how this can be done,
hopefully, moving forward.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.443
I mean, I think that's one
of the big learnings out of this --

00:19:41.467 --> 00:19:44.510
DT: This is possible.
You know, people can replicate this.

00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:47.422
JA: But I'm going to stop coming
to watch TED Talks,

00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:49.866
because you've got ideas
that anything can happen.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.867
(Laughter)

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:54.759
And then my wife told me,

00:19:54.783 --> 00:19:57.784
"Man, you told me you were going
to cook a thousand meals a day.

00:19:57.808 --> 00:19:59.562
I cannot leave you alone for a day."

00:19:59.596 --> 00:20:02.303
(Laughter)

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:05.463
But I hope that World Central Kitchen --

00:20:05.487 --> 00:20:07.509
you know, one thing we did I didn't say:

00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:09.940
I picked up the phone
and I began calling people,

00:20:09.964 --> 00:20:13.884
people that I thought had expertise
that could help us.

00:20:13.908 --> 00:20:17.648
So I picked up the phone and I called
a company called Bon Appétit, Fedele.

00:20:17.672 --> 00:20:19.912
Bon Appétit's one of
the big catering companies.

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:23.494
They do food for Google and for arenas.

00:20:23.518 --> 00:20:24.933
They're out of California.

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:27.385
They belong to a bigger group
called Compass.

00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:29.956
And I told them, "You know what?

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.146
I need cooks, and I need cooks
that can do volume

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.997
and that can do good, quality volume."

00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.214
In less than 24 hours,
I began getting people and chefs.

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:44.292
At one point, we got 16 of the best chefs
that America can offer.

00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:48.447
You see, America
is an amazing heart country

00:20:48.471 --> 00:20:50.456
that always is sending their best.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.408
What we've been learning over the years

00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:56.352
is that those chefs of America
are going to be playing a role

00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:59.958
in how we are going to be feeding America
and maybe other parts of the world

00:20:59.982 --> 00:21:01.490
in times of need.

00:21:01.514 --> 00:21:02.756
What we need to start

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.467
is bringing the right expertise
where the expertise is needed.

00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:09.157
Sometimes I have a feeling,
like with FEMA,

00:21:09.181 --> 00:21:13.364
we are bringing the wrong expertise
in the areas that it's not even needed.

00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:15.587
The people of FEMA are great people.

00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:17.356
The men and women are smart,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.531
they are prepared,

00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:23.848
but they live under this amazing hierarchy
pyramidal organizational chart

00:21:23.872 --> 00:21:26.725
that everybody falls
out of their own weight.

00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:29.373
We need to be empowering
people to be successful.

00:21:29.397 --> 00:21:32.269
What we did was
a flatter organizational chart

00:21:32.293 --> 00:21:35.000
where everybody was owning the situation

00:21:35.024 --> 00:21:38.819
and we all made quick decisions
to solve the problems on the spot.

00:21:38.843 --> 00:21:41.113
(Applause)

00:21:41.137 --> 00:21:42.303
DT: Absolutely.

00:21:42.327 --> 00:21:43.406
(Applause)

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.445
Another round of applause for José Andrés.

00:21:45.469 --> 00:21:51.705
(Applause) (Cheering)
