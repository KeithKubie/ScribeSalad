my cynical reaction to questions about

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
my cynical reaction to questions about
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.640
my cynical reaction to questions about
consciousness is you tell me what it is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
consciousness is you tell me what it is
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.010
consciousness is you tell me what it is
and I tell you if an elephant has it and

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020
and I tell you if an elephant has it and
 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.500
and I tell you if an elephant has it and
that usually shuts people up because you

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510
that usually shuts people up because you
 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.970
that usually shuts people up because you
will not be able to tell me what it is

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
will not be able to tell me what it is
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220
will not be able to tell me what it is
and how I should measure it that is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
and how I should measure it that is
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.570
and how I should measure it that is
really not a good reaction because I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
really not a good reaction because I
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.700
really not a good reaction because I
actually believe that animals have some

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
actually believe that animals have some
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.040
actually believe that animals have some
level of consciousness so for example

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
level of consciousness so for example
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320
level of consciousness so for example
the approach that I sometimes take is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
the approach that I sometimes take is
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.840
the approach that I sometimes take is
that there are certain things that we

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850
that there are certain things that we
 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.170
that there are certain things that we
humans cannot do without consciousness

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
humans cannot do without consciousness
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.290
humans cannot do without consciousness
if we find these kind of actions also in

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
if we find these kind of actions also in
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.389
if we find these kind of actions also in
other species we must assume that they

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
other species we must assume that they
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.040
other species we must assume that they
also involve consciousness so for

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
also involve consciousness so for
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.189
also involve consciousness so for
example you cannot plan a party for

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199
example you cannot plan a party for
 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.649
example you cannot plan a party for
tomorrow for your friends without

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659
tomorrow for your friends without
 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.919
tomorrow for your friends without
consciously thinking about how much beer

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929
consciously thinking about how much beer
 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.360
consciously thinking about how much beer
you need to what kind of music you're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
you need to what kind of music you're
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459
you need to what kind of music you're
gonna play who's gonna and be invited

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
gonna play who's gonna and be invited
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619
gonna play who's gonna and be invited
that you have to consciously think about

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
that you have to consciously think about
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.259
that you have to consciously think about
the event before you can plan it now we

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
the event before you can plan it now we
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.629
the event before you can plan it now we
have very good evidence that animals can

00:00:59.629 --> 00:00:59.639
have very good evidence that animals can
 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.579
have very good evidence that animals can
plan we have lots of experiments now on

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589
plan we have lots of experiments now on
 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.649
plan we have lots of experiments now on
it and we have nature observations for

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659
it and we have nature observations for
 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.740
it and we have nature observations for
example chimpanzees will collect tools

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750
example chimpanzees will collect tools
 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.350
example chimpanzees will collect tools
on one location and then walk for three

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
on one location and then walk for three
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750
on one location and then walk for three
miles and so then an hour later they're

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
miles and so then an hour later they're
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.430
miles and so then an hour later they're
going to use these tools to fish for

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440
going to use these tools to fish for
 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.160
going to use these tools to fish for
termites or to open a beehive meaning

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
termites or to open a beehive meaning
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690
termites or to open a beehive meaning
that they probably had been planning the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
that they probably had been planning the
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.400
that they probably had been planning the
action and we tested out in the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410
action and we tested out in the
 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.350
action and we tested out in the
laboratory and we have evidence for

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
laboratory and we have evidence for
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.180
laboratory and we have evidence for
planning and birds we are planning in in

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190
planning and birds we are planning in in
 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.710
planning and birds we are planning in in
Apes so if they can plan and we plan

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720
Apes so if they can plan and we plan
 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.150
Apes so if they can plan and we plan
consciously

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160
consciously
 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.470
consciously
it's very hard to imagine that they can

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480
it's very hard to imagine that they can
 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.760
it's very hard to imagine that they can
do these same things that we do

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
do these same things that we do
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.500
do these same things that we do
unconsciously I find it hard to imagine

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510
unconsciously I find it hard to imagine
 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.410
unconsciously I find it hard to imagine
we have other things like thinking back

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
we have other things like thinking back
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.140
we have other things like thinking back
in time thinking back to events that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
in time thinking back to events that
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630
in time thinking back to events that
happened like a year ago can you do that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
happened like a year ago can you do that
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700
happened like a year ago can you do that
we have we have now ways of testing that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
we have we have now ways of testing that
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.250
we have we have now ways of testing that
it's called episodic memory in animals

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260
it's called episodic memory in animals
 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.770
it's called episodic memory in animals
and animals have that capacity you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
and animals have that capacity you
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080
and animals have that capacity you
cannot sing back to a specific event in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
cannot sing back to a specific event in
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880
cannot sing back to a specific event in
time like your let's say your wedding or

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
time like your let's say your wedding or
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.920
time like your let's say your wedding or
whatever it is you cannot sing back to a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
whatever it is you cannot sing back to a
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.750
whatever it is you cannot sing back to a
specific event without consciously

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760
specific event without consciously
 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.730
specific event without consciously
thinking about that and so there are

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
thinking about that and so there are
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530
thinking about that and so there are
certain things that animals do and that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
certain things that animals do and that
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.200
certain things that animals do and that
we have no evidence for that require in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
we have no evidence for that require in
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.870
we have no evidence for that require in
humans consciousness and and I think

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
humans consciousness and and I think
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580
humans consciousness and and I think
that's a good indicator that the animals

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
that's a good indicator that the animals
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.600
that's a good indicator that the animals
must also have that kind of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
must also have that kind of
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.100
must also have that kind of
consciousness

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110
 
 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.349
