00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.450
[BACKGROUND VOICES]

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.920
Lord Peter Levene &gt;&gt; I'm the Chairman of Lloyd's,
and it's great to join everybody. I've been

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.839
asked to try and express my view on this question
of will the world economy turn around in 2009.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.059
I-I've always been an optimist, and would
love to answer 'yes,' but I think the realist

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.750
in me says that it's going to take a while.
I mean, unfortunately we've got these big

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.810
job layoffs being announced all over the world
at the moment-a lot of very hard working people

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.370
losing their jobs. Almost everyone who does-they're
going to have a lot less to spend on other

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.390
things which means that other people are not
going to have the jobs to go around. Somehow

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.610
this is all going to be kickstarted.
And I'm confident it'll happen but as much

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.730
as I'd love to say it's going to be fixed
by the end of this year, I don't think so.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.870
So I am optimistic that we are going to work
very hard to try and get this right as soon

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.530
as we can, and maybe if we're standing here
next year I will have been proved wrong which

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.530
will be great, or at least we'll be on the
way by then. Very good to talk to you.
