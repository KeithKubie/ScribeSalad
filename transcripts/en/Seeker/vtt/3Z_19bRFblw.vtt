00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.960
We were expecting hydrogen cars to take over
the world years ago, but so far, we’ve got

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.900
more Prius’ and Teslas.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.020
What happened to the fanfare for the car that
runs on water, man?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.320
It’s been a while since we’ve heard anything
about hydrogen cars, seemingly because the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.070
market wasn’t ready to look past it’s
disadvantages yet.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.790
Back in 2014, we saw the very first commercial
hydrogen fuel cell vehicle debut with the

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.790
Toyota Mirai.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.770
It was a promising alternative, and cost about
sixty thousand dollars to own.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.369
But the sticker price isn’t the only drawback
for the average driver.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.750
The infrastructure for hydrogen cars just
isn’t there yet.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.809
Fuel stations are still few and far between
and the cost to build more is a challenge

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.710
when very few are buying the cars in the first
place

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.079
Plus, competition is steep.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.409
Why pay for a hydrogen car when you can get
an all electric one for less.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.749
Saving money AND helping the environment.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.179
Ultimately, this is a classic chicken or the
egg situation.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.850
Without infrastructure, the auto industry
won't push hydrogen-fuel cars.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.050
But without consumers asking for hydrogen
vehicles, there's less demand to build the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.159
infrastructure.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.040
It doesn't help that building a new hydrogen
distribution infrastructure, like the fueling

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.480
stations and the hydrogen gas itself, is expensive
and complicated.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.890
The most common way we get hydrogen gas is
to separate it from natural gas, but that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.930
split still causes CO2 emissions.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.090
8.And the alternative?

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.550
Ideally we’d use electricity from solar
and winds farms to split hydrogen from water,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.410
a process called electrolysis, but we don’t
have the infrastructure for that either.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.790
Right now, we’d have to use the electricity
that currently comes from power plants, where

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.790
they still emit CO2.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.040
Both of our current processes defeat the purpose
of this whole carbon-free endeavor and are,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.730
ultimately, another roadblock for the hydrogen
car.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.480
On top of the infrastructure challenges, hydrogen
fuel cells are costly and complex to make.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.700
One fuel cell stack alone can cost Toyota
up to eleven thousand dollars.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.210
The heart of a hydrogen fuel cell is composed
of an anode and cathode, usually mixed with

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.770
small particles of platinum, a thin material
called the polymer electrolyte membrane, and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.190
a gas diffusion layer.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.690
Platinum is a special catalyst for chemical
reactions in the fuel cell.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.630
When hydrogen is pumped through the anode
side, the platinum separates the hydrogen

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.989
into protons and electrons.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.930
Since the negatively charged electrons can’t
transfer through the special membrane like

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.370
the hydrogen ions, they get shuffled out through
a circuit, and that flow of electrons creates

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.050
an electrical current that powers the car
(cool).

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.170
The electrons then come around the other side,
meet their hydrogen partners, throw a little

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.560
oxygen into the mix and all that is expelled
as H20. (even cooler).

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.310
For their hydrogen car, Toyota stacks cells
three hundred seventy layers thick in order

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.170
to get the energy output they’re looking
for.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.019
All these materials, especially the platinum,
amount to a pretty penny, and that’s not

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.519
even even including the materials used for
the storage of hydrogen itself, which can

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.140
also be super pricey.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.400
But we’re getting better at this.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.379
Since 2014 fuels cells have become lighter,
and the platinum catalysts are engineered

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.209
more efficiently, which means they cost less.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.250
Scientists are working on electrolysis systems
to make that carbon emission-free hydrogen

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.870
we need AND there are initiatives globally
to get hydrogen vehicles like taxis, buses,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.900
and trucks, on the roads.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.329
See for the average person, hydrogen cars
might be impractical, but for long distance

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.169
travel with large vehicles; they seem to be
a great fit.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.730
Electric vehicles need multiple hours of charge
time whereas hydrogen vehicles can be fueled

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.559
within minutes and have a range of about 500
kilometers; more than fossil fuel and electric

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:28.559
cars.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.969
That might be the reason why Japan has ordered
100 hydrogen buses for the 2020 games, South

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.040
Korea has commissioned 1,000 buses, and companies
in the U.S. pre-ordered 11,000 commercial

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.150
trucks.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.309
Infrastructure to build hydrogen fueling stations
still has a long way to go.

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.469
The California Fuel Cell Partnership has made
it a goal to put 1,000 hydrogen gas stations

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.680
in California by 2030.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.069
And Japan has similar ambitions.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.470
While they currently have 90 hydrogen fueling
stations, the country aims to have 900 stations

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.680
to service some 800,000 FCVs, buses and forklifts
by 2030

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.959
So, hydrogen cars may not take over the world
yet.

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.900
Realistically, in the future there will probably
be a split between electric, gas, and hydrogen

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.900
cars.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.760
If the industry succeeds, maybe we can make
a bigger difference in our carbon footprint

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.120
and could possibly maybe sort of help us live
here past 2100.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.900
Which is something I would like.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900

And Hydrogen fuel isn’t the only way we
want to power our public transit, Julian explains

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.970
how supercapacitors are being in used in buses
too, check it out here.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.790
Fun Fact: The first hydrogen fuel cell ever
invented was actually in 1839 by Sir William

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.350
Robert Grove, but that one didn’t produce
enough energy to be useful.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.610
Thanks for watching everyone and see you next
time on Seeker.
