00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
Hey guys, welcome back to another day of backyard metal melting.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.920
In yesterday's video, I tried using green sand casting and some styrofoam

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.900
to create a custom copper gear.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.700
The problem is, it didn't turn out as perfectly as I wanted it to,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.120
and I think that's because copper has a really high melting point

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.200
which means it cools down a little bit too quickly.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.900
So for this video I wanted to re-visit that experiment because my OCD is kicking in

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.580
and I want to get one of these things near perfect.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.180
Now I just took my copper gear that I'm not extremely proud of and I cut it in half so that we can re-melt it

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.820
and I also made a trip down to the hardware store and got another $30 of copper tubing

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.360
and this time we just cut it and smashed it flat so we can cram more of it in the crucible.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.740
So believe it or not, this little bit of metal here, you're looking at about $60 of copper.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.740
I also have a little copper nugget left over from the casting we did yesterday,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.280
so I'm going to throw that back in, load this crucible up with copper,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.580
and then prep our sand casting mould for another round.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.760
Okay, we're going to stick this in and light it off.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.960
So update guys, we just got our styrofoam gear set back in the box,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.000
we've got our green sand packed in nice and tight

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.820
and we are ready to cast once again.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.880
Now I think one of the problems we were having yesterday when we were pouring the copper is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.800
we waited too long to get it into the mould.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.920
One very interesting observation we saw was that as we got the crucible close to the styrofoam,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.280
it melted, just from the radiant heat, and that was very cool,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.780
but the solidifying point of copper is very, very high, so even just having the crucible out for 35-40 seconds,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.480
I think made so much of a difference that it wasn't quite as liquid as we needed it to be.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040
So when we try pouring our copper this time, I'm going to try it in two stages.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.480
On the first pass, I'm going to take the crucible out and use the heat to melt down the styrofoam

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.400
and then place the crucible back in the foundry.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.580
I'm going to let it heat up for about another 5-10 minutes so it's ripping hot

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.240
then we're going to pull the crucible back out and pour the copper immediately

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.260
before it has any chance to cool down, and see if we get any better results with that method.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.300
It's nice and toasty –&nbsp;you can see it hasn't quite melted yet.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.460
That's okay.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.200
Because we don't need it molten yet.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.400
We're just going to use this to melt the styrofoam.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.780
All right, now I'm just going to use the heat from the crucible...

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.160
Look at that.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.120
So cool.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.060
Uh oh.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.540
I think my crucible touched the top of the sand.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.540
Oh no, it did!

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.660
Okay, so that was kind of a bummer guys.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.520
I got the crucible too close and I actually made contact with the sand,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.400
which crushed it and kind of ruined my mould

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.960
so I'm going to have to use my other styrofoam gear, and make another one.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.240
It's kind of cool though, look at that.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.280
Just makes like a styrofoam shell.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.000
Solid on this side, shell on this side.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.340
That's kind of interesting.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.440
All right, another fail.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.320
You can see that copper hasn't melted yet, but that's okay

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.400
because we're just going to use that radiant heat to burn out the styrofoam.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.700
Here we go.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.620
Oh that's beautiful.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.700
That looks really cool.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.480
Note to self: Don't get too close!

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.980
[laughter]

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.900
Right, we'll put this thing back in.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.560
Looking nice and molten there in the bottom.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.980
All right, I think that's good enough.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.060
I'm tempted to try and pull the styrofoam out but pretty sure I'm going to wreck the mould if I do,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.020
so I'm just going to leave that last layer on there, fire the copper up until it's ripping hot,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.520
and then pour it right in the centre and let it flow out.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.540
We'll see if that works any better. Fingers crossed!

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.480
In the mean time, we'll cover it up to keep it clean.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.120
Update guys, I think our copper is just about ready.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.400
It's been sitting in the foundry for over 20 minutes and it looks really, really hot.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.580
Our mould is prepped and ready to go, so let's go ahead and turn off the foundry

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.740
and see just how quickly we can actually make the transfer.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.000
All right, time is our enemy.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.180
That looks ripping hot, holy heck.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.020
I'm going to bring this out here,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.380
and, give it a pour. Here we go.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.700
Wow.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.480
That's a lot of copper, but look it just –&nbsp;oh man – it just popped out that chunk of sand.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.280
The sand just came out, that's really discouraging.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.400
What is up with this guys?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.040
What is up with this?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.220
Look, it didn't even complete there either.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.020
And this thing is already cooled down; well, maybe not!

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.040
I could still break that and chunk it.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.360
Pour that back in the foundry then.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.080
Okay, failing all over the place. Why cannot we get this to work?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.260
Well, I guess we just make another one!

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.540
So I have to admit, at this point I'm a little bit lost – burning out the mould didn't seem to make a difference.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.480
If anything, it kind of let the sand go and the sand floated to the top.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.940
So at this point I've just gone ahead and made a new styrofoam gear.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.120
We're going to take the copper out, pour it as fast as we can and hope for the best.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.680
Here we go.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.840
Ooh, that looks toasty.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300
All right, quickly, quickly.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.520
That look a little more –&nbsp;awww haw haw haw haw

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.280
That was definitely more molten, but look, another one of our little sand pieces came out.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.540
I wonder if that's because our green sand isn't quite stable enough?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.800
That is very, very frustrating – I'm getting very upset about that.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.580
Everything about that was beautiful except this little chunk came out.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.960
[laughter]

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.040
That looks pretty cool though, huh?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.160
Oh, that was almost perfect!

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.600
So close!

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.220
So here we are guys, I went ahead and made another one.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.040
I think technically this is our sixth foam gear we've tried casting.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.500
I did something a little bit different this time: I wet the sand down a little bit more.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.100
I'm thinking part of the problem we were having earlier is maybe the sand was little bit too dry,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.560
and that's why it was flaking out, so I added a bit more moisture.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.800
So now this thing's set, we've got a new batch of copper melted, so we're going to give it a pour,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.540
and just hold our breath and hope it works.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.440
If it doesn't, I think we're just going to go with whatever we get, because I'm not doing that again.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.660
Let's rock!

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.340
This is our last chance, so it'd better work.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.140
All right, here it goes...

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.580
Oh...

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.420
See those chunks of sand still popping out?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.640
There it goes: all three of them popped out!

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.820
No way!

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.760
The rest of the gear shape filled up pretty nicely though.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.880
Just take these chunks of sand out...

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.360
That is so bizarre.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.660
Well, that looks a little more molten this time.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.260
Our copper was hot enough to even out.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.180
The only problem was, the little impressions of our sand popped out as well.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.580
Dang it!

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.700
Oh well, I'm going with it. I got a copper gear, I'm keeping it.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.120
We're calling it good.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.100
That's hardened up quite a bit.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.400
Sure does get crispy.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.560
Crispy sand.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.720
Let's see how well that held its shape.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.840
Oh, it actually looks pretty decent on that side.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.760
I like it!

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.480
Oh look, it's actually got the little radioactive indentations there.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.020
Looks like it cooled down a little bit, before it popped off.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.980
Oh look at that!

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.560
Obviously it's still hot.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.540
Let's go ahead and quench it in a bucket of water.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:35.540
[sizzling]

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:51.280
[scraping]

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.060
Well guys, I feel like that took way, way longer than I ever wanted it to take,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.600
and after 6 attempts here I'm starting to lose confidence that casting copper in green sand

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.040
is even a viable idea at all.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.180
I've never actually seen anybody else do it, and that's why I wanted to try it for myself,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.380
but it seems the two problems we keep running into is either the copper cools down too quickly to form a nice mould,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.820
or it destroys the sand and breaks up all the details.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.320
In either case it was worth a shot and we learned something about the process

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.440
and now I've got a $60 copper paperweight I can go throw on my shelf.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.520
If you've ever tried green sand casting with copper and had success with intricate moulds,

I'll be looking for you in the next one.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.600
Talk to you then.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.100
Just a random thought here: we could probably drill these pieces out and clean out with a file.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.160
That might work.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.220
Oops, that's still hot.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.860
Don't put your crucible in water.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.960
