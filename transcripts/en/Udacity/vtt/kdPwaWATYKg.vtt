00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We learned about how maps are being used to localized a moving robot.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here is a laser map being produced--in this case, Stanford's car,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we used particles to localize this robot

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by matching momentary measurements with the previously acquired map.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In doing so we were able to localize Junior in the Darpa Urban Challenge

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with centimeter precision.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A similar method is being used by the Google Street View car,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it is one of the secrets sources of the street-view car.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We heavily rely on a previously built map and a type of localization method

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that you implemented to localize the robot and make it follow known lanes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here is a localization quiz.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We learned about the 3 filters, Kalman filters, histogram filters in our first class,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and particle filters.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Check the corresponding box if the attribute applies.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If any of those is multimodal in their distributions, please check the box,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
exponential in the computation complexity relative to the number of dimensions,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and useful in the context of robotics.

00:01:05.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check none, any, or all of those boxes.
