00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.376
To calculate what direction we're firing, the first thing we need to do in our

00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:06.463
update code, is figure out whether or not the user has pressed one of the fire

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:11.835
keys, fire0 or fire1. Once they have, the next step we need to do is figure out

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.425
what the player's position is in screen space. Our render engine actually

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.875
defines a function called getScreenPosition. Which will actually project a

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:25.350
world space position into the canvas screen coordinates. What this means is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.806
that we'll now have the player's position in the same coordinate space as our

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:33.348
mouse input. Because the two are now in the same space, we simply need to

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:36.932
subtract the mouse input from the player position to give us an unnormalized

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:42.018
vector. A simple normalized will give us a unit length vector. And we can now

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:45.846
use the directional vector as basis to launch our projectile towards the other

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.840
evil, evil robot.
