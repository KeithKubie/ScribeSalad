00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:01.371
- Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:03.655
Today I want to start talking
about irregular verbs.

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:06.870
That is to say verbs
that are a little weird.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.329
You know, we have this
idea of a regular verb

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.021
that we can conjugate in all tenses

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:15.111
and it's just going to behave
in a way that we expect.

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.859
Like for example the verb talk.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.783
So if we take a regular verb

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:22.743
and we put it in the past,
the present, and the future,

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:24.257
this is what it's going to look like.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.683
Present tense,

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:27.846
talk.

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:29.148
Future tense,

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:32.166
will talk.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.591
Past tense,

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.984
talked, with that e-d ending.

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:39.030
But there are plenty of verbs in English,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.743
as you have no doubt discovered,

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:43.655
that don't follow that basic rule.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.578
Present tense is one form of the verb,

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.732
then the past tense is the
present with e-d tacked onto it,

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:53.568
and then the future with
will tacked onto the front.

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.266
And there are plenty of words in English,

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.771
as you have no doubt discovered,

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.349
that don't behave that way at all.

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:01.978
So let's take another --

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.983
let's take an irregular word

00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:07.540
like run.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.258
Present tense,

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:10.548
run.

00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:11.616
Future tense,

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.397
will run.

00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:14.381
Past tense,

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:15.462
ran.

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:17.802
Oh weird.

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.386
Super duper weird.

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:23.560
Now there are a lot of
irregular verbs in English,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.992
but you're listening to someone

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:27.090
with a grammar book the size of a car.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.693
So I think between the two of us

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:30.698
we can figure this out together.

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:31.237
But for now,

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:33.165
let's just focus on four verbs.

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.306
To be, to have, to do, and to say.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.117
So let's take these verbs

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.033
and make them work for a
bunch of different people

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.459
in different times.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:41.562
So in the first person,

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.397
when we're talking about ourselves,

00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:44.789
when I'm talking about myself.

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.020
In the present I would say I am.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.673
I have.

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:54.460
I do.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.837
I say.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:01:58.710
If we're talking about someone else,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.471
in the present in the singular,

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:04.761
we would say she is,

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.569
she has,

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.006
she does,

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.977
and she says.

00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:16.423
So the third person singular is different

00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:19.163
in the way that these
words are pronounced.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.747
So am because of this
entirely different word is,

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:25.183
have doesn't become haves,

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:26.997
it's has,

00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:28.955
and do doesn't become does,

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:30.185
it becomes does,

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.917
we actually change the vowel sound here,

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:34.953
just like say doesn't become says,

00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:37.824
we don't say she says in
standard American English,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.563
we say she says.

00:02:40.563 --> 00:02:42.163
In the present tense,

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:46.645
we are, we have, we do, we say.

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:48.237
And in the past tense in the first person,

00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:50.987
these four verbs form the following:

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.083
I was,

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.247
I had,

00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:58.414
I did,

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.274
and I said.

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:03.028
And in the plural past it was

00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:06.210
we were,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.330
we had,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.130
we did,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.400
and we said.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.607
These four verbs are some of
the strangest ones in English,

00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:18.656
but they're the most important.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.590
In another video,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.445
I'm going to go through
some broad rules that govern

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:25.625
the rest of the irregular
verbs in English.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.763
You can learn anything.

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:31.763
David, out!
