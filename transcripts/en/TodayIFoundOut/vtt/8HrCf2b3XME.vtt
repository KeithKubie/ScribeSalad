00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.229
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:07.600
In the video today, we're looking at how clownfish
managed to breed, despite that they're all

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.350
born male.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.170
Let's get started.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.340
Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, are
sequential hermaphrodites that first develop

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.340
into males.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.160
In fact, they live in regimented schools made
up of all males and just one female- the lone

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.650
female being the dominant and generally the
largest fish in a given group.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.230
The second in command of the school is usually
the largest, and most aggressive, male of

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
the group.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.700
Due to his dominance of the other males, he'll
tend to ensure they stay small via taking

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.140
the best food opportunities for himself and
the like.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.309
Besides the perks of more food, he's also
the only one that gets to breed with the female.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.089
During breeding, the female will lay sometimes
thousands of eggs, depending on the species

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.249
and her size, usually on a pre-cleaned rock
or coral close to the anemone she lives in.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.780
After the eggs are laid, the male will go
along and fertilize them.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.120
From here, if a given egg is poor quality,
whether damaged (i.e.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.629
Nemo) or it becomes infected by a fungus or
the like, the male will typically eat the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.629
egg.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.809
Likewise, if the egg is infertile, or if the
clownfish is an inexperienced breeder or stressed,

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.640
he may also simply eat the eggs.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.630
Otherwise, the male, and rarely the female,
will guard the fish for the 6-10 days it takes

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.060
to hatch, as well as regularly fan them, which
increases the chances of the eggs successfully

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.060
developing.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.149
After the eggs hatch, the parent's job is
done and they have nothing to do with the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.640
baby fish, who ascend to the surface and feed
on plankton until maturation.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.609
If the female dies, the dominate male will
get first choice of food and begin to gain

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.270
weight, ultimately becoming female.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.820
She will then choose a breeding partner among
the available males, which is usually the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.110
largest and most aggressive male available.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.990
At the same time, everyone else moves up one
in the pecking order.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.351
The two will pair off and breed together until
something happens to one or the other, at

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.950
which point the cycle begins again.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.530
It is thought that this peculiar ability to
change sex developed because, unlike many

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.659
other types of fish, clownfish almost never
stray very far away from their homes in sea

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.189
anemones, which they form a symbiotic relationship
with.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.659
Thus, if not for their ability to adapt to
potentially limited mating partners in their

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.460
local area, they may not get a chance to breed
at all.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.600
And while we're on the topic of Finding Nemo
related facts, you might be interested to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.439
know that whales do not blow water out of
their blowholes.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.540
Further, the whale’s trachea doesn’t connect
to the esophagus of the whale; so when Dory

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.240
and Marlin went down the whale’s throat,
in real life, they’d have simply been eaten.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.970
You might at this point be wondering then
why it looks like whales do blow water out.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.480
We've covered this in great detail in this
video, but briefly, when the whale resurfaces,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.610
they have to release the used up air back
into the atmosphere just like all other mammals

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.610
do.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.570
This does result in a spout, but it isn’t
ocean water.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.970
The air inside the whale is typically quite
warm from the whale’s body heat.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.940
When it’s exhaled, it meets the much cooler
temperature of the air outside and immediately

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.160
condenses, making it look like a spout of
water.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.780
(This air is also often mixed with mucus —it
is a nose, after all!)

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.290
Another interesting thing to note is that,
as a rule, baleen whales—those whales who

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.910
don’t have teeth, but rather have baleen
plates to filter food out of the water—

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.320
like the one depicted on Finding Nemo, have
two blowholes, while toothed whales have just

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320
one.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.700
Types of baleen whales include the blue, gray,
and humpback whales, the latter of which was

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.650
the one depicted in Finding Nemo, even though
it was shown with just one blowhole.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.120
Another whale of an error in Finding Nemo
is when they depict the humpback whale as

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.700
having a uvula- whales don’t have those.
