00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.146
Here's a picture of the teapot with the lid off. You can see the inside of the

00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:08.119
teapot. What's odd here is that the outside and inside surfaces have the same

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.804
lighting. This is because the same normals are used to calculate both the inside

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:16.398
and outside surfaces. That is, all the normals point outwards. Regardless of

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:20.522
whether we're looking at the inside or outside. This is certainly not how the

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:24.236
real world works. I call this the paper lantern effect, where the surface is

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.778
sort of like a paper lantern, looking the same on both sides. However, if you

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.284
think about it, the shading here is really not like anything in the real world.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:35.680
For example, if we put a light inside this lantern all of the surfaces would be

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.489
dark. This is because they're normals all point away from the light. Say we want

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.620
to fix this problem and have the surface be double-sided? Which of the following

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.122
fixes will work? First if the normal is facing away from the light, don't render

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:52.645
diffuse and specular, render the model twice. Once with backface culling on.

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:57.106
Once with frontface culling on and flipping each shade normal direction. Make

00:00:57.106 --> 00:01:01.591
and also render a second set of triangles in the same locations, but with their

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.890
normals reversed. Do not cull. Put a second light opposite the first light,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.773
pointing in the opposite direction.
