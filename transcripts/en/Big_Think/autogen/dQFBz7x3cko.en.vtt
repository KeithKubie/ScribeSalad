you want to think about where the
funding comes for our research it comes

obligation to communicate science to the
public outreach I think should happen at

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020
public outreach I think should happen at

every level I think that working
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.290
every level I think that working
scientists should be interfacing with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
scientists should be interfacing with
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.770

high schools for example going into to
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.040
high schools for example going into to
high school biology class rooms

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050

outreach program something they call the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
outreach program something they call the
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160
outreach program something they call the
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.619
DNA Learning Center and it's designed to
bring middle school students high school

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
bring middle school students high school
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.280
bring middle school students high school
students into laboratories and expose

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
students into laboratories and expose
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.799
students into laboratories and expose
them to laboratory science I think it's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
them to laboratory science I think it's
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.090
them to laboratory science I think it's
our obligation as scientists to to reach

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
our obligation as scientists to to reach
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.620
our obligation as scientists to to reach
out to the public in the form of public

out to the public in the form of public
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.670
out to the public in the form of public
lecture series we also have a strong

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
lecture series we also have a strong
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560
lecture series we also have a strong
public lecture program at the laboratory

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
public lecture program at the laboratory
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.209
public lecture program at the laboratory
I participate in it I know that that

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219
I participate in it I know that that
 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.440
I participate in it I know that that
many of the other investigators that the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
many of the other investigators that the
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.990
many of the other investigators that the
lab participate in it and I think that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
lab participate in it and I think that
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109
lab participate in it and I think that
that the public has to understand

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
that the public has to understand
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.779
that the public has to understand
science not only because they pay for it

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789
science not only because they pay for it
 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.590
science not only because they pay for it
but because science is increasingly a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
but because science is increasingly a
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.770
but because science is increasingly a
part of their everyday life and to go

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
part of their everyday life and to go
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.310
part of their everyday life and to go

back to the to the discussion of
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.669
back to the to the discussion of
sequencing and bioethics a time will

sequencing and bioethics a time will
come in the not-too-distant future when

come in the not-too-distant future when
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.529
come in the not-too-distant future when
you walk into a doctor's office and they

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539
you walk into a doctor's office and they
 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.389
you walk into a doctor's office and they
sequence at least part of your genome

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
sequence at least part of your genome
