00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.419
Human DNA consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes
with over 3 billion nitrogenous base pairs.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.500
Surely we don’t need all that to function
right, I mean, how hard can it be?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.100
Hey there peoples, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.749
I’m sure what I’m about to say is review
for many of you but just to make sure everyone’s

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.910
on the same page I’ll reiterate: you need
DNA.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.060
Red blood cells being the exception, all the
cells in your body have it.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.150
For most of those cells you have 23 pairs
of long DNA sequences called chromosomes.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.190
The DNA is structured like a spirally ladder
and the rungs of these ladders are the nitrogenous

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.850
base pairs Adenine and Thymine, and Guanine
and Cytosine.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.739
You repeat and rearrange those 4 bases enough
and bingo, you got yourself the blueprint

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.390
to build a human being.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.390
Or a potato.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.750
How you arrange them is key.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.879
Ok, everybody up to speed?

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.879
Great.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.380
So just how many base pairs do you need?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.780
For a human, not a potato.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.059
When we examine our 23 chromosomes it would
seem the answer is a little more than 3 billion.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.660
Three billion ATGCs to make a Steve.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.920
A potato only has only 840 million base pairs
by comparison, and that makes sense right?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.770
Steve is a pretty complex guy, certainly more
so than a potato.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.750
Though interestingly the potato has 24 pairs
of chromosomes to our 23, they’re all just

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.750
a lot shorter.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.560
But don’t be mislead into thinking that
more DNA = more awesomeness.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.270
An organism with a genome 50 times bigger
than ours isn’t going to necessarily be

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.670
a telepath or have laser vision or the power
to control magnetic fields or an increased

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.420
healing factor.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.909
It could be something as simple as a flower.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:31.909
Actually it is.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.350
At over 150 billion base pairs in length,
the flower Paris japonica is the largest genome

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.009
ever accurately measured.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.399
The ameboid Polychaos dubium was estimated
to be even bigger, at 670 billion base pairs,

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.420
but it’s claim to the throne is disputed
because the techniques used to measure genome

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.670
size in the 60s have since proven flawed.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.450
It’s not the size of the DNA, it’s how
you use it.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.740
At the other end of the spectrum there are
bacteria with genomes that don’t even break

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.060
a million base pairs.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.539
Nasuia deltocephalinicola has the smallest
genome ever discovered, measuring in at just

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.400
112 thousand base pairs, though it needs to
live in symbiosis with another bacterium to

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400
survive.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.120
Nanoarchaeum equitans gets by with a scant
490 thousand base pairs encoding 540 genes,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.830
it’s the smallest independent cellular unit
discovered yet.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.340
Scientists recently synthesized a minimalist
genome of just 530 thousand base pairs that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.670
encode just 473 genes by whittling away 70
thousand base pairs of the already diminutive

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.370
Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.840
That’s right, organisms can live without
all their DNA.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.670
In fact it’s estimated that you’re only
using about 8% of your genome.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.030
1% of it is coding proteins, 7% is regulating
when to use that first 1%, and the remaining

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.480
92% is just junk as far as we can tell.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.060
That number is disputed, and by a different
measurement and the loosest definitions as

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.400
much as 80% of our DNA may serve some function,
but that still means 60 million base pairs

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.640
are just along for the ride.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.250
Evolution provides a good explanation for
why we’re carrying around all this extra

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.739
baggage: becoming human was a long and messy
path.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.080
Along the way some DNA is going to mutate
into disuse but keeping it around won’t

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.379
be too much of a hassle.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.269
In fact having all that extra ATGC to work
with means mutations are less likely to occur

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.799
on an essential gene and therefore won’t
be catastrophic.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.220
It may actually be beneficial, giving random
chance the opportunity to mutate junk DNA*

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.239
into something useful and giving an organism
an edge.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.060
As a bonus the process of evolution explains
why a flower can have 50 times more DNA than

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.060
we do.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.370
Just how much of your DNA is junk is still
up for debate.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.659
It may actually be used to make important
things, like your face.

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:46.620
Anthony Carboni explains here.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:04:03.159
Are you surprised about your genome being
bloated or is it no big deal to you?
