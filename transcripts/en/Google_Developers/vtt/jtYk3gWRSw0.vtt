00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.389
Alibaba`s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.477
Alibaba's Xianyu has 200 million registered users,
over 50 million of whom are using Flutter.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.438
Xianyu's goal is to ensure that the value
of idle resources is maximized

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.983
creating a new lifestyle for the younger generation.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.570
For example, when a vendor wants to sell
their collection of accessories for pets, 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.365
they should be able to post a well-designed
ad as quickly as possible.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.868
And when a customer wants to buy something for their pet,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.120
all they need is a swipe on the app.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.375
We asked ourselves how can we create apps
that are easy to navigate for our users.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:46.254
How can we ensure that our apps have beautiful graphics
and still load fast?

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.758
How can we make our apps accessible
to as many users as possible?

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.136
And more importantly, how can we do all of this fast?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:58.058
So we started looking for a solution&nbsp;and came across
Flutter by Google.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:05.398
We were immediately intrigued by Flutter's user
experience including high FPS and smooth UI.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:10.820
But above all, it was an incredible time-saver.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:16.117
All developers know that in order to reach the biggest
amount of users,

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:22.916
you need to build apps for iOS and Android,
maintaining two codebases,

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.169
which will slow you down.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.590
Flutter, however, allows us to use a single codebase,

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.094
which makes maintenance of our apps so much better.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:40.058
It sounded like Flutter was a perfect fit, so we gave it a go.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:47.273
We started implementing Flutter features incrementally,
incorporating them with our apps.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:55.698
The ItemDetail page, the most important, complex and
frequently visited section,

00:01:55.698 --> 00:02:01.704
is run through a single codebase on
Android and iOS using Flutter.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.126
During the last months, Flutter has helped us tremendously.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:10.088
It is super fast because it is a fully native app.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:14.926
The expressive UI widgets allow us to make sleek UI.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.139
Finally, it significantly reduces the workload
when we implement new features.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.767
Now we are highly efficient when it comes to
designing iOS and Android apps.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:30.108
The ItemPost page, a cornerstone of Xianyu's app,
was also developed through Flutter.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:35.905
We are excited to build many more features using Flutter
to move Alibaba's Xianyu forward.
