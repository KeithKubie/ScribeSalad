00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:01.606
&gt;&gt;Students: Ready?

00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.766
Three, two, one, go!

00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:05.946
&gt;&gt;Mary Krenke: I feel like
I have seen a difference.

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:09.256
The kids are more confident
in using the technology

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:12.646
when they bring it back
into the classroom.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:13.976
The students can see it
all relates together.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.726
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: The way we use
our technology is very purposeful.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:30.376
We try to make that integrated
as much as possible

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:35.556
so that everything students do
is pushing them towards a goal.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:40.576
&gt;&gt;Brooklyn: We learn how to, like,
edit pictures and make slides.

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:44.336
&gt;&gt;Lily: And if we want to make,
like, a presentation or a doc,

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:48.466
then we hit the apps button.

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:51.416
&gt;&gt;Michael: Well, we get
to videotape ourselves

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.036
on green screen or use "wevideo".

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.426
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: Last
year was the first year

00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:00.746
that we actually had a technology
teacher in the building and at

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:05.666
that time our focus was on
exposing children to different apps,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.196
but it was still a little
bit in isolation

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:10.976
from what the teaching
was in the classroom.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.576
&gt;&gt;Jeff Dahl: What we've been working
on this year in the second year

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.066
of the program is we've been
trying to integrate more

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.836
of the classroom curriculum
into our tech time.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:25.726
So, I've been meeting with grade-level
representatives and talking to them

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:27.356
about what are they covering in class.

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:28.926
&gt;&gt;Mary Krenke: In fact,
we have a Google doc

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:31.236
that it basically is
just a communication way

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.706
of "This is what's coming up in our
curriculum and what can you do?"

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:38.576
or "Can we have some ideas that maybe
you're able to add on in technology?"

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:41.766
&gt;&gt;Beth Rickerman: For example, if
they're working on stories in writing,

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:47.016
to have that flow into, you know,
his technology time as well.

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.436
&gt;&gt;Jeff Dahl: Okay, we're
gonna start a new project.

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:51.156
We're gonna start working
on scar stories.

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:55.546
It's non-fiction, it really happened,
and it's story that belongs to you.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.586
A narrative is a story, a
personal narrative, your story.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:04.126
We want sensory words, feelings,
touches, tastes, smells, sounds.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.066
Action is key!

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.136
And then the "So what?

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:08.636
Who cares?"

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:09.516
You crashed your bike; so what?

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:11.516
What did you learn from it?

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:14.646
&gt;&gt;When they have a contextual
tie to what they're doing

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.686
in class I think it lends validity.

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:20.326
I can take those opportunities,
teach them a tool,

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.976
and hit content information
at the same time.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:26.156
&gt;&gt;Okay, are you doing green screen?

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:26.446
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:26.926
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.876
Come on. Let's do it.

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:29.746
&gt;&gt;That's good.

00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:30.606
Perfect.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:34.606
&gt;&gt;Cassidy: When I was
little, like three or two,

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:38.126
I hit my eye on something
sharp in my kitchen.

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.636
I had to go to the emergency
room at the hospital.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.576
&gt;&gt;Jeff Dahl: We purchased a green
screen set this year and we're looking

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.696
at color keying technology in some

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:48.886
of the video apps that
are available online.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:50.146
&gt;&gt;Great job.

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:51.056
Nice job, Cass.

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:53.976
Hey, start thinking about what are
the images you want behind you.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.256
&gt;&gt;Cassidy: The green screen's
gonna change my background.

00:02:57.436 --> 00:03:00.956
It makes it look a little bit
more real and interesting.

00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:06.026
&gt;&gt;Brooklyn: We're making slides of
different pictures of what happened

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:09.856
and then you can either edit your
face in by doing the green screen

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:13.196
or you can just, like, voice do it
so you don't have your face on it.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:14.026
&gt;&gt;You're gonna go voiceover?

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:14.696
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.186
&gt;&gt;Yeah. What was the accident?

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.896
Think of one that really stands
out, because those are the ones

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:21.766
that you're really gonna
have good details on.

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:26.606
&gt;&gt;Mallory: Well, I was in a car and
there was a motorcycle behind us

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.326
and then there was a car with a trailer.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.046
Then the trailer got
out of control and..

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:35.976
crash! There was glass everywhere
and it scratched me a lot.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:38.986
&gt;&gt;Jeff Dahl: That's awesome action.

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:40.976
Go into presentation mode
and see what it looks like.

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:46.166
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: It's not just about
substituting programming for something

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.496
that we could've done in writing.

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:51.186
It's to be able to give
students additional ways

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:55.676
to express their learning, to
go out and find information,

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:57.976
pull that together, use their own voice.

00:03:59.196 --> 00:03:59.846
&gt;&gt;Jeff Dahl: You're the author,

00:03:59.986 --> 00:04:01.976
if you don't like the way
it looks, put it back.

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.776
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: We want all of
our students to learn the content,

00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:11.526
of course, but we want our
student to learn how to be learners

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:13.026
for the rest of their lives.

00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:18.006
That ownership just pushes
them to work even harder

00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:20.426
to produce that good end product.
