00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
 

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's say you have a
six by six grid.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.170
And that's what I've
drawn right here.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.980
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.720
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.970
And you were to start in
the top left corner.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.410
So, you were to start
right here.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.720
And your goal is to get to
the bottom right corner.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.990
You want to get right there,
where the star is.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.690
And you can only move
in two ways.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.640
You can only move
to the right.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.760
Or you can only move down.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.420
You can't move diagonally.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.910
You can't move up.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.500
You can't move to the left.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.355
So in every step, you can't
move diagonally.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.020
And every step will get
you a little bit

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.110
closer to this star.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.360
So you can't have
backward moves.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.770
And my question to you is, how
many different ways are there

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.750
to get from here to here?

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.230
That's the problem.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.780
So you can pause it now
and try to solve it.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.400
And I'll try-- when you unpause
it --slowly work to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.970
the solution.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.920
And you can pause it anywhere.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180
You can kind of view all the
intermediary steps as hints.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.400
So the way to think
about it is, well

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.640
let's do the easy ones.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.550
Let's figure out how many ways
can I go from here to each

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.070
intermediate cell, and maybe
that'll help us to figure out

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.020
how many ways can we get
to this end point.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.540
So let me pick a
suitable color.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.180
How many ways can I get from
this starting point to this

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.720
cell right there?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.010
I can only go one way, right?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.220
I can only go from here,
straight to the right.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.110
So there's only one way.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740
Let me write that right there.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.150
One way to get there.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.620
And how many ways can I get
to this cell right here?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.610
There's only one way.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.210
I can only go straight down.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.000
Remember, I can't go
to the right, down,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.900
and then the left.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.100
Because left is not allowed.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.380
Every step has to give me some
progress to my goal.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.190
So it looks like we've made
a little bit of progress.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.210
So how many ways can I get
to this cell right here?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.060
I could go to the right here.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.580
And then I could go one more
step to the right.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.860
And that's pretty much
the only way I

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.480
can get there, right?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.060
If I go down, I can't
go back up.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510
So there's only one
way to go there.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.400
By the same logic, only
one way to go there.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.280
Just straight out.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.270
One way to go there.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.530
One way to go there.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.710
Similarly, you can kind of
view these as symmetric.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.070
I mean, when you go straight to
the right, this is if you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.220
go straight down.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680
So this is one way.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.870
Just straight all the way down.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.550
One way.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.050
One way.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.080
One way.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.470
Fair enough.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.380
Now let's do a slightly
more interesting cell.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.820
How many ways are there to get
to this cell right here?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.930
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.370
Well, this first time,
let's draw it out.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.920
We could either go down
and to the right.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.310
And we could go right
and down.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.350
Right, so there's two ways
to get to this cell.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.990
That's fair enough.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.870
And this was easy to do to work
out all the ways, because

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.860
there aren't that many.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.130
But you might already see
an interesting pattern.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.400
If I have a cell here.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.055
Let me draw a couple of cells.

00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:53.546
 

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:57.200
Let me draw it like that.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.590
And draw it like that.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.970
And let's just say this is some
arbitrary cell someplace

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.430
in this grid.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.010
It doesn't even have to
be a six by six grid.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.120
It can be an n by n grid.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.880
We could do this problem
with 100 by 100.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.670
But then the video would take
long to do all of the math.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.210
But let's say I want to figure
out how many ways can I get to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.740
this cell right here?

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.550
And let's say I know that
there are n ways

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.730
to get to this cell.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.300
And m ways-- not n --m ways
to get to that cell.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.000
So how many ways can
I get there?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.200
Well the only way to get to this
cell-- and I'll do it in

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.870
another color --the only way to
get to this cell, based on

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.470
the rules I gave you, is either
to go straight down or

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.320
go straight to the right.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.575
So you can either go from this
cell, straight down.

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:43.080
Or you can go from this cell
and straight to the right.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.070
So how many total ways can
you get to this cell?

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.960
Well the only ways you could
have gotten to this cell is by

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.410
going down from here.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.420
But there was n ways you could
have gotten there.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.450
So there's n total ways that
you could get to this cell,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.950
and then go to this cell.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.650
And then there's m ways that
you could get to this cell,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.970
and then go to this cell.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.260
So this cell-- or this box --I
keep using the word cell,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.410
maybe because my brain
is fixated on Excel.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.850
There are n plus m ways
to get to it.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.470
And hopefully you understand
that intuition.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.670
Because there's two ways to
get to this cell directly,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.940
from that one and
from that one.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.000
And I'm saying that there's
n ways to get there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.640
So of all of the ways to get
here, there's n ways to get

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.710
here before that.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.100
And same logic for that.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.210
And you saw that right here.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.230
With the two, is one plus one.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.430
So there's two ways
to get there.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.070
And let's see if that logic
holds one more time.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.280
Just because, I don't want
you to just take this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.860
as a leap of faith.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.110
It should make sense to you.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.740
So how many ways are
there to get here?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.620
So based on what I just told
you, I should just be able to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.330
add two plus one,
and say three.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.120
But let's see if
that works out.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.060
So I could go all the
way to the right.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.160
That's one.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.990
I could go two.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.850
Then I could go down
and that way.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.550
Three.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.460
And notice, out of all of the
three ways to get here, one of

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.980
them comes from this cell.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.720
And two of them comes
from this cell.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.410
So that makes sense,
relative to the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.390
intuition I just gave you.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.415
So let's just fill
out this box.

00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:13.580
Let's just fill out the box.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.030
This is going to be one plus
two is three as well.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.530
Let's fill out-- let me switch
colors just to make it

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.640
interesting.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.640
This is one plus
three is four.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.840
Three plus three is six.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.640
Three plus one is four.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.400
And you can kind of see a
symmetry along this diagonal.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.710
Right?

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.700
There's a three and a three.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.130
A four and a four.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.790
And if you've seen the videos
on the binomia coefficients,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.900
or Pascal's triangle, you should
hopefully start seeing

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.400
a pattern, or some recognizable
numbers here.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.720
So what's this?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.810
This is five.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.880
And this square has all sorts
of neat things here.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.630
You have all ones.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.960
And you have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.790
Well, six right?

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.570
One plus five.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.030
Let's see, four, five, six.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.710
Six plus four is 10.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.100
Six plus four is 10.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.940
10 plus five is 15.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.140
15 plus six is 21.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.130
10 plus 10 is 20.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.900
10 plus five is 15.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.440
21.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.110
See, this is 35.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.810
35.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.990
70.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.240
35 plus 21 is 56.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.490
35 plus 21 is 56.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:31.030
56 plus 70 is 126.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.160
And then 126 plus 126 is 252.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.970
So let me do that in
a special color.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.260
There's 200, right?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.970
yeah, 252 ways from getting
from there to there.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.430
And that was just a neat kind
of pattern problem, to

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.180
understand this.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.030
And you could just
fill it out.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.485
And you can actually do
this for any n by m.

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:49.710
It doesn't even have
to be n by m.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.290
You could figure out, I could
have said the problem, how

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.880
many ways are there to
get to this square?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.740
And you would have solved it.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.770
Once you see that pattern, you
can just do simple addition

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.700
and figure it out.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.820
To do it by hand, to figure out
the 252 ways of getting

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.090
there would have taken
you forever.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.940
It would have wasted
all of your time.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.150
But there's something
interesting here.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.240
If you did watch the video on
binomial coefficients, you'll

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.700
recognize that these are the
binomial coefficients.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.860
Actually let me draw something
for you and maybe you'll

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.080
recognize it there.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.940
And this is all bonus relative
to the problem.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.110
You have now solved it.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.180
If your whole goal was just to
solve this problem, and not to

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.090
see how it connects to other
mathematics, then you can stop

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.750
watching it now.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.130
But now I'll show you something
neat about it.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.390
So, if you wanted to figure out
x plus y to the nth power.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.240
And we do this a lot in the
videos on Pascal's triangle

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.420
and binomial coefficients.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.240
But I want to show you it's
the same exact thing here.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.620
This might actually be even an
easier way for you to do it,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.170
than using Pascal's triangle.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.270
Although it's essentially
the same thing.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:08:01.730
If you write one, x, x, x
squared, x to the third, x to

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.100
the fourth, x to the fifth.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.430
These are supposed to go
on top of the square.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.170
But I realize I was running
out of space.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:13.330
You write one and y, y squared,
y to the third, y to

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.630
the fourth, y to the fifth.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:22.460
And if I were to say, given
this, what is x plus y, I

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.820
don't know, to the
fourth power?

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.280
So what you can do is, you say
OK, well, x plus y to the

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.380
fourth is going to be, you know,
x to the fourth plus

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.150
something, something, something,
a bunch of terms,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.650
all the way to y to
the fourth, and

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.640
everything in between.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.409
So as you go here, where you
say, x to the fourth all the

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.730
way down to y to the fourth.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.750
So it'll be this diagonal
right here.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.580
So let me draw this diagonal.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.630
So this diagonal right here.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.990
And these will essentially tell
you to the coefficients.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.530
And not only will it tell
you the coefficients.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.430
It will tell you the mix
of the coefficients.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.540
So what do I mean by that?

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.230
So let me erase some
stuff here.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.720
This is all bonus to
the actual problem.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.140
We've solved the problem.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.520
So I can erase all of this.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.580
So we want to figure out
x plus y to the fourth.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.910
All we have to do-- and I'll
leave you the play with this

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.600
cube a little bit more just to
see all the patterns in it and

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.560
what do the numbers do along
each row and each column and

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.740
each diagonal?

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.240
But if you want to figure out
x plus y to the fourth, or

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.050
actually just this is
x to the fourth.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.670
Or you could say one
x to the fourth.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.320
One x to the fourth times one,
which is just one x to the

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:41.030
fourth, plus four x to
the third, times y.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.260
Right?

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.430
That's just this one
right there.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.015
Then you say, plus six
x squared y squared.

00:09:48.015 --> 00:09:51.110
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:57.910
And then we're at plus four
x y to the third.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.910
And then finally plus one
y to the fourth times

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.670
just a one or an x.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.000
And you might say, that's
amazing Sal.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.060
How did that work?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.640
And the way to think about it
is, when you multiply this x

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.410
plus y to the fourth-- and I
encourage you to try it if

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.210
you're bored one day --there's
actually six ways to get an x

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.690
squared y squared term.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.240
You'll see that when you
multiply it all out.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.710
And we did that in kind of the
intuition behind the binomial

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.760
theorem videos.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.610
But there's six ways to get
there, which is the exact same

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.890
problem as the brain teaser
that I gave you before.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.820
How many ways can you
get to this square?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.060
Well, we figured out
there are six ways.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.880
Anyway hope that you enjoyed
that a little bit.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.380
