Okay. The answer is: q=on &amp; r=on

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because those two checkboxes were checked "on"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the third one, "s", wasn't checked at all.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's go ahead and check this out on the browser, for real.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here is our form--just how we left it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've got our first two checkboxes checked.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And when I click Submit, we see in the URL:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
q=on&amp;r=n.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Simple enough. Cool.
