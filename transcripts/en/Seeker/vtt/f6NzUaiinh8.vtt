00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.540
Hunting down gravitational waves is one of
the most challenging engineering endeavors

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.220
of the 21st century -- and now physicists
are planning on launching that hunt into space!

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.480
Hello!

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.940
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I’m here to quickly talk about

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.770
another nugget of gravitational wave coolness.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.289
If you’re familiar with my videos on Discovery
News, you’ll know that I LOVE gravitational

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.640
waves, or more precisely, I LOVE the prospect
of gravitational wave astronomy.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.210
Gravitational waves are basically ripples
in spacetime.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.370
Imagine the ripples across the surface of
a pond after dropping a pebble in the water

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.820
-- these ripples carry energy away from the
*plop* in the surface.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.930
If we wanted to, we could analyze the amplitude,
speed and direction of these ripples to determine

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.680
the mass of the pebble that fell in and gain
some useful information about the water they’re

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.719
propagating through.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.360
This model is quite useful for us to imagine
how gravitational waves work; if we could

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.239
detect and measure them, we could reveal some
incredible science about the objects creating

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.500
the spacetime ripples.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.350
Gravitational waves were first theorized by
Einstein nearly 100 years ago.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.579
We have strong indirect evidence that they’re
out there, but directly detecting them has

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.750
been very difficult.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.340
However we’re slowly closing in.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.689
As I’ve explained in a previous video, the
US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.570
Observatory (LIGO) detector has recently been
upgraded to begin the most precise search

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.209
for gravitational waves ever.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:18.389
There are high hopes that through new noise-reduction
and laser techniques that gravitational waves

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.829
will not only be identified, but will also
be used to see energetic events such as black

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.740
hole and neutron star collisions, supernovas
and, potentially, the effects of dark matter.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.609
Basically, once this is achieved, the era
of gravitational wave astronomy will have

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:32.609
begun.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.009
But there’s an even more advanced detector
planned that could revolutionize our view

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.750
of the cosmos, and it involves sending a gravitational
wave detector into SPACE, far from all the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.859
noise and commotion we have down here on Earth.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.119
Europe’s Evolved Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (eLISA) is tentatively scheduled to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.020
be launched into Sun-orbit in 2034 and will
consist of 3 spacecraft.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.170
The 3 probes will form the points of a triangle
spaced millions of miles apart, setting up

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.060
the mother of all laser interferometers.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.469
Laser interferometry is perfect for measuring
extremely tiny fluctuations in distance, a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.239
necessity for detecting faint gravitational
wave signals.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.709
As eLISA will be in space, this detector will
be even more sensitive to gravitational waves

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.040
than LIGO, revealing energetic events in far
off galaxies.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.069
But 2034 is a long time to wait -- why is
it going to take this long to launch the next

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.150
big thing in the gravitational wave hunt?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.200
In short, the technology isn’t there yet
and the final design of eLISA isn’t close

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
to being finalized.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.989
But later this year, the first component of
eLISA will be launched to test some key technologies.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.599
The European Space Agency is going to send
a single probe called the LISA Pathfinder

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.879
to the Sun-Earth Lagrangian Point L1.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.060
The L1 point is an island of gravitational
stability located directly between the Sun

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.739
and Earth, where the gravity between them
balances out.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.340
It’s approximately 1.5 million kilometers
away where we have several probes and space

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.049
telescopes currently anchored.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.860
The Pathfinder probe will have a scaled-down
interferometer set up between two masses inside.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.769
It will basically be a physics laboratory
experiment to test how an interferometer will

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.609
function in the space environment.

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.190
Although it’s not designed to seek out gravitational
waves, this will be the seed of eLISA.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.349
So 2034 may be a long way off, but if all
goes to plan, LIGO would have already detected

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.340
gravitational waves by then and eLISA will
be our new eye in space to weed out the weakest

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.219
gravitational wave signals from the deepest
depths of our universe.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.040
And LISA Pathfinder is the first stepping
stone to this ultimate goal.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.440

which has just gone online, check out my recent
