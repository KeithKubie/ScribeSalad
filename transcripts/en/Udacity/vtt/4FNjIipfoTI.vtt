00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.140
So you've just learned a lot about
loops, if else statements, and

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.080
some other Python syntax.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.010
You'll now apply these concepts in
a new function you'll learn about.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.860
To build your first real version
of a mad libs generator.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.210
Which can take in a string that might
contain the words noun, or verb.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.830
And replace those words with
randomly generated nouns and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.740
verbs to simulate user input.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.010
You'll see how functions are useful
in breaking down large tasks

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.560
into smaller more manageable chunks.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.200
Let's get started.
