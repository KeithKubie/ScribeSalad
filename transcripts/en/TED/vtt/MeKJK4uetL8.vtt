00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:18.860
The world is awash
with divisive arguments,

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.757
conflict,

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:22.594
fake news,

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:24.204
victimhood,

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:30.847
exploitation, prejudice,
bigotry, blame, shouting

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:33.794
and minuscule attention spans.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.048
It can sometimes seem
that we are doomed to take sides,

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.334
be stuck in echo chambers

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:44.675
and never agree again.

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:48.343
It can sometimes seem
like a race to the bottom,

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:52.385
where everyone is calling out
somebody else's privilege

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.523
and vying to show that they
are the most hard-done-by person

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:59.085
in the conversation.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.863
How can we make sense

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:05.291
in a world that doesn't?

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:12.361
I have a tool for understanding
this confusing world of ours,

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.293
a tool that you might not expect:

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:17.848
abstract mathematics.

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:21.651
I am a pure mathematician.

00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:26.076
Traditionally, pure maths
is like the theory of maths,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.269
where applied maths is applied
to real problems like building bridges

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:32.808
and flying planes

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.175
and controlling traffic flow.

00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:40.820
But I'm going to talk about a way
that pure maths applies directly

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:42.353
to our daily lives

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:44.222
as a way of thinking.

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:49.119
I don't solve quadratic equations
to help me with my daily life,

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:54.285
but I do use mathematical thinking
to help me understand arguments

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:56.818
and to empathize with other people.

00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:03.109
And so pure maths helps me
with the entire human world.

00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:07.545
But before I talk about
the entire human world,

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.629
I need to talk about something
that you might think of

00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:13.339
as irrelevant schools maths:

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:16.053
factors of numbers.

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:19.633
We're going to start
by thinking about the factors of 30.

00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:24.373
Now, if this makes you shudder
with bad memories of school maths lessons,

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:28.995
I sympathize, because I found
school maths lessons boring, too.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.363
But I'm pretty sure we are going
to take this in a direction

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:36.828
that is very different
from what happened at school.

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:39.444
So what are the factors of 30?

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.693
Well, they're the numbers that go into 30.

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:45.118
Maybe you can remember them.
We'll work them out.

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:48.956
It's one, two, three,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.072
five, six,

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.956
10, 15 and 30.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.457
It's not very interesting.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:58.356
It's a bunch of numbers
in a straight line.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.349
We can make it more interesting

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:04.063
by thinking about which of these numbers
are also factors of each other

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:06.615
and drawing a picture,
a bit like a family tree,

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.345
to show those relationships.

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.439
So 30 is going to be at the top
like a kind of great-grandparent.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:15.060
Six, 10 and 15 go into 30.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.489
Five goes into 10 and 15.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:21.632
Two goes into six and 10.

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:24.943
Three goes into six and 15.

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:29.151
And one goes into two, three and five.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.910
So now we see that 10
is not divisible by three,

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:36.114
but that this is the corners of a cube,

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:38.219
which is, I think, a bit more interesting

00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:40.367
than a bunch of numbers
in a straight line.

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:44.666
We can see something more here.
There's a hierarchy going on.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.561
At the bottom level is the number one,

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:48.829
then there's the numbers
two, three and five,

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.663
and nothing goes into those
except one and themselves.

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:54.117
You might remember
this means they're prime.

00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:57.174
At the next level up,
we have six, 10 and 15,

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:00.706
and each of those is a product
of two prime factors.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.672
So six is two times three,

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:04.367
10 is two times five,

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.352
15 is three times five.

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:08.341
And then at the top, we have 30,

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:10.860
which is a product
of three prime numbers --

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.937
two times three times five.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:17.580
So I could redraw this diagram
using those numbers instead.

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:21.403
We see that we've got
two, three and five at the top,

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.499
we have pairs of numbers
at the next level,

00:04:24.523 --> 00:04:26.910
and we have single elements
at the next level

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.852
and then the empty set at the bottom.

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:34.650
And each of those arrows shows
losing one of your numbers in the set.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.291
Now maybe it can be clear

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:40.173
that it doesn't really matter
what those numbers are.

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.156
In fact, it doesn't matter what they are.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.576
So we could replace them with
something like A, B and C instead,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.335
and we get the same picture.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:51.142
So now this has become very abstract.

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:53.610
The numbers have turned into letters.

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:57.569
But there is a point to this abstraction,

00:04:57.593 --> 00:05:02.178
which is that it now suddenly
becomes very widely applicable,

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:05.876
because A, B and C could be anything.

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:10.609
For example, they could be
three types of privilege:

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:13.326
rich, white and male.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:17.576
So then at the next level,
we have rich white people.

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:20.849
Here we have rich male people.

00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:22.922
Here we have white male people.

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:26.561
Then we have rich, white and male.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:30.341
And finally, people with none
of those types of privilege.

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.634
And I'm going to put back in
the rest of the adjectives for emphasis.

00:05:33.658 --> 00:05:36.688
So here we have rich, white
non-male people,

00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:39.761
to remind us that there are
nonbinary people we need to include.

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.438
Here we have rich, nonwhite male people.

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:45.758
Here we have non-rich, white male people,

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:48.484
rich, nonwhite, non-male,

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:51.059
non-rich, white, non-male

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.418
and non-rich, nonwhite, male.

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:55.639
And at the bottom,
with the least privilege,

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:59.706
non-rich, nonwhite, non-male people.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.542
We have gone from a diagram
of factors of 30

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:07.496
to a diagram of interaction
of different types of privilege.

00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:11.690
And there are many things
we can learn from this diagram, I think.

00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:18.525
The first is that each arrow represents
a direct loss of one type of privilege.

00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:23.814
Sometimes people mistakenly think
that white privilege means

00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:28.386
all white people are better off
than all nonwhite people.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.122
Some people point at superrich
black sports stars and say,

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:35.602
"See? They're really rich.
White privilege doesn't exist."

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:39.145
But that's not what the theory
of white privilege says.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.407
It says that if that superrich sports star
had all the same characteristics

00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:45.907
but they were also white,

00:06:45.931 --> 00:06:49.363
we would expect them
to be better off in society.

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:54.087
There is something else
we can understand from this diagram

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:56.097
if we look along a row.

00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.402
If we look along the second-to-top row,
where people have two types of privilege,

00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:04.382
we might be able to see
that they're not all particularly equal.

00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:10.485
For example, rich white women
are probably much better off in society

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.704
than poor white men,

00:07:12.728 --> 00:07:15.734
and rich black men are probably
somewhere in between.

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:18.535
So it's really more skewed like this,

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:20.492
and the same on the bottom level.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.081
But we can actually take it further

00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:26.676
and look at the interactions
between those two middle levels.

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:33.012
Because rich, nonwhite non-men
might well be better off in society

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.129
than poor white men.

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:39.061
Think about some extreme
examples, like Michelle Obama,

00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:40.503
Oprah Winfrey.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:45.540
They're definitely better off
than poor, white, unemployed homeless men.

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:48.944
So actually, the diagram
is more skewed like this.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.222
And that tension exists

00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:55.485
between the layers
of privilege in the diagram

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.174
and the absolute privilege
that people experience in society.

00:07:59.198 --> 00:08:02.872
And this has helped me to understand
why some poor white men

00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:06.305
are so angry in society at the moment.

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:10.756
Because they are considered to be high up
in this cuboid of privilege,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.563
but in terms of absolute privilege,
they don't actually feel the effect of it.

00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:19.033
And I believe that understanding
the root of that anger

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:23.344
is much more productive
than just being angry at them in return.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:29.839
Seeing these abstract structures
can also help us switch contexts

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:33.509
and see that different people
are at the top in different contexts.

00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:35.313
In our original diagram,

00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:37.340
rich white men were at the top,

00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:41.066
but if we restricted
our attention to non-men,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.780
we would see that they are here,

00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:45.535
and now the rich, white
non-men are at the top.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:48.404
So we could move to
a whole context of women,

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:53.572
and our three types of privilege
could now be rich, white and cisgendered.

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:57.301
Remember that "cisgendered" means
that your gender identity does match

00:08:57.325 --> 00:08:59.290
the gender you were assigned at birth.

00:09:00.021 --> 00:09:06.033
So now we see that rich, white cis women
occupy the analogous situation

00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:09.231
that rich white men did
in broader society.

00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:12.683
And this has helped me understand
why there is so much anger

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:14.360
towards rich white women,

00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:17.906
especially in some parts
of the feminist movement at the moment,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.590
because perhaps they're prone
to seeing themselves as underprivileged

00:09:21.614 --> 00:09:23.427
relative to white men,

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:28.562
and they forget how overprivileged
they are relative to nonwhite women.

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:35.994
We can all use these abstract structures
to help us pivot between situations

00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:38.610
in which we are more privileged
and less privileged.

00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:41.157
We are all more privileged than somebody

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.619
and less privileged than somebody else.

00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:49.522
For example, I know and I feel
that as an Asian person,

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.276
I am less privileged than white people

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.775
because of white privilege.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:55.447
But I also understand

00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:59.600
that I am probably among
the most privileged of nonwhite people,

00:09:59.624 --> 00:10:02.743
and this helps me pivot
between those two contexts.

00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:05.288
And in terms of wealth,

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:07.155
I don't think I'm super rich.

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:10.224
I'm not as rich as the kind of people
who don't have to work.

00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:11.796
But I am doing fine,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.975
and that's a much better
situation to be in

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:15.810
than people who are really struggling,

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.895
maybe are unemployed
or working at minimum wage.

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:23.992
I perform these pivots in my head

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:29.255
to help me understand experiences
from other people's points of view,

00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:34.401
which brings me to this
possibly surprising conclusion:

00:10:35.242 --> 00:10:42.076
that abstract mathematics
is highly relevant to our daily lives

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:48.820
and can even help us to understand
and empathize with other people.

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:56.223
My wish is that everybody would try
to understand other people more

00:10:56.247 --> 00:10:58.163
and work with them together,

00:10:58.187 --> 00:11:00.208
rather than competing with them

00:11:00.232 --> 00:11:02.843
and trying to show that they're wrong.

00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:08.598
And I believe that abstract
mathematical thinking

00:11:08.622 --> 00:11:10.702
can help us achieve that.

00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:13.470
Thank you.

00:11:13.494 --> 00:11:17.649
(Applause)
