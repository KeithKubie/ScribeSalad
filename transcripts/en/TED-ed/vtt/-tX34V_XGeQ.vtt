00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:11.851
This just in:

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:16.512
"Thief robs town 
with world's largest chocolate bunny."

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:19.723
Wait, so are we talking about this,

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:21.847
or this?

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.607
That's a classic case 
of a misplaced modifier,

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:27.086
a common grammatical mistake

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.625
that can dramatically change 
the meaning of a sentence.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:33.810
And lest you think 
this is a bit far-fetched,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.604
confusing headlines like this
appear all the time.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.396
Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:45.381
that add information 
about other parts of a sentence,

00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.433
which is usually helpful.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.364
But when modifiers
aren't linked clearly enough

00:00:50.364 --> 00:00:52.971
to the words 
they're actually referring to,

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.923
they can create unintentional ambiguity.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.039
That happens because the modifying words,

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.801
in this case, 
"with world's largest chocolate bunny,"

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.496
modify the wrong thing,
the robber's actions instead of the town.

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:09.579
To correct this particular sentence,
we simply rephrase

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.596
to make it clearer what the modifying 
phrase is talking about.

00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:18.644
"Town with world's largest chocolate bunny
robbed by thief."

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.502
Now, at least it's clear

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:24.329
that the thief wasn't armed 
with a giant chocolate animal.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.193
Sometimes, modifying words, 
phrases, or clauses

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:30.563
don't appear to be modifying 
anything at all.

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:33.096
That's called a dangling modifier.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.636
"Having robbed the bank in record time,

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:41.354
it was possible to make off 
with the town's chocolate rabbit as well."

00:01:41.354 --> 00:01:45.882
The modifying phrase in this sentence
seems unrelated to anything else,

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.168
and so we're clueless about

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:51.318
who the chocolate-loving criminal 
could possibly be.

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:55.648
Giving the modifier something to modify
will solve the problem.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:59.953
Then there's another group
called the squinting modifiers

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:05.351
because they're stuck between two things
and could feasibly refer to either.

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:09.558
Often, these modifiers are adverbs,
like the one in this sentence:

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:15.639
"Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers."

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.783
"Rapidly" is the modifier, here,
but what's not clear

00:02:18.783 --> 00:02:22.321
is whether it's referring 
to the speed of the chocolate thievery,

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:25.980
or how quickly it alerts 
the furious onlookers.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.286
To clarify, we can either put the modifier
closer to its intended phrase,

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.077
which works in some cases,

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:38.477
or we can entirely reword the sentence
so that the modifier no longer squints,

00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:42.365
but clearly applies to only one part.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:48.276
"Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers
rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers."

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:51.100
Justice will eventually come 
to the chocolate thief,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.482
but in the meantime,

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:55.437
our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity

00:02:55.437 --> 00:03:00.061
by making it clear which parts 
of the sentences modifiers belong to.

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.982
That way, we can at least maintain
grammatical law and order.
