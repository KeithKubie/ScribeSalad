00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.390
Hi, my name is Franklin Kalk, I'm 60 years old, I live in

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.790
Austin Texas. I took Warfarin for six months, about three years ago. I

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.100
had a blood clot, probably due to heavy travel, there were no other

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.310
complicating symptoms, or at least that was What we surmised at the time.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.560
&gt;&gt; Now when you say you had a blood clot, that you know

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.600
to anyone who hasn't had a blood clot before that sounds kind of serious,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.910
is that serious?

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.850
&gt;&gt; It is and it was kind of an interesting I mean I'll tell you the long

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.220
version, right? it started out I in retrospect probably for several

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.290
months I had some developing issues but didn't really know it at the time.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.655
But looking back after after I discovered it, it became pretty clear that I

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.310
had these these symptoms.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.930
&gt;&gt; And just so we know, what are those symptoms?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.540
&gt;&gt; Well, I was having I was getting a little bit light headed occasionally. I

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.980
just thought it was from working out too

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.540
much or something like that, right? I travel

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.450
a lot, my ankles had started to swell on long trips on aircraft, which they

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.760
had never done before. And so, and I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.850
just thought, well, it's inactivity. Well, of course,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.660
it was, but it was also That I was having some of these other

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.980
things, you know, beginning to crop up in my, or, my, my, veins or arteries,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.570
whatever. so, anyway, the story is, I was,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.390
my wife and son were in Colorado on vacation. I was going to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.170
meet them. I flew to Denver from Austin, I was walking

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.390
down the concourse in the Denver airport, talking to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.950
my wife on the phone mo, going to my next

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.590
gate, because I was flying to Vale. And all

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.350
of a sudden, I felt like I was just walking

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.790
through molasses. It was amazing. I just felt like

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.380
I was in slow motion. And it wasn't even vertigo.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.540
It was, it was you know, but I but

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.530
I kind of thought it was. Okay. Altitude you know.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.660
Yada yada yada. RIght. So I said to my wife, I have to sit down. I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.550
think i'm just you know, the thin air is getting to me in Denver. So I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.770
went over to my gate kind of, stumbbled over I guess and I sat down and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.270
put my head between my legs and that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.360
didn't help and I just crashed on the floor.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.710
So you know then I felt kind of woozy but

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.970
I was you know, people were worried about me. I got

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.710
up. I was able to get on the plane. And

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.170
then over the next couple of days, I felt fine. So,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.280
no big deal. I was there for a week. I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.400
then flew to Germany. And I got to Germany. I felt

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.080
fine. my first night there, I went to went into a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.880
an establishment with a friend of mine to watch some soccer.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.000
We had a couple of beers. Walking out I we hit the cobblestone streets and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.900
I twisted my ankle a little bit. The next day, in that same leg, I had

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.120
a very tender spot on the back of my calf and I thought well, I must have

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.320
twisted more than just my ankle. No big deal. But it felt really tender and.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.465
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:11.230
&gt;&gt; Tight, you know, like I had pulled a muscle.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.760
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. For a couple of days. And then, over time, it kind of went away.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.350
So then, a few days later, I flew back to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.640
Austin, got home. The next day, I had the same

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.590
pain, but it was in my groin. And, you know?

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.590
It was late at night. And I said to my wife,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.030
you know? I, that's weird, it's moved. maybe I have

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.420
a blood clot. I'll go to the urgent care clinic

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.730
in the morning. So, the next morning. I got up

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.330
and it was big and it was really tender and red.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.700
So I went in, and you know, the doctor

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.850
took one look and said, yeah, you have a blood

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.960
clot. Get, get across the street to the radiology group

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.260
and We'll do an ultrasound. So I went to cross

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.330
the street, had an ultrasound, it was pretty clear

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.470
during the ultrasound procedure. It was kind of neat because, you

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.050
know, they make you do things like flex your ankles

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.030
and on aircraft, you may have notice there are instructions

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.610
in aircraft magazines about moving your legs, you know, moving your knees

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.890
up and down or flexing your ankles. And they had a speaker

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.170
on the ultrasound device. So I could actually hear the blood flowing through my

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.495
veins as I flexed my ankles. So those exercises are

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:24.620
[LAUGH]

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.420
there for a reason I guess which I didn't know

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.510
at the time. so I thought, that's pretty cool. So

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.260
the radiologist said, it'll take me a while to look

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.390
at your chart. Go ahead and go home. I'll call you.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.510
So I got five minutes away, literally, from the clinic

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.950
in my car and the nurse called and said, you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.270
know, come back. So I turned around, came back and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.340
they gave me a heparin shot immediately in my belly. And

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.800
&gt;&gt; And

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.560
what's heparin for?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.730
&gt;&gt; Heparin is a very fast acting clot

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.019
basically, I'll call it clot breaker. I don't

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:01.407
know exactly the terminology, but it dissolves the

00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:03.680
clot. And it's rapid, I mean it only

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.720
took a couple of days before the swelling

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.260
had virtually gone away. And I took that

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.920
for ten days. I had to take shots

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.620
in my belly, which was really really uncomfortable.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.020
and then I started on Warfarin after that. So ten days on heparin and then I had

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.860
a sort of a ramp up into Warfarin, regime and took Warfarin for six months.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.060
&gt;&gt; Now, I, I guess in your case in

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.850
particular it seems rather, even scary to some people

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.430
that some of those symptoms were even kind of.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.650
Not benign but definitely synonymous with other kinds of causes.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.460
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.730
&gt;&gt; and so

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.020
your realization, you know that it was a blood clot seemed r-,

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.660
rather important to getting it treated in time before something worse happened.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.910
&gt;&gt; Right. Well I, you know I didn't really know anything about blood clots.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.960
I, I have to say I wasn't educated about them at all. I, a

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.720
little better educated now of course but At the time, I really didn't know

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.740
anything. once the pain moved from my calf to my groin, I kind of,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.460
you know, figured out. Oh, wait a minute. This

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.060
isn't just a muscle pull. And it's really tender. I

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.930
mean, you, I couldn't touch it without it being pretty

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.400
painful. So. You know, that was a little bit, you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.320
know, muscle pulls don't really feel that way. With a

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.440
muscle pull, if you, you know, if you really massage,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.900
may be okay. But I mean, just, you know, light

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.100
touch, I could feel it. So, it was something different.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.800
&gt;&gt; Well, after you had the heparin treatment, and you

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.080
were able to sort of bust up the initial clot.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.430
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.040
&gt;&gt; The Warfarin was prescribed to essentially prevent clots

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.750
from forming For a period of time in the future.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.940
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.090
&gt;&gt; Now, is this a pill that you had to

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.550
take every day? Well, first of all, is it a pill?

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.960
&gt;&gt; It's a pill.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.520
&gt;&gt; And is it something you had to take every day?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.640
&gt;&gt; Right. It's a pill, you take it every day, and, I'm

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.890
trying to, I can't remember exactly whether I actually took more than

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.180
one in a day to ramp up to some

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.250
level or not. I don't remember, but It took about

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.860
two weeks to determine that I was stable on

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.530
it. That my my clotting factors were at a normal

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.120
level and not varying a lot. because that's one

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.764
of the things they look for. so I had to

00:07:13.764 --> 00:07:16.678
get, you know, blood tests every every well twice

00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:19.820
a week for two weeks and then every week after.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.300
But it's a pill and, long term over six months I took it once a day.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.840
&gt;&gt; And so obviously I guess the concern

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.640
is since the Warfarin itself modulates the clotting factors.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.730
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.520
&gt;&gt; And how effective and efficient they work for

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.910
you, that too much Warfarin could be a bad thing.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.640
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.720
&gt;&gt; So when your doctor prescribed this for

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.610
you what were the considerations that went into I

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.840
mean did he have lots of special instructions for you? Did he try to get a lot

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.150
of information from you? Did you have to

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.410
modify anything in your life, to accommodate the dosing?

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.850
&gt;&gt; yes, all of the above, he gave gave me some fairly, they weren't super

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.890
detailed, but fairly detailed instructions. I, you

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.970
know, once I'd discovered and had verified at

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.370
the doctor that I had a clot and that I was, you know, because these

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.810
shots will remind you if nothing else.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.420
because compared to the shots the Warfarin itself

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.940
was not really a big deal for me in terms of the you know, the ingestion.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.320
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.680
&gt;&gt; The shots hurt. they hurt for quite a while after taking, maybe 20 minutes

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.910
I would have to lie down and just try to relax because I had such

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:29.630
a massive pain right in my belly where the, where I got the shot. anyway

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.280
the, the Warfarin was so, so there

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.559
were relatively detailed instructions. I had educated myself

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.960
after finding about the clot. And so, the doctor,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.960
you know, more or less cursorily went over the

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.190
instructions with me, rather than go through them word

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.240
by word, because he knew I had read them, and

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.350
had begun to educate myself. And, I was lucky

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.440
because my personal physician was also my next-door neighbor.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.820
So he knew my lifestyle and knew that I

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.230
was going to be, you know, pretty diligent about understanding this,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.460
you know,
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.130
&gt;&gt; This condition.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.260
&gt;&gt; Well, what were some of the special exceptions? we know that vitamin K is

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.510
&gt;&gt; Really important rather the amounts of vitamin

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.290
K, because vitamin K's an essential component for clotting

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.470
&gt;&gt; Right

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.080
&gt;&gt; So did you have to alter your diet,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.200
or did you have to pay special attention to it?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.490
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, before, and this is another interesting sort

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.310
of predetermining factor, I think. Not just the travel but

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.350
I ate a lot of leafy green vegetables, which have, those

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.620
are really the main sources in our normal diet of vitamin K.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.110
for example iceberg lettuce doesn't have much but

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.430
romaine does. Right? Kale has an enormous amount. Spinach.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:48.650
I love spinach. I, I ate a lotta spinach before that. So I had to cut back.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.580
And I really, I didn't eliminate them from my diet but I cut way back. And I

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.990
did. Control very carefully the intake, so I I

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.910
knew exactly how much I was taking each day.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.070
There were some things I totally eliminated from

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.200
my diet, for example, avocados. And the reason for

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.630
that is avocados, you can have two avocados that

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.370
look the same, but yet one will have very

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.490
little vitamin K, and the other can have an

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:21.450
enormous amount. Per unit weight. So the, the variability

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.080
was just, is something that you know you would

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.180
you just imagine well I'm not going to eat those

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.080
then, right? Because I don't want to inject that kind of variability into my

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.900
diet. I, I'm a big fan of if I can control, control things

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.890
through my diet I'll be better off. So, I kind of laugh once

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.032
in a while and say, I went to meat and potatoes for six months.

00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:41.076
[LAUGH]

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:43.860
&gt;&gt; The opposite direction of what some people end up having to do.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.340
&gt;&gt; Right. And the other thing that was

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.660
a little bit interesting to me, and I don't

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.040
remember how important a factor this was made out

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.280
to be, but I know I wasn't suppose to

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.420
get really over heated when I worked out.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.770
So don't really stress your body out and you

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.300
know, because now you're making your liver work pretty

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.170
hard. And that's where the clotting factors come from

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.010
in your blood stream, right? So you need to be

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.380
really careful about, about how you control your you know the

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.950
energy expenditure that your body goes through. So, and I,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.960
and I had a, a, my clot occurred in early July.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.651
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:23.550
&gt;&gt; So in Austin, July is the hottest time of year. So, you

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.562
know, rather than. I'm not going to go outside and run at noon. Right?

00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:27.048
[LAUGH].

00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:27.320
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.040
&gt;&gt; Because I'm not just going to get, super heated. So, that was a, that was

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:39.890
a, a pretty substantial change. Another change, was it, because you have

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.110
to worry about your blood, you know, maybe, maybe not being, so, maybe not being

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.440
able to clot so much anymore.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.800
&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, Warfarin has the effect

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.260
of thinning blood, so that it doesn't clot as

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.280
easily, but then the concern obviously is that

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.740
you don't clot enough when you need to clot.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.890
&gt;&gt; Right Yeah. So another thing I did, was I, I had taken

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.840
baby aspirin one a day at that point. And that's a different way to

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.490
thin the blood, right. As you get older, they kind of recommend that

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.280
for your heart. But that's really a, I think that's a platelet lubricity issue.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.850
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.590
&gt;&gt; Whereas Warfarin is really about clotting

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.605
factors in the bloodstream, which is a

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:20.100
completely, it's a chemistry thing, right. And

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.810
so, I had stopped taking aspirin during

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.470
that time. Just because it was another variable we wanted to eliminate. And so

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.490
I really changed my diet pretty dramatically.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.630
I went out and bought the Coumadin Cookbook.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.630
&gt;&gt;

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.411
[LAUGH].

00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.138
&gt;&gt; Which was really great for meat and potato recipes.

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:35.984
[LAUGH].

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:36.984
&gt;&gt;

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:36.846
[LAUGH].

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.100
Well, that sounds like just the, diet and

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.990
the recipe for some people out there already.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.671
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:42.176
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.860
&gt;&gt; Now where there any like besides your diet

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.940
any special activities that you know you were precluded from

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.610
doing? Besides even, you know, like you said exercising in

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.700
the heat. was there any major concern about getting injuries?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:55.960
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.370
&gt;&gt; Or, or or stopping bleeding if it were to occur?

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.920
&gt;&gt; Yes, In fact,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.590
when I had the weekly blood test one thing

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.880
I noticed right away was that the bleeding did

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.440
not stop. Just a little pin prick in the

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.410
finger is what was needed to get the blood test

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.580
taken. So, you know, you can usually just do

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.820
this with your fingers for two, three minutes, and then

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.460
the blood will stop, right? But it would take

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.090
30 minutes or more. Because, you know, we were trying

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.460
to keep my blood relatively thin. the other thing, the

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.190
other lifestyle change for me was I like to drive cars

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.420
fast at the race track. And, I couldn't do that

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.400
anymore because of the concern about blunt-force trauma. Any kind of

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.620
accident, you know, if you have a bad bruise you

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.220
could you know potentially bleed to death if you're blood doesn't

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.520
clot well. So, you know, that's, that's the kind of

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.860
thing that you know, really was a big change for me.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.220
&gt;&gt; Now, I'm

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.110
interested too sort of in the more personal side. I mean, this is all

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.550
very technical and obviously things about your

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.440
life had to change. You know, from

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.300
the event of having a clot itself, and then of course having to go

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.980
through, like you said, the ten day

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.990
heparin treatment, and the six months of warfarin.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.510
&gt;&gt; Did it have, you know, does this have a

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.780
psychological impact or an emotional impact on you and your family?

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:18.240
&gt;&gt; Yes. Oh yeah. for me personally, I stopped traveling

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.280
for about six to eight weeks. And then

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.540
after that, I remember still the first aircraft

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.230
that I got on. I was fidgeting. And it was Austin to Dallas, you know, literally

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.290
a 35 minute flight. And then I went

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.990
Dallas to Milwaukee. So maybe an hour, right,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.150
not very far. I was fidgeting the whole

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.005
time just trying to keep my blood flowing.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:40.750
[LAUGH]

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.940
I mean it was really, it really changes your attitude. I

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.930
mean for me it was my first glimpse of mortality idea right.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.900
&gt;&gt; So, I mean that was, that was a big deal and I think also

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.980
you know just having to go through a dietary change for the first time in

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.130
my life. And strictly control my diet.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.730
You know, my attitude had always been, I'll

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.280
eat as much as I want, anything I want, I'll just exercise to keep my weight,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.300
you know, where I want it. It wasn't like that

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.370
anymore. So that was a big change, and you know, it

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.050
was a big change for my family because now all

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.990
of a sudden If we were, if they were going to have

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.940
kale or spinach, I wasn't. So it was almost like

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.350
we had to cook for two different diets. Right so, I

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.332
mean, and just things like that. I mean that was

00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:31.360
that was part of it. But I think also there was

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.040
probably some worry, you know, from the other family members about,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.712
you know, is dad okay, or is my husband okay or.

00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:42.120
&gt;&gt; Right well, you know, there are, there's a lot of new

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.940
information out there about genetic variability,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.600
and certain genes that affect your

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.670
metabolism of Warfarin. We're just curious, do you know if you, do

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.616
you know of anything about your genetics with regards to that sensitivity

00:15:54.616 --> 00:15:55.462
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:55.462 --> 00:15:56.210
Warfarin yet.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.610
&gt;&gt; I do not know. And I didn't know there was

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.380
a genetic component, so that's good. I'm going to go study it actually.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah. we'll just ask as a follow up then. So this is

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.170
something that you'd be interested in knowing about yourself then in case you.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.450
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.440
&gt;&gt; Ever needed Warfarin in the future?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.840
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Right. Yeah, and you know there's

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.270
has been there's has been stroke, or heart disease

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.870
in my ancestry.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.411
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:27.380
&gt;&gt; you know recent ancestry. both sides of my

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.880
family father and mother. I've always looked at that and

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.910
said. Well, you know? Back then, people smoked a lot.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.700
And they didn't have very good diets. And I'm in

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.100
much better health than my father was at my age,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.970
and his father. But, you know? It kind of makes me

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.340
wonder. And I know there has been a history of

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.390
strokes on my mother's side of the family, in particular.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.220
And of course, that's one, you know, one by-product of blood clots.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.605
&gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.

00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:58.487
[CROSSTALK]

00:16:58.487 --> 00:17:05.990
&gt;&gt; so overall, you're pretty pleased then that

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.210
a drug like Warfarin does exist at all?

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.310
Obviously to assist. but you know, this was

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.460
a big sort of life changing event for you.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.030
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.010
&gt;&gt; If you could you know, talk to someone that was either just diagnosed with

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:24.180
a blood clot and was going to have to go on Warfarin over a period of time, or

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.329
if you were going to have to give advice to a family member

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.220
or friend of someone who was going to have to undergo that. Do you

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:36.320
have any helpful or important advice or opinion that you'd like to share

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.650
with them. Something that you think it's important and they should know about?

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.600
&gt;&gt; Well when I read about Warfarin I thought,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.450
you know a couple of things. It's, it's almost like

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.920
Aspirin. It was discovered quite a while ago. Almost,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.930
well early in the last century. Maybe 1930s, or 20s.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.390
it's amazing that such an effective drug has

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.170
not really had yet a replacement that works kind

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.130
of for everybody, you know what I mean? that

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.000
was interesting to me. because it has been used

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.450
really, for other purposes than treating blood clots, before

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.320
that At first I thought I'm not sure I

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.980
want to put this in my body, but it really

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.580
wasn't all that bad. The actual ingestion of the,

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.870
of the drug itself. I really felt nothing

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.870
and you know I felt perfectly normal. so

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.360
that was good. And I think. They're, you

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.080
know, don't fear, right? On the other hand, for

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.830
me, I, I stabilized rapidly. And, and, you

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.210
know, my my clotting factors in my blood

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.880
stayed very constant over time. Maybe that was

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.600
just discipline. So, my advice would be, follow a,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.960
a diet, you know. Be really strict about your diet.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.590
That doesn't mean, you know, deprive yourself. But, but be

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.420
consistent with it. So that your, your, your body is

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.120
being presented with the same Chemistry from nutrition. I mean,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.110
I think that's really important. the other thing is that,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.830
you know, taking the drug, again, is not the end

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.720
of the world. And, if you're a typical person that

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.740

was, you know, that was four years ago so you know, I think, but it, it,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.060
it does change your lifestyle a little bit or maybe a lot. I guess depending on

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.755
the you know the gravity of the situation. But it isn't the end of the world
