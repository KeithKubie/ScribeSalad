MARCO GUTIERREZ GIRALDO:
My name is Marco.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.870
And my org is Robocomp.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.080
Robocomp is a
framework for robotics,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.190
which has the basic
tools for developers

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.930
and a set of components, so you
can run your own robot with it.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.410
It's written in C++.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.640
Robocomp has been
around since 2000.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.510
It's been like quite
a few years now.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.010
It started at the University
of Extremadura in Spain.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.770
It was a project by the
robotics lab over there.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.830
And now, it's getting bigger.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.200
And there's a lot
of universities

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
from Spain involved in it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.620
And they're using it and
developing stuff for it.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.080
I got a job at the university.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.810
And right now, I'm
getting my PhD.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.820
So I do some research
with the project.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.510
This our first year at
the Google Summer of Code.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.810
It's been a really, really
good experience for us.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.500
We got two slots, two students.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.860
And they turned out to be great.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.870
One, well, actually,
both of them

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.130
are today working with us,
even if the program is over.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.740
So we are really happy
with the experience.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.560
Robocomp has got a simulator.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.900
And that's one of
our main tools.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.010
So we got a student that
started working with it.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.270
And he put some physics
in it, because we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.710
were missing that part.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.880
And now, we're able
to simulate the world

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.100
in a more accurate way.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.270
And then we had
another student that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.130
was working on the deployment
part of the framework.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.750
So she built a tool for
managing all the components

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.680
that you can have in a robot.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.930
So we have now a nice GUI, so
you can just start and stop

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.220
the robot with a single click.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.590
We will actually get
pretty much anyone there,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.560
because we have tons of stack
of tasks that anyone can do.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.470
So I would say they just
need to like robotics and be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.456
interested in it.

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:24.020
But, yeah, if they
know some programming,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.170
and they just want
to get involved,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.040
it's free for everyone to
come by and drop us an email

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.905
and say, hey, can I help you?

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.970
Yeah, we're always
willing to help people.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.100
In Robocomp, we're
interested in people

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.990
that have a passion
for robotics and that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.680
want to learn and
to do some research.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.630
So pretty much anyone
that is interested

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.310
can just come by and
drop us an email.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.220
Our URL is Robocomp.org.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.010
So they can just go
to a web browser,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.640
get there, and get
the information.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.340
And we'll be happy to help them.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.710
The biggest win for Robocomp
was that we got more open.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.860
We got people from all
over to work with us.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.980
We got some documentation going
on, and it's getting better.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.602
So I guess it made
us more open source.
