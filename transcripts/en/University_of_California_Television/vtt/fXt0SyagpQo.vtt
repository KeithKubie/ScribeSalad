- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.610
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.590
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

- [Nina] We share with these beautiful
cousins of ours skin that serves a variety

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.380
of important functions, and we've heard a
lot about those functions already today:

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.730
protection, thermoregulation. Today, I'm
going to reprise a little bit of what's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.210
been said already about the first two
functions, and then talk somewhat about

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.320
this enormous realm of human communication
that we engage in with skin.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.060
Over time, and through evolution, if we
compare the relative importance of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.350
protection and thermoregulation versus
communication, we can see that in human

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.450
evolution, communication has become one of
the major functions of skin especially

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.340
since the evolution of functionally naked
skin.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.540
I want to first just reprise a little bit
information about protection, though,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.670
because it's useful to think about what we
lost. Hair is enormously useful, and our

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.380
primate relatives and our mammalian
ancestors had hair that help to insulate

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.660
and protect against all manner of
environmental problems and abrasion,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.380
ultraviolet radiation and water, and hair
helps to slow the ingress of pathogens to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.830
the skin. But we lost hair, and although
there is some controversy about why we

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.890
lost it and exactly when, we know that we
now have functionally naked skin probably

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.190
by early Homo times, and almost certainly
for reasons having to do with the need to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.290
keep cool during exercise by a high volume
of eccrine sweating. And what the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.260
important conclusion of this is is that
for much of our...the key portions of our

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.000
evolution, hairless bodies are interfaced
with the environment.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.300
A very different situation than in other
mammals.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.380
The evolution of the stratum corneum, the
very top part of the epidermis is

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.990
something that has been dealt with a lot
in the dermatological literature. We know

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.340
that the epidermis, and particularly the
stratum corneum at the very surface of the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.630
epidermis, here, resists abrasion,
restricts water loss, and prevents the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.710
ingress of pathogens. But that great
change from the haired to the hairless

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.790
condition basically involved changes to
the stratum corneum.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.750
So when we think about really what Ajit
Varki's point was at the very beginning of

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.880
this symposium, "Why is the skin
different." We see from referring to the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.490
chimp genome project that in fact, the
skin is the most distinct organ. Human

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:15.520
skin has been...has many genes that have
been evolving independently, and very

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.440
different from those of chimpanzees much
more so than any organ or cell system. And

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.980
the most important genes in this regard
are those having to do with the stratum

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.200
corneum and the barrier functions of the
epidermis.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.440
We could go on at length, my colleague,
Peter Elias has done distinguished work in

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.200
this area. We know that this stratum
corneum in humans is particularly

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.810
lipid-rich that we have interferon gamma
that helps to generate a potent antiviral

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.820
state in the stratum corneum and that the
skin microbiome plays an enormously

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.130
important and still quite unclear, but
emerging role.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.530
The skin also has to protect against
another major assault which is that of the

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.480
sun and particularly, ultraviolet
radiation. We know from data provided from

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.240
NASA that the ultraviolet radiation load
that we get on the Earth's surface is

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.160
strongest around the equator shown in the
bright pink and red tones here in the map.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.380
Much, much lower as we get close to the
poles, especially in these large land

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.820
masses in the northern hemisphere. How
have humans coped with these high levels

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:50.000
of UV in our ancestral areas, and much
lower levels in areas of habitation later

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.630
in aspects of our evolution?

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:00.310
In early Homo, the loss of body hair is
associated with the development of

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.320
permanent, dark pigmentation. So instead
of having dark hair covering lightly

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:14.560
pigmented skin, we evolve permanently,
darkly pigmented skin. And that is largely

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.960
to do with the production of high amounts
of the tremendously interesting pigment

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.410
called eumelanin; a fascinating polymer
that has myriad important properties. The

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:36.740
most important for our purposes being the
ability to scatter and absorb ultraviolet

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.780
radiation and prevent damage to underlying
tissues.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.600
Ultraviolet radiation causes a lot of
damage to the skin that can lead to skin

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:56.440
cancer, especially in individuals who are
genetically susceptible. But skin cancer

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.380
rarely causes mortality.
So I, as someone who is interested in

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.410
figuring out why skin pigmentation evolved
as it did, and specifically why dark

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:15.090
pigmentation evolved, got very interested
in the effect of ultraviolet radiation on

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:22.620
something that would really count for
reproductive success in evolution. And I

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.010
started looking a lot at folate
metabolism. Without going into a lot

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:34.300
detail, suffice it to say that we need
folate, one of the key B vitamins, in

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:42.520
order to fuel DNA synthesis which is
particularly important in certain parts of

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.420
our development in life especially in
early embryogenesis. When we know that

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.590
folate is critical for the formation of
the embryonic neural tube which is the

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:02.900
precursor of the modern, or the adult,
nervous system. So, if you have an

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.760
environmental agent like ultraviolet
radiation that can actually break down

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:16.500
folate and affect other aspects of folate
metabolism in a pregnant mother, then you

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.980
can affect reproductive success, and this
is why we've highlighted that mechanism.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.620
So.here I say the primary, not the only,
but the primary selective force for the

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.390
evolution of permanent dark pigmentation
is protection against ultraviolet-induced

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:41.800
changes in folate availability and DNA
synthesis in early embryogenesis and in

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:49.500
sperm production. But humans did not
remain in the ancestral environment of

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.650
Africa. Much of human evolution, including
much of Homo Sapien's evolution, has

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.810
occurred in Africa. Tremendous amounts of
diversification, but humans have moved

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.110
around a lot.
And here we can see in the history of

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:09.080
modern humans. We have people
moving...small populations moving out of

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.400
Africa into areas of very different
ultraviolet radiation including very low

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:22.000
areas or very low UV areas later in our
evolutionary history. Why is that

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.950
important? Because ultraviolet radiation,
mostly a malign influence that we think

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:34.500
about in evolution, is a creative
influence, and is extremely important in

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.240
all vertebrates in the production of
Vitamin D in the skin. Without

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.330
ultraviolet-B radiation we cannot make
Vitamin D in the skin. And what we have

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.600
shown in our research and this has been
supported by many collateral lines of

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.040
evidence is that the primary selective
force for the evolution of lightly pink

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.030
bennet [SP] or more correctly, depigmented
skin is promotion of ultraviolet

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:09.660
radiation-induced Vitamin D production in
the skin under conditions of low and

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.150
seasonal ultraviolet radiation.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:19.150
And so here in modern humans, we have this
beautiful and delightful contrast between

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:25.990
skin on the left that maximizes photo
protection against ultraviolet radiation,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:31.330
and skin on the right that maximizes
photosynthesis of Vitamin D under

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.750
conditions of low UV.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:40.110
Skin pigmentation is a superb evolutionary
compromise. Something that we should talk

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:46.340
about in our classes of evolution and
human biology; a superb compromise that is

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.517
an excellent illustration of the action of
natural selection on the human body.

00:11:51.517 --> 00:12:01.310
Themoregulation, I'm only going to say
that as we evolved through time, we became

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:07.280
far more active. This beautiful example of
an early member of the genus Homo was not

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:14.360
a tentative biped. This was a striding,
running, active individual that built up a

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.760
lot of body heat under hot environmental
conditions.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:25.290
Here was the natural selective substrate,
as it were, for the loss of most

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:33.140
functional body hair. Evaporation of sweat
is impeded by hair, and so we reasoned

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:39.140
that most body...most functional body hair
was actually lost because of the

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:46.260
importance of facilitating the evaporation
of sweat from the surface of the body. And

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:52.280
so, functional hairlessness, then, can
best be thought about as facilitating

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:58.150
active body cooling, whole body cooling,
through eccrine sweating during lengthy

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.300
periods of sustained exercise.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:08.670
Communication has always been an important
function of skin, whether we're talking

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:15.650
about a distant mammalian ancestor or a
primate relative. Primates touch one

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:21.210
another. Communication through touch
especially beginning with infant-mother

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:28.880
communication is central. This continues,
and is elaborated in the hairless human

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.120
infant and in hairless bodies contacting
one another. And we know that this type of

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.510
touch communication is absolutely
essential for mother-infant bonding in our

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.710
primate relatives and in ourselves.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:53.210
When we lost most of our body hair, we
lost an important method of displaying our

00:13:53.210 --> 00:14:01.710
emotions. This chimpanzee on the left is
exhibiting a display, a very visible

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.580
display, of anger and aggression toward
the individual on the right.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:13.790
And he is able to manifest this
magnificent raising of hackles. What do we

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:19.400
do without hair? We have no hackles. We
might...our little feeble hairs might go

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:29.810
up. What do we do instead? We don't know
for certain, but what we do know is that

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:36.250
modern humans have much more finely
differentiated, and highly active facial

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:43.920
muscles than do even chimpanzees, and we
have the evolution of enhanced facial

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.910
expressivity in humans that is probably
related to that loss of expressivity in

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.870
the raising of the hackles.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:59.950
As soon as humans evolved naked skin or
probably very soon, thereafter, people

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:06.580
realized that they could decorate their
skin. We don't know when they happened

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.780
upon this, but we have some enticing
evidence that comes from Blombos Cave in

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.930
South Africa from about 70,000 years ago
that would indicate that by that time,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:23.940
people were beginning to use ocher for
decorations and for decorating the inside

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:31.190
of rock shelters. This is exciting because
I would venture that probably long before

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.850
this, humans had been using ocher and
similar pigments to rub on themselves, to

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:46.920
mark themselves. We can't prove this, but
it seems highly likely. Humans are lavish

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:54.170
decorators of themselves. We may not have
colorful fur, but we more than compensate

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.610
for this by having myriad ways of
decorating ourselves with body paint, with

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:07.960
cosmetics.
In most cultures, both sexes are involved

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:14.460
and many parts of the body are involved in
decoration. There is no culture that we

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:23.430
know in the world that does not adorn its
skin in some way. Modern humans have

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:30.850
developed not only body paints but also
cosmetics. Now, mostly associated with

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:36.580
women, but certainly centuries ago, not. A
lavish form of communication that is

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:42.820
incredibly important that individuals can
manipulate and change from one day or one

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.930
season to another.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:51.530
We also start making permanent marks on
our body. We know from the preserved

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:59.460
remains of the so-called Tyrolean iceman,
dating from around 5,000 years ago, that

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:05.720
we have evidence of tattooing of the skin.
These are thought to be therapeutic

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.620
tattoos that were on the skin not
necessarily decorative. Many of them are

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:17.790
crosses or simple lines, parallel lines.
But the fact that they are present that

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.980
early in the archaeological record in
neolithic humans is significant. And

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:30.390
humans around the world tattoo themselves,
and sometimes lavishly.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:38.970
This woman from Burma has beautiful facial
tattoos that signify her marriageable

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:49.460
status. And that identify her to a
particular clan group. But what do we say

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.970
just through our color? And the rest of
this lecture I want to devote to the

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:02.070
messages, the communication that actually
comes from our color.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:09.600
During most of human history, humans moved
around slowly. They came into contact with

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:17.660
one another gradually. There were no big
surprises. And it's not surprising that

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:25.140
through much of history, not just
prehistory but much of history, we have no

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:32.900
indication that humans treated one another
differently on the basis of color. It only

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:40.360
is relatively recent, in the last few
hundred years that color becomes something

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.300
that has social significance, and that has
some kind of set of stereotypes and even

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.820
stigmas attached to it.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:58.040
We really see the emergence of a modern
color-consciousness beginning in the 18th

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:06.920
century when innate skin color comes to
communicate both racial identity or race

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:15.630
belonging, and social status. One of the
most interesting figures in this history

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:23.770
is the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Immanuel
Kant was a very careful reader of

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:31.850
Linnaeus, the great taxonomist. Linnaeus
made very simple descriptions of humans

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:38.660
according to skin color and geography.
Later, he associated skin color and

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.050
geography with some characteristics of
behavior and culture.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:53.690
Kant was an avid reader of Linnaeus, and
Kant, although he's known far more for his

00:19:53.690 --> 00:20:00.760
thoughts on rationality and human
thinking, had tremendous curiosity about

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.850
human diversity, human origins, and the
origins of human capacity for

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:10.000
civilization.
And so, he thought a lot about Linnaeus

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.560
and what Linnaeus said, and Kant, not a
naturalist, but Immanuel Kant the

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:23.410
philosopher, was the first to actually
enunciate the presence of four races. And

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:29.310
the key thing about Kant's races where
that in his mind, they were immutable.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:37.700
They couldn't change ever. And this was
just not a list, it was a hierarchy. And

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.340
critical here is the primacy of the white
race which is something that we see

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.060
emerging again in different guises for
many centuries, for many decades after

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.300
this.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:21:00.320
Kant's tremendous influence was
complemented by the importance of

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:07.330
maintaining a strict social hierarchy in
order to keep the trans-Atlantic slave

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:15.970
trade going. By the early 1800s, there was
tremendous pressure to end slavery, to end

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:26.200
the slave trade. But it was very, very
financially appealing and important for

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.710
the hierarchy of races and especially the
primacy of the white race over the

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:39.020
so-called black race to be enunciated so
that slavery could be maintained. And we

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.580
see this complementarity between a
philosophical and a religious or

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:50.470
pseudo-religious underpinning for race
hierarchies and slavery along with the

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:57.400
mercantile and capitalist underpinnings. A
very pernicious system that led to the

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:04.510
social differentiation of color.
Something that hadn't existed at least in

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:10.980
as strong a form and violent a form
before. And so we see race definitions

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:17.500
that are associated with color that lead
seemingly inexorably to the development of

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:24.610
racial stereotypes especially when they're
propagated by individuals like Kant, like

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:31.060
Thomas Jefferson who were highly, socially
influential through their writings leading

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.720
to the development of what I've called
color memes that are adopted and

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.330
transmitted from family to family,
generation to generation leading to a

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.310
durable psychosocial template for racism.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:54.430
So skin, coming from this delightful and
beautiful evolutionary background, skin

00:22:54.430 --> 00:23:02.620
color actually reflects our evolutionary
history, but in this most recent part of

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:11.860
human written history comes to represent
something entirely different. But I am not

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:18.600
a pessimistic person, and the beautiful
thing about humans as primates is that we

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:27.170
are tremendously imitative and suggestible
and we can change. We adopted in Western

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:33.290
civilization broadly, certain attitudes
toward color and we can change those

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:39.860
attitudes. We're not trapped by the color
memes that we have created. And this

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:48.170
aspect of communication through skin can
in fact change. I want to celebrate the

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:56.910
beauty of human skin and invite you to
think more about the exquisite path that

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:03.090
skin has taken through the last seven or
so million years of the human lineage.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:10.990
The evolution of hairlessness, functional
nakedness, sweating, the development of

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:18.600
these marvelous appendages, and the
beautiful feast of microbes and other

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.840
creatures that live on the surface of our
skin. And then, the superb things that we

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:31.450
do with this beautiful, naked canvass that
has been produced by evolution. Let's

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:38.572
celebrate those and continue an active
program of research. Thank you very much.
