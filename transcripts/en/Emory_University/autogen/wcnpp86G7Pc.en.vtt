well it's the conflict of variety games
right I mean for example I sometimes say

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:36.439
right I mean for example I sometimes say
 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.619
right I mean for example I sometimes say
to students read to a student when was

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:38.629
to students read to a student when was
 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:41.559

difficult it's difficult to get back

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:54.500
difficult it's difficult to get back
 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.869
difficult it's difficult to get back
into the frame of mind of people who

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879
into the frame of mind of people who
 

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.100
into the frame of mind of people who
didn't know they were the losers of

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110
didn't know they were the losers of
 

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.629
didn't know they were the losers of
course the better students very quickly

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639
course the better students very quickly
 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.999
course the better students very quickly
understand the point so I think that was

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:01.009
understand the point so I think that was
 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:02.439

it just before Pickett's Charge and

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:02.449
it just before Pickett's Charge and
 

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:02.950
it just before Pickett's Charge and
Gettysburg

Gettysburg
 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.950
Gettysburg
they speculate like that and then I say

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960
they speculate like that and then I say
 

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.719
they speculate like that and then I say
now what were the arguments the

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:07.729
now what were the arguments the
 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:09.100
now what were the arguments the
Confederates use to convince themselves

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.110

the students to think like the sly bones
 

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.589
the students to think like the sly bones
you've got to get them at least

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599
you've got to get them at least
 

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.509

to understand all these different groups
so we're all conflicting in conflict

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.230
so we're all conflicting in conflict
 

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.819
so we're all conflicting in conflict
with each other

00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:00.829
with each other
 

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.880
with each other
all thinking that they were right

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:02.890
all thinking that they were right
 

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.840
all thinking that they were right
because of course people come into

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:04.850
because of course people come into
 

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.670
because of course people come into
conflict because they think they're

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680
conflict because they think they're
 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.990
conflict because they think they're
right and sometimes because they're even

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000
right and sometimes because they're even
 

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.790
right and sometimes because they're even
willing to die for their belief in their

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800
willing to die for their belief in their
 

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.639
willing to die for their belief in their
rightness yeah that's why it's so

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:12.649
rightness yeah that's why it's so
 

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:13.630
rightness yeah that's why it's so
difficult and why it's so complicated

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640
difficult and why it's so complicated
 

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.180
difficult and why it's so complicated
and of course it's a great discipline

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.190
and of course it's a great discipline
 

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.980
and of course it's a great discipline
and I sometimes say this to students as

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:17.990
and I sometimes say this to students as
 

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.230
and I sometimes say this to students as
well it's a discipline being a student

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240
well it's a discipline being a student
 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.910

really going to understand history at
 

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.620
really going to understand history at
all it's much more difficult than that

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.630
 
 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.639
 
now the next thing is this question

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:36.649
now the next thing is this question
 

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.699

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:19.970
so complicate matters and then you have
 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:24.099

small number but it's a way of trying to

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599

much more confident Rossi when it's much
more complicated and so when this end of

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:36.950
more complicated and so when this end of
 

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.710

whenever people say things like the

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720
