00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.210
I think it's time to move past
simple cosmetic changes to the site.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.010
So far, you've used media
queries to change simple things,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.110
like background color and what not,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.150
but you can also you use media queries
to change the entire layout of the page.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.360
In fact, this is how developers
accomplish responsive design.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.640
By using media queries like minwidth and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.310
maxwidth, developers can change
the entire layout of the page.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.030
&gt;&gt; Right, the point at which the page
changes layout, is called a break point.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.040
And depending on how
your site is laid out,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
you might have one or
several break points.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.390
&gt;&gt; You know what, let's take a look at a
few examples of pages using breakpoints.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.480
Afterwards, I'll show you
a few more pages, and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.490
you tell me,
how many breakpoints they've used.
