00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.270
[siren wailing]

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:07.173
(Jones)
'Hold up. Who's that?'

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.174
Is that Jim?

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.477
'What the hell?'

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.980
What's up, guys?

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.315
- 'Yo!'
- How's it going?

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.717
What are you...
What are you doing?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.952
How's crime tonight?

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:22.522
How's the rhyme tonight?

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.589
I don't even...

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.224
Terry, what are you doing...

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.693
What are you doing
with a cop car?

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:31.097
I bought the car
at Cop Car Mart.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.398
- I got the--
- Cop Car Mart?

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.133
The uniform
at Uniform Junction.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.134
I...

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.869
And then I got a gun

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.838
from Everybody Buying
A Gun Tonight

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.440
the gun store.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.208
I saw a monster...
I thought I saw a monster.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.609
- Okay, we're good.
- Stop it!

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.178
There's no bullets in it!

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.546
Okay. Okay, okay.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.613
[gunshot]

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.315
Alright. Knock it off!

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.450
- Knock it off!
- Stop it, Terry.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.685
I thought
there were no bullets.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.420
(Jim)
'What the [bleep], Terry.'

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.621
- Hi.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.457
- What the [bleep] was that?
- 'Jim.'

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.826
- What was in that rag?
- Are you alright?

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.061
We don't chloroform
our friends.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.464
Uh, he's been doing coke
back here.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.731
Did you see this?

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.967
Look, he's got powder
all over his nose.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.205
I've been baking a cake
for you guys as a surprise.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.108
[Terry cries]

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.076
Hey, Terry!

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.145
- Hi!
- How's it goin'?

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.447
- I'm doing great, A-plus.
- 'Okay, good.'

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.149
I'm totally sober.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.517
- That's great.
- It sucks.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.552
- Good for you.
- I mean, I love it.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:31.390
Yeah, we've gotten a report
of several reports, actually

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:36.295
that people have been finding
pubic hairs in their burritos.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:39.098
'Yeah, you know anything
about that?'

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.968
No, that's awful!

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.402
Yeah, it is.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:47.640
That seems a little peculiar
that you handle food.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.709
I don't touch the food.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.577
'So how do you, you don't
touch the food?'

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.347
I don't, it's on the tray.
I take it and I give it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.150
to you and I say take it,
and don't put pubic hair in it.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.586
I say that specifically.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.555
Well, that's too bad
about the hair, I'm serious.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.257
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call
the police.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.693
- Okay.
- Well, somebody already did.

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.462
- Yeah, here we are.
- Oh.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.198
- Sheriff's Department.
- Hello, we answered your call.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.467
- Oh, that's right.
- 'What can we do for you, sir?'

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.903
Someone's putting pubic hair
in the tacos!

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:20.139
Okay, who do you think
that might be?

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.108
So...

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:28.247
So, um...can we get
a couple free tacos or...

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.218
Um, see what I can do,
Pedro's a little peeved at me.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.753
What'd you do?

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.023
I put some pubic hair in one
of, I fell and I didn't...

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.358
- Come on. let's go.
- I know I said I didn't I--

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.093
- Let's go.
- I didn't mean that.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:45.031
Come on, Terry, let's go.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.301
What do you consider
your job skills to be?

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:51.370
[sighs]

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:53.306
- Skating...
- Yep.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.840
That's good.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.409
High-fiving...

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.411
Skating and high-fiving.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.712
Low-fiving...

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.915
low five, the antithesis
of high five

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:06.252
- And?
- And singing.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.353
Singing.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.921
So, Terry,
what you're basically saying

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.656
is, you could be in
"Starlight Express"

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.160
if they ever, ever are bold
enough to mount it again.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.861
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:19.298
Possible "Starlight Express"
understudy.

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.300
You're off drugs now?
You're totally clean?

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.237
I'm so clean, it's not
even ridiculous.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.738
- Not even ridiculous.
- Not even ridiculous.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.206
Here's the thing,
I find that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.775
eerily a little bit
disappointing

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:32.445
because if you're
not on drugs

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.747
if this is you
totally, totally clean

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.983
and you've missed
19 parole hearings

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.818
and you're working
at who let the clogs out?

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.990
That's kind of disappointing,
don't you think?

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.291
First of all,
I was voted the smartest

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.959
at my family reunion

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:49.895
like, hands down.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.297
By the rest
of your family?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.932
You can't put up two fingers
for the same thing.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.133
You can't say you're smartest

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.868
at your family reunion,
hands down.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.937
That's one thing.
That's one thing.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.672
I was voted smartest
in my family reunion...

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.173
- That's one.
- Hands down.

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:03.009
No. That's part
of the same sentence.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.644
You're saying two
parts of the same sentence

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:07.079
part one of the sentence

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:08.281
end of the sentence.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.349
Those aren't two things.
