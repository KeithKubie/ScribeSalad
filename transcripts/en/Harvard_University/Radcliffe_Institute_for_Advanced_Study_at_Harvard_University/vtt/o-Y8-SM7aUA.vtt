Narrator: Both the video and audio collections of June Jordan reflect three decades of her appearances

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:28.080
on public radio and BBC radio, as well as television,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.952
often in interview or appearing
as a guest expert in her field.

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:37.671
In addition, there are also a great deal of live poetry readings, musical performances, public lectures,

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:42.452
and politically charged rallies and
panel discussions videotaped for posterity.

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:46.102
During this panel discussion
on the show, Essence, circa 1985,

00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:49.721
Jordan addresses the recent release
of the film, The Color Purple,

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:55.189
and the dearth of African American filmmakers
or story lines generally.

00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:58.721
June Jordan: Where The Color Purple is
concerned, whether you like it or don't like it,

00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.852
this is what I would like to say,
emphatically as I possibly can:

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.669
it's not about Alice Walker;

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:07.202
it's not about any single
black writer out here, or poet.

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.019
The problem is, that the coun--
this country is set up

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.269
in such a way that black people--
we do not have access to mass media.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:19.652
Consequently, we do not have
ten and eleven black films a year,

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:21.137
which is what we should have.

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:24.221
We should not have one every ten years,
we should have ten or eleven every year.

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:28.106
And then the burden of our dreams and
our fears--both--

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:31.094
would not fall unduly on any one of us.

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:33.173
Any one of us is just that: one.

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:37.130
Jordan's audiovisual collections enrich
study of her papers.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.253
We can listen to Jordan reading her own poems
as they are meant to be heard and,

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:46.020
as in the case of talks delivered at universities
or in leading her Poetry for the People class,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.054
witness her vibrant and encouraging
 performance style of a different kind--

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:52.359
as a professor and mentor.

00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:58.587
And if I, if I ever let love go
because the hatred and the whisperings

00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:04.671
become a phantom dictate I obey
in lieu of impulse and realities

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:08.286
the blossoming flamingos of
my wild mimosa trees,

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:11.036
then let love freeze me out.

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:18.609
I must become--I must become--
a menace to my enemies.
