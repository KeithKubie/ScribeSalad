[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.380
JEFF WETZLER: I want
to start by showing you

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.130
a few images that have
nothing to do with education.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.853
If you were to enter some
keywords into Google--

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:15.270
for example, if
you were to enter,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.440
"surgery in the
early 20th century,"

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.910
you might see an image
like this one here.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.215
And if you were to then
say, "What about the 1950s?"

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.340
you might see an image like
this, where it changes.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.800
And if you were to say
the 2000's or beyond,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.460
you would see a
pretty different image

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.280
of what the delivery
of medicine looks

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.680
like over the course
of hundred years or so.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.192
Similarly, if you were to
say media or communications,

00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:42.150
you might see something
like this in the 1900s.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.090
And you might see something
like this in the 1950s.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.510
And you'd see something
quite different in the 2000s.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.190
If you go to
transportation, something

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.550
like this in the 1900s,
cars in the 1950s,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.590
planes and beyond now.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.550
Now, I want to apply
it to classrooms.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.217
If you were to do the
same thing and you

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:01.530
were to enter into Google,
"classrooms in the 1900s,"

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.400
you might see
something like this.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
If you were to enter 1950s, you
might see something like this.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.730
And if you were to
enter today, you

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.420
would see something like this.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.680
And one of the observations
that animates the work that we

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.170
do at Transcend is that
those images are not

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.430
particularly different.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.677
And when we think about how
vastly society has changed

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:23.010
in almost every other sector,
in terms of how things are

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.230
delivered, you see
a stark contrast

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.210
with what you would
see in education.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.208
So here comes the first part
of our interactive discussion.

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.500
I want to give you a challenge.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.875
And I like to do
this with groups

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:36.300
and just see, if you were to
look at these three images,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.550
how many features
of school can you

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.850
find that are consistent
across these time periods?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.900
And so a "feature" could
be something like the fact

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.420
that there are desks and
kids are sitting at desks

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.140
and those desks are pointing
to the front of the room.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.810
So you can use that
one to get you started.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.610
But just take a moment
to think about that.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.920
And then when you
think of a feature

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.290
that you notice is unchanged,
just raise your hand,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560
and I'll toss you
the microphone.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.370
Yeah, great.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.490
Here we go.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.430
AUDIENCE: Every
student has notebooks--

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.210
traditional notebooks
or schoolwork

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.206
on their desk versus technology.

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:11.039
JEFF WETZLER: Great.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.940
Thanks for getting us started.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.570
What else?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.070
Over here.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.520
AUDIENCE: One-to-many-- so
one teacher at the front

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.510
with multiple students.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.260
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.000
So there's sort of a
broadcast kind of a mode.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.292
Like, the teacher's got it,
the teacher's broadcasting.

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:25.106
Yes.

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:27.160
AUDIENCE: Class sizes
are basically the same.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.710
JEFF WETZLER: Class sizes--
so somewhere between 20

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.070
and 30 or 40 kids in a
room as part of a class.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.220
Can you catch this?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.870
OK.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.490
AUDIENCE: There's no space
really for group interaction.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.230
All the kids are
just looking forward.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.427
And they aren't grouped at all.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:44.260
JEFF WETZLER: Right.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.300
And so that's
conditioning a certain way

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.340
of working and engaging.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.724
You want to toss it over there?

00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:50.224
Oh.

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:52.002
AUDIENCE: Sorry, my bad.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:53.210
JEFF WETZLER: And who's next?

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.015
Because I'll be ready
for the next one.

00:02:55.015 --> 00:02:55.640
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.727
AUDIENCE: So there's
still a classroom.

00:02:57.727 --> 00:02:58.560
JEFF WETZLER: Sorry?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.540
AUDIENCE: There's
still a classroom.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.590
JEFF WETZLER: There's
still a classroom.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.400
It has walls.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.000
It is a room.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.915
You're inside that room.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:06.540
AUDIENCE: All the
kids in the classroom

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.030
are all about the same age.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.840
JEFF WETZLER: The
kids are grouped.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400
They're batched
almost, you could

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
say, in roughly the
same age in the room.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.060
How about one or two more?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.740
Thank you.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.570
That's all right.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.820
Any last observations?

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.800
OK.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.672
AUDIENCE: The classrooms
don't have a lot of windows.

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:25.630
There's a lot of walls.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.830
They're very closed in,
in terms of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.670
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.640
There's almost like a
separation between learning

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.480
and the real world or learning
and the outside world.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.790
I appreciate that.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.290
Good.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.790
OK.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.900
Let's do two more--
these two over here.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.968
One-- thanks.

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:41.510
AUDIENCE: The kids
would appear to be

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.790
engaged in the same
task at the same time.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.540
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.398
So unlike where you might
see maybe an office here,

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.190
where people are working
on their own thing

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.960
or doing their own
thing, everyone's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.467
kind of being asked to do the
same thing at the same time.

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:56.550
AUDIENCE: I see diversity.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.470
There's not much ethnic
diversity in the classroom.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.220
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.650
There's kind of sameness,
or you might even

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.070
say separation or segregation
in terms of the populations

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.930
in the room, as well.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.772
Some groups get
100, 200 features

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:11.730
that you could imagine.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.740
But it's really
striking, when you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.240
think about the differences in
all these other sectors, just

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.899
the number of features
that really are unchanged.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.940
One of the things that
we often talk about

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.450
are that systems achieve what
they're designed to achieve.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.060
And so you could look at this
as a system that's been designed

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.620
to achieve something.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.500
And you might even say it
is achieving what it's been

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.022
designed to achieve, as well.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.980
And so the next question
I want to just open up

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.820
for conversation is, if we were
to almost reverse engineer,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.580
what is the system
designed to achieve?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.260
If you were to try
to design a system

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.103
to achieve a set of
outcomes and that system

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:46.520
had all the features
that you just

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.140
named in it, in terms of kids
that maybe looked roughly

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.010
the same age, facing a teacher,
inside a room that's separated

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.390
from the outside world--

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.500
those are design features,
you could almost imagine.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.430
What's the outcome?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.030
So what outcome do you think
that this type of system

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.775
is designed to achieve, whether
for kids or for society?

00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:08.650
AUDIENCE: Conformity.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.430
JEFF WETZLER: Conformity.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.930
OK.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.750
Can you say a little
bit more about that?

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.790
It appears to be a very
uniform environment.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.590
They're all doing
the same thing.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.360
It seems like it's
a very narrow scope.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.070
There's not much room
for differentiation

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.570
as an individual person
in these environments.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.740
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.115
So it's almost
like it's designed

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.250
to socialize people
to be a certain way

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.025
and to act a certain way and to
maybe even conform to authority

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.150
or follow directions or
different things like that.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.640
Yeah.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.057
AUDIENCE: This
actually piggybacks

00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:36.790
on what he just said, but it's
almost like an assembly line.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.210
It's like it's
training people to,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.450
you would assume, to do the
exact same thing when they

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.620
get out of this environment.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.370
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.100
And so it's helping
almost masses of people

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.792
be ready to do kind of
standardized types of jobs.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.250
The other thing that I think
is relevant about the assembly

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.440
line point is that it's
also a very efficient way

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.560
to get lots of people in.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.200
And so this model
came about at a time

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.033
when we needed to take
lots and lots of kids

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:05.350
who might have been in rural
communities or not in school.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.480
And it's been a very,
very efficient model

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.140
to give lots and lots of
people access to education.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.460
Ready?

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.830
OK.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.330
AUDIENCE: It's also
kind of designed

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.598
to build competition
internally, because everyone's

00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:19.640
learning the same things.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.990
Everyone's doing the same thing.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.020
So you want to see who's
different, but not really

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.808
different, just more
competitive in the same aspect.

00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:27.600
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.080
So it's designed almost
to create an individual,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.060
individualistic orientation
in people-- like,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.350
how do I get ahead--

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.630
as contrasted with maybe a
more collaborative teamwork

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.500
kind of orientation.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.710
Yes?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.410
AUDIENCE: It teaches
the students--

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.110
or it trains the students to
receive information rather than

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.740
generate it or question it--

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.170
that sort of mono-directional
[INAUDIBLE] transfer.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.060
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.030
It's basically training
and conditioning people

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.740
to be passive recipients.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.740
Take it in from somebody else
who has the answer, as opposed

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.670
to generating the
answer yourself.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.328
Yeah.

00:06:57.328 --> 00:06:58.370
AUDIENCE: Also, I think--

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.787
I don't know the
right way to word

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.560
this-- but to maintain
the status quo,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.190
it's easy for educators and for
school districts-- the system's

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.390
already in place,
so it's easy just

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.440
to keep doing what they've
been doing for a long time.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.210
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.980
And you could think about
that on many levels--

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.480
maintaining the status quo in
terms of how schools function,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.600
how societies function,
how power is distributed

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.180
in society-- a whole range of
different aspects of the status

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.597
quo that can get preserved
when you take a bunch of people

00:07:19.597 --> 00:07:22.100
and say, conform, listen,
there's an authority figure--

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.790
all of that.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.550
Absolutely.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.050
Good.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.840
So I want to ask
you, if you think

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.910
about all these
different outcomes

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.030
that you just identified that
school is preparing people for

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.460
and you would contrast
that with what it takes

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.803
to be successful at Google,
just as an example, what

00:07:37.803 --> 00:07:38.720
are your observations?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.050
What are your reflections about
similarities or differences

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.570
between what our
mainstream model of school

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.180
is setting people
up to do and what

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.360
it takes to be successful
in an environment like here?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.470
Ready?

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.320
AUDIENCE: I'd say it
contrasts in the way

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.970
that here, we reward
strategic thinking,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.970
thinking outside of the box,
going against the status quo,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.580
thinking outside of--

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.910
developing cutting-edge ideas,
whereas this is not that.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.080
This is conforming to a single
form of teaching and receiving.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.830
JEFF WETZLER: Yes.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.538
So if the whole point
is that we actually

00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:17.210
need to think beyond today,
think beyond the box,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.078
and yet we're teaching
kids inside a box

00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:20.870
to follow authority
and listen to a teacher

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.610
and take things
in and not create,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.920
there's a really important
gap or contrast there.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.093
Thanks for starting that.

00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:27.510
Other reflections
or observations?

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.010
Ready?

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.440
AUDIENCE: Here at
Google, you kind of

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.340
have to explore your
own solutions a lot more

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.580
and figure them out.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.240
And then if you need help,
you ask the authority on how

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.809
to guide you, whereas in
the classroom environment,

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.760
it's more like, hey, I
don't know the answer.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.010
And then someone tells
you what the answer is.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.240
JEFF WETZLER: There's
someone who has the answer.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.698
And their job is
to give it to you,

00:08:49.698 --> 00:08:51.300
and your job is to
take it from them

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.010
and do something with
it, as opposed to you've

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.968
got to figure out how to
navigate your own path

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.130
and find your own answer.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.130
Absolutely.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.630
Yeah?

00:09:01.278 --> 00:09:03.570
AUDIENCE: So I disagree
[INAUDIBLE] with other answers.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.010
JEFF WETZLER: Can you
just talk into here?

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.510
Sorry.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.210
Go ahead.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.890
AUDIENCE: I disagree a
little bit with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.190
JEFF WETZLER: Say more.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.790
Yeah.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.090
AUDIENCE: I think especially
at junior levels--

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.640
actually even at senior levels--

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.090
you're given an assignment,
and you have to complete it.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.000
And school is very good
at making people receive

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.250
an assignment and complete it.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.000
JEFF WETZLER: Yep.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.750
So there are ways in
which this actually

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.790
does set you up to be
able to take direction,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.140
follow direction, do it.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.670
Good.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.252
Any reactions to that or other
comments or observations?

00:09:33.252 --> 00:09:34.710
AUDIENCE: I think
a core difference

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.600
in the kinds of assignments
we would get here

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.300
is that we have many unknown
unknowns in which there

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.622
might be no one to go out
and get the answer from.

00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:43.830
You would need to dig in
and actually find the answer

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.510
to an abstract problem.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.132
And that doesn't really
fit into the kind of model

00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:50.340
that you would normally get
in a classroom assignment

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.758
in a traditional school.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.300
JEFF WETZLER: So while it may
be true that school sets you up

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.917
to do assignments, what's the
nature of the assignment that's

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:57.500
required here?

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.290
I think that's important.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.590
Yes?

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.670
Did you also have one?

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.212
AUDIENCE: I would
also say, even when

00:10:01.212 --> 00:10:02.970
people are given
assignments at Google,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.180
it's understood that you might
possibly go back and say,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.380
we need to change the
parameters of this assignment.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.510
It's not necessarily
set in stone.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.400
Or you might find
something to be impossible,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.960
whereas in a school,
you can't just--

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.690
if you get math homework,
you can't declare your math

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.990
homework to be impossible
or think you need

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.257
to do different math homework.

00:10:17.257 --> 00:10:18.090
JEFF WETZLER: Right.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.005
So you actually might
almost be expected

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:21.630
to question the
assignment or to change

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.680
the parameters of
the assignment,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.940
et cetera, which is often
not the case at school.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.700
You're sort of
evaluated and graded on,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.830
did I do the assignment as
given within those parameters?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.570
Great.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.750
AUDIENCE: So I want to take
a maybe less cynical approach

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.040
and think that maybe the
system, if you contextualize it

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.400
with the scarcity of information
that's available around you

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.580
at that time, is actually
a really efficient system

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.960
to get people to integrate
well with society

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.430
with a baseline of knowledge
that's difficult-- now

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.210
with the internet and access
to libraries and resources,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.220
you can say that,
OK, yeah, we need

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.080
better sources of information.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.940
We need more different
styles of learning.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.872
But I think this is probably
the best that we could do.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:06.580
JEFF WETZLER: At the
time, you're saying?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.120
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.025
Did you want to react to that?

00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:09.040
AUDIENCE: And even
in most places now,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.665
it's probably still
the best we can do.

00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:11.932
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:13.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
if I can kind of

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.310
rephrase what you're
saying-- tell me

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.490
if you think this is accurate.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.540
But basically,
you're saying, this

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.030
is a system that is really
well-designed for people

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.447
who don't have a really large
amount of knowledge compared

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.072
to the people they're
interacting with,

00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:24.740
like their teachers,
compared to Google,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.532
where you expect that
everyone has a really

00:11:26.532 --> 00:11:27.680
high baseline of knowledge.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.347
AUDIENCE: And that
baseline of knowledge

00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:30.560
is garnered from some place.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.370
JEFF WETZLER: And that
baseline of knowledge

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.220
is garnered from some place.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.720
Yeah.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.660
And I think
particularly at the time

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.850
when this model came
about, to your point,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.210
when information was scarce,
when it wasn't democratically

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.280
distributed, when we
couldn't take out our phones

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.030
and look up many, many
different things--

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.030
it was really efficient
to have somebody who has

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.620
the information to pass it on.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.680
And also to your point,
that's true in certain places

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.400
at certain moments, as well.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.920
But it's also true
that information

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.312
is far more available now.

00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:56.770
And knowledge is
far more available

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.467
than it ever was before.

00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.800
And I think that's a good segue.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.200
Our core observation
is that we've

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.230
got a delivery model of
schooling that was perfectly

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.450
designed for a time
that's now passed.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.390
And so the question is, what are
the kinds of shifts and changes

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.510
that we would need to make in
our education delivery model

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.990
and schooling, so to
speak, to actually

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.780
make it more relevant
to be able to foster

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.670
in kids the kinds of
habits and competencies

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.500
and things like that
that you all described

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.660
were necessary to thrive
at a place like Google,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.390
and also, maybe more broadly,
to even change the world in ways

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.280
that we don't even
know yet right now?

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.310
So within our own
organization, Transcend,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.680
we think about a set of what
we call leaps that we think

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.210
that schools need to make.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.197
I won't go through them all.

00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:41.530
But they include things like,
what's school going after?

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.337
In a world where
knowledge was scarce,

00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:45.670
learning a lot of things and
learning a lot of knowledge

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.330
was important.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.848
In a world where we can now
access lots of knowledge,

00:12:48.848 --> 00:12:50.140
we need to learn how to create.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.580
We need to learn how to
question assignments.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.788
We need to learn how to
change parameters, et cetera.

00:12:53.788 --> 00:12:55.300
So this first leap
is literally even

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.970
the objectives of
what's going on.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.470
The third one on
the list is around,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.762
what's the role of the student?

00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:02.220
Is the student a
passive recipient,

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.887
or is the student
someone who's actually

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:06.100
going to take charge of
their own learning, someone

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.250
who's going to actually chart
their own path, et cetera?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.150
Several of you noticed
that in the pictures,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.600
there was one teacher
to many students.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.810
And often, that teacher has to
wear many, many different hats.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.440
They have to instruct.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.628
They have to tend
to social needs.

00:13:20.628 --> 00:13:22.420
They have to meet kids
who might be behind.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.490
They have to challenge kids
who are ahead, et cetera.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.610
Why does it have to be that way?

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.152
We actually could
differentiate roles

00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:29.740
of adults who could play many
different roles, some of which

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.890
are teachers, some of which may
be people who technically work

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.432
outside the school.

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:35.890
We didn't talk a
lot about parents,

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.390
but one of the
things that we didn't

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.340
see in any of the pictures
was family members

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.720
or parents or caregivers.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.220
And the traditional
design of school

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.790
often keeps parents and
family members at a distance

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.670
and sort of says, the
teacher's here to do the work,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.107
you guys can do whatever
you want to do, et cetera.

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.690
So there's a number
of different leaps

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.530
that we hypothesize need
to happen for schools to be

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.170
producing kids that are going
to be more ready for where

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.040
the world is today and
what the future demands.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.290
I think it's probably more
helpful and more compelling

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.007
for me to show you what
some of those things

00:14:07.007 --> 00:14:09.340
look like in action, as opposed
to try to describe them.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.910
So I want to show you just
a couple of short videos

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.513
that actually put this in the
words of kids and educators,

00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:15.930
because I think
the way that we're

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.140
going to make these
leaps is going to be,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.890
kids are going to lead
us there, educators

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.820
are going to lead
us there, schools

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.110
are going to lead us there.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.030
So I want to show you
a couple of videos.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.540
And after each video, I want
to ask you to just be thinking

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.660
about, what do you notice here?

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.410
What strikes you as
potentially different?

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.910
And what's the
significance of that?

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.710
So maybe be thinking
about that question.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.900
This first video
is from a partner

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.570
that Transcend started working
with several years ago called

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.940
Achievement First,
who runs schools

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.310
in New York and Connecticut
and Rhode Island.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.712
And they wanted to
rethink the school--

00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:48.420
they wanted to rethink
their school model

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.170
to basically produce
the kinds of outcomes

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.795
that you all were talking about
so that their kids could really

00:14:52.795 --> 00:14:54.550
be the best-prepared
kids in the world.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.170
And one dimension of the
school model has to do with,

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.780
how do we put kids at the center
of pursuing their own dreams

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.410
and goals?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.660
So whereas a traditional
design of school

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.330
is almost irrespective of
what a kid's unique dreams

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.140
and goals is--

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.973
it's like, what's the
teacher doing, what do

00:15:08.973 --> 00:15:10.830
we have to study, et cetera--

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.258
in this design project, we
said, what if we flipped that?

00:15:14.258 --> 00:15:16.050
What if the kid was at
the center, and then

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.958
everything else
was trying to say,

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.750
how do we help that
kid's dreams come true?

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.080
So you won't see
the total model,

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.170
but you hear a little
bit about this.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.535
And then I'm interested
in your observations.

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:24.288
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:26.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.768
- When we really think
about scholars as a whole

00:15:29.768 --> 00:15:31.810
and their strengths and
the things that they love

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.810
and the people that they love,
bringing us all to the table

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.100
is just so powerful.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.370
It says that we care
about you here at school,

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.030
we care about you beyond school.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.870
And I think that that sends
the message with Dream Team.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:48.060
- But today, we're going to
be discussing my strengths.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.520
I think empathy means
having love for others,

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.420
it caring for others, helping
others out when they need it.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.500
Sometimes when I'm around
my grandma, I see how she--

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.230
she believes in God.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.420
I do, too.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.860
But she, like, really
believes in God.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.120
And she's always helping others,
either if it's-- at least

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.040
giving someone some money.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.560
You do that, too, Daddy.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.060
You give me some money
to give to the homeless.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.090
- The concept of
the Dream Teams is

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.670
trying to have more
student agency,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.270
to have them be the drivers
of what's important to them

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.810
in life, because what we've
learned over the years

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.680
is that, at some point,
the school falls away.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.560
Even many of the adults
become at least less present

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.180
in a daily way in a kid's life.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.230
They go off to college.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.650
They go off into the world.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.890
And they've got to have
a sense of self that's

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.330
going to carry them forward.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.970
- Hello, and welcome to
my Dream Team meeting.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.700
This is a place where
I share my goals,

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.300
and I tell you my dreams
and the strengths that

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.340
make me to be me.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.340
I'm grateful that
you guys came here

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.180
to spend your time
to hear my dream--

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.520
- The experiences that I've
noticed with the children--

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.030
they all bring a
little something into--

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.109
a little piece of
themselves into it.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.510
And they run the
meetings themselves.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.849
So it's nice to see my children
actually speaking out and just

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.670
adding their own personalities
to their own meetings.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.768
- Thank you.

00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:25.060
- The purpose of Dream Teams
are to be more student-led

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.859
and student-centered.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.140
So scholars get an
opportunity where

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.220
they get to shine in the
meeting to, A, practice

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.520
their public speaking
abilities and to actually

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.150
own their progress.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.260
- It's really hard to
pass [INAUDIBLE] week,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.120
because you have to be at
the top of one of the sticks.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.130
Five.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.400
So there's bars that
you have to finish.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.582
And there's-- there's sometimes
seven seven [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:52.582 --> 00:17:54.790
- I see improvement from
the last Dream Team meeting.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.310
- I do.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.902
- Definitely.

00:17:55.902 --> 00:17:57.319
- Especially in
the speaking loud.

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:58.660
No?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.200
- We've also seen that
in class, as well--

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.780
just improved speaking out loud.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.810
- When my goal was to get to
mission 5 last [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:15.040
on the Dream Team meeting,
and I finished third.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.820
- [? Anoah ?] knows
what her goals are--

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.830
academic goals,
her passion goals.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.580
And [? Anoah ?] is driving
towards those on her own.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.110
So she's the one that's saying,
oh, I need computer time,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.603
or I want a computer so
I can do my math at home.

00:18:32.603 --> 00:18:34.270
- Can you tell us a
little bit about why

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.580
you're choosing curiosity?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.120
- Because I want to
be focused in STEM

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.710
and ask lots of questions.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.280
And then I can
probably be an engico--

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.780
engineer.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.360
- Well, I think when
we started opening up

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.370
just with simple
questioning, ways

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.190
to get families more
engaged in the conversation,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.590
the investment grew.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.970
And family partnerships
grew as a result of that.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.860
- All my Dream Team
parents have my number.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.610
I get text messages
with screenshots, hey,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.902
is this the homework they're
supposed to be working on?

00:19:07.902 --> 00:19:09.970
And I think we kind of
get rid of that barrier

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.120
where they don't feel
comfortable talking to me.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.710
So I think the purpose is
really to make everyone

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.490
on the same team.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.840
- --they give you feedback?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.530
- They gave me feedback,
because feedback is a gift.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.507
- There we go.

00:19:21.507 --> 00:19:23.080
Yes.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.010
Yes.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.520
- What means a lot to me is
that my dad and my sister

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:36.020
are here to set goals for me
and improve on what I'm doing.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.370
- What about the places you
think we need to set goals?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:43.750
- In reading, you said
that you are proficient.

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:50.270
I'd like to see you advanced
by the end of the year,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.770
because reading is
pretty important.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.960
So I want you to try
harder with reading.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.660
- Right there, can
you explain to me

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.592
what the picture
represent for you?

00:20:02.592 --> 00:20:04.050
- You see scholars
who get up there

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.040
and really feel confident and
have a clear focus on what

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.000
their goals are and what
their strengths are,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.240
and that just feels really good.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:19.260
- My parent was able to see
what I did and how my strengths.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.980
- We are building transferable
life skills for scholars here.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.720
It is really important that
they can be strong scholars

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.675
and academic geniuses.

00:20:29.675 --> 00:20:31.050
But it's more
important that they

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.943
develop into really
strong little people that

00:20:33.943 --> 00:20:36.360
will become big people that
will impact their communities.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.490
And I think that the
life habits that we're

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.118
building in scholars, in terms
of their personal growth,

00:20:41.118 --> 00:20:42.660
the empathy they
show for themselves,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.230
for others, the drive and
persistence that they will need

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.400
to persist to and
through college,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.167
and to just learn more
about who they are as people

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.000
so that they can be
stronger at what they're

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.430
driving towards in life--

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.700
and that is super powerful.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.680
And I just wish more
schools were doing that.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.040
- Like you just was
talking, you never give up.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.850
Keep doing hard work
and complete your goals.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.050
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:09.550
Cool.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.070
So I wanted to just ask you
all, in addition to how cute

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.263
the kids are, what did you
notice when you contrast that

00:21:16.263 --> 00:21:18.430
to some of the kind of
images of school and concepts

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.030
that we talked about?

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.050
You want to start here?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.330
Yes.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.590
AUDIENCE: I wasn't sure
how heavy that was.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.430
I loved that the kid was
sitting in the big chair,

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.050
and everyone was
sitting around them.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.008
And they were the boss.

00:21:31.008 --> 00:21:33.500
It reminds me of "Boss
Baby"-- the books.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.900
And I'm like, yep, that's
my house right there.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.360
JEFF WETZLER: Can you say what
you think the significance

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:37.890
of that might be?

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:37.962
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:21:37.962 --> 00:21:38.370
Oh, sure.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:38.870
Yes.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.820
So to me, it felt like
they were in control.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.870
And they were presenting.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.500
And everybody else
was listening to them.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.068
And I thought that was just
so respectful to the child.

00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:50.860
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.260
It really intends to flip
who's in charge of one's

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.552
learning here in the situation.

00:21:55.552 --> 00:21:56.052
Good.

00:21:56.052 --> 00:21:56.940
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.670
Anybody else have
an observation,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.270
something that struck you?

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.400
Yeah?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.087
AUDIENCE: I know earlier,
you've gone from many children

00:22:05.087 --> 00:22:06.920
to one educator, and
now you have one child,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.270
many people working with them.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.870
JEFF WETZLER: Exactly.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.720
So one of the other things
that Dream Teams does--

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.890
a lot of Dream Teams will
have parents or maybe

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.370
an aunt or an uncle or grandma
or a pastor or a coach.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.310
There's a lot of adults in kids'
lives who have a lot to offer

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.047
and who have a lot
of love for kids.

00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:24.380
And the typical design of
school kind of leaves that all

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.540
on the sidelines and says it's
the job of a teacher, which,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.457
by the way, puts a ton
of pressure on teachers

00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:30.620
and makes teachers'
jobs super, super hard.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.500
If we could actually flip
that and tap into all the love

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.567
that's around a kid--

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:36.650
you could even see that
the sister who was saying,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.580
I have something
to offer to you,

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.023
I want to challenge
you, as well--

00:22:39.023 --> 00:22:40.940
imagine what becomes
possible when you open up

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.773
all those other resources
that are typically

00:22:42.773 --> 00:22:43.685
sidelined right now.

00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:46.040
AUDIENCE: Just an observation--

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.640
everything in those
interactions was so positive.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.822
And if you think about
parent-teacher conferences,

00:22:50.822 --> 00:22:52.280
or if you get called
by the school,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.363
you're going to talk about
what your kid is doing,

00:22:54.363 --> 00:22:57.380
oftentimes it is only because
something bad is happening,

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.380
or there needs to be an
intervention or remediation.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.820
And in this case, it was
the opposite of that.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.720
And so I just think
that was great.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.030
JEFF WETZLER: Awesome.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:05.270
Thanks.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.312
Let's take one more, if
there's any last comment.

00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:09.253
Yes?

00:23:09.253 --> 00:23:10.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
my observation was

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.350
that it was very goal-oriented.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.370
If you ask my 8-year-old,
"What are your goals,"

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.110
he would have no idea
what you're talking about,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.610
number one.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.620
And number two was,
parent-teacher conferences,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.980
like you said, you're talking
about the child instead

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.200
of involving the child
in the conversation.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.325
When we asked the teacher,
"Should the child come,"

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.950
they're like, no,
you guys are fine.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.420
We're just going to
talk about the child.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.295
JEFF WETZLER: As if the
child's participation

00:23:34.295 --> 00:23:36.840
in their own learning isn't
maybe the most important thing.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.340
Right.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:37.910
Exactly.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.282
I think it recognizes
that kids do have dreams.

00:23:40.282 --> 00:23:41.240
And kids do have goals.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.300
And it's possible to tap into
them if we re-orient the way

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.660
that school is structured.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.920
So I want to just
show you one, maybe

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.990
two other clips of older kids.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.820
So this next one is an example
from a partner of Transcend's

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.650
called Valor Collegiate,
which is based in Nashville,

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.830
Tennessee but now
has a model that is

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.670
spreading all over the country.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.540
And among the eight great
leaps that I talked about,

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.920
the first one was
around, really,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.390
what is school going after.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.300
And so what Valor
is saying is, if we

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.888
were to go beyond
academics, if we're

00:24:12.888 --> 00:24:14.930
trying to help kids actually
build skills related

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.240
to relationships, skills
related to knowing themselves,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.490
skills related to their
identity, which is going to be

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.220
pretty important, given
the diversity of the world

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.830
and workplaces and
how often they're

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.913
going to need to reinvent
themselves, potentially,

00:24:25.913 --> 00:24:27.050
as the economy changes--

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:27.842
what would it take?

00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:29.900
What would it look
like to actually build

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.080
that in scholars, in kids?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.680
And they have tried
to integrate academics

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.430
with a lot of the
really interesting youth

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.890
development and even
therapeutic practices

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.080
that you might see when
kids are sharing in circles.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.810
And so in this model, kids have
a whole curriculum that they

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.680
self-direct through, where they
go through a set of different

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.690
kinds of exercises--
you'll see one here--

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.430
at their own pace,
at their own time,

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.470
but then bring that to
share it in a group.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.232
And it's actually the
group that decides

00:24:56.232 --> 00:24:58.190
has the kid done the
work, and does the kid get

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.360
to progress and go forward?

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.680
- I would title my life
"Going Through the Struggles."

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.750
And my mom said that she would
name it "The Butterfly Reaching

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.920
the Top of the Mountain."

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.375
And then my dad said
"Overcoming the Challenges."

00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:16.420
And Miss Hodge said
"The Joy in the Storm."

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.250
The story's about my family.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:18.800
We're Muslim.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.670
And we moved here pretty early.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.420
But we were all
born in Kurdistan.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.860
And a lot of people ask us about
how it's like, where's better--

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.650
here or Kurdistan--

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:38.510
and they really ask about
the food and how we make it.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.130
Something that
really surprised me

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.240
was what my dad
one time told me--

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.520
that I put my mind
to everything,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.730
and when I do that, I
accomplish my goals.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.690
So when I was in
my last school, I

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.490
didn't really share
anything about myself,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.910
because I was shy that
they would make fun of me.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.400
But now I feel
really comfortable

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.550
with my [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:10.580
And I named my life "Going
Through the Struggles,"

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.140
because there's a situation
back in Kurdistan.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:20.726
And I [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:24.820
[CRYING] And it's
hard to do this

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.290
because I still [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.471
It's really hard
to go through this.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.960
And I really wouldn't
change anything about me,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.700
because it's my identity.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.200
And I want to be who I am.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.315
And I wouldn't be who
I am without you guys

00:26:46.315 --> 00:26:47.340
or without my family.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.430
So thank you.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.600
- Lana, thank you for
sharing your life story.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.290
I saw a lot of love being
sent to Lana as she shared.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.350
That was very brave.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.910
Are there any resonances,
anything that stuck

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.150
with you in Lana's life story?

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.430
Pearl?

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.180
- I understand how difficult
it must be, because--

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.050
I've never moved from
country to country.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.910
So I can't relate
with you with that.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.840
But I have moved around
a lot in my life.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.960
And we have been insanely poor.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.590
And we've also been
mildly rich before.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.100
But we've had so many ups
and lows with our family.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.930
And I could connect
with you with that,

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:37.830
because I understand how hard
it is going from place to place

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.620
and just how difficult
it is to deal with that.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.080
And I understand that.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.140
I understand, and
I also appreciate

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.410
that you have the
courage to say that

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.180
in front of a lot of people.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.098
I understand.

00:27:54.098 --> 00:27:54.990
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.110
Similarly, I'm just interested
in thoughts and observations.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.420
Imagine that this
was a part of school,

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.470
that these kinds of experiences
happened literally every week

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.878
with kids sharing, bringing
this kind of vulnerability,

00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:09.420
building these kinds
of relationships

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.560
across lines of difference.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.760
What did you notice here?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.510
And what might be
significant about it?

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.500
Yes.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.900
AUDIENCE: The immediate
acceptance and love

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.750
she felt from her peers after
sharing her brief story, which

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.850
I think is counter to what
you hear about schools today.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.690
Kids are bullies.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.520
Kids are mean.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.380
They are not nice to each other.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.450
And you could really
see the connection

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.560
amongst the students.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.352
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:28:35.352 --> 00:28:38.720
And what do you see as
significant about that?

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.100
AUDIENCE: I think
it's teaching them

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.350
a skill set to be
accepting and loving

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.750
at a very young
age and connection

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:52.070
to their personal identity, to
not be ashamed of who they are.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.570
Yeah.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.612
JEFF WETZLER: Absolutely.

00:28:53.612 --> 00:28:55.660
These are things that
are not the typical aim.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.888
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:57.888 --> 00:28:59.680
Literally, the question
I wanted to ask you

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.810
is, how old are these kids?

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.610
Because I, as a
28-year-old woman,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.980
don't even feel that
connected to my identity.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.653
It's pretty crazy to see
[INAUDIBLE] speak so proudly.

00:29:09.653 --> 00:29:10.570
JEFF WETZLER: Exactly.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.705
It shows what's possible
when we ask this of kids

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:14.080
and we offer them
the opportunity

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.853
to do this kind of work.

00:29:15.853 --> 00:29:17.020
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to--

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.450
just something that's super
just core and super basic--

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.810
just the way that the
room is structured.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.437
And in a traditional classroom,
all the students are facing.

00:29:26.437 --> 00:29:28.770
One student is front of the
class, which can be actually

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:29.960
really intimidating.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.630
And I just liked
how the students

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.760
were sitting in a circle,
because it's not like,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.990
oh, I'm not--

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.220
I'm with you.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.670
I'm not against you.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.220
I'm not here to judge you.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.377
I'm here with you.

00:29:40.377 --> 00:29:40.960
I'm listening.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.920
And I like how when kids are--

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.770
they're listening thoughtfully.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.980
They're listening curiously
and responding thoughtfully.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.330
And when they do that,
I like how they get up,

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.780
and they actually are physically
engaging with the person

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.620
to relate to them.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.360
So I thought that was
super interesting, as well.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:58.720
JEFF WETZLER: Thank you.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.220
Yeah.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.970
And such a contrast
to some of the images

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.520
we saw earlier about
the traditional design.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.770
I think you make a really
important point about space,

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.340
as well, What does that say
about who matters and why

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.300
and all of it?

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.110
Yes.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.152
AUDIENCE: I like that
there was a established way

00:30:13.152 --> 00:30:18.130
to provide real-time feedback
with their finger waves.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.330
They're getting that
instant validation

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.380
while they're speaking.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.297
JEFF WETZLER: Exactly.

00:30:23.297 --> 00:30:25.563
The kind of rituals and
routines and protocols.

00:30:25.563 --> 00:30:27.480
And I that brings up an
important point, which

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.610
is, it's not enough just to
say, let's put kids in a circle.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.640
Let's just see what happens.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.085
Every aspect of it is
a design challenge.

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:37.710
All those rituals and different
things like that were designed.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.960
And someone built those, and
someone prototyped those,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.520
and someone tested
those to the point

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.080
where they felt like
this can actually work.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.497
And so I think it
illustrates some

00:30:44.497 --> 00:30:47.730
of what we would refer to as the
R&amp;D required to actually build

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.922
this in schools.

00:30:48.922 --> 00:30:50.880
AUDIENCE: I guess one
question I have for you--

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.390
because the presentation is
structured as schools don't

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.650
do this, and we should do it.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.943
And I've had a little bit
of a different experience

00:30:58.943 --> 00:31:00.360
in our public
school system, where

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.512
they do have a psychologist
that comes in and grabs

00:31:03.512 --> 00:31:05.220
a group of kids and
brings them to a room

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.760
and has conversations like this.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.610
So I guess my question for you--

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.960
school's changed a lot
since I've been there.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.957
How do you see public
schools-- are they moving

00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:13.790
into this direction?

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.350
Are they starting to
implement these features?

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.570
Or is it region by
region or the more

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.070
progressive regions
are doing things

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.720
like this, where there's
others that are more

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.060
"behind the times," I guess?

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.852
JEFF WETZLER: There's
definitely variation.

00:31:24.852 --> 00:31:25.980
And I'm glad you raised it.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.080
I think that there's all kinds
of really promising practices

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.260
and pilots and innovations that
even individual teachers are

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.500
doing in their classrooms,
schools are trying, et cetera.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.160
And all of that is
really positive.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.670
And I think we want to
essentially put wind

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.110
at the back of all of those
different kinds of efforts.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.500
And yet, at the same
time, oftentimes they

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.290
get constrained, because they're
operating still in the core

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.727
underlying structure of school.

00:31:50.727 --> 00:31:53.310
And so one of the things that
we work on-- and I'll talk about

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.450
this more in a moment--

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.360
is, how do we
actually fully release

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.040
some of those
constraints so that more

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.915
of these kinds of
experiences can be possible

00:32:00.915 --> 00:32:02.610
for kids and for educators?

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.950
Any last comments on this?

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.806
Yes, we'll take this
as the last comment.

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:11.846
AUDIENCE: I really like
that it has to do with--

00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:13.710
we focus on academic
development.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.877
But really, this is about
development of yourself,

00:32:15.877 --> 00:32:17.460
which I think is a
really great focus.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.970
I think in terms of a
really diverse country,

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.197
we often face--

00:32:22.197 --> 00:32:24.030
we're talking about
diversity as we're older

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.810
and trying to
solve those issues.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.860
But if you focus on
it at a younger age--

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.748
as a first generation
Asian-American,

00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:33.540
I tried to hide that
part of me growing up,

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.498
because that's who you
are when you're a child.

00:32:35.498 --> 00:32:36.668
You're trying to fit in.

00:32:36.668 --> 00:32:39.210
And so if we can embrace who we
are and bring it all together

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.910
at a younger age, can
we conquer the issues

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.800
with diversity in the long term?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.028
So I think this is amazing.

00:32:45.028 --> 00:32:45.820
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.330
We see and experience
and hear so much right

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.310
now in our country
and in our world

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.830
about divides and polarization.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.805
And if we can
actually have schools

00:32:54.805 --> 00:32:57.180
be a place where kids are
actually learning that they can

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.850
bring their whole selves and
cross bridges and respect

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.927
one another, et
cetera, how much better

00:33:01.927 --> 00:33:03.510
could the world be
if we could do that

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.530
starting from a young age?

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.730
I really appreciate that point.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.110
And also, I think,
to your point,

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.750
even if all we were caring
about was academic achievement--

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.042
which we believe is only part
of what needs to matter--

00:33:12.042 --> 00:33:14.130
but even if that was all
we were caring about,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.780
what we're starting to find is
that these kinds of experiences

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.790
can allow kids to
be in school more

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.100
in what we call their
executive state, as opposed

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.360
to their survival state.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.680
So if kids are feeling
traumatized or kids are feeling

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.180
not free to be themselves, that
gets in the way of learning,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.560
because that's what they're
going to be thinking about,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.050
as opposed to thinking about
what's going on actually

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:32.830
in the content.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.890
And so both to improve even
academic learning and then

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.420
for all the reasons
you just said,

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.382
these kinds of
experiences really matter.

00:33:40.382 --> 00:33:42.340
If we had more time, I
was hoping to show you--

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.830
but we can send some links
afterwards-- some older

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.620
examples, as well.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.340
So there's actually a
really exciting partner that

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.980
we're working with in Brooklyn
called Brooklyn STEAM,

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.100
which is basically a hub model,
where kids from lots of other

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.010
different schools come and spend
a good chunk of their junior

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.630
and senior year learning
STEAM-related content,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.360
but embedded in the
Brooklyn Naval Yard so that

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.000
they're actually doing the
real work of coding, of design,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
of culinary arts-- a range
of different things--

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.699
with employers and can graduate
not just with a high school

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.520
degree but also with a social
network, which really matters,

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.290
and also with real
skills that they

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.693
can use to earn money during
college, before college,

00:34:19.693 --> 00:34:21.860
after college-- all those
different kinds of things.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.989
And so it's a really
exciting model

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.070
that, if you're
interested, I would even

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.479
encourage you all to check out.

00:34:25.479 --> 00:34:28.150
And there's a whole bunch
of other ones, as well.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.639
We didn't talk as much
about technology here.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.520
But a lot of interesting models
are really engaging and using

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.230
technology not just to
help kids access content,

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.320
but to actually
create and communicate

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.570
with ways to learn far beyond
the walls of the school,

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.127
as well.

00:34:42.127 --> 00:34:43.960
I thought I would take
just a couple minutes

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.590
and share with you about
our organization, Transcend.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.710
Our mission is to enable
communities to imagine, create,

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.989
and spread these kinds of
learning environments--

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:54.820
extraordinary
learning environments,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.290
equitable learning environments.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.760
And we do that really by playing
two major roles in the field.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.260
One is that we're
trying to increase

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.680
the supply of great options.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.010
So we just showed you
snippets out of two models.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.427
But we're trying to increase
the supply of options of what

00:35:08.427 --> 00:35:10.180
we call catalytic models--

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.478
models that are getting
great results-- not just

00:35:12.478 --> 00:35:14.020
academic results,
but the other kinds

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.550
of results that we were
just talking about.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.620
Sometimes we talk about
the triple wow factor.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.677
So one wow is kids
wow-- like, wow,

00:35:20.677 --> 00:35:23.010
I cannot wait to come to
school, I cannot wait to learn,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.130
this is exciting.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.610
A second wow is
the families' wow--

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.610
like, this is so good for
my kid, I love my kid,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.860
my kid is loved, they are
growing, they're challenged,

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.940
it's rigorous.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.120
And the third is educators,
because the traditional design

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.080
of school is not easy
for educators, as well.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.705
So if we can create models that
are getting verified results

00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.330
but also having this
triple wow factor,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.025
that's one piece of what
we call a catalytic model.

00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:45.010
A second is that
it sparks demand.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.960
And so all of these
examples, and many others

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.000
that we work with, people
see them and they say,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.708
we want that in our
communities, as well.

00:35:50.708 --> 00:35:53.430
And so that's part of
creating the wave of change,

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.090
to accelerate it, to your point.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.110
And the third are,
can they be codified

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.360
in ways that make it sharable?

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.460
So to the point of, even
all those little rituals

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.620
and different things like that,
someone had to think them up.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.640
Someone had to write them down.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.170
Someone had to try
them, et cetera.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.340
There's no reason
why everyone has

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.670
to reinvent the wheel on that.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.420
How do we codify that
so that other people

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.540
can borrow from that?

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.460
So one piece of
what Transcend does

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.800
is, we work deeply with
partners across the country that

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.283
work with young people to try
to create these catalytic models

00:36:18.283 --> 00:36:20.200
so that there are more
options for communities

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.810
that they can learn from, be
inspired by, and borrow from.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.630
The second role that
we play is that we're

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.400
supporting a broader
range of communities

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.197
everywhere to build their demand
and readiness for this work.

00:36:30.197 --> 00:36:31.780
So to the point that
you raised, there

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.863
is some of this happening.

00:36:32.863 --> 00:36:33.640
And that's great.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.950
But we actually think there's
even more latent demand,

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.710
like what kids actually want,
the dreams that they actually

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.255
have, what parents
want, et cetera.

00:36:40.255 --> 00:36:42.130
We've started to realize
that we can actually

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.725
work with communities to
build a set of conditions that

00:36:44.725 --> 00:36:46.600
accelerate their movement
in this direction--

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.000
things like conviction
about what really matters;

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.340
clarity about, what are the
kinds of aims beyond just

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.080
knowledge that they
want to be building;

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.400
things like a culture
of innovation,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.733
like you all have here, in
terms of let's try something,

00:36:56.733 --> 00:36:58.970
let's learn from it, let's
keep iterating, et cetera;

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:00.045
things like a coalition.

00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:01.670
So it's not just one
person leading it,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.950
but the change can
actually sustain,

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.492
because parents are part of it,
and employers are part of it,

00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:07.412
committee members are
part of it, et cetera.

00:37:07.412 --> 00:37:09.370
So these are essentially
the two kinds of roles

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.453
that we're trying to play.

00:37:10.453 --> 00:37:12.340
And these are just some
examples of partners

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.870
that we're working with
on both of those fronts.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:14.830
We work with districts.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.800
We work with charter schools.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.380
We work with
independent schools who

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.350
are doing this incredible
innovation work.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.090
And the hope is that
if we can both grow

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.710
the demand and the readiness,
as well as grow the supply,

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.210
we can start to build bridges
so that when a community says,

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.240
all right, now we're ready--

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.910
we can say, oh, here's
a model over here.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.368
We can help make
it faster for them

00:37:32.368 --> 00:37:34.750
to move in that type of
direction, if that makes sense.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.260
And we do that by trying to
invest in three capabilities

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.860
or assets in our organization.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.770
One is a set of design
expertise and tools.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.050
So we have a whole bunch
of people on our team

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.810
who work directly with schools
and are building a set of tools

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.868
that they can use to go through
design processes to learn this.

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:52.660
Two is that we're
building a knowledge hub.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.660
So there's a lot to learn about
what works, what doesn't work,

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.075
in what contexts, et cetera.

00:37:57.075 --> 00:37:58.450
How do we apply
learning science,

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.830
the science of cognition,
neuroscience, et cetera?

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.830
We don't want to just do
this kind of innovation

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.527
willy-nilly, do brainstorming.

00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:05.860
There's a lot that we can learn.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.660
And so we're building
a hub of knowledge

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.130
that people can draw from.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.100
And then the third is a network,
where we actually have schools

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.680
across the country, funders
across the country, talent,

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.630
researchers, et cetera.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.205
We've seen that
change moves fastest

00:38:18.205 --> 00:38:19.330
when networks are involved.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.600
And so we're building
this network, as well.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.850
Those are the three pieces
of what we're trying to do.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:27.000
Any questions or thoughts,
reactions, comments?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.680
AUDIENCE: So I'm
interested in when

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.110
you said it's codified
to make it shareable.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.215
You want it to be so people
don't have to reinvent

00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:34.090
the wheel every time.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:35.160
[INAUDIBLE] makes sense.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.780
How are you doing that?

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.140
Where do you store your
content slash curriculum slash

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.082
resources, materials,
and whatnot?

00:38:42.082 --> 00:38:43.540
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah,
great question.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.172
It's a combination
of different media.

00:38:46.172 --> 00:38:47.880
So some of it is stuff
that we write down

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.650
in documents-- lots
of Google Docs.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.660
Some of it is
videos that we use.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.280
Some of it is
technology platforms

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.405
that people actually start
to interact with things,

00:38:55.405 --> 00:38:57.090
directly using the technology.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:00.120
And some of it is actually
codified through the form

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.360
of learning experiences.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.380
So for example, that second
video that we showed,

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.587
there's a set of training
and learning experiences

00:39:06.587 --> 00:39:08.670
that people can come to
to learn how to facilitate

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.340
that kind of work.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.506
So it's multiple different
kinds of media that we use.

00:39:11.506 --> 00:39:11.942
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:39:11.942 --> 00:39:12.440
Thanks.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.273
JEFF WETZLER: Great.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.160
AUDIENCE: Building
on that question,

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.490
are you typically seeing more
of a bottoms-up approach,

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.950
in the sense of
teachers or educators

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.190
who are ready to
kind of transcend

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.820
or go to that next level?

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.800
Or is it top-down with the
administrator, a district

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.450
superintendent,
principal, et cetera,

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.740
saying, OK, I want to
do this for my school,

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.682
and then kind of layering
your programs on?

00:39:41.682 --> 00:39:43.390
JEFF WETZLER: What we
actually have found

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.870
is that it needs to be both.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.750
So it doesn't work if
it's only top-down,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.162
because people,
quote, "at the top"

00:39:49.162 --> 00:39:51.370
don't have the kind of
insights and direct experience

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.270
and proximity that's
needed to do that.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.665
So a lot of the
experiences that we foster,

00:39:55.665 --> 00:39:57.040
particularly on
when we're trying

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.807
to build demand and
readiness for this,

00:39:58.807 --> 00:40:00.640
directly involve
educators, directly involve

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.050
parents, et cetera.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.850
But folks at the top
create the conditions

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.270
to make this possible, as well.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.590
And so typically, when we do
an engagement with someone,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.408
we are also working with the
CEO or the superintendent

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.450
or different things like
that to create the cover

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.475
and create the permission
for people to innovate.

00:40:19.325 --> 00:40:21.710
I'll take this.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.760
AUDIENCE: So I was curious, in
the research that you've done

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.440
and implementation,
have you found

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.980
that you need to have a
radical approach to cutting out

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:34.480
the current system and trying
to replace it with the goals

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.410
that you'd listed?

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.890
Or do you think there's a way
to do it incrementally that just

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.470
builds upon the current
system but moves it slowly

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.305
towards the goals
that you've listed?

00:40:43.305 --> 00:40:44.930
JEFF WETZLER: So when
we first started,

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.920
we had kind of a purist
ideological approach.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.040
It was like, you had to take
out a blank sheet of paper,

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.498
you had to leave
it all behind, you

00:40:50.498 --> 00:40:52.300
had to design fresh, et cetera.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.430
And we do still
believe that you really

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.470
do need to think about
the total environment.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:57.990
It's like if you were
taking a horse and buggy

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.960
and you were trying to say, how
do we put an engine on that?

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.890
It's just not going to work.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.380
You need to think holistically.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.330
But over time, as we've
worked with schools

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.455
and seen these different
kind of models, what we've

00:41:06.455 --> 00:41:08.290
come to appreciate is
that there's really

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.120
a lot of power and
components of school.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.820
So I don't just mean what we'd
call a point solution, just

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.967
like one curriculum.

00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:15.550
But if you can take
a significant part

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.740
of a kid's experience or
an adult's experience,

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.857
start with that.

00:41:18.857 --> 00:41:19.940
That can make real change.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.460
And that can then open
the door to what's

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.668
the next thing and the next
thing and the next thing.

00:41:23.668 --> 00:41:25.190
And pretty soon,
over several years,

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.440
you can stack together things.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.590
And you step back
and you say, wow,

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.298
that's a radically
different environment.

00:41:29.298 --> 00:41:31.640
But it didn't require gutting
it all from the start.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.723
I appreciate the question.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.993
AUDIENCE: Kind of
following up on that,

00:41:36.993 --> 00:41:38.910
how do you think about
the broader picture of,

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.700
I like this idea of innovating
and changing and making it more

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.800
individual for kids, but what
do you think about the system--

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.920
schools are meant to gear
towards test-- standardized

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.830
testing and getting
into college.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.065
How do you think this type--

00:41:54.065 --> 00:41:55.440
how do you explain
that, I guess,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.880
as you convince schools
to incorporate this in,

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.950
knowing that eventually
these kids need to work

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.378
towards these types of tests?

00:42:03.378 --> 00:42:04.170
JEFF WETZLER: Yeah.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.400
So we can't ignore that.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.427
The stakes for kids
are real in terms

00:42:08.427 --> 00:42:11.010
of what you get on the SAT, and
can you get access to college,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.218
and can you get access to
jobs, and things like that.

00:42:13.218 --> 00:42:15.300
So nothing that
we're trying to do

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.850
is trying to say we should
ignore that, we should pretend

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.998
those things don't
exist, particularly

00:42:19.998 --> 00:42:22.040
when the playing field is
not level for all kids.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.510
Really, kids having
opportunities deeply, deeply

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.260
matters.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.760
So part of the way
we think about it

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.718
is that even if we were
just trying to optimize

00:42:28.718 --> 00:42:31.500
within the current system,
lots of these kinds of designs

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.060
can increase motivation, can
be more efficient for learning,

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.560
et cetera, and just
kind of optimize

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.930
within that current system.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.670
And then at the same time,
there's a number of efforts

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.437
underway to think about
measures of things

00:42:42.437 --> 00:42:44.520
that go beyond the traditional
standardized tests,

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.590
whether those are
social-emotional development,

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:49.350
critical thinking, other
kinds of future-of-work types

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.420
of competencies.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.170
And so that work really
needs to continue.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.870
And as that work
gets more legitimized

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.240
and gets more momentum, I
think it will open up lots

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.440
more pathways for kids, too.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.090
AUDIENCE: So I know you--

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.790
kind of jumping off
of her question,

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.210
you're focusing a lot on
the education system, which

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:07.500
is really nice, obviously.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.360
But I feel like
there's problems that

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.040
exist kind of at
the workforce level,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.010
where people are judged
off of pieces of paper

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.490
with certain scores or
what school you went to

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.970
and stuff like that.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.740
Is there a way to kind of hit
this problem from both ends?

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.290
Instead of just saying, let's
get these educators better

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.540
and make sure the students
are better so that they can

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.610
get a job, but
instead, also say,

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.240
hey, let's try to hire people
in a way that's not necessarily

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.560
just standardized, either?

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.060
JEFF WETZLER: It
absolutely matters.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.340
And I think Google is
among the leaders in kind

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.170
of pushing on that
question and saying,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:42.087
let's not just look at
traditional transcripts

00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:44.170
or where'd you go to school
or that kind of thing,

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.180
but what are the skills?

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.920
But the more that people
follow that lead and do that,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.130
I think the more that
opens up the possibility

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.890
for the K12 system
of schools to feel

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.460
even more confident in
expanding its range of outcomes

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.048
that it's going for, as well.

00:43:58.048 --> 00:43:59.340
I'll leave you with this quote.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.930
"If you always do
what you always did,

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.100
you'll always get
what you always got."

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.058
I think we've talked a
lot about why that's not

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:06.930
good enough for kids and for
society and for workplaces,

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.523
as well.

00:44:07.523 --> 00:44:08.940
And if there's one
message I would

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.700
want to have you take
away, it's possible to do

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.900
something different.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.550
If we design the
system one way, we

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.080
can design the
system another way.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.030
It takes R&amp;D. It takes capacity.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.730
It takes all the things that you
all do in the work that you do.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:21.570
But it's really possible.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.028
And that's what
we're trying to do.

00:44:23.028 --> 00:44:25.785
We would love help in all kinds
of different kinds of ways

00:44:25.785 --> 00:44:26.910
and people to get involved.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.660
So there's a website
up here and whatever.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.813
If you want to get
involved, please join us.

00:44:30.813 --> 00:44:32.730
It's going to take all
of us to get this done.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.540
Thank you.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.890
