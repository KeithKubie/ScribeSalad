00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay guys, I'm going to walk you through the solution to Homework 1,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is basically just getting Google App Engine online.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first thing I do is I got to Chrome.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's see, we're going to download--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we can go to Google--the Google App Engine page.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to assume you've signed up to App Engine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then we basically go to the getting started for--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm using Python 2.7.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Some of you may have more success with 5.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to use this Hello, World example.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And we're going to create these two files.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
One is called helloworld.py,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the other will be called app.yml.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So let's start with the first one. We'll copy this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'll go to my editor, paste this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're going to make this say Udacity, if I recall--Udacity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's go ahead and save this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So I've saved this file.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm going to make the other file.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We can just take the contents from the getting started document here--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
app.yml--we'll put this in a new file,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we'll go ahead and save this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Okay, all is well.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We'll go to my terminal, and we'll go to that directory.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I called it Unit 1 Homework; it's where I save these two files.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You see, there they are.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then to run it locally, it always says we run div_appserver.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the console way of running Google App Engine code.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Many of you are probably using a GUI.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I prefer to use the console version.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It makes it a little bit easier. You don't have to add projects and that sort of stuff.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to run it on a different port.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That's what the P command is for,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because I share this machine with other instructors

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and somebody is already using the default 8080.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And then we just run it in the current directory. That's what period does.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Okay, so this starts up.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It complains a little bit about some missing APIs.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We're not using the image API, so it doesn't matter.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And then we go to our browser,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we can go to local host 8888,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and there we see it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Hello, Udacity.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So all is moving.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We can play around with things a little bit.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If I wanted to change the text here,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can change it, save it, go to Chrome, reload, more exclamation marks--pretty cool.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, when I want to put this online,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
all I do is instead of using div_appserver,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
what I use instead is update app cfg update,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I can run it in my current directory, and this will upload the app.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm not actually going to run this for you because

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
this would override my other homeworks that are already online

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that are--you guys can use for demos.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But basically all I do is I hit Enter here,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and it chatters at me for a little while, and then we're done.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The homework was intended to be very simple,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but I realize that actually getting App Engine running on different platforms can be troublesome,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and getting the Python versions in synch can be troublesome.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I hope you guys have worked through all those things.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And that's it for Homework 1.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
All I wanted to do was get this basic website online.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There it is in my local machine.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And if I were to go to where I've already got it uploaded--

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I think I can go to udacitycs253appspot.com,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
where I've uploaded it prevoiusly,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and there it is--Hello, Udacity.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So all is well. Good job, if you got that.
