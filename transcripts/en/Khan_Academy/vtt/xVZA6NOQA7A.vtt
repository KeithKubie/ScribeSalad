00:00:00.711 --> 00:00:03.113
- [Instructor] We are
told a rocket is launched

00:00:03.113 --> 00:00:04.593
from a platform.

00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:08.770
Its height in meters, x seconds
after the launch is modeled

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.120
by h of x is equal to
negative four times x plus two

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.359
times x minus 18.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.727
Now, the first thing they
ask us is what is the height

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.510
of the rocket at

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.865
the time of launch?

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:25.975
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.851
Well, what is x at the time of launch?

00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:31.398
Well, x is the number of
seconds after the launch, so at

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.918
the time of launch, x
would be equal to zero.

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:37.414
The height of the rocket when
x is equal to zero, they're

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.175
essentially saying,
"Well, what is h of zero?"

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.640
To figure out h of zero, we
just have to go back to this

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.899
expression and replace
all the xs with zeros.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.532
H of zero is going to be equal
to negative four, negative

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:53.875
four times zero plus two,
which is just going to be two

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.395
times zero minus 18,
which is just going to be

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:58.395
negative 18.

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:01.821
Let's see, this is going
to be negative eight times

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:06.168
negative 18, negative
eight times negative 18,

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.335
which is the same thing as

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.426
negative eight times

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:11.906
negative nine

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:13.298
times two.

00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:16.872
This is going to be positive 72 times two,

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:17.955
which is 144,

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.872
so 144

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:23.180
meters.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.740
Did I do that right?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.573
Let's see.

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:26.406
We're going to have ...

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:27.321
Yep that sounds right.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.429
That's right.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.541
How many seconds after
launch will the rocket

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.545
hit the ground?

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:37.268
Pause this video again and
see if you can answer that.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:40.591
Well, what does it mean for
the rocket to hit the ground?

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:43.695
That means that the height is
equal to zero, so if you want

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:45.699
to figure out how many
seconds after launch, how many

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.491
seconds that's x, so we want
to figure out the x when our

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:49.973
height is equal to zero.

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.578
We can set up an equation.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:55.069
Let's make our height h of
x equal to zero, so zero is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.894
equal to negative four times x plus two

00:01:58.894 --> 00:01:59.862
times

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:00.749
x

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:01.582
minus 18.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.122
Well, if you have the product
of three different things

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:08.605
being equal to zero, the way
you get this to be equal to

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:09.438
zero is if

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.715
at least one of these three
things is equal to zero.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:18.072
Well, negative four can't be
equal to zero, so we could say

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:18.905
x plus two

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.359
equals zero.

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.136
I got that from right over here.

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:26.960
If x plus two were equaling
to zero, then this equation

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.476
would be satisfied.

00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:31.696
That would be the situation
when x is equal to negative

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:34.326
two, but remember x is the
number of seconds after the

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:36.685
launch, so a negative
x would mean be going

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:37.913
before the launch.

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:39.601
We can rule that one out.

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.797
Then, we could also think
about, "Well, x minus 18 if

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.089
"that's equal to zero,
then this entire expression

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.926
"could be equal to zero."

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:50.837
X minus 18 equals zero,
you add 18 to both sides.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.399
You get x is equal to 18,

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.920
so 18 seconds after launch, well

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.639
we're going forward in time.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.917
18

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.475
seconds after launch,

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:02.491
we see that our height is zero, we

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:04.650
have hit the ground.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.301
Next question, how many seconds
after being launched will

00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:11.759
the rocket reach its maximum height?

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.357
Pause the video again and see
if you can figure that out.

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:18.716
Well, the key realization here is

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.553
if you have a curve,

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:22.973
if you have a parabola in
particular and it's going to look

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:26.499
something like this, if you're
gonna have a parabola that

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.331
looks something like this,
you're going to hit your maximum

00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:33.360
height right over here
between your two zeros

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.131
or between the two times
that your height is zero.

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:40.576
If you figure out this x
value and this x value, the

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.808
average of the two will give
you your x value the time

00:03:43.808 --> 00:03:46.469
after launch, when you're
at your maximum height.

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.527
Well, we already figured out
what this x-value is and what

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:49.920
this x-value is.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.958
We know that h of x is equal
to zero when x is either

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:54.958
equal to 18,

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:59.613
so that is x is equal to 18 or

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:01.814
x is equal to negative two,

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:04.686
so that is x is equal to negative two.

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.308
To answer this question, we
just have to go halfway between

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:11.275
negative two and 18, so let's do that.

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:12.635
Negative two

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:14.212
plus

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.318
18

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:16.485
divided by two

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.557
gets us what?

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:21.959
That's going to be 16 over
two, which is going to be equal

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.899
to eight.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.247
This is right over here.

00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:28.220
This is x equals eight
seconds the rocket is at

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.358
its maximum height.

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:33.592
Last question, what is the
maximum height that the rocket

00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:34.656
will reach?

00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:37.771
Once again, pause the video
and try to answer that.

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:40.139
Well, we already know from
the previous question that we

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.131
reach our maximum height
when x is equal to eight,

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.058
eight seconds after launch.

00:04:46.058 --> 00:04:49.219
To figure out the height
then, we just have to evaluate

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:50.802
what h of eight is,

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:52.843
h of eight.

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:55.785
Remember that's what this
function does, you give me any x

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.940
value, any elapsed time after
launch and it will give me

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.250
the height, so eight seconds
after launch, I know I have

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.365
maximum height.

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:04.024
To figure out that height,
I just input it into the

00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:07.789
function, so h of eight is
going to be equal to negative

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.695
four

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:10.005
times

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.388
eight plus two times

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:13.709
eight minus

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.125
18.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.466
Eight plus two is 10.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:18.890
Eight minus 18

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.790
is negative

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.883
10.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:23.862
You have negative four times

00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:28.020
negative 100, so that's
going to be positive 400.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.663
H is given in meters, so
that's its maximum height,

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:32.580
400 meters.
