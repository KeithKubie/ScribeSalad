00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.620
So when we remove the keyword, self, from in front

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.650
of storyline. Let me go ahead and do that one

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.370
more time. What we are really doing is changing storyline

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.740
from being an instance variable, accessible with instances like Toy

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.120
Story and Avatar, to being a simple local variable inside

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.180
the function init. Now, I will still be able

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.890
to access this variable, storyline, from anywhere inside this function

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.440
in it. But not with an instance like Avatar. And

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.890
since we are attempting to do that in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.100
this print statement, my hypothesis is that Python will

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.480
throw an error and say that this movie object

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.210
Avatar has no storyline. So to check that

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.600
hypothesis, I will save my media file, and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.270
then go back to my entertainment_center file and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.000
run that file. There is the error. Python says

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
that Movie instance, in this case, Avatar, has no

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.750
attribute called storyline. So, to correct this, what I will do, is go

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.202
back to the code and add the self keyword in front of storyline, there.
