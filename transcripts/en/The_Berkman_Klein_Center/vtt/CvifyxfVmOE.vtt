00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.890
To be entitled to
copyright protection,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.950
something must be original.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.940
That term encompasses two
distinct requirements.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.110
The first is
independent creation.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.410
If you copy your work
from someone else,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.110
you can not assert
a copyright in it.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.450
Suppose, for example, that
you read a poem and like it.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.850
You memorize it, then you
write it down verbatim.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.570
Someone photocopies the
piece of paper on which

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.990
you have written down the poem.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.380
Do you have a copyright
claim against the person

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.880
who makes the photocopy?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.840
No.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.120
The author who first created
the poem might, but you don't.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.990
That's certainly true
if the poem is recent

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.790
and still covered by copyright.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.330
But what if the poem is old and
no longer covered by copyright?

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.810
You still have no claim
against the person

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.780
who makes the photocopy, because
your work is not original.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.260
Here's a more plausible example:
Rodin's famous sculpture,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.420
"The Thinker," was
created in 1902 --

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.210
and thus (as we will see) is
no longer subject to copyright

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520
protection.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.460
Suppose that you make a
perfect replica of The Thinker.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you have a copyright
in your replica?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.090
In other words, if someone
copies your replica,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.330
do you have a legal claim
against the copyist?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.840
No.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.720
The same principle applies
-- certainly in the US

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.830
and probably in
other countries --

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.420
if you take a photograph
of an old painting,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.490
like the Mona Lisa, trying to
recreate the painting exactly.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.420
This is not a
hypothetical example.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.820
A few years ago, there was
a sharped-edged controversy

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.500
between the National
Portrait Gallery in England

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.010
and one Derrick Coetzee, who
uploaded to Wikipedia some 3000

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.380
high-resolution photos, taken
by the Portrait Gallery,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280
of old paintings
in its collection.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.100
Coetzee invoked this principle
when resisting, successfully,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.120
the Gallery's copyright claims.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.180
Because the photos
lacked originality,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.235
they were not
shielded by copyright.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.860
As we will see later,
the question becomes more

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.570
complicated if your replica
or painting of a public-domain

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.420
work is not perfect
-- in other words,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.020
if you have made changes to The
Thinker or altered the colors

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.290
of the Mona Lisa.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.970
But if your replica is
verbatim, you have no rights.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.260
So, to repeat, the first
of the two requirements

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.360
encompassed by the
term originality

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.070
is independent creation.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.750
The second requirement
is creativity.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.410
To be entitled to
copyright protection,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.590
a work must embody a modest
amount of creativity.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.155
Not much, but some.

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:01.780
This is the more
interesting and subtle

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.900
of the meanings of
originality, and we'll

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.100
spend a fair amount
of time exploring it.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.060
Before doing so, however, we
need to identify some related

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.730
characteristics that are
not required for copyright

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.970
protection -- and
consider why not.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.710
Once we have cleared
away this underbrush,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.670
we'll return to the
question of creativity.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.760
The first thing not encompassed
by the Originality requirement

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.050
is novelty.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.450
To be protected in
the United States,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.520
a work does not have to be new.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.550
In this respect,
copyright law is

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.410
very different from patent law.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.380
To be patentable, an
invention must be new.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.710
To be protected by copyright,
a literary or artistic work

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.400
need not.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.250
The classic statement of
this principle in US law

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.440
appears in the Sheldon case,
decided by the Second Circuit

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.770
Court of Appeals.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.970
Because Judge Hand's
language is involuted,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.690
I'll put in up on the screen:

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.490
Borrowed the work
must indeed not be,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.060
for a plagiarist is not
himself pro tanto an "author";

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.790
but if by some magic, a man
who had never known it were

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.830
to compose anew Keats's
Ode on a Grecian Urn,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.620
he would be an "author,"
and, if he copyrighted it,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.680
others might not copy that poem,
though they might of course

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.370
copy Keats's.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.480
In other words, if
your creation is

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.160
identical to an
already existing work,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.680
but you are genuinely unaware
of that existing work,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.880
your creation is original,
and you get the benefit

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.610
of copyright protection.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.050
Novelty is not necessary.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.210
To be sure, as Professor
Paul Goldstein observes,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.290
lack of novelty, though
not itself fatal,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.940
may sometimes be
introduced in litigation

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.490
to undermine other aspects
of a plaintiff's case.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.440
For example, it can be used
to rebut a presumption that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.650
the plaintiff's work was
independently created -- which,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.290
as we've seen, is required
for copyright protection.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.660
Or a defendant can
sometimes use the fact

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.400
that the plaintiff's work
is not novel to argue

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.230
that the defendant did not
copy the plaintiff's work,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.120
but instead copied
the preexisting work.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.630
That's the import of
the last clause in Judge

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.460
Hand's statement -- "though they
might of course copy Keats'."

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.600
If true, that would get
the defendant off the hook.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.340
The upshot is that, in practice,
novelty helps a plaintiff,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.390
and lack of novelty can hurt.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.890
But strictly speaking,
novelty is not

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.432
required for
copyright protection.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.020
Another thing that is not
required for copyright

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.570
protection -- at least in the
United States --is intent to be

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.820
original.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.130
To get the benefit of
copyright protection,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.550
it's not necessary
that you, the author,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.010
try to create
something of your own.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.440
It's only necessary
that you do so.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.760
The classic statement of this
principle in US law comes

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.120
in an opinion by Judge Jerome
Frank in the 1951 Alfred Bell

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.710
case, which held that, even
if mezzotint engravings of old

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.340
(public-domain) paintings
differed from the originals

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.650
only inadvertently, they
were still copyrightable.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.770
"A copyist's bad eyesight
or defective musculature,

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.800
or a shock caused by
a clap of thunder,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.470
may yield sufficiently
distinguishable variations.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.760
Having hit upon such a
variation unintentionally,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.050
the 'author' may adopt it
as his and copyright it."

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.440
As you might imagine, this
issue doesn't arise often,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.630
and one can find some
judicial opinions that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.560
seem to cast doubt upon it.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.080
But the principle
expressed by Judge Hand

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.710
is the canonical view
in the United States.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.640
A third thing not required
for copyright protection

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.240
is that the work in
question be artistic.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.280
If your creation is bad
art -- or not art at all --

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.476
you still get a copyright in it.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.100
The classic statement
of this principle

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.690
comes in the 1903
Bleistein case,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.740
which involved a copyright
claim to 3 circus

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.730
posters, one of which
is shown on the screen.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.120
In some famous passages in the
majority opinion in that case,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.250
Justice Holmes rejected
the defendant's argument

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.670
that these posters did not
enjoy copyright protection

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.520
because they did not
constitute "fine art."

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.290
In US law, Bleistein
has come to stand

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.180
for the principle
sometimes referred

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.700
to as "aesthetic neutrality."

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.200
When applying copyright law, the
quality or artistic character

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.740
of both the plaintiff"s work and
the defendant's work are said

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.250
to be irrelevant.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.100
A child's finger paintings
are as deserving of copyright

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.550
protection as the Mona Lisa.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.400
Why?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.010
What might justify this stance
of strict aesthetic neutrality?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.690
Defenders of this principle
commonly make four arguments.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.470
The first is that
judges (or juries)

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.960
who would be called
upon to assess

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.240
the merit of either the
plaintiff's or the defendant's

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.140
works, lack the
expertise to do so.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.130
Justice Holmes emphasizes
this point in Bleistein:

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.830
"It would be a
dangerous undertaking

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.080
for persons trained
only to the law

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.230
to constitute themselves
final judges of the worth

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.700
of pictorial illustrations,
outside of the narrowest

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.070
and most obvious limits.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.000
At the one extreme
some works of genius

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.049
would be sure to
miss appreciation.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.420
Their very novelty would
make them repulsive

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.660
until the public had
learned the new language

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.560
in which their author spoke.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.920
It may be more than
doubted, for instance,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.420
whether the etchings of Goya
or the paintings of Manet

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.710
would have been sure
of protection when

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.510
seen for the first time.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.770
At the other end,
copyright would

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.810
be denied to pictures
which appealed to a public

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.290
less educated than the judge."

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.140
The second argument,
latent in the last sentence

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.730
of Holmes' passage,
is fear of elitism --

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.770
worry that an upper class would
use the opportunity to assess

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.590
artistic quality to impose
their tastes on the rest

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.570
of the population.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.450
The third, related argument
is fear of paternalism --

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.620
or what has come more recently
to be called parentalism.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.290
This argument is tied to the
political theory of liberalism,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.840
which continues to have
considerable sway at least

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.110
in western democratic societies.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.030
The basic idea is that
governments should not impose

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.000
on their citizens any particular
conception of the good --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.240
or the good life
in particular --

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.040
but rather should create
conditions in which people are

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.520
free to formulate and
pursue their own conceptions

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.770
of the good.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.860
One implication of that
idea, it is sometimes argued,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.450
is that the law --
specifically copyright law --

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.360
should not promulgate a
particular conception of what

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.060
counts as worthy art.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.120
In the United
States, this attitude

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.260
finds expression in
periodic campaigns

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.900
to abolish the
National Endowment

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.120
for the Arts, which distributes
government funds to artists.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.440
Most other countries are less
hostile to government support

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.110
for the arts.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.760
The final argument in
favor of the principle

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.600
of aesthetic neutrality
is that, to decide

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.740
what constitutes good art,
one needs to know what art is,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.690
and there's deep disagreement
on that crucial question.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.720
As Professor Fred
Yen has pointed out,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.880
at least three different
meanings of art

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.150
are in widespread circulation.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.900
Formalism, exemplified by
the work of Clive Bell,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.640
defines art as things capable
of provoking in sensitive people

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.210
the aesthetic emotion.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.710
Some objects have formal
qualities that enable them

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.670
to cause this reaction
while others don't.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.250
Only the former count as art.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.510
By contrast
intentionalism, exemplified

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.330
by the work of Monroe
Beardsley, defines art

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.650
as "something produced with
the intention of giving it

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.310
the capacity to satisfy
the aesthetic interest."

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.030
So, for example, whether
people moving in a circle

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.170
are engaged in a form of
art depends on the nature

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.570
of their motivation.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.980
Their purpose might be
religious (as in a ceremony),

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.370
it might be political or
economic (as in a picket line),

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.870
or it might be artistic
(as in the dance).

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.440
Only if their intention
falls into the last category

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.140
does their behavior
constitute art.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.130
Finally, institutionalism,
exemplified by the work

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.040
of George Dickie, emphasizes
the role of the "art world" --

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.990
""[t]he broad social institution
in which works of art have

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.380
their place."

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.070
The members of this world
include artists and viewers

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.700
who participate in the
traditional social practice

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.620
of creating, presenting,
and appreciating art.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.150
Against this backdrop,
"objects become art

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.330
when someone who believes that
he is a member of the art world

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:35.090
invites others to view
the object aesthetically."

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.320
In the simplest case, an
object constitutes art

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.380
if a museum chooses
to display it.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.690
These 3 approaches --
formalism, intentionalism,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.080
and institutionalism --
are in obvious tension.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.020
Some objects or
activities qualify as art

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.760
under one approach,
but not under others.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.690
If aesthetic theorists cannot
resolve this crucial question,

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:05.090
surely it would be foolish for
the law to attempt to do so.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.280
So those are the 4
arguments commonly

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.440
deployed in support
of the principal

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.050
of aesthetic neutrality.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.160
Lack of expertise,
unease about elitism,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.120
hostility to governmental
involvement in art,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.220
and uncertainty concerning
what constitutes

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.450
art in the first place.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.910
However, as we will
see, the principle

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.820
of aesthetic neutrality
is frequently

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.150
violated-tacitly and
occasionally expressly-even

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.380
in the United States,
which purports

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.930
to adhere to the
principle most faithfully.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.130
Judges and juries find ways
to favor plaintiffs who

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.790
have created what they
consider meritorious works,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.320
and to disfavor plaintiffs who
have created what they consider

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.860
bad or unimpressive material.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.080
On the other side of the
ledger, judges and juries

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.510
find ways to penalize defendants
whose work seems poor,

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.570
and to give extra latitude
to defendants whose

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.840
work seems worthy of respect.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.270
Professor Yen and others argue
that, if judges and juries are

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.480
going to be making
such judgments,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.850
they should do so
expressly-and should be obliged

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.470
to justify their judgments.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.280
This is a fairly
fundamental issue,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.770
on which, as we will see,
countries differ sharply.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.210
By the end of the
series of lectures,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.790
I hope you are in
a position to form

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.180
your own opinion
concerning the scope

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.150
and merits of the principle
of aesthetic neutrality.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.380
Yet another characteristic
not required

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.360
for copyright protection is
that a work be noncommercial.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.190
This is not quite as
obvious as it might seem.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.950
For example, Justice Harlan,
in a dissenting opinion

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.760
in the Bleistein case,
suggested that advertisements

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.400
will be produced in at least
optimal quantities, regardless

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.480
of whether they are
protected by copyright.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.070
In other words, copyright
protection for ads

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.760
is unnecessary.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.520
Whatever the merits of Harlan's
position, it has been rejected.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.000
Today, advertisements
definitely enjoy the protection

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.050
of the copyright law.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.450
A final characteristic
not required

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.660
for copyright protection
in the United States

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.080
is that the content
of a work be lawful.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.940
So, for example, it's
now reasonably clear

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.160
that, in the US,
obscene, libelous,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.800
or fraudulent material
enjoys copyright protection.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.270
In this respect,
US copyright law

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.730
differs sharply from
US trademark law,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.510
which denies protection to
immoral or scandalous marks.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.515
Copyright law purports to
have no such exclusions.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.500
Having listed the things
that copyright does not

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.340
require, let's now return
to what it does require.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.930
As I mentioned
earlier, to satisfy

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.790
the requirement of originality,
a work must pass two tests:

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.290
it must be
independently created,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.610
and it must embody some
degree of creativity.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.710
The more important and
slippery of these tests

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.430
relates to creativity.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.260
How much do you need?

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.810
In the United
States, very little.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.650
In its 1991 decision
in the Feist case,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.070
the Supreme Court
put it this way:

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.980
A work must possess "at
least some minimal degree

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.210
of creativity.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.480
To be sure, the requisite level
of creativity is extremely low;

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.760
even a slight
amount will suffice.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.160
The vast majority of works
make the grade quite easily,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.390
as they possess some creative
spark, 'no matter how crude,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.820
humble or obvious' it might be."

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.560
As the Court notes,
it's pretty easy

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.210
to pass the test
formulated in this way.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.300
Take photographs, for example.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.600
In 1884, the Supreme
Court ruled that this

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.170
staged studio photo
of Oscar Wilde

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.030
enjoyed copyright
protection, emphasizing

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.329
the many forms of creativity
that went into setting

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.950
up and producing the photo.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.970
Today, it's clear that nothing
so elaborate is necessary.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.000
In the US, a snapshot taken
with a modern automated

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.420
point-and-shoot camera
contains enough creativity

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.050
to satisfy the Feist standard.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.490
The modest creativity
involved in deciding

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.460
what to point the camera at, and
when to activate the shutter,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.960
is enough.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.670
But some degree of
creativity is necessary.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.260
The most important effect
of this requirement

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.240
is to withdraw
copyright protection

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.530
from works whose form is
entirely conventional, even

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.660
if they required lots of
effort and/or skill to create.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.110
At one point, courts in the
US (and in other common-law

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.860
countries) extended copyright
protection to such works under

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.420
the auspices of the so-called
'sweat-of-the-brow" theory.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.660
Since the 1991 Feist
decision, that doctrine

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.970
has been formally
rejected by US courts.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.180
I hasten to add that,
in practice, it's

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.180
not so clear that a plaintiff's
labor does him no good when

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.050
seeking copyright protection.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.760
Despite the formal repudiation
of the sweat-of-the-brow

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.650
theory, in borderline cases,
some courts still pay attention

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.100
to the effort that authors
have invested in their works.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.320
Again, this is a
general theme we'll

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.440
return to in lecture
#2, when we take up

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.210
the Fairness and Personality
Theories of Intellectual

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:36.710
Property.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.340
Thus far, I have
confined my attention

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.620
to the interpretation of
the originality requirement

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.150
in the United States.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.140
Now let's examine some
other jurisdictions.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.020
Today, every
country in the world

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.240
treats originality as
an essential requirement

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.010
for copyright protection.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.890
But not all define
"originality" the same way.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.680
A few decades ago, countries'
disagreement on this issue

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.380
was sharp.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.820
Generally speaking, countries
influenced by the common-law

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.910
tradition set the bar
very low, while countries

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.900
influenced by the civil-law
tradition were more demanding.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.540
The two fields where this
disagreement mattered most

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.920
were photography and software.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.570
As mentioned above, in
the US and its cousins,

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.720
virtually all photos
taken by people

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.220
have long enjoyed
copyright protection.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.450
By contrast, as Roman Heidinger
has observed, in Austria

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.510
photographs were given
copyright protection

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.440
only if they differed
substantially

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.260
from pre-existing photographs.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.120
Applying that standard,
a conventional photo

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.950
showing some bikers in a
landscape failed to qualify.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.060
Likewise, as we will
see in Lecture #3,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.810
software programs received
generous protection

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.720
in the US and its cousins.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.670
In Germany, by contrast,
software programs

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.580
were accorded
copyright protection

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.540
only if they embodied
degrees of creativity

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.260
greater than that exercised
by average programmers.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.250
Recently, the divergence
among countries

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.930
on these and related
issues has decreased.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.540
As you can see from the map,
most common-law countries

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.340
have now repudiated the
permissive "sweat of the brow"

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.410
approach and adopted stances
similar (though not always

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.360
identical) to the approach
taken by the US Supreme

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.940
Court in Feist.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.140
Meanwhile, harmonization
within the European Union

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.650
has resulted in a modest
softening of the requirements

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.240
that some of the member
countries previously enforced.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.080
In a series of decisions,
the European Court of Justice

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.490
has announced and then refined
a new, general definition

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.080
of originality.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.450
Under this new approach,
two related things

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.720
(in addition to
independent creation)

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.480
seem both necessary
and sufficient:

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.990
-- the creation reflects
the author's personality;

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.540
-- the author, when
creating the work,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.400
was able to express her creative
ability by making unconstrained

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.869
choices and thus impressing
her personal touch on the work.

00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:17.160
The articulation of this
standard by the European Court

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.800
of Justice has caused courts in
several of the member countries

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.650
of the EU to adjust their
originality thresholds --

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.640
in most cases downward.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.210
In Austria, for
example, it's now easier

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.239
to secure copyright protection
for modestly creative photos

00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:34.030
than it used to be.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.260
And in Germany, a larger
set of software programs

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.740
are now eligible for
copyright protection;

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.030
the only things now excluded
are simple, routine programs

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:49.180
that ordinary programmers
would write the same way.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.540
In combination, the
harmonization process in Europe

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.660
and the trend among
common-law countries

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.030
to abandon the sweat
of the brow theory

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.280
has reduced the divergence
among the countries

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.870
of the world concerning
the meaning of originality.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.530
But some divergence remains.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.890
For example, the European
standard alludes to a theme

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.970
that US lawmakers
generally ignore -- namely,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.880
the degree to which a work
reflects the personality

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.090
of the creator -- a topic we'll
return to in the next lecture.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.710
And there remain
outlier countries.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.980
For example, South
Africa and New Zealand

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.280
still seem to adhere to the
sweat of the brow approach.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.690
At the other extreme, courts
in Switzerland pay attention,

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.200
when considering originality,
to the degree of "statistical

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.600
uniqueness" of the
work in question --

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.850
an approach that suggests
concern with the novelty

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.780
of the work, a consideration
ignored in the overwhelming

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.330
majority of countries.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.000
The upshot is that
some works are

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.800
more likely to secure copyright
protection in some countries

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.920
than in others.
