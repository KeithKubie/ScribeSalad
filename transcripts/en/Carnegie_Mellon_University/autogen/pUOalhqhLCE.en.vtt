was willing to take to advance science
 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.390
was willing to take to advance science
but it was also the trust that existed

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400

responsibility to live up to that trust
and I think that was a critical part of

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110
and I think that was a critical part of
 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.379
and I think that was a critical part of
the success of certainly my early career

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389
the success of certainly my early career

developed something called the the
accent operating system and and then

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000
accent operating system and and then
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
accent operating system and and then
that led directly that was really

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.010
that led directly that was really
 

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.040
that led directly that was really
designed for the perks for those people

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
designed for the perks for those people
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.320
designed for the perks for those people
that River the perks the three worst

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.330
that River the perks the three worst
 

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.800
that River the perks the three worst
corporation perks the that was really

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:48.810
corporation perks the that was really
 

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.470
corporation perks the that was really
then led directly to in a few years the

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480
then led directly to in a few years the
 

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.970
then led directly to in a few years the
development of the mock operating system

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980
development of the mock operating system
 

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.830
development of the mock operating system
which has really become much more famous

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:54.840
which has really become much more famous
 

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.110
which has really become much more famous
than any of the previous one what I

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120
than any of the previous one what I
 

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.610
than any of the previous one what I
think was really interesting it again I

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620
think was really interesting it again I
 

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.530
think was really interesting it again I
think that it was the environment here

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540
think that it was the environment here
 

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.790
think that it was the environment here
at Carnegie Mellon that really allowed

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800
at Carnegie Mellon that really allowed
 

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.759
at Carnegie Mellon that really allowed
this to happen is that you know

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:05.769
this to happen is that you know
 

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:08.040
this to happen is that you know
approach that that was taken with these

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.050
approach that that was taken with these
 

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.259
approach that that was taken with these
systems was one of really you know

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:12.269
systems was one of really you know
 

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:15.660
systems was one of really you know
having a fundamental set of abstractions

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:15.670
having a fundamental set of abstractions
 

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.179
having a fundamental set of abstractions
upon which you could build a larger

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:18.189
upon which you could build a larger
 

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:19.590
upon which you could build a larger
operating system environment typically

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600
operating system environment typically
 

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600
operating system environment typically
in the operating system space people

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
in the operating system space people
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.090
in the operating system space people
don't worry so much about the the serve

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.100
don't worry so much about the the serve
 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.889
don't worry so much about the the serve
basic abstractions of the operating

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:25.899
basic abstractions of the operating
 

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.090
basic abstractions of the operating
system they'd sort of say well what can

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:27.100
system they'd sort of say well what can
 

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.639
system they'd sort of say well what can
I do at this level that supports the

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:29.649
I do at this level that supports the
 

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:31.379
I do at this level that supports the
level above that and how do I fit the

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:31.389
level above that and how do I fit the
 

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:34.379
level above that and how do I fit the
pieces together you know mock and well

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:34.389
pieces together you know mock and well
 

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:37.259
pieces together you know mock and well
accent and mock were really attempts at

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:37.269
accent and mock were really attempts at
 

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.780
accent and mock were really attempts at
saying if if I come up with a very

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:39.790
saying if if I come up with a very
 

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.549

fundamental set of mechanisms and

00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:41.559
fundamental set of mechanisms and
 

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.650
fundamental set of mechanisms and
abstractions can I then build everything

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:43.660
abstractions can I then build everything
 

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.799
abstractions can I then build everything
from that you know and even more so you

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:46.809
from that you know and even more so you
 

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.900
from that you know and even more so you
know can I even think about building it

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:48.910
know can I even think about building it
 

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.030
know can I even think about building it
itself from those same abstractions so I

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040
itself from those same abstractions so I
 

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.210
itself from those same abstractions so I
can I make this completely recursive

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220
can I make this completely recursive
 

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.139
can I make this completely recursive
intellectually and so that was one of

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:55.149
intellectually and so that was one of
 

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:55.679
intellectually and so that was one of
the things I think that really

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:55.689
the things I think that really
 

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:58.229
the things I think that really
distinguished mock and accent from the

00:09:58.229 --> 00:09:58.239
distinguished mock and accent from the
 

00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:00.210
distinguished mock and accent from the
systems that came before it but also I

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:00.220
systems that came before it but also I
 

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.039
systems that came before it but also I
think it's it's a statement about you

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:02.049
think it's it's a statement about you
 

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:04.949
think it's it's a statement about you
know the the notion that it was

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959
know the the notion that it was
 

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.710
know the the notion that it was
important to try to create something

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720
important to try to create something
 

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.769
important to try to create something
that was intellectually elegant and that

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:10.779
that was intellectually elegant and that
 

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:12.900
that was intellectually elegant and that
made sense and that this was an

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:12.910
made sense and that this was an
 

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.489
made sense and that this was an
environment which one could actually do

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:14.499
environment which one could actually do
 

00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:17.669
environment which one could actually do
that and not be sort of put in a in a

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:17.679
that and not be sort of put in a in a
 

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.410
that and not be sort of put in a in a
box and said well no you really can't do

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:19.420
box and said well no you really can't do
 

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.609
box and said well no you really can't do
it quite that way you've got to do it

00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:20.619
it quite that way you've got to do it
 

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.129
it quite that way you've got to do it
some other way instead so I felt really

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:23.139
some other way instead so I felt really
 

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:24.749
some other way instead so I felt really
good about that you know in terms of

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:24.759
good about that you know in terms of
 

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:26.669
good about that you know in terms of
some of the key elements of these

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:26.679
some of the key elements of these
 

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.470
some of the key elements of these
systems we won think people often refer

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480
systems we won think people often refer
 

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.109
systems we won think people often refer
to and you see it you'll see it in some

00:10:31.109 --> 00:10:31.119
to and you see it you'll see it in some
 

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:34.259
to and you see it you'll see it in some
of the chapters and various operating

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:34.269
of the chapters and various operating
 

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:36.389
of the chapters and various operating
system books that talk about mock the

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399
system books that talk about mock the
 

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.369
system books that talk about mock the
people refer to the term microkernel but

00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:38.379
people refer to the term microkernel but
 

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:40.049
people refer to the term microkernel but
generally speaking most people don't

00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:40.059
generally speaking most people don't
 

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:42.769
generally speaking most people don't
really remember what it actually meant

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779
really remember what it actually meant
 

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:47.819
really remember what it actually meant
in the original accent work the many of

in the original accent work the many of
 

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:49.470
in the original accent work the many of
the underlying operating system / if ms

primitives were actually implemented in

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:51.220
primitives were actually implemented in
 

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.129
primitives were actually implemented in
microcode in fact when we started the

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:53.139
microcode in fact when we started the
 

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.409
microcode in fact when we started the
spice project as Raj well remembers you

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:55.419
spice project as Raj well remembers you
 

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:57.150
spice project as Raj well remembers you
know we we felt that you had to have

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160
know we we felt that you had to have
 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.639
know we we felt that you had to have
microcode in the machine in order to be

00:10:59.639 --> 00:10:59.649
microcode in the machine in order to be
 

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:00.989
microcode in the machine in order to be
able to achieve the performance that we

00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:00.999
able to achieve the performance that we
 

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:03.449
able to achieve the performance that we
were looking for and so that's where the

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:03.459
were looking for and so that's where the
 

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:05.009
were looking for and so that's where the
term microcurrent will really came from

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:05.019
term microcurrent will really came from
 

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.629
term microcurrent will really came from
but most people misinterpreted that is

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639
but most people misinterpreted that is
 

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:09.989
but most people misinterpreted that is
meeting small kernel and so today more

00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:09.999
meeting small kernel and so today more
 

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:11.340
meeting small kernel and so today more
often than not people say well gee it

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
often than not people say well gee it
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.799
often than not people say well gee it
wasn't that small and and they're right

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:13.809
wasn't that small and and they're right
 

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:15.389
wasn't that small and and they're right
but it but again it was a different

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399
but it but again it was a different
 

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:17.669
but it but again it was a different
different term the you know the notion

00:11:17.669 --> 00:11:17.679
different term the you know the notion
 

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:19.350
different term the you know the notion
of machine independence and support for

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360
of machine independence and support for
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.890
of machine independence and support for
different kinds

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:19.900
different kinds
 

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.050
different kinds
of architectures my sister's name is new

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.060
of architectures my sister's name is new
 

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.620
of architectures my sister's name is new
promote by the way yeah I invented these

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:25.630
promote by the way yeah I invented these
 

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.080
promote by the way yeah I invented these
terms in my office and the seventh floor

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.090
terms in my office and the seventh floor
 

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.900

of weed hall because i couldn't none of
 

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.930
of weed hall because i couldn't none of
the other faculty members knew the you

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:33.940
the other faculty members knew the you
 

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.340
the other faculty members knew the you
know had good names for those

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.350
know had good names for those
 

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.100
know had good names for those
architectures and so I said okay well

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.110
architectures and so I said okay well
 

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.900
architectures and so I said okay well
this will be like you know they're

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:39.910
this will be like you know they're
 

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.920
this will be like you know they're
actually sort of was a good name for

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:40.930
actually sort of was a good name for
 

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.120
actually sort of was a good name for
Yuma this a uniform memory access

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.130
Yuma this a uniform memory access
 

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.150
Yuma this a uniform memory access
architecture Numa we serve non-uniform

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160
architecture Numa we serve non-uniform
 

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.920
architecture Numa we serve non-uniform
memory access architectures that wasn't

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:46.930
memory access architectures that wasn't
 

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.180
memory access architectures that wasn't
really good name for that and that names

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.190
really good name for that and that names
 

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.400
really good name for that and that names
really stuck and Norma was sort of the

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.410
really stuck and Norma was sort of the
 

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.500
really stuck and Norma was sort of the
distributed no remote memory access

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:52.510
distributed no remote memory access
 

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.690
distributed no remote memory access
architecture so those are the this name

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:54.700
architecture so those are the this name
 

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.090
architecture so those are the this name
stuck the other two really didn't but at

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.100
stuck the other two really didn't but at
 

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.620
stuck the other two really didn't but at
least i got my sister's name in there so

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:58.630
least i got my sister's name in there so
 

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.570
least i got my sister's name in there so
you know you can't can't can't do too

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:00.580
you know you can't can't can't do too
 

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.850
you know you can't can't can't do too
bad but i think again the key thing that

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:02.860
bad but i think again the key thing that
 

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.670
bad but i think again the key thing that
keep idea behind mark was this notion

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680
keep idea behind mark was this notion
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.830
keep idea behind mark was this notion
that you could build a system out of a

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:07.840
that you could build a system out of a
 

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.200
that you could build a system out of a
small set of basic abstraction you could

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.210
small set of basic abstraction you could
 

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.060
small set of basic abstraction you could
layer number of things around out you

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.070
layer number of things around out you
 

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.710
layer number of things around out you
could put it on a wide variety of

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720
could put it on a wide variety of
 

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.570
could put it on a wide variety of
different machine and then you could

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:15.580
different machine and then you could
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.190
different machine and then you could
support different kinds of operating

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200
support different kinds of operating
 

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.950
support different kinds of operating
systems on top of that now i'm going to

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:22.960
systems on top of that now i'm going to
 

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:30.140
systems on top of that now i'm going to
i found an old video I'm going to show

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.150
 
 

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.180
 
so in this basically I'm trying to do

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.190
so in this basically I'm trying to do
 

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.370
so in this basically I'm trying to do
this is an old video I found just lying

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.380
this is an old video I found just lying
 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.410
this is an old video I found just lying
around i had to transcribed into in a

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:37.420
around i had to transcribed into in a
 

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.930
around i had to transcribed into in a
digital form sorry it's not very clear

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:39.940
digital form sorry it's not very clear
 

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.690
digital form sorry it's not very clear
anymore but it's an old VHS tape this is

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:42.700
anymore but it's an old VHS tape this is
 

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.010

mock running on a next machine so in

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.020
mock running on a next machine so in
 

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.280
mock running on a next machine so in
1986 Steve Jobs and and and next decided

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:50.290
1986 Steve Jobs and and and next decided
 

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.340
1986 Steve Jobs and and and next decided
to use mock as the basis for the next

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.350
to use mock as the basis for the next
 

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.100
to use mock as the basis for the next
computer and so they took the mock

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.110
computer and so they took the mock
 

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.130
computer and so they took the mock
colonel at that point of used as the

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.140
colonel at that point of used as the
 

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.990
colonel at that point of used as the
basis for their next step operating

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000
basis for their next step operating
 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.210
basis for their next step operating
system and this is just showing off the

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:03.220
system and this is just showing off the
 

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.680
system and this is just showing off the
fact that it's running and it was cool

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:04.690
fact that it's running and it was cool
 

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.130
fact that it's running and it was cool
it look really interesting again that's

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.140
it look really interesting again that's
 

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.640
it look really interesting again that's
more like 1986 this is mock running on a

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:11.650
more like 1986 this is mock running on a
 

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.130
more like 1986 this is mock running on a
micro box so yet a completely different

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.140
micro box so yet a completely different
 

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.350
micro box so yet a completely different
architecture like a complete different

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360
architecture like a complete different
 

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.890
architecture like a complete different
system you know and this now is see if

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:22.900
system you know and this now is see if
 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.840
system you know and this now is see if
it pops up here this is mock running on

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:27.850
it pops up here this is mock running on
 

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.870
it pops up here this is mock running on
a Macintosh back this would probably

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880
a Macintosh back this would probably
 

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.460
a Macintosh back this would probably
been about 1988

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:33.470
been about 1988
 

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.410
been about 1988
I'm guessing 1987 and again what was

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:38.420
I'm guessing 1987 and again what was
 

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.330
I'm guessing 1987 and again what was
interesting about this was just that we

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:40.340
interesting about this was just that we
 

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.970
interesting about this was just that we
could do it and that we were able then

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:42.980
could do it and that we were able then
 

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.520
could do it and that we were able then
to layer the entire Mac OS operating

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:45.530
to layer the entire Mac OS operating
 

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.420
to layer the entire Mac OS operating
system on top of that and run it so all

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.430
system on top of that and run it so all
 

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.430
system on top of that and run it so all
on all this little video is doing is

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440
on all this little video is doing is
 

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.890
on all this little video is doing is
just showing that that it actually

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:53.900
just showing that that it actually
 

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.930
just showing that that it actually
worked you know which is really a lot of

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:55.940
worked you know which is really a lot of
 

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.250
worked you know which is really a lot of
what you show when you do operating

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.260
what you show when you do operating
 

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.560
what you show when you do operating
system presentations there's a really a

00:13:59.560 --> 00:13:59.570
system presentations there's a really a
 

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:05.460
system presentations there's a really a
whole lot else to show so you know I

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:05.470
 
 

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.720
 
think I just want to skip over to

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:07.730
think I just want to skip over to
 

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.150
think I just want to skip over to
something here all this is trying to

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160
something here all this is trying to
 

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.530
something here all this is trying to
show that it actually worked it actually

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.540
show that it actually worked it actually
 

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.750
show that it actually worked it actually
worked pretty well then in fact this is

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:16.760
worked pretty well then in fact this is
 

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.540
worked pretty well then in fact this is
a you know dark castle running on a mac

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:19.550
a you know dark castle running on a mac
 

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.150
a you know dark castle running on a mac
and mac OS running on top of mock you

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160
and mac OS running on top of mock you
 

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.610
and mac OS running on top of mock you
know on him on a macintosh so gives you

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:24.620
know on him on a macintosh so gives you
 

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.440
know on him on a macintosh so gives you
a sense of the fact that it was it was

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:26.450
a sense of the fact that it was it was
 

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.140
a sense of the fact that it was it was
working and then lastly here if I skip

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.150
working and then lastly here if I skip
 

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.750
working and then lastly here if I skip
forward a bit this is this is mock

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:34.760
forward a bit this is this is mock

fact work so the fact that mock could be

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360
fact work so the fact that mock could be
 

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.870

writing back in 1983 and if you were to
 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:38.320
writing back in 1983 and if you were to
ask me in 1983 do you realize or just

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:38.330
ask me in 1983 do you realize or just
 

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.240
ask me in 1983 do you realize or just
told me do you realize that someday the

told me do you realize that someday the
 

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.590
told me do you realize that someday the

thinking and eventually and I won't go

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:23.180
thinking and eventually and I won't go
 

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.610
thinking and eventually and I won't go
with all the details of how I made the

with all the details of how I made the
 

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.920
with all the details of how I made the
decision but eventually I decided to go

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:26.930
decision but eventually I decided to go
 

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.040
decision but eventually I decided to go
to Microsoft my official decision was on

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.050
to Microsoft my official decision was on

September first of 1991 that's how we
 

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.150
September first of 1991 that's how we
date the beginning of Microsoft Research

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.160
date the beginning of Microsoft Research
 

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.799

imagined my view of microsoft research
 

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:44.560
imagined my view of microsoft research
was really based on my experiences at

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:44.570
was really based on my experiences at
 

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.200
was really based on my experiences at
Carnegie Mellon and the mission

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.210
Carnegie Mellon and the mission
 

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.299

research could have just as easily

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:50.630
research could have just as easily
 

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.870
research could have just as easily
except for the Microsoft card could just

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
except for the Microsoft card could just
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.310
except for the Microsoft card could just
as easily been a mission statement for

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320
as easily been a mission statement for
 

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.230
as easily been a mission statement for
Carnegie Mellon and the key thing was

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240
Carnegie Mellon and the key thing was
 

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.850
Carnegie Mellon and the key thing was
moved to state-of-the-art forward and

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:57.860
moved to state-of-the-art forward and
 

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.580

that's been our mission statement for 18
years I've had the luxury I think of

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200
years I've had the luxury I think of
 

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.049
years I've had the luxury I think of
being one of the longest sitting you

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:11.059
being one of the longest sitting you
 

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:12.880

so I've had the opportunity to keep that

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320
so I've had the opportunity to keep that
 

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.530
so I've had the opportunity to keep that
mission in the focus for that that

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:17.540
mission in the focus for that that
 

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.500
mission in the focus for that that
period of time it was very much a CMU

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:20.510
period of time it was very much a CMU
 

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.590
period of time it was very much a CMU
style organization and I the way I think

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600
style organization and I the way I think
 

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.590
style organization and I the way I think
of that is that you know we really built

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600
of that is that you know we really built
 

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.280
of that is that you know we really built

much for CMU back in the 80s it's a

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:49.310
much for CMU back in the 80s it's a
 

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.160
much for CMU back in the 80s it's a
little hard to do that now the GAO is a

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:51.170
little hard to do that now the GAO is a
 

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.260
little hard to do that now the GAO is a
little bit more excited than it used to

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.270
little bit more excited than it used to
 

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.250

sort of sense of collegiality within the
 

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.610
sort of sense of collegiality within the
organization where no one has to worry

about you know if I if I do something

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.470
about you know if I if I do something
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.680
about you know if I if I do something
good you know will I get more resources

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:08.690
good you know will I get more resources
 

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.300
good you know will I get more resources
or if someone else does something good

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.310
or if someone else does something good
 

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.680

and I help them will they get more and I

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:11.690
and I help them will they get more and I
 

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.600
and I help them will they get more and I
get less you know I can have that kind

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:13.610
get less you know I can have that kind
 

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.390
get less you know I can have that kind
of an atmosphere so I mean had these are

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400
of an atmosphere so I mean had these are
 

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.210
of an atmosphere so I mean had these are
really key I think this part 2 goes back

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.220
really key I think this part 2 goes back
 

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.350
really key I think this part 2 goes back
to what I was saying earlier about the

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360
to what I was saying earlier about the
 

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.020
to what I was saying earlier about the
my experience when I was at CMU feeling

my experience when I was at CMU feeling
 

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.780
my experience when I was at CMU feeling
that I was mentored very well the people

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:25.790
that I was mentored very well the people
 

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.390

very well I was I was trusted to make
things happen and I think that's

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:39.560
things happen and I think that's
 

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.470
things happen and I think that's
something that I feel is important in

something that I feel is important in
 

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.870
something that I feel is important in
our organization as well and something

nothing wrong with that idea it's a
 

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.020
