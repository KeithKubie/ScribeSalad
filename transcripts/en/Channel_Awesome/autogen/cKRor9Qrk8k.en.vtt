that's the chart guy and especially

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.110
that's the chart guy and especially
 

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.080
that's the chart guy and especially
since the chart says yeah

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.090
since the chart says yeah
 

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.280
since the chart says yeah
that um it confirmed the chart guys are

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:22.290
