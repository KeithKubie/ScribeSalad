You know?

Because it used to be a happy

turned it into someplace

away from, you know?

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:06.270

like, probably 2005,

I was a backup singer for a
male artist called Richie Spice.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:16.060
And from then, I remember
one day he got really ill,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.579
and they wanted to
kind of like, you

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:21.330
know, kill some of the
time, the performance time.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.650

to sing for 15 minutes.

00:33:31.882 --> 00:33:34.340

15 minutes, because I didn't

open for him every night.

asking who I was,

you going by Etana, then?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.039

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.010

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:18.885
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:21.889
Tell people about the
origin of your name, Etana.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:25.070
ETANA: Shauna means pretty,
as the given name, right?

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:28.510
But I feel like women are
beautiful all over the world,

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:32.420
but we don't always remember
how powerful we are.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.420
And so I said I
wanted a name that

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.530
would remind every woman
when they see the name,

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.100
they know, OK,
that applies to me.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.590
I'm strong, I'm powerful.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.880
I can do this.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.989
And so I found the name
Etana, in Swahili it

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:48.520
means the strong one-- and I
said OK, well, that's the name.

women see the name Etana,

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.596

you moved to the US

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.580
with your family at a
relatively young age,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.199
and you went to
school to be a nurse.

00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:56.740
ETANA: Right.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
how did you transition

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.440
from wanting to be a nurse
to decide that you wanted

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.310
to pursue singing as a career?

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.180
ETANA: Well, I always
used to love singing,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.860
I just never thought
that I would be a singer.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.120
ETANA: You know?

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.500
And I remember being
in psychology class,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.790
and I was so bored every
day, because it sounded

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.040
like another language
altogether, and I was bored.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.040
And so I would write poetry
in the class, you know?

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.450
And I was talking to
a friend of mine who--

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.610
he lives on South Beach,
and I said, you know what?

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:33.775
I'm just so tired of coming
from school, going to work,

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:34.650
doing the same thing.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.070
Sending a fax, emails,
turning lights on and off.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.180
It's boring, you know?

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.420
And he, said, well
you could sing.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.120
And there is a guy
looking for a black girl

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.130
to join for a girl group.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.660
So maybe I should do your
makeup, take you down there,

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.690
and, you know, you
do the audition.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.594
And I said OK, well, I
don't have anything to lose,

00:36:56.594 --> 00:36:58.760
and I went down there, and
I got in on the same day,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.915
surprisingly.

00:36:59.915 --> 00:37:00.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.950
So you were in this girl
group for a little while.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.464
ETANA: Like about two years.

00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:06.880
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It wasn't really--

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.637
wasn't really your thing?

00:37:08.637 --> 00:37:10.220
ETANA: Well, I had
fun with the girls.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.740
I liked the shopping part.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:12.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.750
ETANA: And I loved the fact
that we lived in one house.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.810
That we had to do
choreography together.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.240
But I hated the fact that we had
to work out seven days a week,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.940
eat nothing but seaweed
and salmon, or cereal.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.471
And water, no juice,
no cakes, no nothing.

00:37:33.471 --> 00:37:33.970
You know?

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:34.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: No jerk chicken?

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:35.940
ETANA: No jerk chicken.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.550
Forget that, you know?

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.147
And the main thing was that
I couldn't express myself

00:37:42.147 --> 00:37:42.980
the way I wanted to.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.350
Like, I couldn't write any song.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.934
You had to sing what was
given, wear what was given.

00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:52.600
I'm talking about
shoes, and everything.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.880
You couldn't do your
hair without them

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.680
approving your look.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very packaged.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.531
Like, it was like the boy bands?

00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:01.280
ETANA: We had to just
fit in all the time.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: Like
N*Sync, Britney Spears era?

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.360
ETANA: Yeah.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.560
Like lingerie,
stiletto heel wearing.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, and
you didn't like that?

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.990
ETANA: No, because I remember
doing choreography one day,

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:18.810
and the camera guy had the
camera so low-- like, he had it

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:25.400
in this angle, looking up at
me, and I had on thong lingerie,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.364
see through, with
stiletto heels.

00:38:27.364 --> 00:38:28.780
And I have to do
this choreography

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.601
where I have to
turn to the side.

00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:31.100
You know?

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: A
little grinding.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.341
ETANA: I was like, no.

00:38:33.341 --> 00:38:33.840
OK?

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.200
No.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.700
And I--

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.949
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's invasive.

00:38:36.949 --> 00:38:38.280
ETANA: Very.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.380
And I said, you know what?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.340
Yeah, I look really good.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.110
You're beautiful.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.990
Like, this is just wicked.

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.430
And for some, it's like
chance of a lifetime.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.175
You don't just walk off.

00:38:48.175 --> 00:38:49.800
You know?

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.080
And I decided after a while
that it wasn't for me.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.340
And they cried, and they
cried, and they screamed,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.845
and we fought.

00:38:58.845 --> 00:39:00.345
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Well, that must have

00:39:00.345 --> 00:39:01.920
made you feel good,
though, that--

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.420
ETANA: No.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: They
valued that much

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.920
that they were gonna
cry, and scream,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.820
and fight for you to be there.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.760
ETANA: Well, yeah.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.950
I mean, yeah, but then I
still-- I even thought that we

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.840
could've-- we write.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.760
We wanted to sing what
we wanted to sing.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.486
We were never even
given that chance.

00:39:17.486 --> 00:39:18.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.072
ETANA: You know?

00:39:19.072 --> 00:39:21.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, let's
talk about happier times.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.690
ETANA: Yeah.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Let's talk about
your fourth problem, I Rise,

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.490
which, again, comes
out in less than a day.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.460
Where did you write
and record that,

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.060
and what was the
inspiration for this album,

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.870
as opposed to some
of your older albums,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.553
and what was that like for you?

00:39:40.553 --> 00:39:45.550
ETANA: Well, the album was
recorded in Jamaica, with,

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:55.500
like, the-- well, one of
the top produces, if not

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.209
the top producer.

00:39:56.209 --> 00:39:58.125
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, don't
sell yourself short.

00:39:58.125 --> 00:39:59.450
Don't sell yourself short.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.730
ETANA: If not the top
producer in Jamaica right now.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.480
He's been around for years.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.680
Did songs with some of the best
rock stars that you may know.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.860
And reggae, too, as well.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.430
Clive Hunt is a genius,
and if you've ever watched,

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.330
like, the mad scientist
movies and see how they act,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.836
that's just Clive.

00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:20.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.350
ETANA: But he's smart, you know?

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.350
And I wanted the
music to sound live.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.460
I wanted it to be big.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.835
I wanted everything about
this album to be massive.

00:40:29.835 --> 00:40:30.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.690
So it this that-- I know you
recorded your previous album

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.700
at the Tuff Gong
Studios in Jamaica.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.461
Was this at the same one?

00:40:37.461 --> 00:40:37.960
ETANA: No.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.970
We did this album in
Clive Hunt's space,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:46.500
and at a small studio called
Barbed Wire Music Studio.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.680
He's a young producer
too, as well,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.250
of a band called
[INAUDIBLE] in Jamaica.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.486
A very gifted,
seriously gifted--

00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:55.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.860
Right on.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.860
So for the people that aren't
necessarily familiar with Tuff

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.950
Gong, it was started by The
Wailers back in the 1960s,

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:08.090
and it produced a lot of
really well known songs,

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.580
like "Redemption Song--"

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.090
ETANA: Yeah.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:11.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: "Stir It Up."

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.450
ETANA: All of the
Bob Marley songs.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.230
FEMALE SPEAKER:
All the good ones.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.420
ETANA: Yeah.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.010
All of them.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.885
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:41:14.885 --> 00:41:17.750
So what was it like recording
and working in that space?

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.650
Did you--

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.320
ETANA: I remember
the first time when

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.180
I had to sing in that
studio, and there

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:31.960
was a guy in the studio--
a man-- older Chinese man.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.750
I forgot his name, but he
never comes out of the studio.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.379
He would be the one that would
always take care of Bob Marley,

00:41:38.379 --> 00:41:40.170
take care of the
instruments in the studio.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:44.015
He flew from China just to
be-- or from Japan, I'm sorry.

00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:47.990
Flew from Japan to be
where Bob Marley was.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.384
And up to this day,
he's still there.

00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:51.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Lives there?

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.280
ETANA: He lives in the studio.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:56.300
ETANA: He never comes out.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.100
And that day when I was
singing, he came out,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.474
and everybody was
like-- you know?

00:42:02.474 --> 00:42:03.890
FEMALE SPEAKER:
You unearthed him.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.960
ETANA: Like, you're out?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.110
Oh my god, you know?

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.514
And everybody was
like, he's out.

00:42:07.514 --> 00:42:08.876
He's out.

00:42:08.876 --> 00:42:11.150
He's out.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:15.260
But it was very, very
warm to see him come out

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.350
and help the musicians,
to make sure--

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.900
just like he did
for Bob Marley--

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.657
to make sure the instruments and
everything was sounding great.

00:42:22.657 --> 00:42:23.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.852
ETANA: Yeah.

00:42:24.852 --> 00:42:26.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
you recently came off

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.200
of the the Jamrock Cruise?

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.630
Jam to--

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.060
ETANA: Now, that--
the Jamrock Cruise.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:35.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jamrock Cruise.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.750
Yeah.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.880
ETANA: That was amazing.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which is
headed by Damian Marley?

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.640
ETANA: Right.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what was
your experience with the Marleys

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.660
before then, and how was
that cruise, and what

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.370
did they try to-- did they
have any advice for you,

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:56.310
in terms of trying to break
through in America with reggae?

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.810
ETANA: No, we never
spoke like that.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.340
I think every time
that we met, we

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.830
were either rehearsing
or recording.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.250
You know, because I did some
recording sessions with Stephen

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:13.110
Marley, and Jr. Gong,
he was always serious.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.096
I see him sulking,
like, you know?

00:43:16.096 --> 00:43:17.410
Always very serious.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.070
But the idea of the
cruise was amazing,

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.420
because the cruise sold
out in three weeks.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.630
Like, they put it up, and
it was down in a month.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.360
And I think they're going to
have to get a bigger ship.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: A bigger boat?

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.310
ETANA: They're going to have
to get a bigger one next year.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.268
And they're probably
going to have to have two,

00:43:35.268 --> 00:43:37.790
because even then people
were on Facebook saying,

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.060
does anybody have any tickets?

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.310
Does anybody have any tickets?

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.769
Because it was
completely sold out.

00:43:41.769 --> 00:43:43.184
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's incredible.

00:43:43.184 --> 00:43:44.090
ETANA: It's amazing.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.320
And one of the things
that I admired the most

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.400
is that when you
go to a festival,

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.580
right, there's this
big barrier, and there

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.770
are thousands of people way
back there-- behind the barrier,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.020
though.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.970
On the cruise, everyone
is like, right there.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.580
And you take the shuttle, and
people are in the bus saying,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.396
can we take a picture?

00:44:04.396 --> 00:44:05.770
Because we're
sharing the shuttle

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.820
with the people on the ship.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.470
We walk around on the ship, we
eat next to our fans, you know?

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:14.564
It's cool.

00:44:14.564 --> 00:44:15.064
Really cool.

00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:16.439
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's very nice.

00:44:16.439 --> 00:44:21.900
So, why do you think
that reggae hasn't really

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.180
caught on in the US
the same way that it

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.590
is in other parts of the world?

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.450
Because I mean, obviously
when Bob Marley was around,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.020
it eventually came
to the US after it

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.350
had exposure in Europe.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.655
But since then, there really
hasn't been much of a,

00:44:37.655 --> 00:44:41.640
I guess, popular reggae
culture in the US.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.310
So why do you think that's
kind of died down, and made

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.540
it more difficult
for reggae to be

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.930
a more prominent
genre over here?

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.840
ETANA: Well, for
some reason I think

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:57.440
that reggae is being shut
off mainstream radio.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.920
Well, it has been shut off
mainstream radio, period.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.020
But there's this movement
that's-- well, for the past,

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:11.900
I don't know, three, four years,
that you have American bands

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.480
who have sold out
vanues across the US.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.900
I think they have it
so locked down now

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.620
that they're actually moving
from the US to Europe.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.890
So they're taking the
reggae from here to Europe.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.800
Usually it's Europe
to America, right?

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.670
ETANA: But the only thing is
that those bands are not--

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.000
most of them, they're
straight Americans,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.779
and not Jamaican bands.

00:45:36.779 --> 00:45:38.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
blue eyed reggae.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.820
ETANA: Yeah.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:45.340
So I think-- no, but
it's not for everybody.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:51.890
Like, OK, what I mean by that
is if you tour a lot in the US,

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:57.910
you will see the same people who
support the American bands come

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.540
out to support your show.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.020
Because I've seen it.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.430
And they come out
in the numbers.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:07.010
But you have to tour
for them to see you,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.360
because you're not
on mainstream radio.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.340
So they don't know.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.030
Right?

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.470
And it may be difficult
for Jamaican bands

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.500
to tour, because of visa,
finances, or whatever it is.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.600
But nobody said
it should be easy.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.363
ETANA: So when I
do it, I go hard.

00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:25.238
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:25.238 --> 00:46:26.220
All right.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:26.720
ETANA: Yeah.

00:46:30.585 --> 00:46:32.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I was
speaking with your drummer

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.940
earlier before the
show, and we were

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.100
talking about the differences
between reggae music

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.650
in Jamaica, and what's
successful here in the US.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:48.020
And with reggae, very
much so about the message,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.320
and commenting on the
culture and politics,

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.100
and it's more of like, a call
to action than it is in the US,

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.620
where it's a lot
more materialistic.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.085
It's a little bit more vain,
it's a little bit more vapid.

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:02.585
ETANA: Yeah.

00:47:05.452 --> 00:47:13.130
You know, it's interesting that
he said as well that in Jamaica

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.390
now with reggae
artists, he feels

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:19.080
like those American
ideals in music

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.130
have kind of been imposed
upon the music and reggae,

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:25.510
so that a lot of
artists are having

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:30.840
to kind of stray from the
roots of the reggae message,

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.120
and incorporate these US
ideals into their songs

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.780
in order to try
to be successful.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.600
So how do you--
well, first of all,

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.290
have you found it difficult to
stay true to your core values?

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.950
ETANA: No.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:46.741
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.

00:47:46.741 --> 00:47:47.530
All right.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.100
ETANA: No, but you know what?

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.750
I feel that if you're
true and real to yourself,

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.430
then people will see
that, and they'll

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.680
gravitate to your realness.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.930
You.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:00.790
You know?

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.960
But I think if
you try to put on,

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.590
that's when people are like
yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.700
We've seen this before.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.270
ETANA: I just feel
like I'm being myself,

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.450
and it's working for me.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.206
And I don't know how
to be anything else.

00:48:14.206 --> 00:48:15.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:15.970
That's good.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.420
That's wonderful.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.730
So in that same vein,
in terms of reggae

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.240
and Jamaican music in
general kind of drawing

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.890
attention to different issues,
political, social, cultural,

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.970
what do you think is
the issue in Jamaica

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:37.330
right now that really
deserves the most attention?

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.830
ETANA: Education.

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.680
And, yeah.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.430
Education.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.720
That's it.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.780
I think it deserves the most
attention because people

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.210
tend to overlook
the little ones.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:53.240
Oh, they don't matter.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240
They don't have a voice.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.530
They can't speak.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.080
You know, they do what
we say do kind of thing.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.040
Because Caribbean
parents are like that.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.750
You do what I say.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:03.485
Shut up.

00:49:03.485 --> 00:49:03.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.241
ETANA: Kind of thing, you know?

00:49:05.241 --> 00:49:08.760
But I think that it's time
that we listen and invest

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.984
a lot more in
education in Jamaica.

00:49:10.984 --> 00:49:12.400
A lot of Caribbean
countries, they

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.320
have free education
because they're still

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.350
under the British rule,
or the French, you know?

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:22.850
But Jamaica somewhat
is still, but not when

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:24.080
it comes to free education.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.610
So you have a lot of
children who stay home

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.550
because of poverty, you know?

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.330
And I think it doesn't
do much for the economy,

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.885
it doesn't do much for
the whole country itself.

00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:38.740
It's wrong to have
them kids sit there,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.740
not know how to read
and write, and grow up

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.690
doing things that
society don't accept.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.970
Or even put other people
in fear because they're

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.140
trying to survive the
best way they know how.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.670
And you've been in the US--
so you live in Florida now?

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.080
ETANA: Yeah.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.288
FEMALE SPEAKER: How long
have you been in the US for?

00:49:56.288 --> 00:49:58.434
ETANA: Well, about
three years now.

00:49:58.434 --> 00:49:59.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: Three years.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.020
ETANA: Yeah.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
is there something

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.740
in particular in the
US that you kind of

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.540
think is an issue that
people are ignoring,

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.500
musicians are ignoring,
that they could speak out

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.400
against in the same way
that reggae artists do?

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.810
I know that's a
tough kind of like--

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.070
ETANA: Well, if you
look at hip hop,

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:22.930
you know, it's kind of like they
rap about what they see, right?

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.820
I don't think there's much that
they can do to change that.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.310
It just is what it is.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:35.890
And when you-- I'm not sure
that they could do anything

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.490
about it, really.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:42.350
Because if they stop rapping
about, you know, the B-I-T-C-H,

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.850
and if the girls stop showing
themselves in the videos,

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:45.150
do you think--

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Money and cars.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:46.380
ETANA: Yeah.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.750
Do you think that people
would still pay attention?

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.290
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Well, you know, we

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.170
were talking about this earlier,
about how someone like Jay Z

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.259
could be that person.

00:50:55.259 --> 00:50:56.300
I mean, this is putting--

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.050
ETANA: To make the change?

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.508
FEMALE SPEAKER: To
make the change.

00:50:58.508 --> 00:51:00.910
You know, someone that's
that big in American culture,

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:04.420
to try to step up
and make that change,

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.120
and really call attention
to things that people aren't

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.290
seeing or doing, or--

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:09.280
ETANA: Well, maybe.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.655
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Maybe it's tough.

00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:13.030
ETANA: Because I've seen
people like Common and Mos Def,

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:15.030
and they're not into that
stuff, but they're not

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.490
as popular as the person who
may do the opposite, you know?

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:18.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:19.376
it's tough.

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:22.790
It's a lot of-- you have to
make choices, and whether or not

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.620
you want to be you and speak
to the things that you value,

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.700
or if you're, you
know, OK with letting

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.549
some of that go in
order to achieve

00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:32.590
a different kind of fame.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:36.490
ETANA: Well, how I see it
is that I wonder when they

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.670
do these things, rap
about these things,

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.295
or behave a certain way in
the media, how do they expect,

00:51:43.295 --> 00:51:47.740
or how-- I'm wondering if their
children, like if they have

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.660
kids, if they get to watch
their mom or dad do that on TV,

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.260
and then how do they raise
them in the right way,

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.900
to say OK, well, we're
just doing that for show.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.780
Like, it's not real.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.090
We don't really do that.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.290
You know, I'm wondering
how they deal with it.

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:04.914
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
they, like, instill

00:52:04.914 --> 00:52:06.219
values in them that are--

00:52:06.219 --> 00:52:07.510
ETANA: That are right and true.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:10.030
Yeah.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: So sticking
with the reggae theme,

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:16.290
and the difference
between things in the US

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.160
and there-- I mean,
you're arguably,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.260
like, one of the most notable
female reggae artists,

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.202
you know, today.

00:52:23.202 --> 00:52:23.910
ETANA: Thank you.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.544
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
for a long time now.

00:52:26.544 --> 00:52:27.044
ETANA: Yeah.

00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:27.544
Thank you.

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:30.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know, the
most visible, prominent, lovely

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.310
reggae artist.

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:32.584
ETANA: Thank you.

00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:34.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Was
it difficult for you

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:40.590
to find your footing in a genre
that's predominately male?

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.380
ETANA: Yeah.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:41.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.488
ETANA: Of course.

00:52:42.488 --> 00:52:45.660
Like, you would sometimes--
there was a time when females

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.400
were on the bill for the
show, and they would show up,

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.120
and they kind of
shoved them off.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.530
And, oh, it's not your time yet.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.812
And then when they call them
on, like sometimes a male

00:52:59.812 --> 00:53:01.520
will come on the stage
and, yeah, my time

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.230
now, and grab the mic
and start singing.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.340
So they didn't, you know,
like, a fair chance to perform.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.060
So what we did at 5th
Element at the time

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.850
is they had a man
walk me up on stage.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:18.500
A man would block the
stage on both ends.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.910
Nobody was able to walk
up on my stage ever,

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.640
and they would have a
man walk me off stage,

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.020
walk my guitar on, walk
my guitar off, you know?

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.040
Kind of teach them
how to treat me.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.820
ETANA: And that's what I did.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.020
I taught them how to treat me.

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:44.680
And so I feel like I still
have-- we still have a long way

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.780
to go, because women in
general all over the world,

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:55.130
sometimes we're not looked upon
as the same or equal to a man.

00:53:55.130 --> 00:54:00.010
So we're at times paid
less, given awkward jobs,

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.780
and stuff like that,
even though we're

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.500
qualified to do-- over
qualified, sometimes,

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.160
to do what the man might do.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.086
And it's the same
thing with reggae.

00:54:10.086 --> 00:54:11.710
And so I think we
still have a long way

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:15.680
to go, but as far as
respect and billing

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.877
me as a headliner and stuff
like, I don't have any issues.

00:54:18.877 --> 00:54:19.752
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:54:22.464 --> 00:54:24.950
Well, I think we can
all appreciate that.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.630
I mean, the image that
you're putting forth,

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.820
even just in the name that
you chose, and the song

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:33.280
Strong Jamaican Woman
from your new album,

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.122
it's really encouraging to
hear that kind of stuff.

00:54:37.122 --> 00:54:37.830
ETANA: Thank you.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.705
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:54:38.705 --> 00:54:41.270
There's a lot of female
artists out there

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:43.900
who speak about
being a woman, but I

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:47.260
feel like you're one of the more
honest and heartfelt artists

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.032
out there that are doing that.

00:54:49.032 --> 00:54:49.740
ETANA: Thank you.

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I
think it's wonderful.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:51.888
ETANA: Thank you.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
consider yourself a role model?

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:01.600
Is that important to you?

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.670
ETANA: Well, you know, I just
live my life the best way

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.420
I know I can.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.776
You know?

00:55:07.776 --> 00:55:12.397
And I like to sleep well
when I do go to sleep.

00:55:12.397 --> 00:55:13.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:16.750
ETANA: So I try my best
to do good wherever I go,

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:21.435
and live my life in such a way
that I create better tomorrows.

00:55:21.435 --> 00:55:22.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:22.910
ETANA: You know?

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:23.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
feel like that's

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.620
a very intimidating title for
a lot of female musicians,

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.940
and-- well, moreso
female than male,

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.264
to be seen as a role model.

00:55:31.264 --> 00:55:32.930
Because it puts a lot
of pressure on you

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.900
in terms of if you
make a misstep, and--

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.400
ETANA: Yeah.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.470
At times, like, if
something goes wrong,

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.095
and you feel like
yelling or cussing.

00:55:39.095 --> 00:55:39.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:40.960
ETANA: You know?

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh-huh.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:46.490
ETANA: Like, I kind
of have to hold it, go

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:49.730
inside somewhere where
there's just me and my manager

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.380
or somebody, and then
scream, you know?

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:51.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.656
ETANA: Because then if
I do, then other people

00:55:53.656 --> 00:55:56.050
look at me like,
Etana said that.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:56.850
You know?

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
hard to have a filter.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:58.529
ETANA: Yeah.

00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:03.430
So I kind of-- I don't
display it that much.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:07.140
And I don't put myself in
positions where I know.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.780
And if something
arise, I deal with it

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.945
with as much
diplomacy as possible.

00:56:12.945 --> 00:56:13.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.020
So how do you stay calm?

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.330
How do you stay positive?

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:17.640
ETANA: I just stay laughing.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.666
ETANA: I just laugh
at everything.

00:56:19.666 --> 00:56:22.184
FEMALE SPEAKER: You got
a lot of good jokes?

00:56:22.184 --> 00:56:23.600
ETANA: I just laugh
at everything.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.850
Seriously, I'm always laughing.

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
we need to hang out

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:30.490
more often, then, so
that I can do that, too.

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.340
ETANA: Yeah.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, switching
gears just a little bit here,

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.360
getting towards
the end, I wanted

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.800
to ask you about
your line of jewelry,

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.571
and your skirts, and
your organic soaps.

00:56:41.571 --> 00:56:42.070
ETANA: Yeah.

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.528
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are you wearing
any of your line right now?

00:56:44.528 --> 00:56:47.420
ETANA: Well, let me see.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:47.920
No.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: What?

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.705
How could you come here without
wearing your own jewelry?

00:56:50.705 --> 00:56:51.990
ETANA: You know what?

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:55.840
I had them on for the past
three shows that we did,

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.090
and for some reason
today I didn't.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:58.610
I didn't.

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.940
I don't know why.

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:05.060
But people are always asking me,
where did you get that skirt?

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.540
Where did you get that earring?

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.480
Where did you get, you
know, that bracelet?

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.500
And I figured-- and on
Facebook people say,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.950
OK, don't tell me where
you got that skirt, tell me

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.610
where you got the fabric.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:20.330
Or tell me who made it, so I
can have them make it, you know?

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:23.260
So I decided I'm just
going to have these stuff,

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.370
make these stuff, and have
them available for people

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:28.700
who want to purchase these.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:33.620
But I have young
girls who may find

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.670
it hard to find jobs
in Jamaica, right?

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.910
Seamstresses.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.560
Very talented.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.460
And, you know, I
use the skirt line

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.506
as a job opportunity for them.

00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:47.880
So it's like woman
helping woman.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.855
So they make the skirts, and
women outside buy the skirts.

00:57:50.855 --> 00:57:52.230
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's wonderful.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:53.254
ETANA: Yeah.

00:57:53.254 --> 00:57:55.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: I like that
you keep it at home like that.

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.662
That's very, very admirable.

00:57:57.662 --> 00:57:58.370
ETANA: Thank you.

00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:59.245
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:57:59.245 --> 00:58:01.740
But next time, bring some of
those things here so we can--

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:02.250
ETANA: The jewelry, too.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.060
The soaps, too.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.340
Same thing, like, the
girls make the jewelry.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.290
Sometimes I do the jewelry
when I do have my free time.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:15.080
Because I love to paint, and
so I have hand painted jewelry.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.510
My husband, too.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:18.630
Like, we all get
involved, you know?

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.400
It's a family thing.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.090
It's love, and sharing,
and caring, and everything.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:26.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: And you
have two young children.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:27.870
So they help out
with that as well?

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:29.579
ETANA: Well-- too young.

00:58:29.579 --> 00:58:30.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are they young?

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.010
They're not old?

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.470
ETANA: No, they're not
old, but, you know,

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.045
my daughter is only two.

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:36.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.936
ETANA: And my son is 13.

00:58:37.936 --> 00:58:39.310
He doesn't care
about that stuff.

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:39.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: Finger painting.

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:40.840
She can finger paint, right?

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.290
ETANA: He's like, he's
not into that stuff.

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.860
He's just like,
Mom, just tell me

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.520
how to do this business stuff,
and I'll try to help you out.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.790
But I'm not gonna paint.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.290
FEMALE SPEAKER:
I'll keep the books.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.380
ETANA: Yeah.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.150
Yeah.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.520
So just to wrap it up, I just
have a couple of fun questions.

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.110
So I work for Songza
within Google,

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:02.480
which I mentioned to you
when we spoke earlier,

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.550
but we are music
streaming, and we

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:08.300
do a lot of curated playlists.

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.310
And so we have
some fun questions

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:12.210
that we like to ask artists.

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.940
ETANA: OK.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: I've
tried to pare them down

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.370
to the less risque ones.

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.580
So I just have a couple here,
so what was the first tape, CD,

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.516
or vinyl that you
bought, and why?

00:59:30.432 --> 00:59:37.542
[HUMMING]

00:59:37.542 --> 00:59:38.750
ETANA: I still remember that.

00:59:41.537 --> 00:59:43.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mine was Paula
Abdul, Forever Your Girl,

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:46.260
if that makes you feel better.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.260
ETANA: No, I think
it was instrumental.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.600
Like, all instrument.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.130
Like jazz.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.860
I forgot the name of the artist.

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.715
He blows the flute.

00:59:57.715 --> 01:00:00.850
I forgot the name of the artist,
but that was the first CD

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.440
that I actually
bought for myself.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.856
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're buying
instrumentals, the first CD?

01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:05.570
ETANA: Yeah.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.153
ETANA: Isn't that weird?

01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:08.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's-- yeah.

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:10.360
You were clearly
more mature than I

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.552
was when I was buying music.

01:00:13.552 --> 01:00:17.160
What was the first
concert that you went to?

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:24.340
ETANA: There was a concert with
[INAUDIBLE] and Sizzla Kalonji.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.469
I actually snuck
into that club, too.

01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:27.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah?

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:28.010
ETANA: Yeah.

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.760
I put on a lot of makeup,
I made my lips really red,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.757
and I remember wearing this wig
that was really long down here.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
you pulled it off?

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.660
ETANA: And I pulled it off.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.020
ETANA: I was so
happy when I got in.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.090
Yeah, it was cool.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Was that in
Jamaica, or was that in the US?

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:47.820
ETANA: No, that was in Miami.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.920
Oh, those clubs are hard to
get into when you're young.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.180
ETANA: I pulled it off.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.440
I pulled it off.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.731
FEMALE SPEAKER: Appreciate you.

01:00:54.731 --> 01:00:56.409
ETANA: I lied so hard.

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:57.825
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Show a little leg.

01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:58.270
It's fine.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:59.760
ETANA: I think-- my
clothes were so short.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.045
FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh-huh.

01:01:00.045 --> 01:01:02.420
ETANA: I remember I had on
this really short skirt,

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.320
looking really cute.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.670
So I know.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:08.190
But you know, I tried to
look as old as possible.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.940
They know.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.490
I think he must have figured it
out, because I was so skinny.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right on.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.210
So when you were a
teenager, assuming you

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:22.380
were as angsty as most
teenagers are growing up--

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.194
ETANA: Yeah?

01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:24.610
FEMALE SPEAKER:
What song, or what

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.975
album would you play to
piss off your parents?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.020
ETANA: Lady Saw.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.650
I would put in a Lady Saw
CD, or something like that.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.060
Like, (SINGING) "If the
man live--" And you know.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.570
My mom would be
like, turn it off.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.069
No.

01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:44.490
Turn it off.

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:50.135
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mine was Lil
Kim, so I got a little dirtier.

01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:51.025
But that's great.

01:01:51.025 --> 01:01:51.700
ETANA: Oh, no.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.637
Trust me, if you listen to
that song, the raw version,

01:01:54.637 --> 01:01:56.470
your mom would tell you
to turn it off, too.

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:57.511
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah?

01:01:57.511 --> 01:01:58.580
We have to send me that.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:04.390
I still like to piss off
my parents, so-- all right,

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.920
so let's see.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.400
So obviously you did some covers
during your set, which I loved.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.420
You did Is This Love, you
did the Dawn Penn song.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.170
ETANA: No, No, No.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.470
Yeah.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.785
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:02:15.785 --> 01:02:17.490
ETANA: I love doing that song.

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:18.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
have any other songs

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.510
that you really enjoy
covering when you're live?

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:21.634
Like, what's your favorite?

01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:22.810
Or were those your favorite?

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:28.630
[SINGING]

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:32.060
ETANA: When I did that song,
and I listened back to it,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.751
I said, oh my god.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.250
You know?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.750
But I'm actually
happy that I asked

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:41.005
Marcia Griffiths about
doing that song over.

01:02:41.005 --> 01:02:48.230
And she'd say, Etana, if
them ask you to do 10, do 10.

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.730
You know?

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:50.517
She was like, do it.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:51.016
Do it.

01:02:51.016 --> 01:02:51.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:52.136
ETANA: You know?

01:02:52.136 --> 01:02:55.082
But I was a little bit
nervous, because that's

01:02:55.082 --> 01:02:55.790
Marcia Griffiths.

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.190
That's like, the
queen of reggae.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.710
When you hear her songs
play all over the world,

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.680
you know, people
kind of lose it.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.240
So in my mind,
I'm like, OK, am I

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.290
going to make this good enough,
you know, everybody out there?

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:13.820
And when I heard it back,
and heard all the comments,

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.820
I figured, OK.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.547
I got it.

01:03:15.547 --> 01:03:17.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
sure you did it justice.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.880
ETANA: Yeah.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.940
It was wicked.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.920
Yeah.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.153
Last one, and then we'll
see if anybody else

01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:24.570
has any questions for you.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:27.540
What's your guilty
pleasure song?

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.680
Like, what do you sing to
yourself in the mirror?

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.170
Like, dancing in your underwear.

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.610
ETANA: Let me see.

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.260
I have a couple.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.140
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Give them all to us.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.652
ETANA: There's a
song called Refill.

01:03:45.652 --> 01:03:46.860
(SINGING) Can I get a refill?

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:52.130
I'm not good with names at all.

01:03:54.854 --> 01:03:56.180
Yeah, Elle.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.566
I like--

01:03:57.566 --> 01:03:58.940
ETANA: There you
go, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.148
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Refill.

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:01.390
I love Elle, you know?

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:03.390
And there's another
one that she did,

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.185
called I Said I Only
Want To Give It To You.

01:04:09.965 --> 01:04:11.420
Yeah, that song is wicked.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.572
And so, you know.

01:04:14.572 --> 01:04:16.280
ETANA: Do the reggae rump, too.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.990
ETANA: Yeah.

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:19.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:19.770
All right.

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:23.950
Well, does anyone else have any
questions for the lovely Etana?

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:26.970
I can't see anything out
there, but if you do,

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.710
stand up, wave your hand around.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:31.480
Hoot and holler.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.860
No?

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.930
ETANA: Shy.

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:35.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Shy.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.740
They're too shy.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.259
All right.

01:04:37.259 --> 01:04:38.550
Well, thank you so much, Etana.

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:38.750
ETANA: Thank you.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.208
FEMALE SPEAKER:
This was wonderful.

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.140
ETANA: And thanks to
everyone for being here.

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.320
Thank you.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.195
FEMALE SPEAKER: And go
out and buy the album.

01:04:44.195 --> 01:04:45.500
It's out tonight.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.680
ETANA: I Rise.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: I Rise.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.607
Go get it.

01:04:48.607 --> 01:04:50.440
ETANA: I can't wait to
have it on my iPhone.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.084
You mean your Droid,
because we're at Google.

01:04:54.084 --> 01:04:54.750
ETANA: Oh, yeah.

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:55.291
That's right.

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:55.800
My Droid.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your Droid.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.494
ETANA: Well, you know what?

01:04:57.494 --> 01:05:00.540
That would be my husband, then.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.700
Because he doesn't
like iPhone at all.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's good.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:08.230
We appreciate that.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.990
All right, lady.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.990
Thank you again so much.

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.073
ETANA: Thanks to everyone.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.
