00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.390
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I have to tell you.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.430
I have had a lot of fun standing
back there for the last couple

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.750
of minutes and listening to
your questions and your energy.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.730
Because I have a feeling the next
hour is going to be a lot of fun.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.370
So my name is Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.730
And I work here at the
Library of Congress.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.790
And I get to officially
welcome you to the Library

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.090
of Congress this morning.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.390
So officially, welcome!

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: [Laughter]
And I also have an opportunity

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.770
to welcome an audience that is
elsewhere around the country

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.240
and around the world because we
are live streaming this event

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.650
so that the questions you
ask are probably questions

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.540 position:56%
that other children have in mind and
you're kind of speaking on behalf

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.180
of all those other kids today.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.340
So I know your questions
are going to be great.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.260
And in addition to welcoming
you to the Library of Congress,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.080
I get to welcome you to the Young
Readers Center here at the Library.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.010
If you have been to the Library

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.180
of Congress before, can
you raise your hand?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.770
Okay, about maybe a third of you?

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.740
Those of you who've
been here before,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.140
have you been to this room before?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: All right.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.760
Well, those of you who
haven't been, this room is sort

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.990
of like the children's
room in your local library.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.310
What sorts of things -- psst --

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.680
what sorts of things are in
your library at your school?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.980
&gt;&gt; Books [inaudible].

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.280
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: What else?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.580
&gt;&gt; Shelves?

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.880
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Say that again.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.180
&gt;&gt; Shelves.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Shelves and
books and what's on the walls?

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
&gt;&gt; What's on the walls is --

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.360
&gt;&gt; More books?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.660
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I like that answer.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.960
You said more books.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.930
But sometimes, there's pictures
and sometimes, there's posters

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.000
and all kinds of fun
things on the walls.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.990
You had something to say.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.070
&gt;&gt; There -- [laughter] it's on the
wall, there is pictures of people.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.400
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: That's right.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.830
&gt;&gt; And their culture.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.590
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Excellent!

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.040
Yes, sometimes there's pictures
of people and sometimes,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.950
those people are authors
and sometimes,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.580 position:56%
those people are famous people and
sometimes those people are you guys.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.540
And I bet some of your artwork
is on the walls in your library.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.620
But here in the Young Readers
Center, we have lots of books

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.540
and we have posters on the walls.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.210
And we have opportunities to
do all kinds of activities

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.220
with young people like today,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.940
when we have a very
special author with us.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.520
Now, I know you guys all
know what authors are, right?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.820
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.120
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
What do authors do?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.420
&gt;&gt; Write books.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.720
&gt;&gt; They write the books.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.020
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: That's
right, they write the books.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.270
Does the author also
illustrate the books?

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.170
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.470
&gt;&gt; Sometimes.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Excellent answer.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.070
That's right, sometimes.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.370
Well, in this case -- you know,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.670
I have a feeling all
of you are authors too.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.970
Have you guys all written stuff?

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to my [inaudible].

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.330
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yeah,
I bet you guys are.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, we had to take [inaudible].

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.180
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Well,
when you guys read books

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.830
or when somebody reads you a
book, how often do you think

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.460 position:56%
about the person who wrote the book?

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.000
You see, that's my
wish for you today.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.570 position:56%
I hope that after this
opportunity to meet an author today,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.680
I hope that every single
book you read from now on,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.690
you think a little
bit about the author

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.790
and the illustrator of the book.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.210
Because when you read a book and
you make a connection to that book,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.340
you're making a connection
to that author too.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.670
And that's really special.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.360
And you're also making a connection
nobody's ever read the book

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.660
or ever will read the book.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630
And that's really special too.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.050
So I am delighted to be
welcoming Shana Corey here

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.500
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.680
She is going to be talking to us
today about a very special book

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.490
that she wrote recently
about John F. Kennedy

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.930
and a very important speech
that he delivered in 1963.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.130
Now, John F. Kennedy, if he had
been, if he were still alive,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.960
would be celebrating his
100th birthday this month.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.670
Do you guys think 100
is a long time?

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.980
&gt;&gt; Today's his birthday?

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.490
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: No,
this month is his birthday.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.330
His birthday would have been
at the end of the month.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.680
Now you are just itching
to say something.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.140
I'm going to call on you and then
I'm going to ask you really nicely

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.560
to put your hands down so we
can really get started, okay?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.060
Now what was it that
you wanted to say?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.330
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, I know, sometimes
people paint the walls.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.630
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Yes, that's right.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.120
In libraries, sometimes
people paint the walls.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.420
That's so true.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.700
You guys are all going to have
a chance to say things later.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.720
So I'm going to ask you
please put your hands down.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.940 position:56%
Let's give a very warm welcome to
Shana and welcome you and thank you.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.680
And we're so excited to hear from
you and also hear about the artwork

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.970
that is also here that your
colleague contributed to the book.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.800
So thank you.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.100
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Thank you.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.080
I am so excited to
be here, you guys.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.630
This is the Library of Congress.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.240
This is like Mission
Control for libraries.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.540
That's pretty cool, right?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.140
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.440
&gt;&gt; And it's [inaudible].

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.740
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So I'm here
today because I'm an author.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.040
But I wasn't always an author.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.140
Do you guys want to see a picture
of me before I was an author?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.740
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, this is me.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.470
You'll like this is me back --

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.640
this is me when I was about
your age, maybe first grade.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.940
Does that look like me?

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.540
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Does it?

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.840
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So would it look
like me if I had a big red hair bow?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.440
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.740
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.040
Well, let's see it.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.340
Do you know who I think
I was really drawing?

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.640
I don't think I was
really drawing myself.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.570
You know who I think I was really
drawing when I was drawing this?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.290
Who was that?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.590
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Madeleine.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.890
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Madeleine.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.190
I love Madeleine.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.490
So Madeleine is this great book.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.790
I bet there's copies
in the back here.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.260
So if you take one pro tip from
today, if you want to learn

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.790
to draw a big hair
bow, two triangles

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.290
and boom, you have your hair bow.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.910
So that's your first
takeaway from today.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.210
Do you want to see
what I really look

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.510
like though when I was your age?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.310
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, this is me
when I was in elementary school.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.960
&gt;&gt; Which one are you?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.260
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Which one am I?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.700
Okay, raise your hand if you
think I'm the sweet, happy,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.880
nice little girl with braids.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.180
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.480
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.330
Raise your hand if you
think I'm the kind of bossy,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.690
cranky looking big sister.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.990
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.730
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What, you guys?

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.410
Okay, you're right.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.710
I'm the [inaudible]
-- okay, hands down.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.370
I'm the bossy big sister.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.670
That's me.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.210
That's me and my sister, Marcie.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.320
Now, I wasn't an author
yet in that picture.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.620
Can you guys hear me?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.720
I wasn't an author
yet in that picture

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.330
but I was already doing something

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.890
that was getting me
ready to be an author.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.520
What do you think I was
doing when I was in first,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.540
second grade that was getting
me ready to be an author?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.840
What do you think?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.140
&gt;&gt; Reading books.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.560
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh my gosh,
you guys are such smart kids.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.740
You, look, people don't get that
right away but yes, I was reading.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.040
I loved to read.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.530 position:56%
Raise your hand if you love to read.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.830
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.130
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, good!

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.250
Well then, you guys, you're all
on your way to being authors

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.440
because reading is the most
important thing you can do

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.320
if you want to be an author.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.800
So when I was growing up, these
were some of my favorite books --

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.500
<i>Little House on the Prairie </i>,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.820
<i>Betsy-Tacy </i>, <i>All-of-a-Kind
Family </i>.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.310
In fact, I liked reading so
much that when I grew up,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.860
I decided I wanted to have
a job where I could be

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.500
around books all day long.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.800
Can you guys think of any --

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.180
what kind of jobs could you
be around books all day long?

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.530
&gt;&gt; Author.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.960
&gt;&gt; At the library?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.690
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You could
work in the library.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.520
You could be a librarian and then
could you imagine this would be

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.820
your office.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.230
And I bet you could take
home any books you wanted.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.810
That would be pretty cool, right?

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.110
No? Well --

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.390
&gt;&gt; If you worked for
the other [inaudible].

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.790
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You work
for the other people?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.150
What kind of book jobs
can you think of?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.740
&gt;&gt; You can be an author
or an illustrator.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.720
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You could
be an author, an illustrator

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.370
so you could write or draw
books or draw the pictures.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.870
What kind of book jobs
can you think of?

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.510
&gt;&gt; I think you could
be, you could be

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.420
around books by painting pictures?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.470
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You could paint
pictures like the illustrator

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.880
of this book, R. Gregory Picture.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.690
R. Gregory Picture --
R. Gregory Christie.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.900
He painted these pictures
so he's around books all day

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.560
and then he draws the pictures.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.860
That's pretty cool.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.160
We'll do one last book job.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.700
What kind of book job
can you think of?

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:29.070
&gt;&gt; One last book job that I can
think of is organizing books.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.590
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, that's a
really good one, organizing books.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.050
You think, do you think
librarians organize books?

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.650
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah, that's
a really smart thought.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.240
&gt;&gt; I do [inaudible] offer
because of your earrings.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.340
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I'm
wearing book earrings.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.640
It's true.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.940
So I decided to get a job.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.130
Hold on to your thoughts because
we'll do lots more in a little bit.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.610
I decided to get a job being
something called an editor.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.910
Does anyone know?

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.640
What's an editor?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.680
What's an editor?

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.070
&gt;&gt; An editor likes to make
books like popular books

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.240
so that there are more
copies for everyone to read.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.540
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, interesting.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.550
So yes, that's part of
what an editor does.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.760
They make sure lots of people are
going to get copies of the books.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.840
What else do you think
an editor does?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.380
And I'm sorry, I didn't -- I
should have repeated your answer

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.720
so people -- your friends
far away could hear.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720
He said that an editor makes
copies of books so lots

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.900
of people could read them.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.560
And what else does an editor do?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.480
&gt;&gt; I think an editor
-- I don't know.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.350
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So I think an
editor's a lot like a teacher.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.480
Do your teachers help you
make your work better?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, she edit it.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.380
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So an
editor works with authors

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.680
to help them make their
stories better.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.980
So I got a job as an editor.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.280
Here is my office in New York City.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.580
I work at Random House
Children's Books.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.880
And it's just like I always wanted.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.180
I'm surrounded by books
all day long.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.480
So you guys might recognize
some of these books.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.780
I work on books for big kids.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.870
I work on early readers and a lot
of the early readers I work on are

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.900
about history because
I love history.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.200
I see someone pointing.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.020
Do you know that book, <i>George
Washington and the General's Dog </i>?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.620
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.920
&gt;&gt; It's at our classroom.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.220
&gt;&gt; He has it.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.520
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I love that book.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.820
That's an excellent book.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.120
&gt;&gt; I haven't read it.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.420
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So those
-- it's really good.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.720
I really recommend it.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.020
Those books are true stories.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.320
Who can tell me, what's it called
when a book's a true story?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.350
Does anyone know what's a book --

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.840
what's it called when
a book's a true story?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.340
&gt;&gt; They -- they also [inaudible]
when they read the book

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.930
to children who don't have books.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh,
people read books

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.740
to children who don't have books?

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.230
What were you going to say?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.030
&gt;&gt; What was the question again?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.330
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What is it
called, what's it called

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.130
when a book is a true story?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.430
&gt;&gt; Fiction.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.730
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Whoa, really close.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.030
Nonfiction.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.330
&gt;&gt; Nonfiction.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.630
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes, exactly.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.930
Nonfiction.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.230
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] it's something
that's not, it's real.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.630
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: In fiction,
it's something that's made up.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.480
Exactly. Okay, so I
also work on books.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.340
I've worked on series like
<i>Babymouse </i>and another series

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.180
that you guys wouldn't know.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.480
I don't think.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.780
No one's ever heard of
Junie B. Jones, have they?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.080
&gt;&gt; I know!

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.380
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You
know Junie B. Jones?

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.680
Oh, I love Junie.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.490
You have it?

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.960
I have it in my backpack too.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.260
I love Junie B. Jones!

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.120
So you guys, after -- after I
had been editing for a while,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.850
I decided I wanted to
write my own stories.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.210
Now when you guys write stories,
where do you get your ideas?

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.570
Where do you get -- where
do you get your ideas?

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.970
&gt;&gt; From your brain.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.250
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Sometimes you
just get ideas from your brain.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.550
Where do you get your ideas?

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.080
Let's see, where do you,
where do you get your ideas?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I sometimes get ideas from books.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.870
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: From other books,
that's a great place to get ideas.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.040
Where do you get your idea?

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; From -- so sometimes, I get ideas

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.930
from maybe my journal
writing or poetry?

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That's fabulous.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.800
Yeah, from journal
writing or poetry.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.100
That's a great place to get ideas.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.400
Where do you get your idea?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.880
&gt;&gt; I get my ideas from other
books because when I read a book,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.160
it makes me think of
what I could do.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.890
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That's -- listen,
you guys have such great ideas.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.250
So she gets her ideas from her
journals and poetry and other books

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.090
because when she reads
books, it gives her ideas

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.390
of other things she could do.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.750
Where do you get your ideas?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.050
&gt;&gt; Pictures.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.350
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: From pictures.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.480
Looking at pictures is a
great place to get ideas.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.780
Okay, we'll do one more.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.170
Is there anyone that hasn't?

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.470
We'll do you.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.540
&gt;&gt; So I want to [inaudible]
pictures and facts.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.420
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Pictures and facts.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.990
That's a -- are you kids
sure you're first graders?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.550
Those are really good
answers and thoughts.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.030
Yeah, facts and I get a
lot of ideas from facts

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.880 position:56%
because I write a lot of nonfiction.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.930 position:56%
So I'll tell you about -- come here.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.230
You write nonfiction too?

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.950
That's -- I love nonfiction.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.010
So let's put hands down for a
second and I'll tell you about some

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.920
of the stories I've written and
then we'll read the one about JFK.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.710
So a lot of my stories, a lot of
my stories -- can you hear me, hon?

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.140
A lot of my stories
are about real people,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.040
about people that inspire me.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.250
And I get inspired by people who do
things to create change like things

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.290
that are going to [inaudible],
they want to change the world.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.020
So some of my first books
are about real ladies

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.100
that lived a long time ago
and they didn't like the kind

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.000
of clothes women wore
a long time ago.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.300
&gt;&gt; What kind?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.600
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What
kind of clothes?

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.320
What -- does anyone know
anything about olden day clothes?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.310
What kind of clothes did
ladies wear a long time ago?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.180
&gt;&gt; I know, they was wearing dresses
that would show your body part.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.110
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: They were
wearing dresses, long dresses.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.330
Any other, what else do you
know about olden day clothes?

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.070
&gt;&gt; And sometimes, they
would only wear hats

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.520
because they're only
allowed to wear a hat.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.460
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: They had to wear
hats and bonnets a lot of times.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:11.650
In fact, are any of you guys
going to go swimming this summer?

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.250
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah or?

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.550
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go swimming.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.850
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah,
are any of you going

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.150
to wear a bathing suit
that looks like this?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.450
&gt;&gt; No.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.750
&gt;&gt; No.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.050
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.350
Well, a long time ago, women used

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.830
to wear bathing suits
that looked like this.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.130
&gt;&gt; I don't like dresses.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.840
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: But girls, you're
going to wear tights, right?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.220
You can't go swimming
without tights, right?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.520
&gt;&gt; No.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.820
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.560
Well, Annette Kellermann, the
woman on the right, was a real lady

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.110
that lived a long time ago.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.170
And she was a champion swimmer.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.500 position:56%
And she thought, we can't, you can't
win races and set swimming records

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.430
in those kind of bathing suits.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.410
So she invented her
own bathing suit.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.060
So I write about a lot
of people like that.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.750
&gt;&gt; That's a bathing
suit [inaudible].

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.500
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That's how
bathing suits were invented.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.860
I also write, I write some books
that are historical fiction.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.760
Does anyone know what's
historical fiction?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.420
Any guesses?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.270
&gt;&gt; Historical fake.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.570
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: It's
called a fake, yeah.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.870
That's exactly right.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.170
Historical but fake.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.470
So some parts are true.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.130
There's some facts
and some are made up.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.600 position:56%
So I'm going to tell you which parts

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.470
of this are true and
which are made up.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.770
<i>Players in Pigtails </i>is

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.210
about a real baseball
league a long time ago,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.710
the All-American Girls
Professional Baseball League.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.890
It was the first girls'
baseball league

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.090
and it started during World War II.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.870
All of this is true
because all of the boys

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.270
that played baseball went
off to fight in the war.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.270
And President Roosevelt wrote
a letter to the Commissioner

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.680
of Baseball -- Roosevelt
and he said,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.030
"You have to keep baseball going."

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.080
So they started a girls' league.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.280
So I did all this research
for this book.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.820
Here's real pictures of the team.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.810
Here's another real picture.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.200
But I had a problem.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.840
Hold on to your thought.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.730
I didn't know who to write about
because I had all the facts

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.730
about the league but I didn't have
a main character because there were

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.270
so many people that played
baseball in this league.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.660
Hold on to your thought.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.460
But then I went to library
because you can always find facts

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.990
and answers at the library, right?

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:19.870
Right, so I found this old book
in this secret room that's a room

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.870
on the third floor of
the library by my house.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.940
I don't know even know if I
was supposed to be up there.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.430
It was this dusty old
book and I pulled it

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.480
out and I blew out the dust.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.270
And when I read it,
I got goose bumps

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.160
because this old book had the song.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.430
Does anyone ever know the song,
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game"?

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.730
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.030
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Can you guys --

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.950
we'll all together say just
the first line of the song,

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.150
"Take Me Out to the
Ball Game" all together?

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.790
&gt;&gt; Take me out to the ball game.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.450
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, hold
on to your hats, folks.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.870
Guess what?

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.480
That's not really the
first line of that song.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.950
When I opened that book,
I could not believe it.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.570
There's a whole verse
that comes before that.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.040
And that's the kind
of stuff you can find

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.080
when you're researching
in libraries.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.150
The real first line of that song
is "Katie Casey is baseball mad,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.160
have the fever and had it bad."

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.190
And when I read that,
I got goose bumps.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.490
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.330
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Because that means
that song that everyone sings

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.920
and knows and thinks of
when they think of baseball,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.880
that song is really about a girl.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.650
That's pretty cool, right girls?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.250
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I think
that's really cool.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.890
So I just -- so I decided to make
Katie Casey my name character.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.360
So that's why that book
is historical fiction.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.680
The facts about the league are true
but my main character is made up.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.400
I've also written a book about
the first subway in New York City.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.260
And before I tell you about that
book, I just have a question.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.410
Has anyone ever seen
litter in the streets?

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.590
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Has anyone
ever been stuck in traffic?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.490
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Well,
believe it or not,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.790 position:56%
the litter in the streets especially

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.880
in New York City was even worse
150 years ago than it is today.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.800 position:56%
In fact, it's so bad, I don't even
know if I should show you a picture.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.280
Your teachers might get upset.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.800
Eew, it's so gross.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.280
You're sure you want to see it?

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.880
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, this
is what the litter looked

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.790
like 150 years ago.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.090
&gt;&gt; Eew.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.550
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So this was before
street cleaning, before recycling,

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:24.590
before alternate side parking
and the streets were a mess!

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.520
So they were gross and in fact, can
anyone tell me how did people get

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.000
around 150 years ago
before there were cars?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.300
How did they get around?

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.600
&gt;&gt; Walk.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.060
&gt;&gt; Horses pulling the carts.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.660
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Horses
pulled people in carts.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.510
So if there were a lot
of horses on the street,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.360
what else do you think was on
the street that horses produced?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.660
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.240
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What do you think?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.540
&gt;&gt; Poop.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.840
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes, horse poop.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.310
So the streets were
really, really gross.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.960
There's another picture.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.210
Also, they hadn't invented
things like stoplights.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.580
That's a picture of Broadway
in New York City in the 1850s.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.970
They hadn't invented
stop signs or stop lines,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.820
stoplights or even lanes.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.110
Look, there are no lanes in that
picture because traffic was new.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.530
So this man named Alfred
Ely Beach had an idea.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.030
He was going to invent a subway.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.720
So have any of you ever
read, rode the Metro here?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So Beach wanted
to invent -- you just did.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.020
He wanted to invent a
different kind of subway.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.990
He wanted to invent a subway
that ran on pneumatic power.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.990
Does anyone know what
pneumatic power is?

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.290
&gt;&gt; No.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.720
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, I need -- do
you know what pneumatic power is?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.790
&gt;&gt; Pneumatic power is that
the subway stays on forever.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.090
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That
the subway what?

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.390
&gt;&gt; Stays on forever.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.730
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Stays old forever?

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.030
&gt;&gt; On.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.330
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Stays on forever.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.630
That's a really good thought.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.930
Would you be my volunteer?

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.230
I need someone to come volunteer
and demonstrate pneumatic power.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.530
Come, come up here.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.920
So are you really good at Science?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.750
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, we have
a scientist here who's going

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.860
to demonstrate pneumatic
power for us.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.160
Can you take this and blow it?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.350
Whoa! So I have a question for you.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.450
I didn't see you take
your hand and move that.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.380 position:56%
What force did you use to move that?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.680
&gt;&gt; Wind.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.980
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Wind.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.280
Air and that's what
pneumatic power is.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.580
It's air power.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.250
So Beach used air power.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.720
You want to hold on to that?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.020
Here, let me hold onto it.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.320
You can have it at the end.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.620
Thank you so much.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.260 position:56%
Can we give her a round of applause?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.650
So Beach used air, people, to
move his subway back and forth.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.090
Now the book I'm going to read
today is a book about this person.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.390
Who is that?

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.690
&gt;&gt; John F. Kennedy.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.250
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: John F. Kennedy --
who would be a hundred at the end

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.270
of -- at the end of this month.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.900
And he inspires me because he's a
real person and he had a decision

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.220
to make if he was going
to be brave and stand

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.020
up for something he believed in.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.880
So should we read the
story and see what he did?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.480
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes, okay.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.580
I'm going to -- let's see
if I can put this here

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.680
so I can turn the pages in my
book and read a little up closer.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.400
Yes, okay.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.300
<i>A Time To Act </i>, so do
you guys, what's it called

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.250
when a book is about a person?

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.550
Do you know the name?

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.020 position:56%
What kind of book is about a person?

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.820
Yes.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.210
&gt;&gt; What's the --

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.510
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.810
So you --

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.110
&gt;&gt; Biology?

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.410
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Close.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.410
Biography -- you guys
are such smart kids.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.690
Biography -- so this is a
biography of John F. Kennedy.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.760
So it's also nonfiction
and I'm going

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.340
to read it here and turn the pages.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.640
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.480
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: John F. Kennedy
loved to read about history.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.800
But history isn't just in books.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.380
It's happening all
around us and the people

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.720
who make history aren't just famous
leaders or characters in stories,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.520
they're real people just like you.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.700
Sometimes, they are you.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.380
John or Jack as he was
called, was the second

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.920
of nine children in
a big, rich family.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.430
If you saw the Kennedys, you
might think they had everything.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.350
But take a closer look.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.860
Jack wasn't the favorite.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.010
That was his big brother, Joe.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.290
Their father wanted Joe to
grow up to be the president.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.800
No one was sure what Jack would be.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.400
Jack didn't always
do well in school.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.180
"He is casual and disorderly and
can seldom locate his possessions,"

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.820
said one of his teachers.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.870
And he was often sick.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.220
But Jack was funny
and people liked him.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.600
When Jack was too sick to
play outdoors, he read.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.450
Jack's mother taught her
children the importance

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.590
of giving back to one's country.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.830
Jack took that belief seriously.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.240
When the United States entered
World War II, he joined the fight.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.500
On August 2, 1943 an enemy ship
ripped into the boat he commanded.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.830
Jack led their survivors to safety,
towing one of the injured for more

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.050
than three miles by the
man's lifeboat strap.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.530
He carried the lifeboat strap
in his teeth while he swam.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Wait, what about that other page?

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.790
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That other page?

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.090
I'm reading.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.390
I'm not reading the whole
thing because I want

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.690
to make sure we have time
for questions and for me

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.910
to show you how it became a book.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.580
Jack's brother, Joe,
also served his country.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.220
But Joe wasn't as lucky as Jack.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.020
A year after Jack's rescue,
Joe was killed flying

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.710
over the English Channel.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.830
The family was heartbroken.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.470
Now, it was up to Jack to carry
out his father's dreams for Joe.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.350
In 1946, Jack ran for Congress.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.180
His whole family helped.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.250
After six years as a congressman,
Jack was elected to the Senate.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.310
Americans loved the handsome young
senator and his new wife, Jackie.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.640
They were celebrities.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.990
Soon after they were married,
Jack had back surgery.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.920 position:56%
While he recovered, he wrote another
book with the help of his staff.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.640
<i>Profiles in Courage </i>told
about people who had the courage

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.480
to take a stand for things
they believed in even

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.080
when they weren't popular.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.350
Have you guys ever done
something really brave?

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.650
&gt;&gt; I have.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.950
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What?

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.550
Have any of you guys
ever done something

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.950
that you feel like is really brave?

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.010
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What have
you done that's really brave?

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.090 position:56%
What -- because Jack was interested.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.080
He wrote a whole book about
people who did brave things.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.380
&gt;&gt; I ran into the pool and I
didn't even know how deep it was.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.100
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Going into a pool,
that's really brave especially

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.580
if you're not sure about it.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.420
What else have you done
that's really brave?

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.370
&gt;&gt; I have a nine-feet
pool and I jumped

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:29.020
into the deep feet even
though that I was scared.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.320
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, wow!

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.960
Jumping into a pool is
a really brave thing.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.380
You guys are a bunch of brave kids.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.440
So hold on -- we'll do
more in a little bit.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.240
On January 2, 1960, Jack announced
he was running for president.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.360
Hold on, I'm juggling
a lot of things.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.920
For president of the United States
-- years of practice had turned him

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.800
into a powerful speaker but not
everyone thought he would win.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.730
Do you think it would be
hard to run for office

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.540
if people were saying
you couldn't win?

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.750
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah, he was 42
years old, younger than every,

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.740
any president who had
ever been elected before.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.940
President Dwight D.
Eisenhower called him

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.940
that young whippersnapper.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.620
Eleanor Roosevelt thought Jack's
father was spending too much money

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.340
to help him get elected.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.300
"My dear boy," she telegrammed,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.540
"I only say these things
for your own good."

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.040
And Jack was Catholic.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.550
Many people believe the country
wouldn't elect a Catholic.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.850
"I believe in an America

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.360
where religious intolerance
will someday end," said Jack.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.140
&gt;&gt; That's really for you.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.440
&gt;&gt; Wait.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.740
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That is
-- that is Ruby pictures.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.470
Look, the pictures
right before, behind it.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.900
America was also in
the midst of a long,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.350
hard struggle over civil rights.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.470
Civil rights are the rights of
all people to be treated fairly

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.040 position:56%
without being discriminated against.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.570
In many places, black people
were not treated fairly

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:57.150 position:56%
and the south especially, a system
called segregation kept black people

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.980
apart from white people.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.090 position:56%
Even though the Supreme Court -- and
did you guys pass the Supreme Court

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.840
on its way here, on the
way here, it's just right

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.280
down the street -- had
declared it illegal.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.290 position:56%
Black people were not allowed to go
to the same schools as white people.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.350
They were not allowed to drink from
the same water fountains or eat

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.850
in the same restaurants or
stay in the same hotels.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.810
Black people couldn't always get
the same jobs as white people

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.680
and sometimes, they
were kept from voting.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.460
Many Americans, both civil rights
leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.810
and others who weren't famous,
even students, even kids just

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.920 position:56%
like you guys, were trying to change
that through peaceful protests.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.230
Have any of you ever
been to a protest?

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.610
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah,
that's really exciting.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.660
So you guys, if you've
been to protests,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.470
you're already part of history.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.990
You're part of history just
like the people in this book.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.290
&gt;&gt; I've been to a protest.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.590
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You've
been to a protest?

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.960
So you're working to change
history and to make history.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.250
That's how you make
history by being part of it.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.640 position:56%
And you guys are already doing that.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.210
&gt;&gt; I went to the --

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.510
&gt;&gt; Women's March?

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.810
&gt;&gt; The Women's March.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.110
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: The Women's March?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.640
&gt;&gt; I told Donald Trump that we --
that we should be where we want.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.800
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Wait, so you
went to the Women's March.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.370
&gt;&gt; So we can show Donald
Trump that we're --

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.690
&gt;&gt; That love is --

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.450
&gt;&gt; That love is stronger.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And that's where she made a sign.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.850
&gt;&gt; That says --

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.150
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You made a sign?

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.450
&gt;&gt; That says love is stronger.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.850
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That's fabulous!

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.290
So you're part of history.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.720
You guys are changing history.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.350
You're making your voices heard

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.030
and telling people how you
want our country to be.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.810
Good job. Good job, all of you.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.380
So here are some more kids
that were part of protests.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.660
Just a month after Jack announced
he was running for president,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.560 position:56%
four college students in Greensboro,
North Carolina began a sit-in.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.500
So does anyone know
what a sit-in is?

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.830
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: It's a protest when
you're sitting to make a statement.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.160
So I'll read about it.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.940
They sat quietly and peacefully

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.350
at a whites-only lunch counter
and waited to be served.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.090
They were refused.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.020
Every day, more and more
students joined them.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.160
By the end of the week, the sit-ins
had spread across the country.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.970
I'll turn the page.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.120
That October, Martin Luther King
was arrested and sent to prison

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.430
after participating in a sit-in.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.660
His wife, Coretta Scott-King,
feared he would be killed.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.750
Jack's campaign worked
secretly with Georgia's governor

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.790
to get Dr. King released.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:40.130
Some of Jack's advisers worried
that would cost him the votes

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.650
of white people who didn't
support civil rights.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.540
So do you think that stopped him
or do you think he still wanted

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.100
to help Martin Luther King?

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.750
&gt;&gt; He wanted to help
Martin Luther King.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.990
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: But Jack
telephoned Mrs. King.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.710
"If there is anything I
can do to help," he said,

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.600
"please feel free to call on me."

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.430
On November 8, 1960, Jack was
elected the 35th president

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.310
of the United States.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.300
Hold on to your -- can you hold
on to your thought for a minute

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.700
and we'll do questions at the end?

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.960
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: In some things, the
new president acted quick -- whoop!

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.440
Thank you.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.310
In some things, the new president
acted quickly and used bold words.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.740
He established the Peace Corps and
challenged young Americans to go

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.390
out into the world and
work shoulder-to-shoulder

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.750
with people in other countries.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.330
The United States and the Soviet
Union were rivals competing

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.940
to be the strongest.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.030
The Soviet Union had already
sent a man into space.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.180
Have you guys heard
about the space race?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.780
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes, Jack declared

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.000
that the United States would be the
first to land the man on the moon.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.420
But on other things, in
important civil rights issues,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.260
Jack was slow to act.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.600
He once declared that the
president must be willing

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.170
to get in the thick of fight.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.510
But now, he seemed unwilling
to fight some battles.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.850
"I would like to be patient,"

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.790
the famous baseball player
Jackie Robinson wrote to Jack,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.840
"but patience has cost us years in
our struggle for human dignity."

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.710
So he's moving really fast in
some things but in other things,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.850
he's moving a little
slower like on civil rights.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.650
But others were taking action.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.410
In that May, despite the danger,
hundreds of black children

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.880
and teenagers once again
stood up and acted.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.020
They left their classrooms
in Birmingham, Alabama

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.580
and singing songs of freedom,

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.850
marched peacefully to
protest segregation.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.920
They were hauled off to jail.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.450 position:56%
But the next day, even more young
people arrived to take their places.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.200
So in the Civil Rights Movement,

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.690
a lot of young people were
right at the forefront.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.940
They were the ones
making change and saying,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.770
"We have to do something different.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.930
We have to make our voices heard."

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.050
Americans including Jack, saw the
young people's courage on the news

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.040
and were sickened by the violence.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.020
On June 11th, two black
students applied to enroll

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.270
at the University of Alabama.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.420
Alabama's white governor
pledged to block them.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.900
Again and again, young people
had shown their courage.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.710
Do you think Jack's
going to act now?

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.550
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Jack had to act.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.460
And finally, following
in the footsteps of those

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.840
who would set the course by sitting
in and sending letters, marching

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.970
and riding buses, he did.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.110
Jack ordered the National Guard
to escort the students safely

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:38.440
into school and that night,
in living rooms, in kitchens,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.760
in diners across America, millions
of people of all colors, children

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.620
and parents and grandparents,
rich people and poor people,

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.490
people from the North and
people from the South,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.040
people of different religions,
people who had looked the other way

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.920
and people who had fought for
change, turned on their televisions

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.790
and radios and heard
the president speak.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.860
Okay, this is some of
what the president said.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.160
So he made this very important
speech on civil rights.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.650
He said, "One hundred
years of delay has passed

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.370
since President Lincoln freed
the slaves yet their heirs,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.080
their grandsons are not fully free.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.570
This nation will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.620
Now the time has come for this
nation to fulfill its promise.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.140
It is a time to act."

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.340
So that's where that
title comes from.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.760
So after that speech,
Martin Luther King

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.600
and the baseball player Jackie
Robinson, sent Jack telegrams

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.410
and letters and said, "Good."

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.000
They basically said, "Good job."

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.520
Jackie Robinson said, "The
presidential statement

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.200
on the color question is one of
the finest declarations ever issued

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.620
in the cause of human rights."

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.500
Because presidents hadn't
really said that before.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.510
Sometimes, they had said, "Oh, you
know, we need to end segregation."

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:58.680
But they had never really said that
it's totally and completely wrong.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.690
They had made it sound
like it was about politics.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.030
And Jack Kennedy was the first one
that said, "No, it's just wrong."

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.390
The following week, Jack sent
a strong Civil Rights bill

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.690
to Congress.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.810
So do you think he sent almost
right across the street to Congress

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.330
and the Senate Building
right across the street?

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.460
It's pretty cool that you
guys are right in the place

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.130
where all of this happened.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:26.820
President Kennedy was
killed on November 22, 1963,

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.970
just a few minutes out
or just a few months

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.700
after he addressed the
nation on civil rights.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.770
But his legacy, his words
and actions live on.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.070
Today, the Soviet Union
no longer exists

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.760
but young Peace Corps volunteers
still go out into the world,

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.970
building roads and bridges,
libraries and schools.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.000
On July 20, 1969, Kennedy's
space challenge was met.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.880
Two American astronauts
walked on the moon.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:05.110
And on July 2, 1964 with the
help of many courageous people,

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.780
people who didn't give
up, the Civil Rights Act

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:13.010
of 1964 was finally passed
making it illegal to discriminate

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:16.860
in jobs based on the color
of one's skin and providing

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.350
for the integration of
schools and public places.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.500
Hold on one second and then we'll
do questions in a little bit.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.960
In the 50 years since
the bill was passed,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.790
there has been much
progress on civil rights.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.240
But there have been
step backwards too.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.290
History isn't a straight line.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.830
And it's not words written
in books and permanent ink.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.130
It's changing.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.810
We're changing it every day.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.320 position:56%
You guys, when you go to protests
and things, you're changing history.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.910
"From here on out, you
are the decision makers,"

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.840
Jack once told young people.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.130
"You are the writers of history.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:57.220 position:56%
And so now, it's your turn to choose
your course, to speak up, to act,

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.310
to move the world forward,
to make history."

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.710
So kids your age can
and have made history.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.760
You guys are part of history.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.290
So I was going to show you guys,

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.520
do you want to see how
this story became a book

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.070
and then we'll have
time for questions?

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.370
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.570
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So I'll show
you, when I first wrote this,

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.330
the first thing I do is
I look for inspiration.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.630
And you guys were talking
about where you get your ideas

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.290
and someone said, "Pictures."

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.720
I get a lot of ideas
from photographs.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.090
These are some of the real pictures
of John F. Kennedy's family.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.880
I know you guys saw some
Kennedy memorabilia upstairs.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.570
Did you see pictures?

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.170
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.470
So he's the second oldest.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.770
Here's another picture
of his family later.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.050
He's right in the middle
in the back.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.550
But even more, as much as I was
inspired by John F. Kennedy,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:50.020
I was even more inspired by
the people he was inspired by,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.500 position:56%
the people that were really creating
the change, those brave kids

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.210
that were showing their
courage by protesting.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.510
Who knows, who is that?

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.810
Does anyone who -- who?

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.110
&gt;&gt; Ruby Bridges.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.410
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Everyone knows.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.710
Who is that?

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.010
&gt;&gt; Ruby Bridges?

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.310
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You guys, I
can't get over these kids.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:06.610
They are so smart.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.910
Yes, that's Ruby Bridges.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.210
So she was the first
black student to integrate

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.590
in elementary school, right?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.890
What were you going to say?

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.600
&gt;&gt; Why did she have to go
to the white kid's school?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.680
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You know,
that's a really good question.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.980
She wanted to.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.710
She wasn't -- she hadn't been
allowed to but usually the schools

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.120
that the white kids went
to had better resources.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.830
They had more money so they --
she wanted to have the same things

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.420
that her parents wanted her to
have because she deserved just

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.140
as good an education as
everyone else, right?

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.160
&gt;&gt; Why would the [inaudible]?

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.530
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That's
a really good question.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.640
You know, have you heard -- noticed
sometimes when some people think

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.440
that some people are worried
that they're going to --

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.620
if they share with people
that they won't have as much.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.400
I think it had to do with that.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.090
Some people felt like they
wanted to keep all the good stuff

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.480
so they would keep the other
people out and they felt

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.110 position:56%
like they wanted all the good stuff.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.670
And yeah, it wasn't a fair system.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.540
The Supreme Court said
it was unfair, right?

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.360
And so now we could be together.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.940
I was also inspired.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.330
These are some of the real kids.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:10.490
Remember in the book, the march
when the kids left their classrooms

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.790
in Birmingham and marched?

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.470
That's called the Children's
Crusade.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.850
Here are some of the
real kids who marched.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.560
Just like you guys when some of
you said you had marched recently.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.700
And I was inspired by those kids.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.780
So when I started reading
about Kennedy --

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.080
&gt;&gt; I marched.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.380
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: When you
marched, I wanted to write

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.700
about the kids that inspired him.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.770
So then I started writing.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.270
I also found lots of old documents.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.580
This is a letter John F. Kennedy
wrote when he was a little boy.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.270
Here are some telegrams he got.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.600
There's a telegram from Eleanor
Roosevelt that says, "My dear boy,"

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.160
and then I started
writing my rough draft.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.470
You know, my rough
drafts are kind of messy.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.770
I don't know if I should
show it to you.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.070
They're --

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.670
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah?

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.970
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.270
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay, this is
what my rough drafts look like.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.010
This is a rough draft
for my baseball book.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.310
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.680
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So if you were in
the library and you could check

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.050
out any book you wanted,
how many of you would get

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.340
that if you saw it on the shelf?

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.640
What --

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.940
&gt;&gt; I won't.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.240
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Not many, right?

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.540
What's it missing?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.840
What does it need before
it can be a book?

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.140
What's it missing?

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.550
&gt;&gt; It's missing pictures and
it's missing a front page.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.940
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: It's missing
pictures, a title page.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.560 position:56%
One more -- what else is it missing?

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.960
&gt;&gt; It's also missing the title.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.110
If it had a title, then they
would actually be a book.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.650
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: If it had a title,
it actually would be a book.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.400
Okay, one more.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.700
What else is it missing?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.000
What does it need before
it can be a book?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.180
&gt;&gt; It could be a book with
[inaudible] they wanted

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:47.360
and everything that it has to
be, I'll have pictures on it.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.660
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You're right.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.960
Not all books have pictures.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.260
You're absolutely right.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.560
Not all books have pictures.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.860
And it is pretty messy, right?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.160
&gt;&gt; No.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.460
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.760
Should we get one more?

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.060
What were you going to say?

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.360
&gt;&gt; It's missing a period.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.660
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Is it?

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.960
It probably is.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.260
And I can't even tell.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.560
It's missing -- I think it's
missing correct spelling.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.860
It's missing pages.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.160
It's pretty messy.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.520
So what I do after my
first draft is I revise.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.310
I -- who can tell me,
what does revise mean?

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.220
What does revise mean?

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.520
&gt;&gt; You do it again.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah, I do it again.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.930
So I keep working on it to
make it better and better.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.770
And when it's as good as
I can possibly make it,

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.260
I type it all neatly.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.780
Here's a typed up version of a
book I did about the Girl Scouts.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.180
And I sent it to my editor.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.610
Now, how many people think when
I send my typed up, very neat,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.490
spellchecked version to my
editor, she says, "It's brilliant.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.790
It's perfect.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.560
We're going to publish
tomorrow just like this."

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.860
Is that what you guys think?

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.460
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah?

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.970
You see, I think that every
single time and it never happened.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.420
Instead, she sends it
back to me full of ideas

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.840
for how I can revise it more.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.570
You want to see what she sent
me back when I sent her this?

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.170
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So this
is about Daisy Low,

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.470
the founder of Girl Scouts.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.890
Here is what she said back to me.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.190
&gt;&gt; Oh [inaudible].

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.820
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: If you look,
all of those are comments

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.120
about ways I can make
the story better.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.600
I think in this one, the only thing
she said I could keep was the main

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.900
character's name.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.710
And that's only because
it's nonfiction.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.330
It really was her name.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.800
Everything else she wants me to
change and try to make it better

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.800
because if we're going to ask you
guys to take your time to read it,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.160
we really need to work as hard
as we can to make it good.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.260
And then the last thing we do is
we send it to the illustrator.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.960
This illustrator's name is R.
Gregory Christie for this book.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.910
And the illustrator
does some sketches.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.850
So that's what his sketches look

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.210
like before he does these beautiful
paintings that you see behind me.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.570
And for covers -- covers
can take a really long time,

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.420
just like authors revise and
revise to get their stories right.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.100
Illustrators revise and revise
[inaudible] art for that.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.550
Here are some of what Greg Christie
when he was working on the cover.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.440
This is what the final
cover looks like.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.490
Put it here so you guys can see.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.860
But you can see these
are some things

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.700
when he was experimenting
with different ideas.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.000
Getting different ideas down.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.320 position:56%
These are just he was thinking
maybe we should have Kennedy walking

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.760
to the podium?

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.300
&gt;&gt; I would [inaudible].

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.600
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What?

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.900
&gt;&gt; It doesn't [inaudible].

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.590
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Sorry, a couple
didn't come through but so look,

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:16.960
all these different ideas.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.530
But when we were talking
about these, we had a thought.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.330
It's great to see Kennedy in these

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.590
but what was Kennedy's
big inspiration?

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.520
The book's about who
inspired Kennedy?

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.180
Yeah, who inspired Kennedy?

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.990
&gt;&gt; What does inspire mean?

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Inspire means
who made him give his speech?

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.530
Who --

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.470
&gt;&gt; Yes, Martin Luther King.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.190
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Martin Luther
King and also who else?

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The kids when they were marching.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.790
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: And also the kids.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.330
But you're right, Martin
Luther King wrote to him

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.040
and said, "You need to do more."

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.310
And the kids marching and he saw
pictures of those kids marching

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.890
and being met by violence
and he thought

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.500
if they can do it, we
have to do something.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.250
So R. Gregory Christie
decided, "You know what?

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.810
The kids need to be on the
front cover too because they're

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.750
as important as Kennedy
in this story at least."

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.200
So the final cover -- here, let's
see if I have the final cover

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.360
up there -- is it he'd brought
the real kids and he worked them

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.150
into the illustration
because that's --

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.560
so inspiration means the thing
that makes you do something.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.010
So that was Kennedy's inspiration.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.650
And that's everything I was going
to tell you guys about today.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.560
Do you guys have questions for me?

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.710
Yes, questions.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.030
&gt;&gt; Why did, if they
were making a sign,

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.000
why did they color the sign blue?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.300
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, good question.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.390 position:56%
I bet the real sign had words on it.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:45.480
But I would guess, you know,
artists can all -- they always --

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.730
they can make their decisions on
what they think looks the best.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.380
I think that it's probably,
if you put words on it,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.900
it might distract from the title.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.670
That would be my guess as to why
there aren't words on that sign.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.970
Good question.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.270
Yes.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.330
&gt;&gt; So I kind of have
an answer to Kai.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:08.330
So maybe since it's
-- so maybe that's --

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:13.200
so maybe the back of the sign was
actually supposed to be blue paper.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Oh, that's a good --

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.380
because we could be looking
at the back of the sign there.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.680
That's a good thought.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.980
&gt;&gt; Why are they [inaudible]?

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.720
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Okay,
we'll come back.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.020
Yes.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.550
&gt;&gt; Why did they -- why did
they -- did he have a funeral?

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:29.850
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Kennedy?

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.150
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:32.450
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: He did.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.750
When he died which was
later, it was in November

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.050
of the same year that
he gave the speech.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.350
He had a big, big funeral.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.850
Any other question?

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.470
Yes.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.960
&gt;&gt; What inspired you
to write the book?

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.160
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: To write this book?

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.680
I was interested in
writing about Kennedy

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.890
because I knew it was
his hundredth birthday.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.000
But what I was really interested is
I knew he was president during the

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.590
Civil Rights Movement.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.870
And I didn't know what
his involvement was.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.840
I had always read about those
two parts of history separately.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.470
I had read about Kennedy and
then I'd read about things

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.670
like the sit-in and Ruby Bridges.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.360
And I wondered what
was he actually doing?

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.660
He was the president.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.150
He had to be involved in it.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.760
And so I started trying to research
and find out what he was doing.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.060
Good question.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.550
Yes.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:22.530
&gt;&gt; What did you really like
about in the book about Kennedy?

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:23.960
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What do I like
in the book about Kennedy?

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.370
I can tell you my favorite piece
of art is -- it's not here.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.910
It's a piece of art that's all
the kids watching television.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:35.250
I find that really powerful
because you see kids all over,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.030
different kids, you know, some kids
from the South, some from the North

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.330
and I thought it must be
powerful to have a president stand

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.370
up for something that
you know is right.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.760
Actually, did any of you guys
-- you probably didn't --

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.770
there's the book that Kennedy
wrote called "Profiles in Courage"

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.180
about brave people,
they're awards --

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.960
Profile in Courage Awards and they
just gave them out this past week.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.340
And guess who got the
Profile in Courage Award?

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.640
&gt;&gt; John F. Kennedy.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.530
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: John
F. -- good, good idea.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:08.170
This year, it went to
President Barack Obama.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.470
So that was cool.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.780
&gt;&gt; He was my favorite
president [inaudible].

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.210
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: He was
your favorite president?

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.630
Well, you can hear his speech.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.790
He just -- just this past week, he
talks about Kennedy which was neat.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.290
&gt;&gt; He's very famous.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.190
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: He is very famous.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.490
Yes?

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.720
&gt;&gt; How come when Martin Luther King
got shot, how come segregation end?

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.860
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You know, it didn't
end right away like officially,

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.960
it ended with the Civil Rights Act.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.270
And even before the Civil Rights
Act, there was a Supreme Court case

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.960
that said there shouldn't
be segregation.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.900
But history, it can
take a long time.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.390
Change happens slowly.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:46.130
I think we want it to
happen faster, right?

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.010
I know I do but change happens --

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.190
&gt;&gt; Like what the [inaudible].

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.370
&gt;&gt; I thought that everybody
[inaudible] and he still got shot

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.570
that they would just
end it right away.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.870
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I know,
it would be nice

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.170
if it had just ended right away.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.720
I think it's also that you have
to keep working for things, right?

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.670
Because sometimes, it's
like we could relax

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.970
and think something's all done.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.550
That's why in the book, I talk
about how like we have gone forward

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:12.190
but then we slide backwards too.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.920
So that's why we have to
keep marching and protesting

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.610
in for things we believe in.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.710
Yes.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.810
&gt;&gt; Why did, why did the guy
shoot him in the first place?

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.530
&gt;&gt; Because he's mad at him.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.470
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Kennedy
or Martin Luther King?

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:28.770
&gt;&gt; Why was he mad at him?

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.070
&gt;&gt; Martin Luther King.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.370
&gt;&gt; He didn't like him.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.670
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Martin
Luther -- because --

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:33.970
&gt;&gt; He met Kennedy.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.270
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: He met Kennedy?

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:37.870
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You
know, there are --

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:39.170
&gt;&gt; He didn't like any
neighbor that had [inaudible].

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.470
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I think he just --
you know, I honestly don't know.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.800
I think he didn't agree
with him but [inaudible].

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.170
&gt;&gt; He didn't like the speech.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.470
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: He did
not like the speech.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.770
It was a little bit later.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.850
But I think a lot of times, it's
dangerous being a president.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.820
That's why presidents have
the Secret Service, right.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.720
Have you guys ever
seen Secret Service?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah, so now they
actually do a lot more safety things

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.220
than they used to do like they
don't have open cars and stuff

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.940
so that their presidents
can be a little safer.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.580
But yeah, it's much better
to -- if you have concerns,

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.990
to peacefully protest,
right, versus violence?

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:10.290
Yes.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.260
&gt;&gt; I know that so when
I saw that picture,

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:21.940
I thought so I knew it was going to
be like that because on the book,

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:30.710 position:56%
in the red writing, it said -- it
says "John F. Kennedy's Big Speech."

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.110
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: It does say that.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.670 position:56%
So we had a lot of -- I'll tell you
a few little behind-the-scene things

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.020
about that picture.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.870
When we first saw the
painting, it was all in color.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.960
And that's something the artist
revised because we started thinking

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.390
about it and what do you guys know

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.360
about televisions from
a long time ago?

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.120
What do you know about
-- you kids are so smart.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.420
&gt;&gt; It was black and white.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.720
It was black and white.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yeah, a lot of TVs,
most TVs were still black and white.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.750
So he had to go back and change
the art because we realized, wait,

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.190
that probably wouldn't
have been in color.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.060
And we also did a lot to the title,

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.590
"A Time To Act" comes
from the speech he gave.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.090
Those were some of the words.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.440
And then we had to -- we debated
whether it should be John F.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.640
Kennedy's Big Speech or JFK's
Big Speech because a lot

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.730
of people called him JFK.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.030
What would you guys have done?

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.740
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] the F there for?

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.940
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Fitzgerald,
that was his -- yes.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:32.200
&gt;&gt; Back then, TV was
not really invented.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: But it was invented.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.270
&gt;&gt; And I saw a real live
TV way, way back then

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:42.700
and also something what I
did brave was go under water

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.000
when I didn't even, when I was,
when I didn't even want to do it.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.300
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: That
is really brave.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.570
A lot of people did
brave water things.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.180
Yeah, so TV was just invented.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.610
That's why the book says a lot of
people listened to it on the radio

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.580
because not everyone had a TV

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.180
and the government
didn't have the internet.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.370
No one was live streaming
the speech.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.710
But you know what, you guys, you
can actually watch the speech.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.890
You can go online and
your teacher can find --

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.190
you can watch a video
of this actual speech.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.830
It's on my website
or the JFK Library.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.130
Yes.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:19.290
&gt;&gt; So not all the people who
helped our country is black.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.930
Not all of them.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No, you're right.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.720
They were certainly,
there were white people

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.520
and other people that
helped too, right?

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.820
Allies? Yes.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:33.380
&gt;&gt; I know the last name of the
person who killed John F. Kennedy.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.680
&gt;&gt; Who?

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.980
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: What?

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.280
&gt;&gt; His last name is Oswald.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.580
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You're right.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.880
Yes.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.180
&gt;&gt; Oswald?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.470
&gt;&gt; What month was his funeral?

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.770
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You
know, I would assume --

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:47.280
he died in November
-- November 22nd.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.990
I actually don't offhand
know the date of his funeral

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.530
but I bet it was still November.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.900
&gt;&gt; I know the [inaudible].

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.540
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You
know the sit-in book?

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.170
Is it the one, the four
friends sitting there?

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.470
I love that book.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:03.770
That's a wonderful book.

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.800
There are wonderful books
about the -- about the sit-in.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.380 position:56%
Yeah, there's a wonderful book about
-- there are several wonderful books

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.380
about Martin Luther King.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.020
There's great books
about Ruby Bridges.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.200
Ruby Bridges actually wrote a kid's
book that you can find to read

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.590
when -- it's just interesting.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.310
&gt;&gt; Are you going to [inaudible]?

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.610
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I don't
know if you guys are going

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:23.910
to get read books here after.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.210
Are they reading books?

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.700
If not, I'm sure you can come
back and I bet you have a lot

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.850
of these books in your school.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:34.210
&gt;&gt; Didn't the person who got,

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:39.510
who killed John F. Kennedy,
didn't he get hanged?

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.930
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No, he didn't.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:42.740 position:56%
But he was -- that's a good thought.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.180
He was actually, he was shot.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.480
He was someone --

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, someone shot
him [inaudible].

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.970
&gt;&gt; I know the person
who [inaudible].

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.040
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You guys, I
think know more about Kennedy.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.410
&gt;&gt; I know who killed Oswald.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.180
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Who killed Oswald?

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.630
&gt;&gt; Jack Ruby, right?

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:00.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.760
&gt;&gt; Jack Ruby.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.060
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.360
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Jack Ruby.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.660
And there are books about that too.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.960
That's the thing.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.320 position:56%
One of the neat things about writing
is you can write different things.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.730
So this book is really about
Kennedy and civil rights.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.830
But there are books, I know
lots of great books too,

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.400
that talk about his assassination.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.050
There are some early
readers that are really good

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.630
about him too and other
picture books.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:26.510
&gt;&gt; Then Oswald also got arrested
for killing John F. Kennedy.

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:28.620
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.920
Yes.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.790
&gt;&gt; The person who killed John F. --

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:36.780
the person who killed John F.
Kennedy and then the person

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.780
who shot the person who shot John
F. Kennedy, who shot that person?

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.270
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes, it was
a really intense time, right,

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:48.160
of American history
because it was all --

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.460
&gt;&gt; It happened all in one day?

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.350
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: No, I don't believe
it happened all in the same day.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.510
No. Yes.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.880
&gt;&gt; When was this book made?

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.950
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So this
book -- good question --

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.980
it just came out last month.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.100
It was just published but
I really wrote it last year

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.920
because it takes a long time for --

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.380
the illustrator gets to do their
work after it's already written.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:19.100
So I wrote it and then it
went to the illustrator.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.400
Yes.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.730
&gt;&gt; When -- when did
the segregation end?

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.410
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Good question, so
I believe with the Civil Right --

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.060
what were you going to say?

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.490
&gt;&gt; I know when slavery ended.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.930
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: When
did slavery end?

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:40.630
&gt;&gt; Nineteen -- 1869.

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:41.930
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Good.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:47.130
&gt;&gt; I know when the first dependence
says we celebrate on the fourth

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.180
of July because that's in our
first dependence was wrote in.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.480
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: You're right.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.780
You guys know such good --

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.950
&gt;&gt; And George Washington
was in the fight.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:57.250
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: And
George Washington was

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.740
in the revolutionary war and
then was the first president?

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.250
&gt;&gt; The first president [inaudible].

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.260
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: So I think
segregation, it was --

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.210
it took longer to actually end
and when it became illegal.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:18.340
&gt;&gt; So we -- so we kind of know this
other person named Paul Revere.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I kind of know about
a person named Paul Revere too.

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, what is that?

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.480
&gt;&gt; Do this.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.730
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: It's
part of American history.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:31.690
And Paul Revere has to do with
the American Revolution too.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.010
I think Paul Revere
is very interesting.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.310
Yes.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.650
&gt;&gt; Are you writing another book?

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:38.110
What would it be about?

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:39.410
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Good question.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:44.310
So right now, I'm actually writing
a book about Michelle Obama.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.610
Yes.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:46.910
&gt;&gt; Any [inaudible]?

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:48.210
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: I think this
is the very last question.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.080
&gt;&gt; Was the person who
killed JFK arrested?

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.380
&gt;&gt; Shana Corey: Yes,
he was arrested.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.320
