00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.510
So one of the more powerful techniques that psychologists have at their

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.710
disposal for understanding where a personality comes from is twin adoption

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.440
studies. Now, twin adoption studies are so important because they really

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.595
simulate these naturally occurring experiments as it were. So the twin part is

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:20.752
really shorthand for how genetically related people are. So, for instance

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:25.240
identical twins are 100% genetically related, fraternal twins, siblings and

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.173
parents and off springs are 50% genetically related. Cousins then for instance

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:36.302
are about 12% genetically related on average. The adoption part is important

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:41.224
because it varies the environment. So whether people are raised in the same

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:46.473
family and household are in different families and households. So we can't

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:49.575
randomly assign people to these conditions, so we have to use what nature gives

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:54.112
us and that's the Twin Adoption Study. So the best way to study the affects of

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:57.596
genes in environment or nature and nurture on personality is to study different

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:03.630
kinds of relatives brought up in different kinds of environments. So now let's

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.559
go to Lauren for a question.
