00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's see if we can use
integration by parts

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.271
to find the antiderivative of
e to the x cosine of x, dx.

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.270
And whenever we talk about
integration by parts,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.090
we always say, well,
which of these functions--

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.060
we're taking a product
of two of these-- which

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.685
of these functions, either the
x or cosine of x, that if I were

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.520
to take its derivative,
becomes simpler.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.530
And in this case neither
of them become simpler.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.030
And neither of them become
dramatically more complicated

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.430
when I take their
antiderivative.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.520
So here, it's kind of a
toss up which one I assign

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.290
to f of x and which one
I assign to g prime of x.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.020
And actually, you can solve
this problem either way.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.270
So let's just assign this one.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.140
Let's assign f of x
equaling e to the x.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.130
And let's assign g prime of
x as equaling cosine of x.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.480
So let me write it down.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.100
We are saying f of x
is equal to e to the x,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.300
or f prime of x is
equal to e to the x.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.630
Derivative of e to the
x is just e to the x.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.730
And we can say that g-- we're
making the assignment-- g

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.510
prime of x is equal
to cosine of x.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.950
And the antiderivative
of that g of x is also.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.010
Or the antiderivative
of cosine of x

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
is just going to be
equal to sine of x.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.220
So now let's apply
integration by parts.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.440
So this thing is
going to be equal to f

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.250
of x times g of x,
which is equal to e

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.600
to the x times sine of x,
minus the antiderivative of f

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.160
prime of x-- f prime
of x is e to the x.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.080
e to the x times g of x, which
is once again, sine of x.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.520
Now, it doesn't look like
we've made a lot of progress,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.145
now we have an
indefinite integral that

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:48.560
involves a sine of x.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.480
So let's see if we can
solve that, let's see

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.740
if we solve this one separately.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.530
So let's say if we were trying
to find the antiderivative.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.740
The antiderivative of e
to the x, sine of x dx.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.070
How could we do that?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.580
Well, similarly, we can set f
of x as equal to e to the x.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.440
So, and now this is
we're reassigning,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.310
although we're happening to make
the exact same reassignment.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330
So we're saying f of x
is equal to e to the x.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.030
f prime of x is equal to
just the derivative of that,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.750
which is still e to the x.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.580
And then we could say
g of x, in this case,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.690
is equal to sine of x.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.660
We'll put these assignments in
the back of our brain for now.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.080
And then-- let me make this
clear-- g prime of x, let me,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.710
woops, there you go--
so we have g prime

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.570
of x is equal to sine
of x, which means

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.010
that its antiderivative
is negative cosine of x.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.660
Derivative of cosine
is negative sine,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.380
derivative of negative
cosine is positive sine.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.370
So once again, let's apply
integration by parts.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.520
So we have f of x times g of x.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.870
f of x times g of
x is negative--

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.750
is I'll put the negative
out front-- it's negative e

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:13.330
to the x times cosine of x,
minus the antiderivative of f

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.460
prime of xg of x.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.770
F prime of x is e to x.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.020
And then g of x is
negative cosine of x.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.912
So I'll put the cosine
of x right over here,

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.620
and then the negative,
we can take it out

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.220
of the integral sign.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.450
And so we're
subtracting a negative.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.050
That becomes a positive.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.270
And of course, we have
our dx right over there.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.740
And you might say, Sal, we're
not making any progress.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.160
This thing right
over here, we now

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.820
expressed in terms
of an integral that

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.220
was our original integral.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.890
We've come back full circle.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.900
But let's try to do
something interesting.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.260
Let's substitute back
this-- all right,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.040
let me write it this way.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.690
Let's substitute back
this thing up here.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.610
Or actually, let me
write it a different way.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.740
Let's substitute this for
this in our original equation.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.070
And let's see if we got
anything interesting.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.910
So what we'll get is
our original integral,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.829
on the left hand side here.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.950
The indefinite integral
or the antiderivative of e

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.330
to the x cosine of
x dx is equal to e

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:39.027
to the x sine of x, minus
all of this business.

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:40.860
So let's just subtract
all of this business.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.070
We're subtracting all of this.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.660
So if you subtract negative
e to the x cosine of x,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.490
it's going to be positive.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.380
It's going to be positive
e to the x, cosine of x.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.570
And then remember, we're
subtracting all of this.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.470
So then we're going to subtract.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:08.710
So then we have minus the
antiderivative of e to the x,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.152
cosine of x,dx.

00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:14.890
Now this is interesting.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.170
Just remember all we did is, we
took this part right over here.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.780
We said, we used
integration by parts

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.738
to figure out that it's
the same thing as this.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.320
So we substituted this back in.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.840
When you subtracted it.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.600
When you subtracted
this from this,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.380
we got this business
right over here.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.830
Now what's interesting
here is we have essentially

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.139
an equation where we
have our expression,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.430
our original expression, twice.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.054
We could even assign
this to a variable

00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:38.950
and essentially solve
for that variable.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.420
So why don't we
just add this thing

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.025
to both sides of the equation?

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:43.900
Let me make it clear.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.800
Let's just add the integral
of e to the x cosine

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.710
of x dx to both sides.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.600
e to the x, cosine of x, dx.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.559
And what do you get?

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:57.100
Well, on the left
hand side, you have

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.520
two times our original integral.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.440
e to the x, cosine of x, dx is
equal to all of this business.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.125
Is equal to this.

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:09.132
I'll copy and paste it.

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:11.890
So copy and paste.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.630
It's equal to all of that.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.250
And then this part, this part
right over here, cancels out.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.040
And now we can solve for
our original expression.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.350
The antiderivative of e
to the x cosine of x dx.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.240
We just have to divide
both sides of this,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.370
essentially an equation, by 2.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.220
So if you divide the
left hand side by two,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.280
you're left with our
original expression.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.200
The antiderivative of e
to the x cosine of x dx.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.690
And on the right hand side you
have what it must be equal to.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.132
e to the x sine of x, plus e
to the x cosine of x over 2.

00:06:47.132 --> 00:06:49.110
And now we want to be
careful because this

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.600
is an antiderivative of
our original expression,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.090
but it's not the only one.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.550
We always have to remember,
even though we've worked hard

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.770
and we've done-- we've used
integration by parts twice.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.010
And we've had to
back substitute in.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.440
We have to remember we should
still have a constant here.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.820
So if you take the
derivative of this business,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.630
regardless of what
the constant is,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.850
you will get e to
the x cosine of x.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.476
And it's actually a pretty
neat looking expression.
