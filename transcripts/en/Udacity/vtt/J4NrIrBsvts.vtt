00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is there is always exactly 1.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For any message ciphertext pair, there is one key that maps that message to that ciphertext.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can see that thinking about the nature of the one-time pad.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Suppose we just have 1-bit messages.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We have messages 0 and 1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then the key 0 will map 0 to 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The key 1 will map 1 to 0. The key 0 will map 1 to 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This works for any length message and any length key.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Note that the length of the key and the length of the message scale the same way.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we had 2-bit messages there would be four different keys

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that would map each message to each different ciphertext.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If we had 2-bit messages, there would also be one key

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that maps each message to each different ciphertext.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For example, the key that maps 00 to 10 would be the key 11.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That means we can compute this probability,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
summing over all the messages summing over all the keys

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
where we've got the probability that that key encrypts that message to the given ciphertext.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We need to divide this by the space, which is the size of the messages

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
times the size of the keys.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now whats the value of the summation?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We know for a given message there is exactly one key that maps it to that ciphertext.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is one, and we're summing over all the messages,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
summing the value of 1.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That means we're going to get the number of messages divided by

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the number of messages times the number of keys.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That's equal to 1 over the number of keys.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's the probability of event B, which is probability

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that some message encrypts to some key.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Notice this is computed over all the messages.

00:01:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's over the distribution.
