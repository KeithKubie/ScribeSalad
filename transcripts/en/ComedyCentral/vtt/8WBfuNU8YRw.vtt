00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.912
- Welcome to Sober History.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:18.745
Today's guest is my dear
friend Eric Falconer.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.670
First subject is called having a dick.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.917
It doesn't suck having a dick?

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:28.309
- No I love having a dick.

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.811
(laughing)

00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:32.340
- [Derek] That's my favorite line.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.340
- I love it.

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:35.270
- [Derek] There's a lot of things I love,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.398
but nothing more than having a dick.

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:37.765
- I'd have a dick all day

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:38.952
- [Derek] Having a dick all day

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:40.262
- If I could

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:41.843
I'm scared about what
I'm about to say here.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:42.676
I'm really scared.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.335
I had a girlfriend once in high school

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.782
she knew I liked the movie
Beauty and the Beast.

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:48.786
(laughing)

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:52.369
so she gave me a statue
of Belle as a gift.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:58.392
It was beautiful, it
was a little statuette,

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:02.793
porcelain or whatever you make them out of

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:05.535
of Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:06.368
- [Derek] Beautiful.

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.115
- It was beautiful, it was french

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:09.992
- [Derek] Gaston

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:11.077
- A french gift

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:12.798
I was an awesome boyfriend by the way

00:01:12.798 --> 00:01:13.631
- You were what?

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.435
- An awesome boyfriend by the way

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:17.064
- You accepted the gift though?

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:19.098
- I did and I didn't talk about it

00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:23.571
for another 20 years (laughing)

00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:25.495
- Then you brought you
up the Statue of Liberty

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:26.542
You remember play dough?

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:30.709
- Yeah I don't remember how
I started eating play dough.

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.749
It's the gist of the arm man.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.124
If you care about
America you will see this

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:37.138
for what it's meant to be.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.555
- The Smurf dick.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:43.428
- It looks like a Gremlin, it
doesn't look like a statue.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:46.676
- You know how you said
as a kid I'd do right now,

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:49.945
fucking eat play dough, I
loved eating play dough.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:51.603
- Alright so you talked me into it

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:52.436
Eating it?

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.117
- I had a thing as a kid

00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:56.394
I would eat paste, I would eat paper,

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:58.852
I would eat like notebooks.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:02.876
- I get paste, you would eat play dough?

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:03.709
- Mmmhmm

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.622
This is old school Miley

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:09.457
- It's fucking terrible

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:12.554
It was the saltiest thing I've
ever put in my mouth, ever.

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:14.368
- Wig it down with some wine

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:17.124
- How did I not puke there?

00:02:17.124 --> 00:02:20.444
You'd think that would
have been my puking moment.

00:02:20.444 --> 00:02:23.277
Stay tuned for more Drunk History.
