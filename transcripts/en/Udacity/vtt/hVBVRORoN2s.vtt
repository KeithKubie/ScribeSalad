Well that was not easy, was it? No it wasn't. And that was kind of a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.870
trick question, because all of these things are

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.060
important to consider when building a scalable system. So

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.790
let's be clear about this. Plain virtual machines

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.060
are great in many ways. But if you

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.290
have to do all of these things yourself,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.810
we could consider using them a dead end street.
