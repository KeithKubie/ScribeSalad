00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, so let's see if we can actually use this as a way

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.830
of deriving something maybe that we already

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.310
knew. So I'm going to go through a couple

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.770
of these because I I actually think,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.690
well, frankly I just think it's kind of cool.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.820
But, I I'm hoping I can convince you it's sort of cool too and that

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.180
we get something out of it. Okay, so let me set up the word, I'm

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.960
going to set up a a problem, and it's going to be a kind of generic problem,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.440
and I'm going to see what we can get out of it, okay? So this is

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.890
machine learning, so we're going to be given a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.210
bunch of data, so there are three assumptions

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.540
that I'm going to make here. The first is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.810
that we're going to be given a bunch of labeled

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.390
training data, which I'm writing here as x sub i and d sub i, so x sub i

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.890
is whatever the input space is, and d sub i are these labels. And let's say, it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.290
doesn't actually even matter what the labels are, but

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.400
let's say that the labels are classification labels. Okay?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.860
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.820
&gt;&gt; All right. And furthermore, not only we're given

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.430
this data as examples drawn from some underlying concept c,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490
but they're, in fact, noise-free. Okay? So they're

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.060
true examples that tell you what c is. Okay?

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.471
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to say, in fact, let me write

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.320
that down because I think it's important. They're noise-free examples. Okay.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.640
&gt;&gt; Like di equals c of xi.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
&gt;&gt; That's right, for all xi. So, the second assumption, is that the true

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320
concept c, is actually in our hypothesis

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.980
space, whatever that hypothesis space is. And finally,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.750
we have no reason to believe that

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.400
any particular hypothesis in our hypothesis space is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.920
more likely than any other. And so, we have a uniform prior over our hypotheses.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.700
&gt;&gt; So it's like the one thing we know is that we don't know anything.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.620
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, sometimes people called this an uninformative prior

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.600
because you don't know anything. Except of course I've always thought that's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.880
a terrible name because its a completely informative prior. In fact

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.010
its equally as informative as every other prior in that it tells

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.810
you something that all hypothesis are equally likely. But that's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.010
&gt;&gt; I thought it was called an uninformed prior.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.470
&gt;&gt; Is it? So its just an ignorant prior is what you're telling me. Yeah.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, then maybe that's the problem.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.230
I just always had a problem with it

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.870
because people keep calling it uninformative and the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.020
really mean uninformed. Okay. In any case, so these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420
are our, these are our assumptions. We've got

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960
a bunch of data, it's noise free, the concept

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.650
is actually in the hypothesis base we care

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.360
about and we have a uniform prior. So we

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.940
need to compute the best hypothesis. So given

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.400
that we want to somehow compute the probability of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.200
some hypothesis given the data, right? That's just

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.790
Bay's Rule. So, Michael, you've got the problem right?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.482
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:21.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.610
okay. So in order to compute the probability of a hypothesis

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.550
given the data, we just need to figure out all of these

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.620
other terms. So let me just write down some of the terms

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.030
and you can tell me what a you think the answer. Okay.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.870
&gt;&gt; Well, what was the question?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.410
&gt;&gt; The question is, while we want to compute some

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180
kind of expression for the probability of a hypothesis given

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.320
the data. So given some particular hypothesis, I want to know

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.090
what's the probability of that hypothesis given the data, okay?

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, you got the setup. So, we're

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.370
going to compute that by figuring out these three

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.720
terms over here. So, let's just pick, one

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.410
of them to do. Let's try the prior probability.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.250
So Michael, what's the prior probability on H?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.000
&gt;&gt; Did we say that it was a finite hypothesis class?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.570
&gt;&gt; It is a finite hypothesis class.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.800
&gt;&gt; Then it's like, one over the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.370
size of that hypothesis class because it's uniform.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.970
&gt;&gt; Exactly right, uniform means Exactly that. Okay so we've got one of our

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.570
terms, good job. let's pick another term. How about the probability of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.600
data given the hypothesis. What's that?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.860
&gt;&gt; The probability, so I guess noise free, and we know that it's

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.310
noise free so it's always, so they're always going to be zeros and ones.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.853
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:36.240
&gt;&gt; So, and it's going to be a question of whether or not

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.070
the data is consistent with that hypothesis. Right, if the labels all match.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.750
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.140
&gt;&gt; What we expect them to be if that really were the hypothesis, then

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.590
we get a one, otherwise we get a zero. That's exactly right. So let me

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.160
see if I can write down what I think you just said. The probability of the data,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.300
given the hypothesis, is, therefore one if it's the case, that the labels

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.378
And the hypothesis agree for every single one of the training exercises. Right?

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:05.713
&gt;&gt; Yep

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:09.120
&gt;&gt; Is that what you said? Good. And if any of

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.770
them disagree, then the probability is zero. So that's actually very important.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.870
It's important to, to understand exactly what it means for,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.839
to have the probability to get a hypothesis, as we

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.510
mentioned before. That the English version of this is, what's

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.320
the probability that I would see data with these labels in

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.370
a universe where H is actually true. Which is different

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.930
from saying that H is trure or H is false. It's

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.940
really a common about the labels that you see on

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.480
a data. In a universe, where H happens to be true.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.770
&gt;&gt; Okay, but you know, it's occurring to me now

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.340
that you wrote that down, that we've talked about this idea before.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.840
&gt;&gt; When?

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.460
&gt;&gt; Well, so, like there's a shorter way of writing that. Which is

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.460
D of H equals one if H is in the version space of D.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.400
&gt;&gt; Huh, that's exactly right, that's exactly right. So, in

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.880
fact, that will help us to compute the final term

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.150
that we need, which is the probability of seeing the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.830
data labels. So, how do we go about computing that? Well,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.910
it's exactly going to boil down to the version space

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.980
as you say, let me just write out a couple

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.060
of steps so that it's pretty Kind of easy to

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.320
see. It's sometimes easier in these situations to kind of break

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.690
things up. So, the probability of the data sort of

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.700
formally, is equal to just this. So we can write the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.500
probability of the data as being, basically, a marginalized version

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.410
of the probability of the data given each of the hypotheses

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.040
times the probability of the hypotheses. Now, this is only

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.580
true in a world where our hypotheses are mutually exclusive.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.910
Okay so let's assume we are in that world because

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.750
frankly that's what we always assume and this little trick

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.140
is going to workout for us because we are going to

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.670
get to take advantage of two terms that we already

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.990
computed naming the probability that the data given the hypothesis

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.460
and the prior probability of a particular hypothesis so we know that

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.590
prior probability of a hypothesis is right, its

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.040
just one over the size of the hypothesis space

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.400
and how am I going to substitute in this equation

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200
for the probability of the data given the hypothesis?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.610
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know. I would

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.490
write that differently. I mean, it's basically it's

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.160
like the indicator function on whether or hot HI is in the version space of D.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.320
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right. So in fact this is not a good

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.580
way to have written it. Let's see if I can come up with a,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.320
a good notational way of doing it. Let's

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.690
say, for every hypothesis that is in the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.900
version space of the hypothesis space given the

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.100
labels that we've got. Okay? How's that count?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.788
&gt;&gt; So rather than having to come

00:06:34.788 --> 00:06:38.668
up with an indicator function, I'm just going to

00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:40.996
define vs as the subset of all

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:45.478
those hypotheses that are consistent with the data.

00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:46.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.896
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so whats the probability of those?

00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:52.970
&gt;&gt; One It's one and it's zero otherwise, so then,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.763
we can simplify the sum and it's simply what? ?

00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:56.974
&gt;&gt; The sum of the one, ooh! The

00:06:56.974 --> 00:06:58.609
one of each doesn't even depend on the hypothesis.

00:06:58.609 --> 00:06:59.200
&gt;&gt; mm-mh!

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.000
&gt;&gt; I see wait I don't see oh yes I do, I do it's one over the size

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.120
of version space. No its the size of the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.610
version space over the size of the hypothesis space.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.169
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.249
Basically for every single hypothesis in the version space we're

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.320
going to add one and how many of those are?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.980
Well the size of the version space number of those.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.400
And multiply all that by one over the size hypothesis space,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.600
and so the probability of the data is that term. So

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.170
now we can just substitute all of that, into our

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.880
handy dandy equation up there, and let's just do that.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.300
So the probability of the hypothesis given the data, is the

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:43.500
probability of the data given the hypothesis Which we know is one for all those

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.860
that are consistent, zero otherwise. The probability

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.300
of the prior probability over the hypothesis is

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.890
just one over the size of the hypothesis space, and the probability of the data

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.920
is the size of the version space Over the size of the hypothesis base which,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.070
when we divide everything out, is simply this. Got it?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.640
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.790
&gt;&gt; So, what does that all say? It says that, given a bunch of data, your

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.800
probability of a particular hypothesis being correct, or being the best one

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.700
or the right one, is simply uniform over all of the hypotheses that are

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.060
in the version space. That is, are consistent with the data that we see.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.680
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.180
&gt;&gt; It

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.880
is kind of nice. And by the way, if it's

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.340
not consistent with it, then it's zero. So, this is

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.580
only true for hypotheses that are still in

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.100
version space and zero otherwise. Now notice that all of

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.090
this sort of works out only in a world

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.090
where you really do have noise free examples, and you

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.280
know that the concept is actually in your hypothesis space

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.220
and, just as crucially that you have a uniform prior

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.090
for all the hypotheses. Now this is exactly the algorithm that

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.820
we talked about before right. We talked about before what would

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.160
we do. To kind of decide whether a hypothesis was good

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.370
enough in this sort of noise-free world. And the answer we came

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.760
up with is you should just pick one of them that's

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.480
in the version space. And what this says is there's no reason

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.070
to pick one over the other from the version space. They're

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.210
all equally as good or rather equally as likely to be correct.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.060
that follows.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there you go. So it turns out you

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.990
can actually do something with this. Notice by the way that we

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.600
did not pick a particular hypothesis space, we did not pick

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.390
a particular form of our instance space, we did not actually say

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.920
anything at all about exactly what the labels were other than

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.160
that they were labels of some sort. The strongest assumption that we

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.920
made was a uniform prior, so this is always the right thing

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.790
to do. At least in a Bayesen sense in a world where

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.340
you've got noise free data, you have to find that hypothesis space, and

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.430
you have uniform priors. Just pick

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.610
something from the consistent set of hypotheses.
