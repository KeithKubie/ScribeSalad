Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the TodayIFoundOut Youtube channel.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.419
In the video today, we’re looking at the
origin of the word blackmail and the much

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.420
lesser known buttockmail.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.390
"Blackmail" has its roots in the early 16th
century, first used by English farmers living

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.490
on the England/Scotland border.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.410
It derives from the Middle English word "male"
which itself is thought to derive from the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.980
Old English word "mal", meaning "lawsuit,
terms, bargaining, agreement".

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.300
Over time, this word evolved to "Male" which
in Middle English roughly translated to either

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.610
"Rent" or "Tribute".

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.800
As such, the rent paid by a farmer living
on the Scottish border was known as "Silver

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.540
Rent/Mail" because it was normally paid in
silver.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.070
This gave rise to "White Money" or "White
Rent", and eventually "whitemail".

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.120
When certain Scottish chieftains (and various
brigands) noticed all these well to do farmers

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.170
going about their business without someone
threatening them for money, they decided to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.030
start threatening them for money in return
for not razing their farm to the ground and

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.579
destroying all their livestock.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.170
Those forcing the tribute would also then
offer their protection to the farmers from

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.640
others who might try something similar.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
Farmers almost immediately began referring
to this secondary rent they were being forced

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.909
to pay as "black rent" or "blackmail".

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.159
Etymologists aren't sure where the "black"
part of blackmail came from.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.829
Seemingly the most obvious theory is simply
due to the connotations black had with evil.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.950
But the most obvious answer and the correct
one aren't necessarily the same, and lacking

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.619
direct evidence, many other theories have
popped up.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.569
The most probable of the bunch is by Charles
McKay in the Dictionary of Lowland Scots (1888)

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.250
who claimed it derives from the Gaelic blathaich,
meaning "to protect", so "protection rent".

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.529
Whatever the case, in 1814, the Scottish playwright,
Sir Walter Scott gave the world perhaps the

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:42.409
most detailed explanation of what blackmail
back in those days entailed.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.479
In Scott's historical novel Waverley, blackmail
(written then as "black-mail") is described

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.479
as follows.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.250
“A sort of protection-money that Low-Country
gentlemen and heritors,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.609
lying near the Highlands, pay to some Highland
chief, that he may neither

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.560
do them harm himself, nor suffer it to be
done to them by others”

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.259
Scott also mentions that if a person paying
this protection money comes to harm or suffered

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.149
a loss at the hands of another raider, the
person they were paying would endeavour to

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.229
cover their losses, usually by stealing replacements
from someone who wasn't paying them protection

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.229
money.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.510
This all brings us to yet another form of
"-mail" that was popular from about the 16th

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
century through the 19th that, purely for
its amusing sounding nature, we'd like to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.140
bring back into common usage in some form
or another: buttock-mail.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.470
Given what you now know of "-mail", if you
guessed that "buttock-mail" was some form

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.000
of payment in order to keep things quiet about
your having a good time with someone's buttock,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.360
you actually wouldn't be that far off.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.250
In fact (in Scotland), buttock-mail was a
sort of a tax introduced in 1595 which was

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.849
enforced by the church courts.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.200
Essentially, if you had sex outside of wedlock,
often with a prostitute (hence the "buttock"

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.230
part, which was a slang for prostitute), and
you were a Presbyterian in Scotland, you would

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.469
often be given the choice of the Stool of
Repentance or paying buttock-mail to stop

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.970
from having to stand on a stool in front of
everyone and get berated by your local minister

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.129
for your lustful actions.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.920
While the latter, perhaps, doesn't sound so
bad to modern thinking compared to having

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.440
to pay a hefty tax to keep things quiet, without
the option of buttock-mail, or if one couldn't

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.360
afford it, people are known to have killed
themselves rather than have to face the Stool

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:23.099
of Repentance and the "fornicator" label that
would follow them 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.730
in the aftermath.
