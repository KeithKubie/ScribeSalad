Elizabeth Cooper: It's right by the Dinky train station 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.029
and so I just ran into

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:07.940
a couple of

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.980
people who said they've been walking by 
every day wondering what it is is because it's

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.340
something that they pass by every day and 
that was one of the intentions of the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.340
location — to be pretty central so that people 
would be seeing it and wondering what's going on here.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.140
It's cool to have a space that hasn't been 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.279
tainted in some way. It has whatever 
connotation you give it. So, for me, it has a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.520
connotation of magic

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.490
and possibility and potentiality.
Fritz Haeg: This project is called the 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.820
"Princeton Student Colony." My name is Fritz Haeg 
and I'm leading an Atelier class here at Princeton.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.970
Ray Auduong: The Princeton Atelier is a program that 
invites a visiting artist and offers a class to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.410
Princeton undergraduates during each semester.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.160
Fritz Haeg: We would be focusing 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.240
specifically on a lot of really 
fundamental human activities that are

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.730
really kind of dismissed or not taken
seriously by institutions of higher

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.870
learning, like cooking and gardening 
and composting and napping and socializing

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900
and movement and dancing and exercise and 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.620
conversation and gathering —  you know, all 
these sorts of 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.720
activities maybe that are even so 
fundamentally human and so 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.390
obvious and quotidian 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.640
that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.869
we just 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.250
don't take them very seriously. 
Ugo Udogwu: I'm interested in art. I'm a visual art major, 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.250
and it's like this kind of 
encompasses a lot of different things. 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.050
It encompasses art in a new way. 
It's not just like you're somewhere 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.470
just making a piece of work. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.930
It's almost as if the whole class, 
the whole event, is an artwork.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
Fritz Haeg: Dan Wood and I, my collaborator  
in the architecture program, we 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.410
designed the platform, we decided upon the 
tent and we created a basic infrastructure for 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.860
the students to move into, 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370
a platform upon which things can happen,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.780
a tent within which we can be 
all winter. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.410
So, we wanted to supply the most basic 
kind of framework for us to 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.350
move into the space and start to meet here.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.629
Daniel Wood: I believe in this project. I think it can
be a great experience and it's definitely kind of a thing 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.399
you don't really see at Princeton everyday or 
really any schools. Charlotte Leib: We've had a

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.589
lot of great guest speakers so far 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:22.319
and they've been able to contribute a
lot of their expertise. So we're actually doing 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.759
something physical. So I think it's an 
unbelievably valuable experience for

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.150
the future in terms of working in a group

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.679
and just

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:34.059
figuring out how to make things happen.  is
We have so many big ideas it's just what is so great 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.859
about Princeton students. We're all from different 
majors. D.J. Judd: It also has a lot to do 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.649
with low-impact living, performance studies, 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.279
social networking. It just seemed 
to touch on a lot of things that I was 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.629
interested in. The
Atelier program is usually focused on cross-

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.049
disciplinary 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.559
subjects and it seemed like a lot of the 
subjects that this class was intent on 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.619
tackling

00:02:55.619 --> 00:03:00.389
was sort of right up my alley. 
Elizabeth Cooper: It's not just our thing, it's actually 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.339
everybody's potential. It's everybody's space. And so, 
I think one way to do that is to have 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.900
practical things that we need to have 
made or created, and inviting people 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.799
to help do that with us. So, if we
have a project making cushions or a 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.469
bookshelf, to invite people to help with that. 
Or invite people to lead their own activity 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.469
if they have something. It's really a stage and 
an opportunity for everybody to use.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:37.329
