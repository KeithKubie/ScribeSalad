00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.210
Sensor sizes play a role in all of this too.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.830
Here I'm basically showing you the aspect ratio and

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.310
sensor size of a 35 millimeter standard, full frame camera.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.040
So basically this is a 1 to 1 full frame, 35 millimeter, 24 millimeter.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.900
Sensor of course that impacts the field of view of a camera that you use to

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.840
capture images.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.144
Slightly smaller.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:27.878
This is another sensor size that's widely used 28.7 to 19.1.

00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:31.779
And the aspect ratio is no longer full frame, but 1 to 1.26.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.643
This is yet another well known and widely used.

00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:38.250
The aspect ratio in this one is 1 to 1.5.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.810
These days micro four-third cameras are getting more common and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.600
this is the sensor size for that.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.590
Of course a micro two-third camera sensor size is this.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.730
Other sensor sizes exist, 7.25 millimeter to 5.33.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.330
And again, now you notice that we're moving from a much more

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.500
professional digital SLR all the way to handheld cameras or

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.010
pocket cameras or more instant you know, cell phone cameras.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.130
This, for example, is a sensor for iPhone 5, 4.54 times 3.52 millimeters.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.930
And of course we can keep on getting other type of sensor sizes.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.830
But you noticed this is a sensor for

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.720
a professional camera all the way to kind of what's in mobile phones like this.
