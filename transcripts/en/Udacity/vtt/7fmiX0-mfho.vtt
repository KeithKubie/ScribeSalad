00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.830
In this section we're going to talk
about converting from decimals

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.390
to percents and back.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.743
Now I want to start by saying this
is going to be very brief section.

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:11.730
The assumption is that you've seen this
before and this is just a reminder.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.010
So if this is insufficient,
there's plenty of other resources online

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.630
that can help you learn how to
convert between decimals and percents.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.290
And you can find them linked in
the instructor notes section

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.130
below this video.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.600
So let's start with a candy bar.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.860
That's one whole candy bar.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.300
This is half of a candy bar.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.120
So if you have half a candy bar,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.418
what percent of the original
candy bar do you have left?

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:34.980
And you answer in this box, and you
don't need to include the percent sign.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.193
I'll include it for you.

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:37.796
Don't worry if you don't know
how to do this quite yet.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:41.300
We're going to review
this in the next video.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.420
This is just to get you thinking.
