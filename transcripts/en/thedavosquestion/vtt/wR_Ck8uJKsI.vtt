&gt;&gt;Beth A. Brooke: I just came out of the Denver
parody group and we had a fabulous discussion;

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.019
made several commitments and I know our organization
Ernst &amp; Young is very committed to continuing

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.760
to promote the business case for the inclusiveness
of women and people of different ethnicities,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.070
sexual orientation. But the purpose of all
of that, is to have a diverse set of perspectives

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.630
around the table. Frankly, at this point in
time with the financial crisis, if you have

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.430
and you actually have a diverse organization,
which we do, and you empower the use of that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.570
diversity to tackle issues, tackle challenges,
to create innovative ways to address the challenges

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.070
that we face we think that we'll get better
answers.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
That was one of the recommendations coming
out of the gender parody group. We're committed

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.649
to it and I know the other members of the
gender parody group are. So I'm delighted.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.470
I just hope we get more organizations truly
embracing the value of diversity, inclusiveness

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.829
and how it can produce tangibly different
outcomes for the future.
