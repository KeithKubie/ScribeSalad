00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.030
So the answer is the oxygen that you see down here in the RNA Nucleotide.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.200
Notice if we compare the two molecules to each other.The only difference that we

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.520
see is right here,the fact the DNA is missing a oxygen that the RNA has and

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.360
fact thats why we call it A deoxynucleotide for DNA, because it's missing the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.260
oxygen. Deoxy. Whereas RNA has the oxygen, so it's just

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.850
called a nucleotide. Some people even call it a ribonucleotide.
