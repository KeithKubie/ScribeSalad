00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.170
SPEAKER: You can
go this job alone.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.870
You can go the
leading route alone,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.590
or you can do it together.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.460
It's always more fun
to do it together.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.490
We can get together and support
each other in great ways

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.300
because we're authentic,
we belong together,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.160
and we're on a journey
to be strong women.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.180
Be really open to change.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.160
Be resilient, be tough.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.400
Breathe deeply.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.800
Some things are out of your
control, and that's OK.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.200
Growth and comfort
do not coexist.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.440
Invest in yourself.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.730
Have mentors always.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.700
Be visible, be present.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.810
Be humble.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.730
Humility is the
opposite of arrogance.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.840
You take one thing and
say yes and figure it out.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.660
If you never say yes,
you will never grow.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.520
You will never push yourself.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.826
Be a contributing
member of the tribe.

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:55.950
So be there for each other.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.334
Like, once you find your
tribe, really be there.

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.250
Collaborate, collaborate,
and then collaborate

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.080
more-- more minds, more energy,
more enthusiasm, more support.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.550
Many women live like
it's dress rehearsal.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.286
Ladies, the curtain
is up, and you're on.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.440
