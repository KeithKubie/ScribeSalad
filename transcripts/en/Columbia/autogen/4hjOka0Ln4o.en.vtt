there others who went outside of the
 

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.640
there others who went outside of the
base on the roads would see things so

the ones that were the prison guard

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:42.890
the ones that were the prison guard
 

01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:45.410

military police they did different kinds

01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420
military police they did different kinds
 

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.510
military police they did different kinds
of jobs so I wanted the spectrum but

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520
of jobs so I wanted the spectrum but
 

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.120
of jobs so I wanted the spectrum but
also you know to be absolutely honest

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:50.130
also you know to be absolutely honest
 

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:52.910
also you know to be absolutely honest
and this is not so scientific I also

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920
and this is not so scientific I also
 

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.000
and this is not so scientific I also
picked the ones I got on with best

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.010
picked the ones I got on with best
 

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:59.360
picked the ones I got on with best
because because the interview went the

01:21:59.360 --> 01:21:59.370
because because the interview went the
 

01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:03.830
because because the interview went the
best with them and they opened up the

01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840
best with them and they opened up the
 

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.720
best with them and they opened up the
most they told me the most because we

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:05.730
most they told me the most because we
 

01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.570
most they told me the most because we
get there was a simpatico thing going on

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580
get there was a simpatico thing going on
 

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.730
get there was a simpatico thing going on
and you know they were there was this

01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:10.740
and you know they were there was this
 

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.459
and you know they were there was this
one marine major who was

01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:14.469
one marine major who was
 

01:22:14.469 --> 01:22:16.709
one marine major who was
so gung-ho about the war I quote her a

01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719
so gung-ho about the war I quote her a
 

01:22:16.719 --> 01:22:25.500
so gung-ho about the war I quote her a
few times and so like myopic I listen to

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:25.510
few times and so like myopic I listen to
 

01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:27.090
few times and so like myopic I listen to
her I know that that's a point of view

01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:27.100
her I know that that's a point of view
 

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.709
her I know that that's a point of view
out there and I should have it in my

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719
out there and I should have it in my
 

01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:31.200
out there and I should have it in my
book but I didn't dwell it on it much

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:31.210
book but I didn't dwell it on it much
 

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:33.180
book but I didn't dwell it on it much
because all the other military books

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:33.190
because all the other military books
 

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:35.430
because all the other military books
have that point of view I wanted to be

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440
have that point of view I wanted to be
 

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.250
have that point of view I wanted to be
the different book so I and I'd also

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:38.260
the different book so I and I'd also
 

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.000
the different book so I and I'd also
come across a survey that showed that by

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:41.010
come across a survey that showed that by
 

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:45.570
come across a survey that showed that by
2006 80 % of the women serving in the

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:45.580
2006 80 % of the women serving in the
 

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.310
2006 80 % of the women serving in the
military in Iraq thought we should get

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320
military in Iraq thought we should get
 

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.680
military in Iraq thought we should get
out within a year 80 percent so I

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:49.690
out within a year 80 percent so I
 

01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:51.689
out within a year 80 percent so I
figured okay it's fine for me to

01:22:51.689 --> 01:22:51.699
figured okay it's fine for me to
 

01:22:51.699 --> 01:22:53.070
figured okay it's fine for me to
concentrate on the women who have

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080
concentrate on the women who have
 

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.570
concentrate on the women who have
problems with this war because they have

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:54.580
problems with this war because they have
 

01:22:54.580 --> 01:23:00.120
problems with this war because they have
a maturity anyway but yeah getting on

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:00.130
a maturity anyway but yeah getting on
 

01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:21.410
a maturity anyway but yeah getting on
with them that's the unscientific answer

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420
 

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:43.630
reporting the name too

01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:43.640
 

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.440
oh oh I see I see what you mean what's

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:47.450
oh oh I see I see what you mean what's
 

01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:53.790
oh oh I see I see what you mean what's
their logic why why if you're anonymous

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800
 

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.500
that's a really good question loser gets

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:56.510
that's a really good question loser gets
 

01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:57.940
that's a really good question loser gets
to the heart of the matter in the heart

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:57.950
to the heart of the matter in the heart
 

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:01.420
to the heart of the matter in the heart
of the matter is that they feel that if

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:01.430
of the matter is that they feel that if
 

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:05.280
of the matter is that they feel that if
a woman isn't willing to give her name

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:05.290
a woman isn't willing to give her name
 

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.950
a woman isn't willing to give her name
then why should a man suffer accusation

01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960
then why should a man suffer accusation
 

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.350
then why should a man suffer accusation
in other words they see the accuser and

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360
in other words they see the accuser and
 

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.670
in other words they see the accuser and
the accused as equal as do many people

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:15.680
the accused as equal as do many people
 

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.800
the accused as equal as do many people
in this country they forget that well

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:17.810
in this country they forget that well
 

01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:20.170
in this country they forget that well
you know saying you're the victim of a

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:20.180
you know saying you're the victim of a
 

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:26.580
you know saying you're the victim of a
crime is not a criminal act and so big

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:26.590
crime is not a criminal act and so big
 

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:29.620

they basically figure I think they have

01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:29.630
they basically figure I think they have
 

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:32.260
they basically figure I think they have
an idea that if they don't if they let

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:32.270
an idea that if they don't if they let
 

01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:34.000
an idea that if they don't if they let
everybody be anonymous and they would

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.010
everybody be anonymous and they would
 

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:35.650
everybody be anonymous and they would
prosecute any way that all these women

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:35.660
prosecute any way that all these women
 

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.720
prosecute any way that all these women

this is one of the great myths about
 

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.180
this is one of the great myths about
rape I really think that's the thinking
