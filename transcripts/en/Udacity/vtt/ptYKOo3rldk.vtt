WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is all of the above.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As I said, anything can exist on the web,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
while HTML is the main type of content,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you can link to whatever you like,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.574
and these are all perfectly fine examples.
