Here's another question. When the addFriend method runs, do we have enough

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.095
information to decide where to draw the circle? Yes, it's in the x coord and y

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.770
coord variables. Yes, we can get the coordinates from the friend variable. Yes,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.945
it's somewhere else. No, we should take the coordinates in as parameters in the

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:21.090
addFriend method or no, we should make an instance variable.
