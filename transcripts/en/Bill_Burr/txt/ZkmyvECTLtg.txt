Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I am just checking in on you. Who's that checking in on you? You can't, sorry. I'm in New York, you know, all of a sudden you just got to start doing your little sin, natural vibe. Um, Joe and I'm going out and I'm buying a new pair of fucking sneakers today. Go Away. Are you going to get you? Do you gotta get the Jordan Five's? Dude, I know what I'm going to get. You know I'm going to, I, I'm getting some old man running sneakers. I need some workout sneakers. You know about the ones that were on better call Saul for the old ladies. Did you guys watch the rest of that a series? Did you see it yet? Can I ruin it for you? I've got to tell you in the last episode, in the last scene when the guy says, just trying to get all you guys to scamper for your fucking pause buttons. No, no,

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       no. I didn't watch it yet.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       People literally run out of the room. People run out of the fucking room. When you'd start talking about a show, they haven't seen the last episode yet. Have they do that? You know what I mean? But if you just sit there and you're fucking, somebody rips a fight, people just put a fucking shirt over their nose. Oh, who did that? You're literally inhaling air from this guy's ass. You know? And that doesn't make you leave the room. But if, God forbid, somebody brings up the last episode of a fucking show, you haven't seen everybody runs out like the building's on fire. Um, it is a perfect, perfect day in New York City. The breeze don't this breeze top five breezes ever. This breeze, my top five ever. That's a verse you think for as you would actually rank his breezes top five reasons ever. Dude, I was sitting there, I had on a pair of Jordan's sexes with the Fucking v Neck with the chain on the outside over, over. Waitress came up to me. She could barely take my order. She couldn't, she couldn't even like she was taking in. The whole thing was ridiculous. New pair of guests, jeans over.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Oh fuck. Anyways, um, yeah, so I'm up in fucking port Chester. I didn't know what port Chester is by no. Westchester, there's east Chester and Alva daily. Those port Chester, which I believe is just Connecticut. Um, there tonight I'm there Tamara and then I'm there on Saturday and then I'm done and then I'm back. And uh, I'll tell you right now, you have not experienced loneliness till you have a fucking kid. It meant and then you leave my favorite part of the fucking days when my kid wakes up. You know what I mean? Cause like they're super fucking rested and they just, you know, life hasn't beaten down yet. They don't have any credit card debt then know got some psycho blowing up their phone. They don't have this shit. They got to do some fucking receipt. They have to find, they got, they got, they the look of contentment on her face. You know when you go down, when you go to give her a kiss, like she lifts all of her limbs come up like a baby's ability to do leg lifts. I don't know how the fuck if I tried to do what she did, just straight up, just lift some write up. I don't get it. Sit there and suck in their toes. Evidently hours that flexible at one point tell you that a couple million miles in the back of the fucking plane, that'll, that'll take the infant right out of you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       That'll take this Flaco right out of your eye. Um, that's what I missed the most, so that I won't always face time with my lovely lady. And um, as the best. It's the best, but it sucks and I'm on the road, but I just out here being like, you know what? I'm earning money someday. So when she has to go to private fucking, uh, kindergarten for 90 grand a year or whatever the hell it costs, because evidently if she goes to a public school, she's going to get stabbed. You know what happened? What happened to the public schools? Was that the computers? Is that what it was? Everybody had to have a tablet, a laptop, some sort of interface. Is that what happened? And went right through the fun and all of a sudden we couldn't keep up with China. How to fuck is China beaten us the overhead of a fucking billion people alone?

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       I mean, we should be like, we should get everything at a 60% discount over here as far as educating our own people. Does it make any sense? Does any of it make any fucking sense? Does it make any sense how so many people are fucking struggling out there and they just keep building these luxury apartments and he's fucking giant goddamn houses who, oh, right. And they, oh yeah, it's money from Russia. It's Ronnie from China. It's oil money from the Middle East. Now listen, I don't know what to do about China. I don't know what to do about Russia and I don't know what to do about the Middle East, but that's not gonna stop me from telling you what to do about all these things I just ate. Why is my stomach grumbling? Um, this is all you've got to do for the Middle East. Okay. All we do is we just, you fucking, you embrace solar power.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       That's it. How do we do that? How do we do that with the oil companies? If somebody fucking, and we'll be, if we actually went to solar direction when a bunch of planes start crashing that had the leaders of the solar movement on them. Yes, that would definitely happen. They would definitely take them out. So what do you do? This is what you do. You give the son to the oil people. Okay. You draw up a contract and you say the sun is yours. All right. Now what are they going to do with the site? They can't put it out. They can't touch it. It'll burn their fucking hands, but they just make the money off the book and uh, the solar power. Okay. And if they could just somehow handle that, those people in the Middle East is sitting on a bunch of goop that they can make money off of. They could just seamlessly fucking walk away from that Shit. If I was president, I would literally give oil companies federal fucking grants to fucking get the solar thing going. You guys own the sun. I would just keep walk. But you own the sun and they'd be sitting, well, both on your book. There's stuff in this stuff. When the mill waste over, dude, fuck that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       You want that stuff? Is that, that stuff's like God took an Atari. It's like the Reebok pump. Nobody gives a shit. Okay, this is the new shit. This is the new shit we're giving you the fucking son, son. You understand that you own the center of the solar system. All right? In every fucking little bit of heat that comes off that thing that trickles down on a Mike freckled bald goddamn head. You own.

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       you put a fucking meat or red on my back. I don't give a shit. Okay? And I want you guys to thinking, Eh, built. This doesn't make any fucking sense. I don't give a shit. Let's listen to me. Hear me up. You give these people the sun, you give them the God son. All right? And then what? What happens over in the Middle East, they sit in on all of this fucking Goop, all right? And all of a sudden it's not worth, it's not worth diddly squat. Okay. And all of a sudden the fucking, the bills started piling up. They don't know what to do. They start selling their properties over here. They want to give money to the terrorist groups. Then I'll get the money to do it. You have fucking bleed them dry. Then that's it. And then they go back to doing whatever the fuck they want to do over there. God forbid they live their lives they way they want to live it over there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       God forbid they're not into Jesus and Starbucks, God for fucking bid. They want to walk around and some clothes that are actually functional for the part of the world they live in. You just leave them the fuck alone. And then all they gotta do is just keep driving around in cars and all of that shit. So they, you know, they'll make a lot less money, but they won't have us over there going, hey, you should do this and you should do that. We just get the fuck out of there. Then we're over here, solar powered everything

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Just think about everything and think about your shirt. Solar powered everything. Everything fucking solar power. I know what you're thinking. Well, Bill, what happens at night? You go to bed.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       what do people do in Alaska during the winter? Fuck them. We got to get out. We got again, that place. If it's the last thing we ever do, it's bankrupting us. It's making it very few people, a ton of fucking body is bankrupting us. We're not going to seek, cannot solve that shit. Okay, so now that we know you can't solve it, because I said you can't solve it without doing any research. Now that now that I've established that as a fact on my own podcast, the only thing, other reason to be over there is it sitting on all that goop, but now we don't need the group. The group, the group, the group is on fire. We don't give a fuck. Keep it

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       You give the son to the oil companies, that's it. Just go total solar power. You know Jimmy, that Georgia peanut farmer, he said it 40 years ago. He said, we are addicted to oil. We've had. We just kept going and going and going, and now look at us now. Look at us now. Look at US spending all this fucking money over there. They're giving it to the constant of shooting shit at us, right? And then when shooting back at them, they're making all this money and then they'd come over and they buy a 50 fucking thousand square foot house overlooking our shit. Oh look in RJ. Hey, we overlook you. We're up on the hill. Not the other way around.

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       You give them the sun. Oh God, you guys, I'm telling you, I would have to, I would fucking sell those oil guys. I would have a meeting under a mountain or wherever the fuck do you meet with these fucking people that really run shit. You know, you're underneath the mountain. You got this fucking underwater waterfalls and shit. Right? There's like these planet of the apes plucking things walking or whenever the fuck goes on underneath that thing. Right. And you just tell them, is that shit flow? And I can't, I can't do a waterfall on my fucking the dude from police academy. I can't do that. Sound effects? Yeah. Gentlemen. I came here. I came underneath this mountain tonight to keep me as a son. I'm sorry. I don't have my proper recording equipment here. I can't. I can't do my illuminati media. You give him the fuck him. The fucking Sun.

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       give on the fucking Sun. [inaudible] that's what I would do. Instead of going over there and talking about evil doors and doors, the evil and fucking this, that and the other. You pack the whole fucking Shit Up. That's it. You pack it all up. You sent over 10 cargo planes. You bring the men and women of the Arab forces. You bring them home.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       You say you can keep your Google, you can keep you safe, but I want some of those cool clothes. I like the clothes they wear over there. The Jane Open ended one, Z, whatever the fuck you call it. I think those things are cool. Matt. I wish I want, I want one of those. Can I buy one of those without offending Muslims? Could I talk my way out of a beheading? If I put one of those on, just went, look man, I'm a, I'm a red head. It was hot out. I look on page. Am I, what am I supposed to do?

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Then they get my face. You'll blow away. Um, that's it. That's all I wanted to say today. Give the oil companies, this son, he gave it to them and then the whole fucking thing is over.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       Whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       I believe I can fly. Um, so I got to get here tonight and I'm going to go, well, I'm going to go play some drums, is a little rehearsal studio down the street. I'm going to go play my fucking drums for a couple hours. I was going to go right around and one of those fucking Citibank fucking banker cut bicycles, but there's never any, they got like 14 for the whole city. And then also what kind of an asshole rides a bicycle in a city. You know what I mean? What am I in Europe? How many people die a year in Europe? Just riding around on bicycles in a fucking city. So is fucking cars go by walk. We bought, we bought, we bought, we fucking yet another ambulance going over to pick up some fucking, yeah. Six foot, three inch fucking 110 pound European that taken out on his bicycle that has a basket on the front.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       I like riding bicycles. Oh, you know what? I watched this documentary called ovarian psychosis. Right. How do you not click on that? I first clicked on this action movie and it was just the same fucking shit. The one guy who beats the fuck out of everybody. Nobody ever, they all have guns, but they never think to use it. And I was just like, I've seen this a million times. It's really loud. And look at that nice classic car. They're wrecking the fucking thing. I, I can't watch this shit. So I shut it off and I saw this thing called Ovarian psychos and I was like, I want, I want, I got it. I to see what this is about. It was about some, uh, some women in east La, mainly Mexican who are sick of fucking being scared women and they started their own group when they ride around these women's only, um, you know, riding bicycles when there's like a full moon or some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       I Dunno. I Dunno. So I was watching this stuff and of course typical guys look, Whoa, women's all we go slow or the fire guys only bug, right. I hate when people act like it's a level playing field, you know what I mean? It's like they're having this thing because it's not a level playing field. One of the women, and there was this like everything's kind of full fucking men only. What's your, it really is when you really look at it. Okay. I don't want him to fucking come off as like a, a complete God damn liberal here. All right. But you know, it really is, it's, it's just, it's there for the taking for you. When you're a guy, you know, not saying you're going to get it. Nine out of 10 people still fail. That's one thing that feminists don't realize. You know, when you listen to them talking about what it's like to be a guy that had this cartoonish idea of what it's like to be a guy, you just show up. Oh. And the classic one, the more you act like a Dick, the more people respect you. I love that one. If a women of a woman does it, she's considered a bitch. If a guy does it, it's like,

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       have they ever done a survey? Just ask the general public, Hey, if you had your choice between working for somebody nice or working for a complete fucking asshole who treats you like shit, which would you pick?

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       Yeah. Nobody does. I think the, when I meet successful people, truly successful people that get it.

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       Successful in there, personal life and in their professional life, those people I always meet, their always humble. They're self deprecating. They walk into a room, you want to be around him

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       and they, they, they're good at talking to people. They don't come in like fucking Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross. Um, that bullshit that men respect a guy like that fucking record of fucking with him. No, I don't, I don't respect anybody like what I see as an insecure asshole who's afraid it's all gonna go away by the afternoon. Um, anyway, so I'm watching this documentary, check it out. It's actually really a, you only get bothered me about the documentary is the way they spelled psychos, ovarian psychos. It's like, but you're on cycles. So why didn't you spell the first half? Like cycle and the rest like psycho, you know, a little word play there. Nothing. All right. Anyways, so I watched it and it was interesting and actually it's this one woman said in it, you know, cause she'd been through all this shit when she was, uh, a little girl with their mother and then she had a daughter, I believe she, and at least she had a kid, she became a mom. And then her mother said, well, now do you at least understand me? I bet you understand me a lot more. And she said to her mother, no, actually I've never understood you less. And actually cringed when I, when I saw that and I was just like, you know, that's something if you feel it, you don't say to your mom

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       like, what do you get out of saying that's your mother? All you're gonna do is devastated her and make her feel like she completely failed as a mom and it doesn't get you any real estate. That's something you say to your friend and now that I have a kid, it's just like, I don't even understand what the fuck my mother did to me even more and have it in your fucking clink your wine coolers and then that's it. You don't say it to your mom or checking callers. Um, I just watched the Schick hydro transformer ad that made those dollar shave club ads make even more fucking sense. The blade literally turned into one of those fucking robots.

Speaker 3:          00:18:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       Why is my tumble wagging his finger at me? Like he just blocked a shot in a mobile one commercials. Is he out of NBA Money? Where the fuck did he come from out of nowhere? Did he buy one too many fucking gold chains is some shit and then easily called up as agent or I need to work again. Is that Schwartzenegger? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       I don't have no idea. Um, I don't have my ads. I'll have to read the ad at the end of this fucking thing. Whenever that, whenever the fuck that thing comes in, I have no idea. Oh, by the way, I forgot to bring this up. Season three of f is for family is going to happen. Thank you so much to everybody who watched, we are now, um, breaking stories for season three. It's animation. So season three ought to come out somewhere in late 2019. Now we're hoping that we can have a come out. You know, we came out May 30th of this year, so we're, that's what I'm personally, that's what I'm shooting for it now. I haven't communicated that to anybody I've worked, I'm working with. I'm just assuming that they already know that. And then if it doesn't happen, I will just get quiet for no reason around them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       That's the way I was taught to communicate with others. While growing up, do all the math in your head, do not communicate it to anybody. And when they don't see it, the way you see it, you just stopped talking to people. That was the way it was done. And then you just don't talk to him for like three days. And then, then when they finally like, well, I guess I'm not gonna fucking talk to you again. You then out of nowhere, it bring up whatever game happened last night and you start talking about it like the last three days. Never fucking happened. That's the way it was done when I was growing up. Um, they, one of these days, I'm actually going to fly up to port Chester and helicopter. I'm trying to convince this guy to put dual controls. I mean, it's the whole fucking purpose of me going right. Fly over the George Washington bridge. I just want to see how you, uh, transition through all this fucking commercial airspace where you have j f k you have LaGuardia and you have new work. But I see helicopters all the time going up and down the Hudson Bay. So there's gotta be some corridor that they're allowed to fly, like probably I would guess no higher than like,

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       I dunno the flight really fucking low, but I never know if it's like sightseeing, but I wouldn't think you'd be any higher than a thousand feet and you just Kinda, you know, and then just look out for sully when he comes to landed in the Hudson Bay. Um, I do know with lax, you either transition along the beach at a below one 50 or you go along supported a boulevard, which I never do that one. That one always scares the shit out of me because you look down and there's a jumbo jet underneath you. And I always think like, what if she aborts is landing and just fucking yanks back on the stick. Then I got this fucking 300 person missile coming right at me and my little art, 22,

Speaker 3:          00:21:24       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       you ever see a cheetah running down a baby, whatever. That's what it would be like accepted. See Aviation version of that. And I would be the baby gazelle, not even out a baby turtle. How slow is a baby? Turtle. Is there anything sadder than watching that documentary? When those baby turtles try to make it to the ocean and all those fucking seagulls come down and pick off nine out of 10 of them. I fucking love turtles. I had a pet turtle when I was a kid

Speaker 3:          00:21:57       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       used to feed it like dead grass offers and shit. I love this fucking thing. I love cleaning the tank, making sure it's shell stayed fucking wet and all that so it wouldn't crack. And uh, had my little tank set it up. I fucking love this thing. I love watching it coming up for air and all that shit. So one time I went to church because that's what I used to do every Sunday. Right. So I went to church with my family baggy shirt. So we go to church and uh, I came home.

Speaker 3:          00:22:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       And the turtle was the way I'd position the rock. The turtle had gone head first into the water and it's turtle ass was out of the water.

Speaker 3:          00:22:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       And I mean we went over and I picked it up and its head was sunk all the way back.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       It's like Shell and its eyes would close in. His mouth was open and it wasn't moving.

Speaker 3:          00:22:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       And I was like, Oh fuck, is it dead? Did it drown? And I went downstairs and I said, dad, it's my turtle dead. And he goes, yeah, he's gone. And I was fucking devastated. So I took a red and take a brown, you know, you put your lunch in the Brown, like lunch bags, put the turtle in there. And then I went out in the woods and dug a little grave and put the marker up and then that was it. And then my dad was like, we'll get you another one, we'll get you another one. I was like, no, I don't deserve it. I blame turtles. I, it was my fault. I set up the fucking, the rocks wrong. And that was just said San Jose. That's it. That's it. I'm done.

Speaker 3:          00:23:34       You know, I've done,

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       I'm not going to kill another fucking turtle. And it was so weird, like, like four days later we were driving down the street and it was a turtle crossing the street. This is when there was actually animals, you know, before we fucking killed and ate all of them. You know, I blamed the food network for that. You know, when all these fucking assholes going around eating bizarre foods, I'm in Timbuktu, Wheaton magnets right now all of a sudden everybody's gotta Eat Maggots to servant grasshoppers at fucking Mariner Games or whatever the hell they doing out there, um, was America. We don't eat grasshoppers. We Doritos, Taco Bell.

Speaker 3:          00:24:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       You give them the sun. Everybody I'm telling you that would turn this country around. Turn this country route. Just give him a son. That's it. So anyways, I flew the other day on a, on Tuesday. I hadn't flown in like a month and I flew like a fucking champ to the point. I actually got a God damn compliment from my instructor with unsolicited said, you're flying great today. Made me feel really good. Okay. I've done my auto rotations. I'm ready to get back out there and solo. So there's a flight I want to do. I want to fly up to San a fucking Barbara solar. So that's what I'm working towards. And, um, I'm really looking forward to it, but flying a lot in the valley and everything, getting to know all of that stuff. Um, it's so fucking cool. Yesterday we will actually going to two days ago, we're going to try to fly over to Santa Monica airport cause I know that they're gonna they're allegedly closing it in five years.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       We'll see what the fuck happens. So I was like, well, I never landed there. I might as well go over there and check that place out. But what we wanted to do, like pad work, they don't let you do that over there. Noise abatement's and all that. They don't want some helicopter flying around and all that shit. So we just said fuck it. We flew up along the coast and went by the Pacific Palisades and you just sitting there, look in this. What this the whole give them the son Shit came from, I looked, I said, look at that fucking house they are building. This house was the size of this house. I looked at it and I said to the instructor, I go, that looks like if the building of fucking mall that I would never go into going like that's going to be too crowded. And it was somebody's house. It was going to cost half a fucking billion dollars and there was some prints of some fucking country in the Middle East, you know, was going to move. That's like his fucking house on the other side of the world. That's his cottage. And that right there, I was just like, how much fucking money we give it to these people.

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       It's time to give the oil companies to son. That's, that's all you do. So they're still in control of everything. You know, they could give us empty threats, well shot at, you know, like they could do it. Um, so anyways, you were flying over there and I'm just looking at all these fucking houses and I look down, I see this one, it was fucking beautiful house. I got Jesus Christ. Look at that one. I'd have this glass where you couldn't see in at all like ceiling. The floors is fucking look like a yet. But it was a house and uh, and those guys, they was give tours so they know all the celebrities like, oh, that's so and so's fucking house. And I was like, wow, that's what 20 million a movie gives you. And I'm not going to say the guy's name because he probably has enough fucking people looking at his house. Although recently they said that he sold it. So I have no fucking idea. But anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:38:25       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn and this is the Monday morning podcast. For Monday, June 29th, 2009 and that was an MP three by one of my listeners, uh, kind of an old school one, which I kind of liked. Uh, you know, a little old school, a little new school, you know, still have had the eighties heavy metal radio station sound to it. And then it also had like that, the newer sort of a, what do they call that, that cookie monster singing where people were

Speaker 7:          00:38:56       red, red, red, red, red, bro.

Speaker 4:          00:38:58       You know, I really respect the musicianship of being able to play that fast, but I have to admit, I, maybe I'm too old, but I just can't listen to something

Speaker 7:          00:39:08       guy go, Rawr, Rawr, Rawr, Rawr, Rawr, Rawr Rawr.

Speaker 4:          00:39:10       Without laughing or it just seems ridiculous to me. But, uh, but maybe that's me. I don't know. But uh, thank you for the a, I know those things take a long time to put together, so I appreciate anybody who does one. And I actually got a, I got another one this week was, so, uh, next week there'll be a different intro and a, if you're new to my podcast, that's one of the things. Um, every once in awhile one of my listeners will put together an MP three and then it takes me eight days to figure out how to fucking sink it up in garage band. I just wish I knew a way where I, I could play it and talk over it like you would on like a, a, a fucking a I guess a radio show if anybody knows how to do that. You know what?

Speaker 4:          00:39:53       There was a fucking question I was going to ask you guys some sort of computer question. God Damn Man, I gotta I gotta write these things down. I really going to write these things down anyways. I'm still in New York City, everybody. I am down to my, uh, the final week. I just have one more scene to shoot. I got two lines, that's all I got left. And then I, then I'm out of the movie and it's been, uh, it's been great. It's been a great experience. And, uh, but I am going a little bit nuts because I've been away from my life for so long, which, uh, I dunno, I think a lot of you guys maybe don't get to experience that if you have more of a real life where you get to just go to work and then come home. Um, you know, like when you go on vacation, how it's fun for the first fucking week, you know, and everything's cool.

Speaker 4:          00:40:48       Maybe takes a couple of days to relax, but then they comes to that point where you get in a vacation where you kind of ready to go home and you know, you need to, you need to, you just need to sleep in your own bed. Yeah. I just want to go home, you know, see my dog and fucking, you know, put them in a fault pauper, you know, put it in a full Nelson. Maybe give her a couple of jabs to a little doggie nose. Uh, yeah. It's another thing. If you new to my podcast, I really love kicking the shit out of my dog. Um, it's uh, I'm kidding. You know, now, you know what this really is. This is me, my inability to say that I miss people in my life. Okay. This is my, my fucking Irish Boston, you know, inability to hug right now to say that I actually, uh, you know, maybe some people in my life, see I have to have an ambiguous right now.

Speaker 4:          00:41:36       So anyways, yeah. So I've been fucking staying here in New York, you know, going into the same goddamn diner every morning. And uh, I know this is a really hacky premise and I say that every week as I throw out hacky shit. But what is the deal with ordering orange, orange juice and they charge, they charge. I had a small, they charged me 450. You know, I got a couple of eggs. So I thought it was going to come in and about like fucking uh, you know, the $13 range. And next thing you know, it's like I owed like 25 bucks is cause I ordered a fucking orange juice. Is it? Cause everybody loves it. You know, there's no shortage of oranges. It's, I don't know. Jesus Christ is podcasts socks. This re this podcast really sucks. Thank God I had an intro cause I, I literally just ran out of steam right there.

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       You know what is the deal with oranges bill? Huh? All right. Let's talk about some fucking topical Shit. Jeezy you would think that I would bring up some other shit. Maybe some other, let's just backtrack with all the crazy shit that's happened this week. All right. Bernie Madoff just got a 150 fucking years in jail for being the piece of shit that he evidently is because the guy got convicted for a, you know, that whole Ponzi scheme. I think that's great. I totally back that. The fact that they gave him the maximum amount, I was already getting pissed when his lawyer was like, well, he's this age now and so he's probably only going to live another 13 years, so we would like if he just gave him 12 years, what, why should he get out at all? He's going to live another 13 years. Well, let's give him 14 to make sure he fucking dies in prison.

Speaker 4:          00:43:30       You know, I'll tell you out of all the fucking things that you can do short of like physically assaulting somebody is, you know, if you steal old people's money, okay. And they worked their asses off their whole life. You know, especially some of these ritual people who, you know, worked really hard taking advantage of sweatshop labor and you come in there and no, I'm just fucking around. But seriously, you know what I mean? Like, and then they ended up having to eat dog food. You took their whole life's work away, man. I can't imagine that. I mean God bless those old people for not coming down there and just literally killing the guy. I would actually contemplate that. You know, what kind of jail do you think that they would send to you and send you to if you like an 85 year old guy who had worked his whole life, you're 85 they means you probably fought in at least one war. So you're a veteran. So you already got at the like right there. Everybody's like, well fuck that. That guy used to be a marine, you know?

Speaker 6:          00:44:33       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:44:33       Fought for our freedom. He did the right thing his whole life. Then he got burned by this fucking feathered mullet jackass and then he shot him in the head. He actually saved us some fucking, some tax payer money. I don't know. What kind of jail would they send you to? They couldn't send you the 11 worth. It's not like you're fucking fought dogs like Michael Vick. Right? So anyways, that guy got 150 years. I think that's a that, that's great. But I don't understand why those other bankers who loaned all of our hard earned money out to fucking homeless people, you know who then defaulted on loans and then not only do they not go to jail, they asked for more fucking money that they already print and the print and then they charged us the interest on it.

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       Is Anybody, did anybody out there major in economics? Can anybody out there explain to me how, how we keep printing money with no gold behind it and catch up isn't like $72 a bottle. Can anybody out there? Can anybody explain that to me? You know, and if you listen to this podcast, you know that's a major pet peeve of mine is when somebody comes up to me and they tell me that whatever I'm talking about, they majored in, in college as if that's some sort of fucking, uh, uh, what is the expression thorn in your crown? That's not it. Jewel in your side. I don't know what the fuck it is. You know what I mean? It's like, dude, you, you, I hate people who go to college and major in Shit, and then they think that that automatically, that makes them a fucking expert on the subject.

Speaker 4:          00:46:01       It's like douchebag. You went there and you read the books that they gave you. Okay? The fucking school is aligned with a certain like viewpoint. And then you read 50 fucking books with the same goddamn viewpoint. All right? They're fucking viewpoint, which is encouraging you to, to, to go out and pay for a fucking education that's not even worth what they're charging you. For you to come out of school and be 80 a hundred grand in debt. Somewhere along the line, the banks give you a fucking credit card with like a $3,000 limit. All only, even though you're only making 300 bucks a week at hot topic or whatever the fuck you doing. So they get, you're buried in that debt and then you're suppose to knock up some broad by 26 28 have a kid and then go buy a fucking house. She had done, you're on the wheel to your 90 you're fucking done. All right. So I dunno what I'm talking about, but I'm just, you know what I'm sick of. I just don't like when I make a point, somebody challenges it. That's what it is.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       Especially with the college education. But anyways, I don't understand why those guys aren't fucking jail. So anyways, let's, let's back up more. Michael Jackson. I had no idea how big that guy was. I forgot. I don't know if any of the rest you will like this, but I literally, I forgot how famous that guy was. Why I should say more like how talented he was. Because the last, really, to be honest with you, from about 91 92 the last 1718 years was so not even about his music or his talent. It was all about his plastic surgery. Those trials he went through, um, the plastic surgery, you know, just all the weird stuff. And then another thing about him was I really felt that he was kind of like a comedian who stopped writing a brilliant comedian. You know, he just kept wearing those penny loafers and he kept doing that, kicking his leg up, you know, he does that little knee thing and then the little mine step to the side and he throws his fucking hand up into the air, sort of the John Travolta, like, I'm going to disco dance, but wait a second, I'm stopping, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:48:17       But anyway, so the guy dies and then they started showing all his videos on MTV, if you can fucking believe it. They actually showed videos on MTV. And I came in from shooting the movie at like five in the morning. And I sat there and I watched his videos for like a fucking hour and I remembered once again, how would a giant, that guy was, I don't know if you guys are old like me, but for some of you youngsters out there when that thriller video came out, I can't even, it was, it was fucking great. It was ridiculous. I just wish that you could just watch all the videos that, that like had taken place before that video. Have you ever seen that journey one, that awful journey video where, I mean, I'm not really into the music of journey, but those were all top notch fucking musicians.

Speaker 4:          00:49:06       All right. What's his face there? Uh, the lead singer, they're unbelievable voice even though I just didn't like, and uh, they had dramas. Steve Smith is like, he continued to hit. He's like one of the greatest drummers in the world right now. Considered that. But for some reason when they made the video, you have all these top notch fucking musicians. For some reason they decided that they should rather than have one of the greatest drummers in the world drum, they, that he should air drum and that all the guitarist should air guitar. And then the worst thing ever, they had the keyboardist air keyboard and then they will all fucking just hunched in together, like sort of just stomp on their foot. It was fucking embarrassing then. So anyways, so thriller came out and basically what MTV would do was they actually had a debut with the video.

Speaker 4:          00:49:58       That's how fucking huge it was. I remember they used to do debuts what it was just everybody fucking watched it and it wasn't just like they debuted it and then it was in the rotation they like showed it at like whatever, like three o'clock in the afternoon, right as the kids came home from school. And then they will like, we will be showing it again at six and then you'd go live your little fucking, you know, I'm 12 year old life and then you'd come back with fucking five 58 you'd sit there with your jaw on the floor, you'd it again. And then they'd be like, we're going to show it again at nine. And then once, you know, right before you went to watch it again, and then the next day everybody go to school today, Short four times. I show it five times. No Way.

Speaker 4:          00:50:39       You'd have to stay up to three to focus more on like these stupid arguments. And they did that fill out for like a fucking week. It was unreal. And I actually watched it a what? That's the first time I, they actually showed the full length one and I don't think I've seen the full length version of that since the 80s. And uh, I dunno, it was fucking amazing. And then it's also sad because you're looking at the guy, that's what I was doing. I look at the old videos, I'm like, he was a good looking guy. The fuck did he do or like a, as you're watching them gradually, you know, have operations you just right there. We should have stopped right there. Right, right there.

Speaker 6:          00:51:17       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       Stop. Freeze one, two, three red light. But he, he just kept fucking going. And, uh, I dunno, one of the thing that pissed me off as I was reading in the post, there was a guy writing for the post saying how he actually was at the second child molestation trial and was saying how ridiculous it was and how he couldn't even believe it went to trial. That the charges were such bullshit. And I just remember thinking going, where the fuck was that story in the post during that time? Because I was reading the posts because I like the sports page. And all they did was just talk about what uh, you know, they, they had him convicted in the paper. So in my mind he was fucking convicted. I hate one papers do that. Like they go all the way to the left and then when they realize you know that they can't go to the left anymore than they present the fucking right. You know, I dunno what the fuck up saying in there, but all I know is I actually started believing that he was just a really gullible jackass and was kind of wide open to that stuff. But you know, then this is how, this is how I'm going to leave it, because the guy was acquitted twice. I'm gonna, I'm gonna

Speaker 4:          00:52:30       believe that he was innocent, but this is the deal. I would believe that the guy was innocent, but if I had a kid, I wouldn't leave him alone with them for like three seconds. How about that? You know what I mean? That's, that's not Mike. I hear you. I totally believe you. Yeah, those charges were fucked up. Uh, we're going to go now and uh, yeah, we're going to slowly back towards the car and a is, I listened for the Choo Choo train as it goes around your house to make sure that I don't get run over by it. Uh, no, I don't want a glass of wine. Thank you. Thank you very much. Uh, Farrah Fawcett died. This is a really sad, weak Farrah Fawcett. I believe that was my first, um, no, it wasn't. You know what? Kate Jackson was my first fantasy famous girlfriend and that's when she was on the rookies. You guys remember the rookies? Ben and [inaudible] at it. Ben In and edit it. Did it, did it, did it, did it [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:53:32       remember that shit when they have those great seventies fucking TV shows in all right. Theme songs like that anymore, right. Number, swat

Speaker 4:          00:53:41       ba but ba, ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba. But I had to delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

Speaker 8:          00:53:51       Back when they had musicians. That'd be a whole fucking orchestra. People used to make God damn livings ready. TV themes. But anyways, Kate Jackson, she was like the original to me more, however you say that fucking cougars name, Huh? With their fucking lead pipe titties. Um, yeah, she played, she was the whole shared the sexy voice. Absolutely beautiful eyes, beautiful hair. The whole fucking thing. She was so fucking hot and she was dressed like a nurse and there was no fucking Internet. There was no porn. There was no, I had nothing. I was a man without a fucking country back then. So I would just sit there fucking Mesmer. It was a, it was a perfect show. And she's married to the cop. The cops character's name, I still remember was Mike Danco. Right. That's like a classic seventies macho. I'm fucking hitting it, right name Mike Danco.

Speaker 9:          00:54:47       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:54:47       I'm Mike Danco motherfucker. That's how we should have said it. There's no, they should have beeped out motherfucker every week when somebody said his name, you know, and I used to watch that show going on, I can call and that's what I'm going to do in life. I want to be a cop. I'm changing my name to Mike Danko and I'm marrying some hot ass fucking nurse and I'm banging our in that fucking nurse outfit. I didn't even think shit like that. I was like so innocent. I'd even have thoughts like that. I was literally like in love. Remember that when you actually had that in his, before he ever met some girl who just fucked up your whole view of women and you actually viewed them as if they were like these angels because they were so gorgeous. You know, before you realize that a three out of four weeks a month, they're going to be absolutely fucking maniacs.

Speaker 8:          00:55:31       But I digress. So, um, yeah, so Farrah Fawcett dies. Talk about, you know, out of all the fucking days to die, you die on a day when a guy, yeah, do Michael Jackson is so famous. If you guys seen that thing, an entire prison yard in the Philippines work nine hours to reenact the thriller dance and they did it and they put it up on Youtube. These are prisoners in the fucking Philippines that the risk of pissing off all you white trash, ice road truckers out there. Fuck Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley was, he just wasn't anywhere near that. He was, he was huge artists. A bunch of people right now. Now why are you know minute? That's the fucking king man. You don't say that Shit. Elvis Presley was the king. You understand? They had buddy Michael Jackson was the king of Pop. Do you understand that? That means his, his kingdom is clarified.

Speaker 8:          00:56:34       He's the king of everything. No, he's the king of fucking pop. Elvis Presley was a fucking king period, which means Michael Jackson was his fucking subject. Um, I get that. And also Elvis Presley didn't have the advantage of the worldwide web. You know what I mean? Where you can have as little talent as the chocolate rain guy and you can go national. So I can only imagine if, you know, Ed Sullivan could have put that fucking, you know, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Whatever. I had to defend Elvis a little bit. I, I, you know, I used to make fun of Elvis and then I went to his house one time when I was on the road and I went in there thinking I was going to get a bit and thinking it was going to be funny. And you know what? It was just sad.

Speaker 8:          00:57:18       I just saw a guy who was basically the original behind the music guy, um, and who was like, even in death, we're all white as I felt like I was just like, I'm just intruding on this guy's house. And then you walk out back and the his grave and everybody's taking pictures next to his grave. It just like, uh, you know, that house should be haunted. Like Elvis should literally be haunting that house and scaring the shit out of those fucking people. But God knows they still wouldn't even get it. They would still thinking, you know, he's singing, he's singing from the grave. It's a little more vulgar than I remember, you know. I mean, I guess he didn't ride his own lyrics. Haley probably fucking stolen. If you believe what some of them people of color are saying about his music. Um, all right, what are we doing here?

Speaker 8:          00:58:07       Let's get on with the, Oh, wait a minute and now we have to go back. Before that. Who Else fucking died? There was some Ed Mcmahon died. Ed Mcmahon. Ed Mcmahon died and I hated after fucking, you know, Michael, you know, ed McMahon dies. Then a Farrah Fawcett dies and Michael Jackson dies. And then there's always that Douche bag who has to be like, Shit. She bad. Things come in threes. You know. Bad things come in threes. Really? What about David? David Carradine. You know what about him? He died. That makes for stupid. Some old lady died of heat stroke. I saw that on the news. That's five. Well, was it all on the same week? Well, you know what, I got two words for you, Billy Mays. Ah, Billy Mays and I fucking died too. So there you go. That's four famous mother fuckers in one God damn week. You know what? Somebody told me some, somebody wrote me a hilarious fucking email was saying like, how the fuck they, they couldn't believe that they didn't see Billy Mays dying.

Speaker 8:          00:59:09       They couldn't see his death. Come on when he clearly looks like he ate four pounds of Bacon every goddamn morning. He really did. He ever do. I hate when people do that. Like you always predict some shit after it happens. But I gotta admit once Billy died, you were kind of like, well, he really did have that heart attack face, didn't he? He just had that, that bluedot beard and he was always screaming. And not only that, he was around all that cleaner. How many takes do you think they did as he was sitting there spraying that oxy washed fucking whatever the hell it was called, that oxy oxy clean. Do you guys ever get that shit? Did you, did you feel that it made your whites a whole lot wider? I don't think it did. That's why I think Billy Mays. Dot. I think it was from all that line.

Speaker 8:          00:59:52       He just couldn't do it anymore. Screaming about fucking alarm clocks. I can scratch your back or whatever the hell he had. I don't know. So whenever, there you go, what a fucking month. Huh? David Carradine. God bless them. And I really think it's bad that people actually give them shit. I have no problem with, with the fact that he liked to put on fish nets and hang himself. You know? I hope that I'm that much of a freak at 72 fucking years old. You know? I just, I just, I got really like a, I got inspired by the fact that he was doing that, that at that age, you know what I mean? Do you just picture your 72 you know, you just fucking hobbling around.

Speaker 8:          01:00:36       I'll tell you that paper boy, he keeps playing with the paper too far away from your door. That's what, that's what I picture 72 as you know, you're all excited. You got that. You can't go up the stairs anymore. You've got to sit in that electronic fucking thing that brings you all the way up the stairs. You know? Remember that Shit I was talking about a long time ago where you have that you have the elevated toilet seat because anybody can use gravity and get their fucking old ass down on a toilet seat. But it still takes the quad strength to get the fuck back up off of it. But you can't afford somebody to help you up off the toilet seat. So you have to have an elevated toilet seat. So you basically for the rest of your fucking life, you take a fucking shit standing there like a third basement, you know at the ready position.

Speaker 8:          01:01:30       That's how you take a shit, you know, hands on your knees standing there like fucking Brooks Robinson waiting this squeeze one out. Little metamucil wouldn't hurt either. And then you got David Carradine. See I'm telling you guys that that's why each stretching is so fucking unbelievable if you want it. That's the biggest thing you can do other than eating well, I think to try and still feel young because if you don't stretch your hamstrings and everything, if you don't stretch it out, use it. I guess. Atrophies. I don't even know what the fuck that means. All I know is I noticed, you know, I haven't been that good about it and I've been running with my dog and I was like, Holy Shit, I am rapidly approaching the age where I can't run anymore. You know? I mean that happens anyways. At some point you're not going to be able to run, but if you stop stretching that is the quickest.

Speaker 8:          01:02:21       I think that is the quickest way. And I'm saying that having absolutely no degree in nutrition, physical therapy or anything whatsoever. So you can take that to the fucking bank. All right, let's get into the podcast stuff here that you guys send it. Um, here's one for you. Last week I was talking about grenades. I don't know why. I can't remember why, but I had somehow as I presented the question, um, what would happen if I, you know, oh, I remember because we were talking about that, that guy sent in that email about that psycho who lived across the street, who was in the army and he used to sneak shit home and try and sell it. And the guy was in a bar trying to sell a fucking grenade. And uh, be honest, you'd buy it when you get three Budweisers in, you're going through a breakup or maybe you're just young and you have hope and he just got that one fucking, that, that industrial area that they're just developing in your town, in your like, all right, this is the deal.

Speaker 8:          01:03:24       We'll pull the pin, we'll throw it, and then we'll fucking row. Yeah, of course you're going to do that. So anyway, so I presented like, I was wondering like what, what the level of explosion that concussive force, whatever the fuck it is of a grenade. Like, could, if I had threw a grenade on the other side of my bed and I dove on the other side of my bed, blocked up my ears and it exploded. Okay. And I'm talking about one of those beds, those beds way, you know, you can't steal it because they got like the fucking, the wood frame underneath it. Um, would I be able to survive so far? Somebody from, uh, the, uh, the Marines told me, he said, Bill, a hand grenade in your hotel room would definitely fuck your day up with a 15 mil, 15 meter kill radius inside of an enclosed space.

Speaker 8:          01:04:12       Your head and asshole would be indistinguishable, indistinguishable from one another. I hope that answers your question. Yeah, I would say you were pretty specific there. So anyways, so you who suck at math? Uh, a meter is a little more than a yard. And I only remember that from that commercial back in the 70s when they were trying to teach us the metric system, which bombed miserably. So 15 times three would be 45 feet, and that is a radius of 45 feet. Jesus Christ. So then I, I wrote the guy back cause I really found that interesting. Uh, and I guess because it's enclosed that the ceiling kind of keeps the blast in and the walls and all that. I guess if you're outside you have a better chance. I Dunno, I'd have to talk more about this, but this immediately as opened up a new podcast thing for anyone who's in the military, I want to learn about these fucking weapons and a what they can do to you. And I'm going to tell you right now, anybody with a fucking gun, there's nothing they like better than telling you what the fucking gun would do to you. Have you ever noticed that

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       anytime somebody gets a gun, what do they say? I, I, you know, I just got it to go hunting, right? And then you'd be like, well, what's, you know, what's, what's that gun like in the guys do from here? If I shot you right from here and I shot you, a whole fucking shoulder would come off, you spinal core would be dangled. They always do that shit. So, you know, what's the point? I have in a weapon if you don't know what it would do to a human being. That's what I say. Huh. Anybody else? Anybody else or Braveheart fan? Um, all right. You know, actually set the end of the day watching the whole history of the machine gun. It was really fascinating. Like this guy actually developed the machine gun cause he thought it was going to save lives when he was in the civil war. He was a Gatlin was the guy like the Gatlin gun.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       He was sitting there talking about how he just saw the unbelievable level of carnage in the civil war. And you've gotta remember that to Americans shooting Americans. So even if you're winning, you know, it's, it's just a brutal thing. And he was saying that if you've got a machine gun, if it could do the work of 15 fucking people or 20 people, um, then that would be 19 less people who'd be out on the battlefield, who could possibly lose their lives. Of course he didn't do the math of, well, if they get one too, then you need to have another guy with a machine gun. And then it just keeps fucking escalating. But I did find it interesting or maybe that was just the bullshit that he said because he felt bad that he was making money off of creating a weapon that could just literally mow down people.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       Um, anyways, so here's the second part of the, uh, the grenade thing. Um, I forgot what I, what did I ask him? Um, oh, I remember this. So I emailed that guy back and I said, okay, so what if I had a suite, a hotel suite, and I threw it out into the living room area. I closed the door in the bedroom and I dealt dove behind the bed. So then he proceeded to take a lot of time out of his day, which I appreciate. Here. Wrote me a nice long email. So this ladies and gentlemen is the answer to what if you had the suite and you lit up, you fucking pulled the pin on a grenade, closed your bedroom door and dove behind the bed. See, I asked the questions that America wants to know. All right, here we go. This guy said, I did five years in the marines. Uh, he said, I got on the Post Nine 11 redneck bandwagon. Uh, but by the time I got to Iraq in 2006, we stop using hand grenades indoors. Normally. Normally we would just love a few of those fuckers in a room and not have to worry about the assholes on the other side. Uh, he goes, I know that's cold blooded, but hey, he can have his 73 versions of an unspecified gender. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:07:57       you know what, that's a funny ass fucking loophole. They really just say he gets 73 virgin. They don't say that they are women. Do they? That's fuck, that's a great analogy. Anyways. Um, he said, and we replaced them with a flash grenades. Uh, basically we didn't want to kill innocent people in wind up on the cover of Time magazine as the winner of Asshole of the year. Um, then we, after we throw in the flash flash, well, I just literally lost my place there, the flash grenades. Then we would charge into the room shooting. Like I was a in the Goddamn Matrix. Um, but anyways, I have seen hand-grenades go off and there are two wait, there were two ways of standard fragmentation. Grenade can kill you. One, the blast itself, which generally projects in a 15 foot radius. Is anybody out there? Can anybody explain to me the, the blast itself, how that kills you if you're not getting hit by shrapnel, just the blast.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       Is that basically like the most psychotic invisible front kick? Is that what an explosion is in, in that, that the air, the force of the blast just hits you so hard. It's like getting hit by like an invisible truck. Is that what it is? Um, to be honest with you, I've always kind of thought about that, but I never really sat down and tried to figure it out. And that's basically what I was able to come up with having not researched anyways. But anyways, the guy says, ah, the concussion from the blast turns your insides into Jello if you're within a five meter bubble. So is that what happens? You know what I mean? So literally it's like getting hit by this invisible fucking, uh, what, what did Bruce Lee have? The one inch punch? It's like getting hit by a like that times fucking 200.

Speaker 4:          01:09:54       I don't know. Why don't I read the rest of us and maybe we'll find out. Ah, the second way you can die a horrific deaths is, uh, from uh, uh, frag grenade is the fragmentation from the shell of the grenade and the fragmentation of all the other shit like wood and pieces of other people that the blast turns into shrapnel. Wow. Jesus Christ. You know what I mean? As much as you watched the beginning of saving private Ryan, like he's still really can't ever capture how fucking horrific that must be. Um, the amount of damage of frag will do to you in the next room depends on the wall and your suite, what it's made out of. If the walls are made out of concrete with rebar and shit inside, you're more than likely just shit your pants. That's amazing. So if there isn't like rebar in there, which I'm imagining is those little steal things, it could still fucking kill you.

Speaker 4:          01:10:48       Um, if the wall is thin and some of the fragmentation may or may go through the wall and hit you, but you'll be safe from the blast itself and probably we'll probably live all just be screaming on the floor. Like that guy in platoon is Barnes crawls over and digs the shit out with a knife. Good Lord. God bless you guys, man. I really do not have a difficult life here. All right, more. Most stores on hotel rooms are pretty solid, so I think they could take a direct hit and not damage anything on the other side. Also, it depends on the type of grenade. American hand grenades are the largest and the deadliest USA USA. That's right. Fucking America baby. Um, the Russian grenades are a little bit smaller. I liked this. I like the whole, uh, the whole Phallic thing going on here with less fragmentation, but I still wouldn't want to be in the same fucking zip code when one goes off.

Speaker 4:          01:11:40       Um, and then the second question I asked him was, um, hearing loss is a big thing for me because a, I play drums without earplugs for awhile. And I also went and saw AACD seen a bunch of other heavy metal bands in every other time I wear earplugs and I have tinnitus in my right ear, which is a, you know, sometimes it can be a buzzing sound or it can be just a ringing sound and it never goes away and it's driven people to suicide. If it's loud enough, mind fortunately isn't. It's just like, like right now I can barely hear it. Like if I actually just stopped talking, if I stopped like late at night, I can hear it when there's nothing going on. If there's no background noise, I just thought of here like this really low, just soda

Speaker 2:          01:12:26       e

Speaker 4:          01:12:28       in my ear. And I know a lot of you just was like, Holy Shit, that must be crazy. But you actually, that's my phone by the way. If you're wondering what the other sound is, that's not the sound in my ear. That's letting me know that I have some fucking new Texas. Um, but anyways, yeah, I was always wondering like how these guys are in war and they're shooting these fucking machine guns and all this type of stuff. Like how do you not lose your hearing? And he said to, to answer your second question, he said, I have a condition called Tinnitus, uh, which I basically explained, but all I have them explained it to, he said, which is a permanent permanent ringing in my ears and my left ear is pretty fucked up as well. Some dude opened up with a machine gun right next to my head and I didn't have an ear plug in my left year.

Speaker 4:          01:13:07       So I guess you guys wear ear plugs over there. But I would think sometimes if you get ambushed you don't have a men and then you just got to fucking open up anyways. I don't really notice the ringing unless it's really fucking quiet. And since I live in the middle of a dense urban area, it's never really fucking quiet. So it's not an issue in combat. We wear ear plugs that work pretty well. Shooting aside small rooms is still pretty fucking loud though. The loudest thing over there are aircraft in anything that explodes. I'm talking about the loudest fucking thing you would ever hear in your life. Also, we normally communicate non verbally through hand signals and just knowing where you should be in a certain situation. Oh, he's addressing the fact that, you know, you always watched those cop movies in the, in the sort of whisper after they shot a couple of rounds, you know, and I've shot a gun without fucking earplugs.

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       That's another dumb thing I did when my hearing and I couldn't hear anything. So there's no fucking way I could then whisper to somebody next to me going, you go around back and I'll try to keep them busy here cause they got to be going like, hey, I can't fucking hear you. Um, so anyways, he said they use hand. Um, anyways, besides shouting within earshot of the enemy is retarded since they counter attack and the element of surprise is lost. Uh, this email was probably longer than that, ladies. Oh, that Lady's who've made fun of your suit on Konan now, dude, I totally appreciate that man. If there's anybody else out there that like, really, uh, that's like some time life books kind of stopped, you know when they talk about what it's really like. So if anybody else, if I have anybody who's a overseas, God knows you get the Internet over there, if you're over there in Iraq or if you're over there in Afghanistan, and I'm trying to think of a question of any of the listeners have any questions of stuff over there.

Speaker 4:          01:14:53       Um, I got one for you. You know, you sit there and you train and you go through bootcamp and you do all that stuff, you know, and uh, you get yourself ready for battle and then you go on over there. You know, I know my biggest fear would have been like, what am I going to be? That guy who freezes up and is crying in the fetal position spooning his weapon in a foxhole is someone's screaming at me, private bar for Christ Sake, get your shit together. You best on fuck yourself pile. I mean what happens is does it just naturally clicking? Cause I would think even in my first battle, even if I didn't push you out, I would still be a spazz and woo fucking empty in entirety

Speaker 8:          01:15:40       clip. I remember talking to cops about this shit. We had this cop on my radio show uninformed and by the way, uh, I have a new episode coming out. We taped one a yesterday that will be out on a July 3rd. You can listen to that on a XM two o two and A. Anyways, this cop was saying how a lot, yeah, he worked with guys the first time they pulled their weapon. This is, this is an old school guy, so they still had like the six shooter and was saying they pulled that gun out of their holster and by the time they brought it up level with the suspect, they were literally out of bullets because they would be pulling it out. But I've had my Bambam like shooting literally into the ground in front of them. They've had guys shoot themselves in the foot.

Speaker 8:          01:16:22       I'm just, I just can't imagine the fucking adrenaline that is going through your, your, your body when something like that is happening. So, you know, if it's not too painful, obviously I'm not trying to have a big therapy session here. This is supposed to be a comedy fuck. So if you've got some funny stories or anything like that, uh, listen to me. If you've got any funny stories about war and engaging the enemy, I don't know. Anything that you would think would be fucking interesting. Uh, cause I don't think I can, I can answer any more questions about comedy. I've pretty much answered them all. But um, I don't know, I'm kind of speaking for the group here, but I find that stuff really interesting because my only frame of restaurant references when I watch movies and you see these guys, you know, they throw your, never see that in the movie.

Speaker 8:          01:17:07       Like there's a grenade lands near the guys, then somebody dies on top of it to save his buddies life. Now from, I always thought that you could do that, but having just read that last one, evidently if I did that, then just, you know, all the 200, whatever bones in my body would just turn into shrapnel. And you know, I don't know if people would die around me, but they would definitely rolling around on the ground trying to get my femur out of the side of their fucking neck. So we all learned something. All right, let's

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       along with the, uh, the podcast questions then. You know, it's just not, the question is obviously post to all veterans cops, anybody rednecks. If you got, knows you probably threw a grenade at a duck and it's bill came back and hit you in your foot. Now you've gotta limp. Any, any of those fucking stories? I, I would, I would love to hear all right. Podcast questions of the week. Uh, this was a really interesting one. Um, this guy says, ah, Bill, I come from a family where more than half of the women have gotten pregnant in their teens and almost all of the men have ended up in jail, in jail at various points in their lives. Um, so I've seen firsthand how having a kid when you're not ready and going to prison at an early age can really fuck up your life. And because I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to end the tradition of poverty and dysfunction in my family, I am very hesitant towards trying to hook up with random women and can be considered a bit of a nerd also.

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       Um, due to the fact that I don't have like two or three baby mothers and I'm never bringing girls around the family, you guessed it. I've now been accused of being gay, I guess by his, his, uh, his family members. Wow. Okay. Thought I came from a dysfunctional family. Um, all right. I hope you see my dilemma here. Uh, if I go out of my way to prove I'm not gay, then I'm acting, acting like the classic homophobe. I'm not cool with that. I'm also giving them power by trying to conform to their perception of what a quote unquote real man is. But if I ignore it, they continued to talk shit. It would be different if, um, if, if it were a collection of Douche bag jock sang things like this, but it's not, this is my fucking family. The people who are supposed to love me unconditionally.

Speaker 4:          01:19:22       And yes, as sad as it may seem, my family members are that stupid and ignorant. Uh, they think being gay is something that warrants being made fun of. Although I can, uh, I can really see the humor in this. It really does hurt a little doing the right thing by staying in school and trying to make something out of my life while staying out of trouble has gotten me where I'm accused of being gay. I'm so disgusted with my family that I'm seriously considering cutting each member out of my family life. Even my own mother, parentheses, my, my father's dead. Your thoughts. Uh, I think you're doing an amazing thing to be honest with you. I think one of the hardest things to do is to grow up in a fucked up and to be in the environment and be surrounded by totally immersed in it.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       Yet still have the ability to pull yourself out of it and analyze it and look at how other people are living and if they're living in a smarter way or a way that appeals to you more, to actually try to go and try to go in that direction without doing what most normal people. What most people do in that situation is they just look at other people. If they're living a smarter life, they just dismiss them as facts. You know, well, I want to go to college like these a bunch of figs, you know? Um, yeah, that's a, that's a lesson I learned late in life that you really have to watch out who your, uh, who you surround yourself with because a, you basically end up, for the most part, you end up doing what they do. You just get sucked into their vortex.

Speaker 4:          01:21:04       So I don't know if that's the right word. Whatever the fuck it is, you get sucked into that. They're little, uh, their world. And so if you're hanging out with people who were doing dumb shit fucking up their lives, the chances of you fucking up your life is going to be huge. And Dude, you don't want two or three when babies with, with two or three different women, you know that everybody knows that. And even those fucking retards who are doing it, they know that. And you know what it really is? I really think this is a classic example of misery loves company and they, when they're laying in bed at night, they know that they've fucked their lives up. And you know what? When people fuck their lives up, you know what you do, you lay in bed and you think about the first day, that day when you fucked your life up and you wish you could just go back to it and make a left instead of making a right.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       That's what the fuck they're doing. And the harsh reality is you can't go back in time and which leaves you with one of two things. You can even eat them, man up and admit that you're the reason and you're responsible for, you know, for the fact that your life is fucked up and you try to make the best of it and try to actually help other people not make the same mistakes you have. That's the most noble thing that you can do. Or you can take the easy way out like most people and is try to fucking do that and misery loves company and drag everybody down with you. That's all they're trying to do. They're trying to drag you down to the bottom of the swimming pool so you can drown in their fucking misery too. So you're doing the right thing. And if you have to a, I don't know if you've got to like totally cut them out because it is your family that is your mom and at some point, you know, you know they're not going to be around forever.

Speaker 4:          01:22:45       So it's never good to not go for long periods without communicating with your family. But you just kinda got to give yourself a halftime speech or a pregame speech before you talk to them. To make sure that, uh, you know, you basically stay on point and uh, yeah dude, that those are my thoughts. You're totally doing the right thing. And I think, uh, I think you're a really strong person that you are able to see how fucked up your family was. That's a hard thing to do, you know? Um, and try and correct it, you know, so it'll be great. So then you'll end up with the right woman, you end up having great kids and then you'll be, you'll break the, uh, your break that circle, but the problem is dead. You'll then run into is then when you have kids is then they're going to want, they're fucked up kids to hang out with your, uh, enlightened kids.

Speaker 4:          01:23:39       And that'll be the hard thing because they are your cousins in, in, in whatever. I Dunno, it's a fucking mess. But Dude, you're on the right track. So what do I think you should keep doing what you're doing and try to find some middle ground where you keep them at an arm's length, but you don't totally sever ties. And when they, and when they give you shit, you know about being gay, just give him shit right back. Oh really? Really? Really? I'm, I'm, I'm gay. What? Because I don't have some fucking psycho coming in here trying to burn down my fucking clothes cause I knocked up another fucking broad. Now don't do that. Don't go for it. That's what I would do. I'd go for the jugular. Like, dude, your life sucks. Okay. What's it like earning $400 a week and giving it in, dividing up 380 of it and fucking given it to three different women and then he'd go on down to the fucking hot dog truck in and buying you dinner.

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       You dumb fuck, you know, put a shirt on and get your shit together. I don't know. I would just say mean shit. Don't listen to me. That for the first part of my advice was good, but uh, yeah, try to find a, I dunno, you know what, talk to somebody else for the second half. I right. I'm not Deepak Chopra, but I, I got, I think the first half of the advice I gave you was good. All right. So that's it. You're doing the right thing. There you go. Something positive. All right, next question. Hey Bill. Um, essentially a pretty big sports fan. I was wondering what we are opinion. What was your opinion of soccer? Um, I'm not much of a fan. I basically only watched some of the World Cup, but today at the restaurant I was watching Brazil versus USA game and a few of my Brazilian coworkers, um, we're watching the game and for the first task for the first half, I had a blast watching the game because basically I got to play out the stereotypical over the top clues American. They were just dying inside when the u s scored a the first two goals and I got to fuck with them. I was yelling, Shit like a throw the flag. Uh, I'll tell you what Brazil needs to do. They should call a timeout and regroup. And then my coworkers were taking me serious, furiously telling me that there are no timeouts in soccer. Oh, that's great, dude. They should call a fucking time out.

Speaker 4:          01:25:53       I'll tell you, there's nothing more fun than playing up the ignorant American, you know, that's the greatest thing you can do when you go to Europe and they start giving you shit that you don't know anything about their country and brace it and just be like, yeah, dude, I gotta be honest. Nobody talks about your country in my country, we don't have, we know who the fuck you guys are. What do, I can't believe you're not all walking around a wooden shoes over here. You guys have cars, you know, just fucking play it up. All right. Anyways, he said at, my coworkers were taking me seriously. If you're a seat telling me that they want a time out. And he said, once the US scored the second goal, I yelled, what are the odds? I'd say about a Brazilian to one dude. I actually wish I was there to see that you really signed up noxious. That must've been great. Is there anything goes? It goes, but then in the long run, uh, they ended up giving me shit because a, as I was watching the game, um, I was thinking, why, why not have Brazil take a, Oh, this is, this is a big conspiracy theory. He goes, but as I was watching the game, I thought it's something that, uh, I'm amazed that the F F I f a

Speaker 4:          01:27:04       didn't arrange this to make it happen. I was thinking, why not have Brazil take a dive against the US, but you know, make it look good. And then the next year when the World Cup came around, the interest in the US would be through the roof, you know, let the u s beat Brazil and then you, uh, you spit out a bunch of t shirts, you split them 50, 50, with the Brazilian, you know, the whole, we kicked Brazilians ass, uh, Brazil's acid in 15 years when everyone has forgot about the game. That's when you make the movie. What do you think about the idea of bill? Well, I think, uh, if I read it a little bit better when it made more sense, you think it would have worked? Um, yeah. I think we beat Brazil in us. The U s team started, uh, building up, you know, something. Actually, I don't think it would've worked because those people down there take soccer way too seriously. Brazil takes it really seriously, but they're not like, like Columbia or was it Columbia? Like, uh, was it the Venezuelan team? Somebody accidentally put the ball in their own net and the guy went home and he got fucking machine gun, like the fucking Saint Valentine's Day massacre, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:28:11       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:12       Um, so no, I don't think it would work. I think would work in America because we don't give a fuck about soccer. Um, all right. I think that's the end of the questions that I have. Anything else here? I'm a little disorganized. Uh, all right. How about this? How about a movie review and then I'm going to end this podcast because, oh man, I have to end it for now. This is too fucking lock. I'll read one really quickly. Uh, the punisher movie review based on the marvel comic character Thomas Jane, who was in the midst of the dream catcher in the thin red line stars is Frank Castle, who is a former Greenbury that becomes an FBI agent. Castle has one last bus to make that involves stolen weapons. And during the bus, the son of a mob boss, Howard St, played by John Travolta, is killed. St wants vengeance on who got his son killed and finds out the castle is one the one who caused saints son's death.

Speaker 4:          01:29:00       Not to spoil, but shit happens. And castle gets in his Camaro to fuck shit some shit up. I give it two out of four stars. It's a movie that tries to be a real realistic, which is great compared to the over the top cliche Aquins action sequences and the SQL. It's definitely worth the rent or a purchasing as how it's $5 on DVD and $10 on Blu Ray at best buy or Walmart. And there are two versions, the three theatrical and the extended edition. So this guy gives a two out of four stars basically saying the punisher is a good rental. All right. And that's the podcast for this week. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Uh, there's going to be one more podcasts. I'm out here in New York City and then I will finally be back out in Los Angelis. Um, for, or maybe actually I'll be in San Francisco.

Speaker 10:         01:30:31       just to give you guys a heads up when I get the exact time. All right, so that's it for the podcast. You guys all have a great week and don't take any shit from me. Okay,
