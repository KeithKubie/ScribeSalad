we're looking at more aspects of life
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.010
we're looking at more aspects of life
that we never actually understood as

out that in fact there is an
informational quality to it that we can

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
informational quality to it that we can
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.010
informational quality to it that we can
render into a data format so what we're

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
render into a data format so what we're
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.750
render into a data format so what we're
seeing with social media companies is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
seeing with social media companies is
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939
seeing with social media companies is
they're actually data fiying aspects of

they're actually data fiying aspects of
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.370
they're actually data fiying aspects of
the life that we never really saw that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380
the life that we never really saw that
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900
the life that we never really saw that
could be data fide so for example

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
could be data fide so for example
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.470

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660
files our professional contacts and more
and more and more are we seeing that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
and more and more are we seeing that
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340
and more and more are we seeing that
we're able to take the daily

interactions of living things that we
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600
interactions of living things that we
never really saw that could be rendered

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
never really saw that could be rendered
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.190
never really saw that could be rendered
into a data format and we're putting it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
into a data format and we're putting it
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830
into a data format and we're putting it
into data formats now what does this

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
into data formats now what does this
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510
into data formats now what does this
mean in the big picture the factors were

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
mean in the big picture the factors were
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250
mean in the big picture the factors were
just at the outset of the big data era

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
just at the outset of the big data era
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.380

so we're gonna find out but you can just

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
so we're gonna find out but you can just
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.850
so we're gonna find out but you can just
use your imagination and think of some

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
use your imagination and think of some
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.250
use your imagination and think of some
of the extraordinary uses one way that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
of the extraordinary uses one way that
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.869
of the extraordinary uses one way that
we're doing it is looking at who

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
we're doing it is looking at who
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660
we're doing it is looking at who
contacts whom on Twitter and whose ones

followers are and we're able to identify
that and we've never known this before

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
that and we've never known this before
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920
that and we've never known this before
that subpopulations exist that are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
that subpopulations exist that are
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770
that subpopulations exist that are
either a minyan eyes for the flu or are

not now it's a public health issue the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
not now it's a public health issue the
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899
not now it's a public health issue the
whole point of vaccinations is that you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
whole point of vaccinations is that you
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.539
whole point of vaccinations is that you
take a broad population you vaccinate

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
take a broad population you vaccinate
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.109
take a broad population you vaccinate
many but not all and everyone is covered

what we've just now learned with Twitter

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
what we've just now learned with Twitter
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.510
what we've just now learned with Twitter
is that this idea of herd immunity might

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
is that this idea of herd immunity might
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.480
is that this idea of herd immunity might
not be the case because there's whole

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490
not be the case because there's whole
 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.670
not be the case because there's whole
subgroups of the population that all

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
subgroups of the population that all
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730
subgroups of the population that all
don't get vaccinated yet they all hang

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
don't get vaccinated yet they all hang
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560
don't get vaccinated yet they all hang
out together they do virtually and we're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
out together they do virtually and we're
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060
out together they do virtually and we're
seeing that those virtual ties are also

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
seeing that those virtual ties are also
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149
seeing that those virtual ties are also
physical ties I want to stress this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
physical ties I want to stress this
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370
physical ties I want to stress this
sounds like it might be a intuitive

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
sounds like it might be a intuitive
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370
sounds like it might be a intuitive

just be a nice thing to know it's deadly
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590
just be a nice thing to know it's deadly
important it's very serious and it took

interactions to learn it so when you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
interactions to learn it so when you
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639
interactions to learn it so when you
think about it in the grand scheme what

Big Data means is we are able to learn

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
Big Data means is we are able to learn
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.679
Big Data means is we are able to learn
things about ourselves at the population

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
things about ourselves at the population
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900
things about ourselves at the population
level at a huge scale that we never

sociology totally gets upended because

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909
sociology totally gets upended because
 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.550
sociology totally gets upended because
in the past you ran small studies on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
in the past you ran small studies on
