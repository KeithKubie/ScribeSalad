Christoph Waltz especially because it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
Christoph Waltz especially because it
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.860
Christoph Waltz especially because it
gets deep and dark eventually it gets to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870

of Christoph Waltz I think that for the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
of Christoph Waltz I think that for the
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.750
of Christoph Waltz I think that for the
most part he's great in this movie there

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
most part he's great in this movie there
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.370
most part he's great in this movie there
are some parts though where he gets

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
are some parts though where he gets
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.440
are some parts though where he gets
really over the top to the point where

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
really over the top to the point where
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.420
really over the top to the point where
he gets a little cartoony now I don't

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
he gets a little cartoony now I don't
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.010
he gets a little cartoony now I don't
know if I can critique that though

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020
know if I can critique that though
 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.410
know if I can critique that though
because the real-life woman is still

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
because the real-life woman is still
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.070
because the real-life woman is still
alive

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
alive
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.410
alive
so it is entirely possible that she

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420
so it is entirely possible that she
 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.600
so it is entirely possible that she
described the way her husband acted and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
described the way her husband acted and
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.760
described the way her husband acted and
that Christoph Waltz did it perfectly

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
that Christoph Waltz did it perfectly
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.190
that Christoph Waltz did it perfectly
but in the movie he does feel a little

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
but in the movie he does feel a little
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.199
but in the movie he does feel a little
bit larger than life a little bit bigger

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209
bit larger than life a little bit bigger
 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.400
bit larger than life a little bit bigger
than he should be from time to time

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
than he should be from time to time
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.080
than he should be from time to time
there are moments in the movie where it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
there are moments in the movie where it
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.729
there are moments in the movie where it
does drag a bit though and a lot of that

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
does drag a bit though and a lot of that
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.199
does drag a bit though and a lot of that
is due to the fact that the movie

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
is due to the fact that the movie
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.949
is due to the fact that the movie
doesn't fully explore some of its deeper

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
doesn't fully explore some of its deeper
 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.260
doesn't fully explore some of its deeper
questions in the way that it could that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270
questions in the way that it could that
 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.820
questions in the way that it could that
combined with Christoph Waltz being a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
combined with Christoph Waltz being a
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.080
combined with Christoph Waltz being a
little over the top from time to time

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
little over the top from time to time
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.760
little over the top from time to time
makes the movie not as good as it could

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770
makes the movie not as good as it could
