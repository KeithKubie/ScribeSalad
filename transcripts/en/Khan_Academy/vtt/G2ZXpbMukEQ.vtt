00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:01.591
- [Voiceover] So we have here f of x

00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:06.043
being equal to the natural
log of the square root of x.

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:07.482
And what we wanna do in this video

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.805
is find the derivative of f.

00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:14.620
And the key here is to
recognize that f can actually

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.526
be viewed as a composition
of two functions.

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:20.306
And we can diagram that
out, what's going on here?

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:23.372
Well if you input an
x into our function f,

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:24.777
what's the first thing that you do?

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:26.403
Well, you take the square root of it.

00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:30.153
So if we start off with
some x, you input it,

00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:35.890
the first thing that you do,
you take the square root of it.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.635
You are going to take the
square root of the input

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.302
to produce the square root of x,

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.425
and then what do you do?

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:46.619
You take the square root and then

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.363
you take the natural log of that.

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:51.144
So then you take the natural log of that,

00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:53.118
so you could view that as inputting it

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:55.436
into another function
that takes the natural log

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.769
of whatever is inputted in.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:58.847
I'm making these little squares to

00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:00.578
show what you do with the input.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:02.062
And then what do you produce?

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:06.935
Well you produce the natural
log of the square root of x.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.433
Natural log of the square root of x.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.358
Which is equal to f of x.

00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:16.275
So you could view f of
x as this entire set,

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:20.899
or this entire, I guess you could say,

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.963
this combination of
functions right over there.

00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:27.375
That is f of x, which is essentially,

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.756
a composition of two functions.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.076
You're inputting into one function

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:34.020
then taking that output and
inputting it into another.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.237
So you could have a function u here,

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:38.711
which takes the square root
of whatever its input is,

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.544
so u of x is equal to
the square root of x.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.015
And then you take that output,

00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:49.972
and input it into another
function that we could call v,

00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:51.365
and what does v do?

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.569
Well it take the natural log
of whatever the input is.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.259
In this case, in the case
of f, or in the case of how

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.203
I just diagrammed it, v
is taking the natural log,

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.108
the input happens to be square root of x,

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:05.028
so it outputs the natural
log of the square root of x.

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:08.198
If we wanted to write
v with x as an input,

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:10.376
we would just say well
that's the natural log,

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:13.209
that is just the natural log of x.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.224
And as you can see here, f of x,

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:17.979
and I color-coded ahead of time,

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.896
is equal to, f of x is equal to,

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:24.690
the natural log of the square root of x.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.857
So that is v of the square
root of x, or v of u of x.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.971
So it is a composition
which tells you that,

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:36.024
okay, if I'm trying to
find the derivative here,

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.333
the chain rule is going to be
very, very, very, very useful.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:43.074
And the chain rule tells
us that f prime of x

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:46.574
is going to be equal to the derivative of,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.061
you can view it as the outside function,

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:51.421
with respect to this inside function,

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.588
so it's going to be v prime of u of x,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.185
v prime of u of x,

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:01.421
times the derivative
of this inside function

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.753
with respect to x.

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:05.836
So that's just u prime, u prime of x.

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:08.896
So how do we evaluate these things?

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:11.292
Well, we know how to take
the derivative of u of x

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:16.237
and v of x, u prime of x
here, is going to be equal to,

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:19.691
well remember, square root
of x is just the same thing

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.694
as x to 1/2 power, so we
can use the power rule,

00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:26.688
bring the 1/2 out from so
it becomes 1/2 x to the,

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:29.420
and then take off one
out of that exponent,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.606
so that's 1/2 minus one
is negative 1/2 power.

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:36.606
And what is v of x, sorry,
what is v prime of x?

00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:40.897
Well the derivative of
the natural log of x

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:45.025
is one over x, we show
that in other videos.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:48.325
And so we now know what u prime of x is,

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:52.942
we know what v prime of x is,
but what is v prime of u of x?

00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:56.775
Well v prime of u of x,
wherever we see the x,

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.879
we replace it, let me write
that a little bit neater,

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.365
we replace that with a u
of x, so v prime of u of x

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:07.594
is going to be equal to,

00:04:07.594 --> 00:04:10.854
is going to be equal to one over u of x,

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:13.771
one over u of x, which is equal to,

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.910
which is equal to one over,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.276
u of x is just the square root of x.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.776
One over the square root of x.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:29.101
This thing right over
here, we have figured out,

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.303
is one over the square root of x,

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:35.053
and this thing, u prime
of x, we figured out,

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.761
is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.780
and x to the negative 1/2,
I could rewrite that as 1/2

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.492
times one over x to the
1/2, which is the same thing

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:51.159
as 1/2 times one over
the square root of x,

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.241
or I could write that as one
over 2 square roots of x.

00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.194
So what is this thing going to be?

00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:02.395
Well this is going to
be equal to, in green,

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:06.562
v prime of u of x is one
over the square root of x,

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:11.668
times, times, u prime of
x is one over two times

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.983
the square root of x, now what
is this going to be equal to?

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.794
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.457
this is just algebra at this point,

00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:24.267
one over, we have our
two and square root of x

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:26.472
times square root of x is just x.

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:29.096
So it just simplifies to one over two x.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.170
So hopefully this made sense,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.789
and I intentionally diagrammed it out

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.321
so that you start to get that
muscle in your brain going

00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.748
of recognizing the composite functions,

00:05:37.748 --> 00:05:39.499
and then making a little bit more sense of

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.201
some of these expressions
of the chain rule

00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:43.333
that you might see in your calculus class,

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:44.931
or in your calculus textbook.

00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:47.143
But as you get more practice,
you'll be able to do it,

00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:49.994
essentially, without having
to write out all of this.

00:05:49.994 --> 00:05:51.504
You'll say okay, look,
I have a composition.

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:55.041
This is the natural log
of the square root of x,

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.708
this is v of u of x.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.050
So what I wanna do is I
wanna take the derivative

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.097
of this outside function with respect

00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:03.942
to this inside function.

00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:07.301
So the derivative of
natural log of something,

00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:11.929
with respect to that something,
is one over that something.

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.287
So it is one over that something,

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:16.184
the derivative natural log of something

00:06:16.184 --> 00:06:19.624
with respect to that something
is one over that something,

00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:21.182
so that's what we just did here.

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:24.160
One way to think about it,
what would natural log of x be?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.571
Well that'd be one over x,
but it's not natural log of x.

00:06:27.571 --> 00:06:28.822
It's one over square root of x,

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:31.442
so it's going to be one
over the square root of x,

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.540
so you take the derivative
of the outside function

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.158
with respect to the inside one,

00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:37.480
and then you multiply that
times just the derivative

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.897
of the inside function with respect to x.

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.182
And we are done.
