00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:04.537
- [Voiceover] We have three
plus blank is equal to 10.

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:06.896
So pause the video and try to figure out

00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:08.371
what the blank is.

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.049
What do I have to add
to three to get to 10?

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.148
So you've had a go at it.

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.679
Now let's see if we can do this together.

00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:21.608
So over here, I have three of these,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.267
I guess you could say purple,
these purple pinkish circles

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:27.954
and I have 10 boxes.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.370
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.877
eight, nine, ten.

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:33.748
So one way to think about it is,

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:37.010
how many more circles do
I need to add to fill up

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.366
all of the boxes?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.817
Well, let's just count that together.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:45.156
I need to add one, two, three, four,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.229
five, six, seven to fill up all 10 boxes.

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:53.646
So three plus what is equal 10?

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.847
Well, three plus one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:59.390
is equal to 10.

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:00.924
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:07.086
So now I have six plus
blank is equal to 10.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.234
So again, try to pause the video

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:13.730
and see if you can figure
out what the blank is.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.608
What do I need to add to six to get to 10?

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:18.592
Let's do it together.

00:01:18.663 --> 00:01:23.663
So we now have one, two,
three, four, five, six circles.

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:26.151
We have 10 boxes here.

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.551
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.863
So we just have to think
about how many more circles

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:34.707
do we need to fill up all
the boxes to get to 10

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:36.969
because we already have six filled in.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:42.006
Well, we need one, two,
three, four to get to 10.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.561
So let's just fill that in.

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:47.790
Six plus four is equal to 10,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.684
or we could say even that

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:52.270
four plus six is equal to 10, either way.
