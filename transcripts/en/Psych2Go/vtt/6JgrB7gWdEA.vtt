00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.419
Many 
women wonder what type of girls men are most
drawn to, the girly girl who always looks

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.699
as if she just walked out of a salon. The
business woman with a booming career. The

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.099
adventurous gal who will show you the definition
of a good time. How about the mysterious one

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.609
whom you're just dying to get to know. Psychological
studies showcase that there are four categories

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:37.760
of women that seem to bring out the best in
men. The femina, the islander, the regal and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.210
the entrepreneur. All women contain a little
of each archetype within themselves with one

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.649
taking precedence over the others. 1: The
Femina. The Femina always looks as if she

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.680
has a daily stylist, she's fashionable, classy
and loves the finer things in life. She portrays

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.719
confidence, friendliness, vulnerability and
a sweet touch of femininity. Her irresistible

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.539
charm makes her easily desirable to men. Two
famous femina women are Princess Diana and

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.209
Halle Berry. Men are attracted to the femina
because she makes an effort to maintain and

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:21.330
showcase her style and beauty. They are visual
and they admire a woman who can externally

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.610
take care of herself. Better yet a femina
doesn't dress in accordance to win the approval

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.780
of men, but rather she does so to satisfy
herself. Bring out your femina by accentuating

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.750
your beautiful physical aspects gracefully
and modestly. Do you have great legs? Show

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.119
them off with a cute skirt. Do you have nice
shoulders? Wear a flattering top. The most

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.099
attractive quality is confidence, if you don't
have that level of confidence yet just fake

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:58.729
it until you make it. 2: The Islander. The
islander is energetic, comforting and lively.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.929
No man will ever get bored of her, she can
easily win over the male heart with her smile

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.970
and natural charm. She's a non-conformist
and definitely a stand out of the crowd type

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.830
of girl. She rightfully owns her own unique
style just like Shakira and Nicky Minaj. Men

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.190
are attracted to the Islander because of her
spontaneous nature allows for her to keep

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.930
it interesting and constantly has men on their
toes. Channel your inner islander by being

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.910
adventurous, go do something you've always
been afraid to do but wanted to do anyway.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.400
Such as rock climbing or diving. 3: The regal.
It takes a strong, confident man to be with

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.820
a regal. This woman tends to be highly selective,
reserved and well mannered. She is well aware

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.610
of what she desires and fully knows that she
will obtain it. Men find the regal attractive

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.770
because they like the array of mystery she
possesses and they enjoy the fact that she

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.080
isn't too easily available. When they finally
win her over, it's almost as if they've obtained

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.120
a diamond. Bring out your inner regal by simply
listening 80% of the time and talking only

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.760
20% of the time. Be sincerely interested and
ask questions when you truly listen to a man

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.050
you make him feel like he's important to you.
And you'll get a further glimpse into his

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.500
brain. Don't forget to add your own insight
and reveal some details of yourself as well.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.819
4: The entrepreneur. The entrepreneur is a
career woman who wants to be a power couple

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.690
with her partner. She is intelligent, independent
and driven for success. She will easily override

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.050
passive-aggressive men and have no patience
for that. A man needs to be successful, dominant

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.110
and assertive in order to keep up with her.
Two famous entrepreneurs are Oprah Winfrey

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.640
and Hillary Clinton. The entrepreneur is attractive
to men because she's mentally stimulating

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.680
and can carry an educated conversation. She's
driven and continuously trying to improve.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.289
Men of high social ranking look for women
who can keep up with them intellectually since

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.950
they enjoy discussing politics, philosophical
ideas, science, the news and such with their

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.630
partners. Channel your inner entrepreneur
by investing in self growth and improvement

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.900
whether that be to obtain a higher education,
grow your business or establish new connections.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.150
Keep in mind that everyone has improvements
they can strive to work on, make a plan and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.130
set out to follow it. Now that you know the
four main types of women, what type of woman

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.770
