1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.810
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.980
N y. S. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.090
All right. Okay, so let's just do the open. All right. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today we're going to be talking,

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.170
well, let, let's do it this way. Which way I, uh,

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.000
I was at the 92nd street y in New York City, a big gathering spot for up, uh,

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.830
cool people with new books and that particular we is Richard Dawkins.

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.450
Richard,

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.640
<v 1>don't you like him?</v>

10
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.450
<v 2>Make it so easy for him? I decided to begin.</v>

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.340
This is a real problem for a lot of people by quoting him to him.

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.250
Um, you right. I Dunno if it's in this book or some other,

13
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.840
the total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent

14
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.260
contemplation during the minute that takes me to compose this sentence.

15
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:01.490
Thousands of animals are being eaten alive. Others are running for their lives,

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.180
whimpering with fear. Others are slowly being devoured from within,

17
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:09.770
by rasping parasites. Thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation,

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.320
thirst disease. It must be.

19
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.290
So if there's ever a time of plenty,

20
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.650
this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the

21
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:22.370
natural state of starvation and misery is restored.

22
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.620
<v 3>Who Darwin was worried by the same thing. I mean,</v>

23
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:33.621
Darwin recognize the total horror of the suffering in nature was one of the

24
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.360
things that actually made him lose his faith.

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
But he also realized that it's not just a fact that it happens. It's,

26
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.090
it's intrinsic to natural selection that it must happen.

27
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.560
And when you look at a beautiful animal like a Cheetah that appears to be

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.870
beautifully designed for something like a cheater is amazingly well designed

29
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.280
apparently for catching gazelles and gazelles are amazingly well designed for

30
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.510
escaping from,

31
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.810
from Cheetahs that they are the end products of a sort of evolutionary arms race

32
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.470
in which thousands, millions of animals have died. The,

33
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.730
the shaping,

34
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.890
the carving of the shape of a cheetah or a gazelle has come about through

35
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.470
millions of unsuccessful gazelles being caught and the successful ones,

36
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.800
um, making it through, only to be caught later probably,

37
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:30.390
but after reproducing and passing on the genes that help them to escape.

38
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.750
So the sheer number of deaths that lie behind the sculpting of,

39
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:41.910
of these beautiful creatures is horrifying. And at the same time, it,

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.500
it's got a kind of savage beauty

41
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.393
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.800
<v 0>wow. Why do you blame this exactly? Well, because I was sitting there thinking,</v>

43
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.190
I know cheetahs chasing eat antelopes but wasn't there a nice ones that went

44
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.050
over to the antelope and said, yeah, have a sandwich together.

45
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.950
And it maybe something about the Cheetah and the had something to do with an act

46
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:09.784
of kindness,

47
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.710
<v 5>thinking that maybe it's not just meanness that can sculpt,</v>

48
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.240
that maybe niceness can sculpt too.

49
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.123
<v 0>The exact</v>

50
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.340
niceness as a, as a

51
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.780
<v 6>[inaudible] niceness as a scout.</v>

52
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.080
I want listen to that show. [inaudible]

53
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.550
wait a second. We are that show. We should do it then.

54
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.760
Let's do it today on radio lab.

55
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.823
<v 7>Goodness,</v>

56
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.040
<v 5>selflessness, altruism. If the world is so cruel, how do you account for it?</v>

57
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.110
How should we think about it? And when you do see generosity,

58
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.840
<v 7>how do you know what's really generous?</v>

59
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.683
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

60
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.690
<v 5>All right, so we're going to start the show, uh,</v>

61
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.990
with a story that sort of embodies the last question.

62
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:13.270
You asked about a guy named George Price,

63
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.950
who is a mathematician we never heard of until our producer Lynn Levy told us

64
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:21.130
about him. She heard about it from an author, Oren Harman,

65
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.960
who wrote a book called the price as in George Price of altruistic around,

66
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.440
you know, this is a high school photo. So, okay,

67
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.240
so the people on the radio can't see the picture.

68
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.260
So describe what he looks like. Well, I tell you, he looks a bit like sort of a,

69
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.270
some kind of Scandinavian prince in the 17th century.

70
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.710
Good looking guy. Totally. Um, definitely something about this guy's eyes.

71
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:48.150
His eyes. Yeah. This was described to me by a number of people who knew him.

72
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.190
He had a gaze that you sort of walked away from at your own peril.

73
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.660
There was something that, you know, he, he sort of new things.

74
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.370
You could start George's story anywhere.

75
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.000
But let's start in 1943 today,

76
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.670
George graduates from college and he's this very kinetic kind of guy.

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.540
Really Athletic.

78
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.920
You'd swim in the surf and he did a lot of rock climbing and by all accounts he

79
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:13.600
was incredibly brilliant and right after college he starts to kind of bounce

80
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.420
through history. He was all over the place.

81
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.280
First place he ends up is the Manhattan project on uranium in Richmond.

82
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:25.810
So he was working as a chemist on the atom bomb when he was done with that.

83
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.940
After a couple of years he made a 90 degree turn and started working at bell

84
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:32.890
labs on transistor research.

85
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.510
Solved some very basic problems there and then disappeared like a phantom.

86
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.250
Started working at a medical center on oncology research, meaning cancer.

87
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.280
And I remember going to his lab playing hide and seek all these bottles and tips

88
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.020
to the, by this time George had a wife and two kids.

89
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:53.800
You look under the microscope, it's slides of blood [inaudible] and Kathleen,

90
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.880
but you never really saw them that much work 56 hours straight without sleeping

91
00:05:58.881 --> 00:05:59.490
on Benzos.

92
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.050
<v 8>I remember he was always stuff like that. Gone a lot. Mm.</v>

93
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.630
When the kids were still pretty young, we were like five and six.

94
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.310
He left his family.

95
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.183
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

96
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.340
Just left turn another 90 degree corner and began working on computer aided

97
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:21.390
design. In fact, he invented computer aided design.

98
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.370
He was firing in all directions.

99
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.220
What do you think was driving him to keep moving from thing to thing?

100
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.100
He just wanted to succeed at any cost.

101
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.410
It made no difference in what field.

102
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.670
And at one point in time he was corresponding with about five Nobel laureates

103
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.810
each in a different field.

104
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.100
He wanted to have one great discovery that would make his name.

105
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.630
<v 8>So that's, that's George. Wow. Quite a guy. Very interesting guy.</v>

106
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.950
So what happens next? So next what happens is he gets on a boat and he,

107
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:55.690
he goes to London. When was this by the way? It's November,

108
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.290
1967 and uh, in London, that's where things, um,

109
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.290
for our purposes start to really happen by what happens in London. Well,

110
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.580
he starts looking for this question. He goes from library to library.

111
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:10.840
There are 13 libraries that he would hang out at and the question that he finds

112
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:15.390
for himself, which is weird considering his personal history, um,

113
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.280
is

114
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.113
<v 5>why family?</v>

115
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.430
<v 8>Like why do people have family? Like, why do families stick together?</v>

116
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.200
<v 5>There are a lot of sort of dynamics within the family where it would make more</v>

117
00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:28.360
sense for an individual to sort of break out.

118
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.450
<v 8>No, go it alone. I'm like, he had and yet family persists</v>

119
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.130
<v 5>and there should be a good reason for it.</v>

120
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.350
<v 8>He even wrote about the question to his daughter, do Kathleen?</v>

121
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.910
My big paper will be on the evolutionary origin of the human family.

122
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.260
And most species,

123
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.700
the father just mates with the mother and she does all the childbearing herself.

124
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.200
But in the human species,

125
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:54.820
the dominant pattern has involved care by adult males toward their own children.

126
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.370
Why did I species evolve this way?

127
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.340
Yeah,

128
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.340
it just brings back what kind of a father our father was towards us and

129
00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:12.951
basically there was kind of this benign neglect [inaudible]

130
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:14.780
<v 6>okay,</v>

131
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.990
<v 8>but this question, why family was only the beginning, uh,</v>

132
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.810
why family led him to a bigger question,

133
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.660
which is why does anybody help anybody? Huh?

134
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.600
Well, what do you mean? If you think about, um, Darwin's idea,

135
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.390
survival of the fittest. [inaudible] think about what that really means.

136
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:37.090
It means if you are a creature, you have two big important jobs,

137
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.850
you gotta to survive and you gotta be fit, right? Whatever that means.

138
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:42.430
Fitness really means how many babies can you make,

139
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:46.030
how many babies are you making? And so if you do some stupid, you know,

140
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.160
harebrained thing, that means you can't stay alive and or you can't make babies.

141
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.970
That doesn't make any sense. Right? And yet, wherever you look in,

142
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.340
you see creatures

143
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 5>doing this from bacteria to insects, birds,</v>

144
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.090
[inaudible] ants and wasps. Fish. I'll give you an example.

145
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.720
There's a species of Amoeba called Disco Tealium, discoid, IOM Wa,

146
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.810
which usually the Amiibo sort of lives on its own.

147
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:14.520
It's a single celled organism in the forest. But when resources are low,

148
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.030
what it does is it sends out this chemical signal and all the other Amoeba who

149
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.900
are also single cell,

150
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.860
they start sending out signals and they start sort of crawling until they all

151
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:30.330
meet and they become one slug, which is now a single organism.

152
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.520
And the slug begins to sort of move along until it finds a place that's windy

153
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.490
and sunny, at which point it stops.

154
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.050
And the top 20% of the slug,

155
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.440
the top 20% Amoeba in the head of the slug begin to create out of their own body

156
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:48.404
a star

157
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.640
<v 1>which hardens</v>

158
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.120
<v 5>and they die while doing so.</v>

159
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.560
But the stock allows the bottom 80% to climb up the stock and to create an orb

160
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:13.700
at the top of the stock. And from there all the Amoeba that aren't, you know,

161
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.340
dead. They can catch a wind

162
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.250
<v 3>to better pastures. It's like a dandelion.</v>

163
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.810
So what's happened is that the top 20% have really sacrificed themselves for the

164
00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:30.400
back 80% and that's an Amoeba. So he figured what the hell is happening here?

165
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.790
This was a great mystery to Darwin. And Darwin said,

166
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.190
this is in fact the greatest mystery in the greatest riddle.

167
00:10:36.191 --> 00:10:39.190
And if I can't answer it, then my theory isn't worth anything.

168
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.980
<v 5>And for a hundred years when people talked about evolution, this thing,</v>

169
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.590
altruism is the elephant in the room.

170
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.100
So we were curious about this. How might you take this elephant,

171
00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:58.040
this niceness thing that seems to be everywhere and shove it back into the mean

172
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:02.560
old theory of evolution? It's gotta be a way. So we called up Carl Zimmer,

173
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.870
who's a journalist we have on the show quite often,

174
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.490
writes a lot about evolution.

175
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.150
And he told us in the 1960s just as George Price was starting to ask these

176
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:14.860
questions, some scientists came up with a new way of thinking about altruism.

177
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.980
A thought experiment, which you ran us through. Okay. So, okay,

178
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:24.390
so, so Robert, do you have siblings? I have a sister. Okay, you have a sister,

179
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.920
Sarah. Okay, let's just imagine that, um,

180
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.180
you guys are like home from college saying okay.

181
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.210
And there's a flood at the crawl, which manner

182
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.990
<v 9>the water's flooding around and you can see that your sister is about to die.</v>

183
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.010
If you save your sister's life and dying the process, your genes,

184
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.180
Robert Krulwich, his genes are gone. Yup. Yup.

185
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.110
<v 5>Right? This is the problem. Yes. But you,</v>

186
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.530
your sister have the same parents? Yes. Okay.

187
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.510
So your sister has 50% of your genes. So if I rescue her,

188
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.030
then half my genes survive. Right? 50% move on.

189
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.060
Now if you had a sister and a brother

190
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.750
and you saved them both lead each have 50% so it's a wash and so it's

191
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:17.200
effectively, it's like it's like saving Robert College in his entirety.

192
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.500
Mathematically speaking, mathematically speaking. Right.

193
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.240
Can you do this with cousins? Yeah,

194
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.570
actually if you step it back to cousins,

195
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.680
<v 10>what percentages are, that's a quarter.</v>

196
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:29.270
In the case of the grist cousins that is,

197
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.470
it's an eighth so we have to have eight covers cousins to equal my full genome.

198
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.620
Right? Yeah. Do you have that many?

199
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.680
<v 5>I have 32 third cousins and that's why I always round them up at a Rodeo every</v>

200
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.750
year and you place them all together.

201
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.260
You guys stay here in case something happens to me, but here's what I don't get.

202
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:49.090
Like how does this actually operate?

203
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:51.580
Like Robert's not going to sit there while the manor is flooding and be like,

204
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.414
well, let's see,

205
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.660
I have a cousin that's an eighth then a second cousin that the 32nd no,

206
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:59.860
you understand the math has already been done. The math is already,

207
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:04.630
the math has been done by evolution on genes and those are the jeans you got.

208
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.340
Oh, so you're saying that the evolution is turned the math into an instinct.

209
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.203
Yeah. You got it.

210
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.300
<v 10>I don't think I get it. Like so what is the instinct here? The,</v>

211
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:18.570
I know I want to save my sister. Yeah, let's, so here's how I understand it.

212
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.900
Since this has half your genes and since second cousin only has a 32nd,

213
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.960
theoretically your instinct to save your cyst should be 16 times stronger than

214
00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:33.570
your instinct. No, that's actually roughly proportionally. Correct.

215
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.170
But keep in mind, this was just an idea.

216
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.580
It's just a thought experiment until our Guy George Price comes along and writes

217
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.563
an equation,

218
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.290
which shows mathematically how an instinct like this could evolve. Very

219
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.240
<v 5>powerful. Okay. So well do you want me to just read the letters? Yeah.</v>

220
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.380
What is the equation? What equals what? Okay. Okay. So it's a, um,

221
00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.790
w times Delta z equals the covariance of w I come a Z,

222
00:14:01.911 --> 00:14:06.870
I plus e, we call it e w, I, Delta, Z, I,

223
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.210
oh, of course. Yeah. There you go.

224
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.770
<v 8>Well complicated. I mean, it was simple a second ago. Yeah,</v>

225
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.440
it sounds a little complicated. He's not just dealing with like a simple setup.

226
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.330
It's like he's got a traits and how they affect the different groups and how

227
00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:25.410
things change over time. So it's a big, there's a lot going on in there. Okay.

228
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.303
Yeah. All right.

229
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.580
<v 5>Do you understand what you just said? Not so here.</v>

230
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.190
This is a really interesting letter, which you should read it.

231
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.810
When he did write the equation,

232
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.140
he walked off the street into the university and University College of the

233
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.510
University of London in London. Complete unknown. Why? Just moved from America.

234
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.110
No one knew who, who he was.

235
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.170
I went to talk to a professor Smith and he showed equation to the professor and

236
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:53.330
said, is this new?

237
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.320
I felt sure that someone must've discovered it before the professor looked at it

238
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.340
and after a very, very short amount of minutes,

239
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.700
gave him an honorary professorship keys and the keys to,

240
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.093
to an office,

241
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.940
<v 11>one of the best genetics departments in the world.</v>

242
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.930
So George is sitting in his office,

243
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.800
which by the way is on the site of Darwin's old house. Whoa. Yeah. And uh,

244
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.950
he's made this big discovery and he's thinking, thank you.

245
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.513
Thank you.

246
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.620
<v 3>Thinking philosophically that what it all meant.</v>

247
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.570
<v 11>Thank you. Thank you.</v>

248
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.700
<v 3>If I can write a formal mathematical treatment of the evolution of a trait like</v>

249
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.480
altruism,

250
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.480
what it means about the trade is that that the trait is never really purely

251
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:48.970
altruistic.

252
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.290
<v 4>Mm.</v>

253
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:55.390
<v 5>If making a sacrifice helps me in the end or helps my genes sort of like</v>

254
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:58.280
selfishness in the skies. Yeah. If that's true,

255
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.340
<v 3>the world is a terrible place.</v>

256
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.383
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

257
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.940
<v 3>because it means that there's no Tucson,</v>

258
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.580
there could never be true selflessness in the world.

259
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.120
My math means that there cannot ever be true selflessness

260
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.220
and I can't accept a world like that.

261
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.970
<v 5>Why could he suddenly not accept a world like that? I, yeah. I don't know. Um,</v>

262
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.110
or other things it might be because precisely because he had been so selfish for

263
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.430
most of his life.

264
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.300
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

265
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.300
<v 3>and so he decided in his own life to embark on a program of radical altruism</v>

266
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:36.870
that would prove that there was true selflessness in school and that's what led

267
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.300
him to the streets of London

268
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.540
<v 5>in search of homeless people.</v>

269
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.520
There were licks down and outs and he began by sort of just walking up to them

270
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:51.280
introducing himself. Hello, my name is George. What's your name?

271
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:53.560
How can I help you? It's random people on the street. Yeah,

272
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.510
everywhere I go I keep running into down and out alcoholics to whom I give,

273
00:16:58.511 --> 00:17:02.380
when I have anything and with whom I sit and drink from their bottle.

274
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:06.550
If they offer me a drink, buy people's sandwiches or give them a few pounds,

275
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.000
whether it's by giving them money, cleaning a filthy kitchen,

276
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:14.890
and then got them Lord bigger started giving out keys to his place,

277
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.770
dividing these guys into his home. People were coming and going.

278
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:21.610
He was giving them food clothes and after a few months of charity like that,

279
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.140
he was out of money.

280
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.750
There was one letter that he had written to John Maynard Smith,

281
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.900
another great biologist of the era which said, John,

282
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.230
I'm down to my last 15 p and I can't wait to get rid of the f the last 15 huh?

283
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.710
He thought he was proving his equation wrong.

284
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.950
So by getting poorer and poorer and giving away all this stuff,

285
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:44.430
he was somehow negating the thing.

286
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:48.670
His math seemed to say was inevitable. The selfish instinct. Yeah. You know,

287
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.920
he had self-preservation

288
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.380
<v 12>instinct and he was gonna fight the self preservation instinct and,</v>

289
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.400
and he was gonna win to sort of beat the mathematics that he himself had

290
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:00.090
written. So he was approaching it almost like a, like a math proof. Yeah.

291
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.810
Just the red one that you'd be talking [inaudible] when you ran out of money,

292
00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:09.100
George moved out of his apartment and into this abandoned house in a part of

293
00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:12.460
London called Tomer Square. Which one does the volume for my headphone,

294
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.520
which is where he met Sylvia. It was rough. They were just,

295
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.070
cause they were just poles holding the walls up some, some places at balls.

296
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.460
She was a young artist also squatting at the time and the buildings are

297
00:18:24.461 --> 00:18:26.230
crumbling, you know, people had made,

298
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.940
makes shift staircases and George had like a room, well,

299
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.420
a few clothes on the floor. Not much, but you know,

300
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.550
you could see he was always thinking he would go around asking other people,

301
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:44.110
does anybody have shoes? They don't want seven, seven needs a pair of shoes.

302
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.270
You know, that would be part of it,

303
00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:50.200
but it might also be like if somebody was sick,

304
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.980
getting them to a doctor because if you didn't, if you were homeless,

305
00:18:53.981 --> 00:18:56.500
it's very hard to have a doctor. But like I said,

306
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.900
all this is going on at the same time,

307
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.700
he was getting thinner and thinner,

308
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.690
send the neck and then these clothes, it just hung around him.

309
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.020
<v 5>Hmm. He began writing letters to his daughters apologizing.</v>

310
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.460
<v 12>[inaudible] dear Henri, sorry,</v>

311
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:18.060
I deserted you like that and I'm sorry it was such a poor father to you. Yeah,

312
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.490
I've been a terrible father. Looking at your picture now,

313
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.620
it makes me wish I could do it all over again.

314
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.390
Maybe where I come into the picture is to leave you. Okay.

315
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.330
He wanted to begin again. She says, George asked her to marry him over and over.

316
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.650
First I thought it was some kind of a joke kind of Saint George.

317
00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:38.110
We can't get met, you know,

318
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.970
she said no each time and that at a certain point he gave up.

319
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.820
It's hard to really, really remember,

320
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.350
but it was cold or is it as winter came on,

321
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.673
um,

322
00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.980
you wouldn't see George's often. He became quieter. I think.

323
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.580
I just remember, um,

324
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.393
I'm quieter.

325
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.910
<v 5>One morning this guy that was sharing a squat with George [inaudible] name is</v>

326
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.740
[inaudible]. He was heading out the door, he found beneath the door. Um,

327
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.570
as he was going out of the building,

328
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.040
he found beneath the door a letter and since they were living in a squat,

329
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:27.890
he was afraid that this was some kind of eviction notice or something like that.

330
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:29.720
He didn't read English, he couldn't read English.

331
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020
So he ran up the stairs and knocked on George's door because George was the only

332
00:20:35.031 --> 00:20:37.670
one who could read English. And when he knocked the door,

333
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:42.671
sort of kind of went in a bit and he could see in the aperture that there was

334
00:20:44.031 --> 00:20:47.960
blood all over the linoleum. [inaudible]

335
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.990
<v 3>had enough of an opening.</v>

336
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:53.890
He could see that George was sitting there with no blood left in his body.

337
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.840
He killed himself. Yeah, he took a pair of, um,

338
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.770
of scissors and cut through his carotid artery, which is a very,

339
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.750
very sort of terrible death.

340
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.053
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

341
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.550

365
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.060
Our topic today is goodness, goodness, selflessness. So we've done the math.

366
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:45.070
I the math leaves me a little on the cold side. Why did your why is,

367
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:47.590
you know what? Forget the math. Forget it. Let's, yeah,

368
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.420
let's go to the people who do the deeds.

369
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.390
You have people who do amazingly brave and heroic things. Yeah,

370
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.340
no math required and maybe find out,

371
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.300
I don't know what makes them different than the rest of us. Yeah.

372
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.520
That question. Let us

373
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.590
<v 15>to a guy named Walter Rick Calcium [inaudible] and</v>

374
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.310
<v 16>I am the executive director and secretary of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.</v>

375
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.720
Cool. Well thanks for doing this. Okay.

376
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.960
Can you just give us a little background on the hero fund?

377
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.510
What is the Carnegie Hero Fund?

378
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.720
A Carnegie Hero Fund is a private operating foundation that was established by

379
00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:25.721
Andrew Carnegie in 1904 and what we do is recognize civilian heroism throughout

380
00:23:26.991 --> 00:23:31.991
the United States and Canada by giving an award called the Carnegie Medal and

381
00:23:32.091 --> 00:23:36.400
the company, the Carnegie Medal is a financial grant. How much a?

382
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.670
Currently the amount is $5,000 wow. And how do you guys choose your heroes?

383
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.960
We judged the heroic acts against a list of,

384
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.070
so then you have to have some kind of definition of hero,

385
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:53.840
which includes some and excludes others. Yes. Perfect. Basic definition,

386
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:58.841
which is a civilian one meaning no military who voluntarily to leaves a point of

387
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:05.441
safety three to risk his own life or her own life or to an extraordinary degree

388
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.400
to save or to attempt to save the life of another human six.

389
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.550
How about seven y can you hear? Can you read that one more time? Okay.

390
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:15.230
I wasn't reading that just came from memory.

391
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:19.310
So what is it that happens in a person's mind at that pivotal moment when they

392
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:20.930
decide to voluntarily,

393
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:24.920
voluntarily leave a point of safety and seen their life to an extraordinary

394
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:28.400
degree to save the life of another human? That's what we wanted to know.

395
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.950
Should we just jump in? Okay.

396
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.310
So the first one we have on our list is a Laura Shrek. Okay.

397
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.060
That's file number seven three five four six and the award number is 8,005

398
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.150
<v 8>I am Laura shrike. I'm from Matt Toon,</v>

399
00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:46.900
Illinois and I currently live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

400
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.400
<v 16>Oh Wow. Laura spoke with our producer Tim Howard. Okay,</v>

401
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:51.530
so we're going back a little bit here. Yeah,

402
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:56.531
15 years back in the mid Nineties 1995 to 21 year old college students

403
00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:01.850
<v 8>and I was driving through the country and I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull</v>

404
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.260
and a pasture,

405
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.430
<v 16>so she stopped to see what was going on,</v>

406
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.040
<v 8>jumped out and started yelling at her to see what I could do.</v>

407
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:16.670
The woman was on the ground and the bull was 50 pound Jersey bull tossing her in

408
00:25:18.121 --> 00:25:22.350
the air and back on the ground. Wow. She was clearly struggling.

409
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.170
And where were you? I was right on the other side of the fence,

410
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.190
but the fence was electric.

411
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.280
<v 16>So here's the moment that we find fascinating. At this point,</v>

412
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:38.020
Laura can either go forward through thousands of volts of electricity toward an

413
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:41.440
angry ball that will likely mall her to, or

414
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:43.540
<v 11>mm.</v>

415
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.500
<v 16>She can stay safe.</v>

416
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.393
<v 11>No,</v>

417
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.890
<v 6>I wouldn't have just climbed through the fence</v>

418
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.590
<v 8>and I don't remember ever feeling the electricity.</v>

419
00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.470
She says by the time she got through crazily enough,

420
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.300
neighbor had shown up and threw her a piece of pipe maybe about two feet long or

421
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.180
she approached the woman who was still conscious the whole time she's yelling at

422
00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:10.480
me. Hit the ball in the face as hard as you can and don't stop.

423
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.470
<v 16>So Miss Shriek went up to the bowl and uh,</v>

424
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.010
<v 6>repeatedly. Yeah,</v>

425
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.080
<v 8>she's two foot, one foot tubing.</v>

426
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.720
I think it distracted the bowl and not where she was able to get out from under

427
00:26:25.721 --> 00:26:26.410
him.

428
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.970
And as soon as we were outside the fence looking back into the pastor and the

429
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.720
bull was literally right there at the fence,

430
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.590
kick the ground a few times and snorted. He was not happy. He was not happy.

431
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.453
<v 6>Okay.</v>

432
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.950
<v 16>To our question, when you were at that fence</v>

433
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 5>and you had the choice either stay put or to go through it,</v>

434
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.860
what was going through your mind? W was there a calculation there?

435
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.430
<v 8>No, I can't really say that. I mean</v>

436
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.320
<v 5>you didn't weigh your options or anything like that?</v>

437
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.560
<v 8>I did not know. It was just, here's the problem,</v>

438
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.270
here's what I need to do, and something needed to happen. Huh?

439
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.720
<v 5>So there is no choice moment?</v>

440
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.170
<v 8>Not that I recall, no.</v>

441
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.730
If nobody came to this woman's rescue, she would die. Unfortunately.

442
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.340
<v 5>This is the usual explanation, says Walter lobular. No explanation.</v>

443
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.970
<v 16>Like I couldn't stand there and not do anything. I would,</v>

444
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.580
I was compelled to act.

445
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.840
<v 8>I didn't really take the time to think about what else could happen.</v>

446
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.150
<v 5>I can't say I ever really thought about loan life at that time.</v>

447
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.490
I think we just jumped ahead because we thought we'd try again.

448
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:39.150
That's the voice of the next Carnegie Hero that, uh, Walter told us about.

449
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.180
<v 16>Yeah. William David Pennell, Ames William Pannell wife,</v>

450
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.270
who is the 8362nd person to receive the Carnegie Medal.

451
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.520
<v 5>I'm pretty sure Lynn Levy tracked him down. Bill, can you hear me? Yeah,</v>

452
00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:51.070
I can hear you.

453
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.330
<v 16>William. David Pennell was 37 years old at the time of his heroic act.</v>

454
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.520
<v 5>Was It 1999? Yes. I was, uh, early in the morning. It was like [inaudible]</v>

455
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.190
<v 16>3:19 AM in a small town near Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</v>

456
00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:05.510
Monongahela, Pennsylvania.

457
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.870
<v 17>Yeah, we was in bed sleeping and my wife heard a lot crash.</v>

458
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.550
I actually didn't hear it when a dog

459
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.530
<v 5>my one dog was carrying on. So right away I run down there.</v>

460
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:20.040
<v 16>Mr Pennell went outside his house. There was a very bad automobile accident,</v>

461
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.320
a car crashed head on until utility [inaudible]

462
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.510
<v 17>cool blames was like rippling the windshield out from under the hood.</v>

463
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.900
[inaudible] responded to the scene wearing only sweatpants,

464
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.170
no shoes or sharp or nothing on their chest and their foot.

465
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.270
So here we are, bill standing in front of this ball of fire.

466
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.950
There are three drunk teenagers inside that car though he doesn't know it can

467
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:43.420
either a do nothing.

468
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.470
<v 5>Ruby go in brew the driver's door</v>

469
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.190
<v 17>and it's a big fella slopped out the door.</v>

470
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.610
So I reached in and grabbed the whole of them around the chest and pulled him

471
00:28:56.611 --> 00:29:00.760
from the driver's seat out to the ground. Meantime, the car was just like blazer

472
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.250
and my neighbor was there. She was hollering, there's more of them in there.

473
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.170
So I run back to the VF and we found that the front seat passenger was trapped

474
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:12.810
in the wreckage. I finally got him loose and pulled him out.

475
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:17.680
Apparently Mr panel was aware that the third person was in the car 30 on man and

476
00:29:17.681 --> 00:29:19.830
Mr Pennell entered the car third time.

477
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.160
By then it was tires blowing flames in front to about three feet above the car.

478
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.880
His roof interior,

479
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.390
like the headline or at the car and stuff was stripping like plastic Donald.

480
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.330
My back. Huh? I mean, I'm in there screaming, you know,

481
00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:34.650
somebody give me hand in here,

482
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.800
but nobody, nobody would help. And uh,

483
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.540
I reached in and grabbed the hold of the kid who was in the back by the scruff

484
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.040
of the neck and pulled him out.

485
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.370
<v 5>All right, so when you are coming out of your house and you looking at that car,</v>

486
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.490
what was going through your head?

487
00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.880
<v 17>Well, just trying to try to help. I mean, I, I,</v>

488
00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.460
I did what any normal person would do. I mean, you know,

489
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:04.950
I just kept saying this to somebody whose kid, you know what I mean?

490
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.700
It's a time my daughter was like 16 and I'm saying to myself, you know,

491
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.490
if something, God forbid, whatever happened to her,

492
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.650
that I would hope someone would be there to help.

493
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.550
Do you ever talk to your neighbors and ask them why they didn't come in there?

494
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.460
Uh, you know what, that's funny you brought that up because, no, I've never,

495
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.260
never brought it up. Never brought it up. [inaudible] I dunno. I guess,

496
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.200
uh, maybe I probably wouldn't like their answer. I don't know.

497
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.510
I don't know why. I've never asked him about

498
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.750
<v 5>what do you think is the difference between you and those other people who just</v>

499
00:30:39.751 --> 00:30:40.584
sort of stood by?

500
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.270
<v 17>Uh, I, I couldn't answer that. I couldn't answer that.</v>

501
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.490
<v 5>So our bull girl, she didn't know</v>

502
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.440
<v 17>this guy didn't really know either.</v>

503
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.050
<v 5>Somebody must be able to tell us something about what they were thinking at that</v>

504
00:30:55.051 --> 00:30:58.640
moment that allowed them, that gave them the courage to do what they did.

505
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.210
<v 16>I can't give you a definite answer as to what propels people to do this. No,</v>

506
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.620
<v 5>but we took one more shot with Walter and he told us about a case that of all</v>

507
00:31:06.621 --> 00:31:11.090
the cases he's heard, and this is the one that puzzles him the most,

508
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.130
<v 16>the case of Wesley James Autry,</v>

509
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:18.670
a construction worker from a New York 50 year old man who did jump into the

510
00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:24.770
track that in a subway station to remove a fellow,

511
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.990
a young man who had fallen onto the track.

512
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.430
The gentleman was a six foot 280 pounds. He was,

513
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.170
he was in ERT and yet Mr Autry persisted despite the fact that a train was

514
00:31:36.171 --> 00:31:40.490
coming. There would come a point then, let's, at least in my estimation,

515
00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:41.780
where you would have to say,

516
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.130
I have to get out of here because I'm going to be killed on, I'm not suicidal,

517
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:51.560
but Mr Autry didn't think that way. He and I parked in this in this manner.

518
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:57.020
What he did was he lay at top the victim between the rails while the train

519
00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.980
passed over them in the farthest reaches of my imagination,

520
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.790
I can see myself jumping onto a subway track to attempt the rescue.

521
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.730
What I can't see myself doing is lying at top,

522
00:32:07.731 --> 00:32:09.650
the victim while the train passes over me.

523
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:14.700
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

524
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.440
<v 5>making this story even more nuts.</v>

525
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.040
When we finally met up with Wesley,

526
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.940
Audrey on the platform where this incident happened under 35th and Broadway,

527
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.490
he explained to us that his daughters had been with him. Okay.

528
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.300
<v 18>And uh, how old are your daughters at that time?</v>

529
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.230
My daughter was four and six. And this, this them there.

530
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.860
Oh Shit. This picture, oh my God, super cute.

531
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.490
<v 5>The one behind me is Shuki in this, the baby Sashi.</v>

532
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.220
So when they're standing there and this guy starts convulsing and then

533
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:50.480
eventually falls off the platform onto the tracks, right as a train is coming,

534
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:55.250
his choice is pretty stark. In order to say this complete stranger,

535
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.330
he's got to leave his daughters behind potentially without a dad

536
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.050
<v 19>and had him seeking and going into another seizure. Well,</v>

537
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:06.510
some strange reason a boys out of nowhere that don't worry about your own new

538
00:33:06.511 --> 00:33:08.850
worry about your daughters. You can do this.

539
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:15.080
So he jumps runs to the guy. Is he conscious? No,

540
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.430
no. Tries to grab the guy's hand and he's started my grab. This hand will slip,

541
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:22.610
applied in a, he slipped. I look up, the train is getting close.

542
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:26.480
I grab his hand again. We'll slip apart just riding the skulls up, 50 feet,

543
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.063
20 feet,

544
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.950
10 feet and then it's right there and all he can do his [inaudible] wrap the

545
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:32.101
guy,

546
00:33:32.101 --> 00:33:36.090
get them in a bear hug and flattened his body against the guy as much as he can.

547
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.380
The first train car,

548
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:46.670
just greys my cats train car went right over it.

549
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.470
Train, came to a stop quoted, five calls passed over us.

550
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.310
I looked them in the eyes. Excuse me, you seem to have a seizure or something.

551
00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:55.960
I don't know you, you don't know me.

552
00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.830
So I just kept talking to him until he came through and he was like, well,

553
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.490
we have like, we're looking for training. He said, well, who are you? I said,

554
00:34:03.491 --> 00:34:07.390
I came down to save your life. So he kept asking me, are we dead or when heaven,

555
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.400
I gave him a slight pinch on his own. He's like, oh, just I see you.

556
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.370
You are very much alive. Have you,

557
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.530
did you ever ask yourself at this point like what am I doing here? He asked it.

558
00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:23.470
What am I doing here? What about you, your mom? I can hear the two ladies.

559
00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:25.960
We had my daughter standing, the man between their legs.

560
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.180
I can hear my daughter screaming. So when that train come to a stop, uh,

561
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.160
I yelled up from underneath the train. Excuse me, I'm the father. We're okay.

562
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.110
I just want to let my daughters know that,

563
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.810
that I'm okay because I know that they are worried about me.

564
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.360
Everybody started clapping. Can I ask you a question?

565
00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:45.980
So it's the point at which you said you heard a voice. Yes.

566
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.130
That said I can do this. I can do this. What's what,

567
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.900
what is amazing to me?

568
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.150
Is it you left your daughters right here and died after a guy you don't know he

569
00:34:57.151 --> 00:35:00.930
was a stranger, a total stranger. But you know what? The mission wasn't calm,

570
00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:05.460
completed. I was chose by that. You felt chose like you were cheating.

571
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.920
I felt like I was the chosen for a religious person though.

572
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.670
I would wonder why me? Well, you know what, uh,

573
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:21.420
maybe 20 years ago I was supposed to be at a certain point

574
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.100
<v 5>and then he explained to us exactly why he had jumped.</v>

575
00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:27.670
He was the one guy who could, he said right before his feet left the platform,

576
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:30.900
this one specific moment from his life flashed

577
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.110
<v 19>mind. This thing that happened, you know,</v>

578
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.660
I had a gun pool to my temple, but you, it was a misfire. So you know,

579
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.450
a gun was put to your head and you missing, so you are almost dead for a second.

580
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.140
Those dead, you know, so you think you might've been spared for a period?

581
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.920
I was spared for a reason. After that moment,

582
00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:52.020
he says when the gun went click and he didn't die,

583
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.420
he always wondered why had God spared him that moment until he was on the

584
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:01.380
platform and he saw the guy fall off. He says, then he knew,

585
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.810
this is why I can do this. It's just I can do this. I can do this.

586
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.020
That voice, when that boy said that you're going to be okay.

587
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:11.430
I knew everything was gonna work out,

588
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.640
<v 10>you know? And I think at the end of the day, what's that happen?</v>

589
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.650
I don't think that there's an answer to the question we asked.

590
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.050
I don't really hear a question. Why were you a hero?

591
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.030
I don't think that any three of these here.

592
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.730
I mean the last one had the longest explanation.

593
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.130
He had been selected for some purpose,

594
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.130
but does he know why he was not a clue?

595
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.270
A CIA guy number three gives me something. What does he give you? Okay,

596
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:44.940
so the first two, right? They have no idea. None,

597
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.880
so there's just something in them that made them act began.

598
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.430
Number three is talking about circumstances.

599
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.710
The world prepared him for that moment. Serendipity, so it makes me think,

600
00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.450
well, what if circumstances are just right? Maybe any of us could do that.

601
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.960
I'll get, I'll get a middle man. He, he used to say to me all the time, he says,

602
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.380
how did you manage to do that up? Or how did you manage her pulling kids out?

603
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.660
I don't know if I could done that. I said, well, you know what?

604
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:13.170
Don't say you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do that to you're put in that

605
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:15.540
situation. In fact, when we asked Walter,

606
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.870
how many nominations do you get a year, are they hard to find?

607
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.220
<v 16>No, they are not hard at all to find a,</v>

608
00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:24.430
we are fortunate to be living in a society regardless of what you hear

609
00:37:24.431 --> 00:37:25.264
elsewhere.

610
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.620
We are fortunate to be living in a society where people do look out for others,

611
00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:30.520
even strangers.

612
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.340
<v 10>He told us they've even had to up their guidelines to make it harder to win</v>

613
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.380
<v 16>simply because of the vast number for road deeds that, uh,</v>

614
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.820
happen in day to day life.

615
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.133
<v 19>Okay.</v>

616
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.260
<v 5>Hey there. This is [inaudible] calling from London, England.</v>

Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

623
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.500
Oh yes. Would you like to say our topic? Robert? Our topic today is goodness,

624
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.300
niceness or may altruism. Yep. Thus far,

625
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:22.860
we've met a couple of folks,

626
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:26.280
individuals who have struggled with altruism in some way. No.

627
00:38:26.281 --> 00:38:31.281
We're going to sort of pull back and go from specifics to grand global strategy.

628
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:36.280
Yes. Hello. Hello, hello. And we're going to tell you really cool story.

629
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.520
<v 20>We think the begins with this guy. My name is Robert Axelrod.</v>

630
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:44.610
I'm the Walgreen professor for the study of human understanding and the

631
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.840
Department of Political Science and the Ford School of public policy of the

632
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:50.950
University of Michigan.

633
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.850
I know that's a mouth that was like your dean was like,

634
00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.550
well you know,

635
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:01.420
you could just say I'm a professor of public policy and political science or

636
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:05.590
something. But before he was all of that extra road when he was in high school,

637
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.410
he was one of those guys who just loved computers. Well, yes, in 59,

638
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.290
1960 I hung around the Northwestern university computer center.

639
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.550
59 60.

640
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:19.840
So what were those large pieces of furniture in the building?

641
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.470
They were, in fact, the hall campus had one computer and uh, they,

642
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:26.140
let me use it for 15 minutes here in 15 minutes there.

643
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.640
And what would you do with you with the computer?

644
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.880
What I did was I did a very simple computer simulation of hypothetical life

645
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.350
forms and environments for science project. Really? Yeah.

646
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.620
You're a pre geek is what you are. Yes. The word had been invented.

647
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.600
I can't think you could say that.

648
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:45.660
But then in 1962 when actual robbers down in a computer basement,

649
00:39:45.661 --> 00:39:47.830
I got somewhere all over the world.

650
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.630
Everybody else was watching one of the great dramas in modern times.

651
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.973
<v 21>Hello telethons</v>

652
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.390
<v 20>unfolding the Cuban missile crisis</v>

653
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.263
<v 21>the past week.</v>

654
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:02.160
Unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive

655
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:07.230
missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island.

656
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.200
<v 20>And that's what rod started thinking about, the dilemma we were in. Well,</v>

657
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.200
each side wants to spend more money buying missiles and things. You know,

658
00:40:13.201 --> 00:40:15.930
we could build more bombs, but then they could build more bombs.

659
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.680
It would be better if they would both stop. But if we stop and they don't,

660
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.130
that'd be bad. Very bad. Yeah. And so I was interested in what's the,

661
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:26.640
what were the conditions that would allow people to get out of this problem?

662
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.380
And then he starts thinking, well wait,

663
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.940
maybe I could use my computer to help me figure out what's a good strategy for

664
00:40:32.941 --> 00:40:36.390
this. For something like the Cuban missile crisis. Well, yes. Right.

665
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.010
And what made you think that computers could help with that? Well,

666
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.860
I came across a simple game called the prisoners to Atlanta.

667
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.140
<v 5>No, it's from the window. Okay.</v>

668
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.530
So the prisoner's dilemma is a very famous thought experiment.

669
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.340
It's a little tricky to describe, but I got a friend of mine, Andrew Zali,

670
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.700
who's written about the prisoner's dilemma in an upcoming book, resilience,

671
00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.480
the science of why things bounce back. I got him to lay it out for me.

672
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.910
What is the prisoners in love, Matt?

673
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.790
So imagine that two bank robbers are hanging out across the street from the

674
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:13.780
first national bank and uh, the police pick them up.

675
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.950
They've received a tip that these two guys are about to rob the bank. Get it.

676
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.220
Yup. So the cops take these two guys back to the station,

677
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.590
do the whole law and order thing, put them in different rooms.

678
00:41:23.591 --> 00:41:26.680
They walk into each one, let's call them lucky and Joe.

679
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.080
And they say to lucky,

680
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.200
we have enough to make sure that you go away for a six month sentence.

681
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.640
But this is not really what the cops want.

682
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:40.010
They want a longer sentence for one of these guys.

683
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:41.900
And so they make lucky and offer.

684
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.930
If you lucky rat out Joe and Joe doesn't say anything,

685
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.530
you will go free and Joe will go to jail for 10 years.

686
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.720
If the reverse happens, meaning if you say nothing and Joe Rats you out,

687
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.930
you're going to jail for 10 years and he's going to walk free.

688
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.630
If you both end up ratting on each other, you both get five, five years.

689
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.730
Whereas if you both keep your mouth shut,

690
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.890
you're each going to jail for six months for loitering.

691
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.800
Just somehow if lucky and Joe could talk to each other,

692
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.960
they both say don't speak. Absolutely.

693
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.310
But the big problem that lucky and Joe have is they can't talk to each other.

694
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:24.510
<v 20>All right, so you're lucky. Okay. What do you do? Do you rat Joe out or no?</v>

695
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.590
Do I know this guy? Huh?

696
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.590
<v 10>At all? I mean you met for this one job,</v>

697
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.450
but tomorrow you'll never see him again. Ever. Ever. Well, if I,

698
00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.360
if I knew him and I could trust him, then I think I know what I would do.

699
00:42:39.361 --> 00:42:41.600
But if keep your mouth shut, I wouldn't get six months.

700
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.080
He'd keep his mouth shut. It would be a sweet thing indeed. But see,

701
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.640
since I don't, no matter what, what would happen if he rats me out?

702
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.470
You'd go to jail for 10 years. He'd go freed bastard 10 years.

703
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:52.740
Yeah,

704
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.740
but if I read him out in the worst I get is five years or you know,

705
00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:02.330
I go way free. I'm totally free. Do it. I guess say what's in your head.

706
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.530
I'm going to, I'm throwing him under the bus. Yes.

707
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.130
I wonder what's his name again? Joe. Joe. He's already gone.

708
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.050
Excuse me. Memory of your dad.

709
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:16.240
<v 5>Jimmy. Joe. So you see in this type of scenario where you don't know the guy,</v>

710
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.680
you have have very strong incentive to rack the other guy out or as the social

711
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.640
scientists would say to defect. That's right. If you play it only once,

712
00:43:24.641 --> 00:43:27.430
if you only meet somebody once, whatever the other guy does,

713
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.130
you're better off defecting against them. Just here on out.

714
00:43:30.131 --> 00:43:33.160
Whenever you hear the word defect, know that it means screw the other guy over.

715
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.910
But the f the really interesting stuff happens if you play over and over again.

716
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:39.760
If you're going to meet the same people again because now you're thinking,

717
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.050
should I help this guy out the next time? If he screwed me, should I say, screw

718
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:47.790
<v 20>him up? This secret whip, extraordinary build up of communist missiles.</v>

719
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.780
What do you do? You want to cooperate, but you don't want to get screwed,

720
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.180
which cannot be accepted by this country. Right. You know,

721
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:58.200
these kind of thoughts were paramount in those days because the prisoner's

722
00:43:58.201 --> 00:44:00.900
dilemma was being played between the two superpowers.

723
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.550
This is our friend Steve Strogatz,

724
00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:06.120
the Cornell mathematician who says at that time, low kinds of folks,

725
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:09.090
political scientists and economists and psychologists,

726
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.630
mathematicians were writing papers about the prisoner's dilemma.

727
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.950
We have a really in thinking, come on,

728
00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:16.980
we've got to be able to win this game if we're going to play against the

729
00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:19.890
Russians and we have to do it. Right. Exactly.

730
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.380
But there was no consensus on the best way to do it,

731
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.310
and so I was interested in what's a, what's a good strategy for this?

732
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.150
And that's when Robert Axelrod's sitting down there in the basement somewhere in

733
00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:32.010
the Midwest with the big, that's when

734
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 22>he had his idea. His approach,</v>

735
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:38.310
which was really novel at the time,

736
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:42.840
was to conduct a computer tournament. The computer terminal.

737
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:43.861
Yeah.

738
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.400
Invite the people that had come up with these different ideas to play with each

739
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:51.390
other. In other words, what he said is, uh, all right, Mr DWIs guy. You know,

740
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:54.480
you've written so-and-so many articles on the prisoner's dilemma.

741
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:55.680
You think you understand it.

742
00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.630
How about joining this tournament where you have to submit a program that will

743
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:04.950
play prisoner's dilemma against programs submitted by the other experts.

744
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.300
We'll have a round Robin, right?

745
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.400
Try these different programs against each other.

746
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.240
So all these computer guys are brought to Caesar's palace in Las Vegas.

747
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.500
I wear Tuxedos. And they all sat down at the table. No, it's a nice image.

748
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.760
But what really happened was everyone submitted their programs to axle Rod.

749
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:23.850
They would mail their entries to me, but there was a trophy.

750
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:28.170
There wasn't a TOEFL. So I wrote to people and I said, if you win,

751
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:29.220
I'll send you a trophy.

752
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.330
Know little plaque that says you won the computer tournament. Yeah. Okay.

753
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:34.260
So here's the deal.

754
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.180
Every program will play every other program 200 times.

755
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:43.050
There will be points in each round and then actual rod will total the scores and

756
00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:46.170
see what actually works by which he means in the long run.

757
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:47.970
Even if you lose some rounds here in the air,

758
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.790
one of these strategies is going to beat all the others.

759
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:55.290
Meaning it'll let you survive. Maybe even prosper.

760
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.980
That's the game. That's right. And uh,

761
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.960
can you introduce us to some of the contestants? Yeah.

762
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:06.020
So there was one program called massive retaliatory strike and the first move it

763
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:10.200
just cooperates. But then as soon as the other program doesn't cooperate,

764
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.050
it would then retaliate for the rest of the [inaudible].

765
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.103
<v 1>Yes.</v>

766
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:18.970
<v 22>Sorry man, you blew it and never trust you again. Yeah. That's it for you.</v>

767
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.120
This is like the way my wife was,

768
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.580
whenever a guy in her earlier life stood her up, that was it. Game over.

769
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.390
But there were also some trickier program.

770
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.690
I mean some crafty ones try to make a model of the opponent,

771
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.600
like you mentioned one that was called Tester, so tester would,

772
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.720
would see what you were like. It would start by being mean

773
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.880
<v 1>and then</v>

774
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.560
<v 22>if you start retaliating, it backs off and says, you know, Ho chill.</v>

775
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.570
It's okay man. And you know,

776
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:53.100
and then starts cooperating for awhile until it throws in another.

777
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.050
<v 1>Yes. The past.</v>

778
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.130
<v 22>The other guy goes after all, it's called Tester. Yeah.</v>

779
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.810
So test your guys kind of designed to see how much it can get away with. I mean,

780
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:04.260
it sounds kind of sensible in a way. I mean mean well, but if you see,

781
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:07.020
if you think about what happens if these two players play each other,

782
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:10.980
if tester plays massive retaliation 200 times,

783
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:12.320
pretty soon the tester will defect

784
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.530
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

785
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.020
<v 22>and then massive retaliation. Right.</v>

786
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.770
<v 23>Never cooperate again. You, it's true. Let's go</v>

787
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.030
back to what I do very badly,

788
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.980
<v 22>both of them. When you're sitting</v>

789
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.370
<v 0>there,</v>

790
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.590
did you have a hunch as to which would be the most successful program or were

791
00:47:34.591 --> 00:47:34.700
you

792
00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:39.020
<v 20>well, I didn't know and which is why I wanted to do it. Uh, but I did have a,</v>

793
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.670
a hunch that, you know,

794
00:47:40.671 --> 00:47:45.440
thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code would be needed to have a pretty

795
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.730
competent program.

796
00:47:46.731 --> 00:47:50.110
So when the mailman delivers the fattest envelope to your house, he's like,

797
00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.420
this could be the one they have. Well, yes. Right. Um,

798
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.850
now it didn't turn out that way

799
00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:01.000
<v 0>when it was all said and done when he loaded all the programs into the computer,</v>

800
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.140
when it all played each other 200 times the program, that one

801
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:06.760
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

802
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.900
<v 20>it's really two lines of code. Two lines of code. Yeah. It's got a simple name.</v>

803
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:15.040
It's called tit for tat first line of Code B. Nice.

804
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.660
<v 22>Nice. Yeah. Nice. Nice. As a technical word in this game.</v>

805
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.070
Nice means I never am nasty first.

806
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.330
<v 20>And after that second line of code,</v>

807
00:48:26.331 --> 00:48:29.390
it just does what the other player did on the previous move.

808
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:30.940
<v 22>Hmm.</v>

809
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.270
<v 20>So if the other player has just cooperated, it'll cooperate.</v>

810
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.670
And if the other player has just defected, it'll defect

811
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.450
<v 22>it retaliates on the next move. Couldn't be clearer. On the other hand,</v>

812
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.680
it only retaliates that one time. I mean, unless provoked further, it does.

813
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.710
It's retaliation and now bygones be bygones. And that's it.

814
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.550
So how exactly did it win? I mean, can you give us a sense of,

815
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.600
of why it one? Okay, so let's suppose I'm here.

816
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.890
Let's take an extreme case of um, some very simple programs.

817
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.860
One of them I'll call Jesus

818
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:10.760
<v 0>for the sake of argument. Let's think of her name. The Jesus Program</v>

819
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.620
<v 22>cooperates on every turn that is, it's always, it's always, you know, good.</v>

820
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:20.090
Yeah. So the Jesus program is a simple algorithm that says, always be good.

821
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.470
Good, good, good, good, good. That's right.

822
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.590
And let's say the other program is the Lucifer program, which um,

823
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.740
no matter what always

824
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:31.330
<v 0>[inaudible] is bad. Okay. These are your two extremes. [inaudible] from,</v>

825
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.250
of course, most programs and most people fall somewhere in the middle, right?

826
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.510
But in TIF attack, you've got a strategy that can swing both ways. For instance,

827
00:49:38.511 --> 00:49:39.330
with Jesus,

828
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:43.170
<v 22>tit for tat starts by cooperating as does Jesus.</v>

829
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:44.750
<v 4>Oh.</v>

830
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.310
<v 22>And then they're going to keep cooperating</v>

831
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.080
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

832
00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.170
<v 0>for the whole 200 rounds, which is, you know, good.</v>

833
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.710
But now let's suppose it plays Lucifer where there's no chance to cooperate.

834
00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.620
The says Steve Tit for tat just plays good defense.

835
00:49:57.621 --> 00:50:01.510
So when Lucifer does his thing, tiff atop retaliate

836
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:05.660
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

837
00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.140
<v 0>and they pretty much keep doing that and stay even. So in other words,</v>

838
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:13.280
<v 22>it's a very robust program. It elicits cooperation.</v>

839
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.430
If the opponent has any inclination to cooperate,

840
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.670
but it doesn't take any guff and it wins.

841
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:24.380
So you might say in evolutionary terms, this program is the fittest.

842
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:28.880
So actually axle rod played an evolutionary of his tournament. That is,

843
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:31.490
he has these programs after they played their tournament,

844
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.840
get a chance to reproduce copies of themselves according to how well they did.

845
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.150
You mean the winners would get to have more babies? Yeah.

846
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.850
And then with the babies play each other. Yeah, he ran them again.

847
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:42.950
I mean he ran them for many generations. And to sell it.

848
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:47.900
Like suppose you have a world of Lucifer's and there are a few tit for tat

849
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:50.960
players out there. Can they thrive?

850
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.040
Can cooperation emerge in this horribly hostile world? Oh,

851
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.951
an interesting question.

852
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:58.310
So he looked at that and the answer was if you have enough of them so that they

853
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:02.060
have enough chance of meeting each other and they can actually invade and take

854
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:02.894
over the world

855
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:04.540
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

856
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.400
<v 22>even if the world starts horribly mean</v>

857
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:10.550
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

858
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.650
<v 24>I mean what, what I take to be the big message though,</v>

859
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:15.260
I mean what always sent chills down my spine,

860
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.690
just that we see this version of morality around the world,

861
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.820
you know, be upright, forgiving, but retaliatory.

862
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.210
I mean that sounds to me like the Old Testament. No,

863
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.590
it's not turning the other cheek. It's an eye for an eye,

864
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.230
but not 10 eyes for an eye.

865
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.420
And to think that it's not something that's handed down by our teachers or by

866
00:51:38.421 --> 00:51:40.970
God, but that it's something that came from biology.

867
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:44.370
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

868
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.900
<v 24>I like that argument personally.</v>

869
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:50.463
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

870
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.470
<v 25>from biology. [inaudible]</v>

871
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.791
<v 22>now,</v>

872
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:57.791
do we know whether the math has anything to do with real people in real life

873
00:51:59.971 --> 00:52:02.560
situations or are we just abstracting behavior?

874
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.890
Is this wise or is this just math?

875
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.310
This is what's so impressive to me about Axel Rod's work,

876
00:52:08.311 --> 00:52:12.030
so he's not just playing math games. He,

877
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.240
he tries to tie this to history and politics at scene.

878
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:19.890
I like to scan journals. One of my head would say it's past Angus.

879
00:52:19.891 --> 00:52:21.000
It's part of my profession,

880
00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:26.001
but I came across a book called the live and let live system in world war one.

881
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.860
<v 5>So here's what we jump away from the math and the computer tournaments and into</v>

882
00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:31.660
something very real.

883
00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:35.350
The war began late in July,

884
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.070
1914 that Stanley only one trail expert in World War One, Evan [inaudible],

885
00:52:39.071 --> 00:52:43.000
professor of Meredith at Penn State, and a story that stands gonna help us tell.

886
00:52:43.001 --> 00:52:45.400
It takes place on what was called the western front,

887
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.510
which was basically these two lines of trenches, very close to each other,

888
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.530
a few hundred yards apart and they stretched for a hundreds of miles and that

889
00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:56.350
fall in November. The weather turned bed

890
00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.560
<v 25>heavy rains. Then it became IC</v>

891
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.310
and then slush and then snow.

892
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.950
It became disgusting because the trenches also were filled with rats,

893
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:15.050
rats, the rats when after not only the food but after corpses,

894
00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:18.130
<v 5>and it was oddly in this miserable,</v>

895
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:21.370
disgusting hell hole that something quite amazing happened.

896
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:26.490
No one quite knows how it started, but one day maybe around daybreak,

897
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:28.500
let's say while the two sides were fighting,

898
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:30.450
some of the British soldiers stopped firing

899
00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.090
<v 25>long enough to have breakfast</v>

900
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.860
<v 5>and as they were eating, they noticed, hmm, the German stop too,</v>

901
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:40.760
to have their breakfast. When they were both done,

902
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:44.600
they'd begin firing again next morning. Same thing.

903
00:53:44.601 --> 00:53:47.000
British take their breakfast break at about the same time.

904
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.760
The Germans do the same thing morning after that,

905
00:53:49.761 --> 00:53:53.000
the same thing and then the next and after a while both

906
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:56.400
<v 20>sides caught on. Now if they didn't interrupt the other one,</v>

907
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.750
then they wouldn't be interrupted.

908
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.600
<v 26>On the whole, there is silence.</v>

909
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.780
<v 5>This is from a letter a British soldier sent home to his wife at the time.</v>

910
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:12.110
After all, if you prevent your enemy from drawing his rations,

911
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.770
his remedy is simple. He will prevent you from drawing yours.

912
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:17.630
When Axelrod read this,

913
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:20.330
<v 20>I thought, gee, this sounds very familiar.</v>

914
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:23.770
<v 5>Line one, if tit for tat B, Nice first.</v>

915
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.740
Now the Brits probably didn't mean to be nice first when they started the

916
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:30.220
breakfast truce, but it happened and then the Germans reciprocated,

917
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.143
which is line two.

918
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.190
Now keep in mind these two sides are at war and implicit in line two is a

919
00:54:36.191 --> 00:54:38.980
threat. If you mess with me, I'm going to mess with you.

920
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.110
<v 20>Well, think about snipers for example.</v>

921
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.440
So there's letters where they a explained where the snipers would shoot at a

922
00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:48.190
tree over and over and over again showing that in fact they were really

923
00:54:48.191 --> 00:54:51.360
accurate, meaning that if they wanted to kill you, they'd get you.

924
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.190
<v 5>And this was going on during the breakfast truce and these little agreements,</v>

925
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:57.950
you know, like, I'm going to be nice to you, but I could kick your ass.

926
00:54:57.951 --> 00:54:58.640
Don't forget.

927
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.110
Well these little truces spread all up and down the western front until things

928
00:55:03.111 --> 00:55:07.100
really changed. Fast forward to December, Christmas Eve,

929
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:11.630
<v 25>the climate was just about freezing on Christmas Eve and the Germans had a</v>

930
00:55:11.631 --> 00:55:14.900
tradition of a tabletop, Christmas trees,

931
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.940
small trees for weeks.

932
00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:20.450
He said the German government had been shipping small trees literally to the

933
00:55:20.451 --> 00:55:22.730
trenches, hundreds and hundreds of trees.

934
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.830
And that night on Christmas Eve at dusk,

935
00:55:24.831 --> 00:55:26.750
the Germans began putting up their trees,

936
00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.830
mounted them on the rim of their trench and lit candles on them singing

937
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.773
Christmas carols.

938
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.273
<v 1>Uh,</v>

939
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.030
<v 25>the British who might've been no more than 50 or 70 yards away,</v>

940
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.770
crawled forward and to no man's land to see better. And then they were spotted.

941
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:49.520
<v 5>Here's a letter from a German soldier sent home to his family,</v>

942
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.080
which describes what happened next.

943
00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:54.350
I shouted to our enemies that we didn't wish to shoot.

944
00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.110
I said we could speak to each other.

945
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:02.420
At first there was silence and then very slowly out of the darkness,

946
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.280
the British guys approached.

947
00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.720
And so we came together and shook hands this to see,

948
00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:11.570
this is where I start to think, ah, are you making this up?

949
00:56:11.571 --> 00:56:14.540
Because this is where it starts to sound sort of crazy to me.

950
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.390
That's a pat Walters, our producer. Yeah,

951
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:21.410
<v 25>sounds as if this is being made up and the result was for many decades people</v>

952
00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:24.340
assumed that this was just myth, couldn't possibly have happened,

953
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.890
but we know it had happened because we have the letters that the British and the

954
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:34.270
Germans sent back home. We know that they met in darkness and decided,

955
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.610
why don't we have a truce? In the morning?

956
00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.770
<v 5>Next morning, thousands of soldiers put down their rifles,</v>

957
00:56:40.771 --> 00:56:45.030
climbed out of their trenches into no man's land and started hanging out with

958
00:56:45.031 --> 00:56:45.480
each other.

959
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.170
A lot of us went over and talked to them and this lasted the whole morning.

960
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.940
I talked to several of them,

961
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.260
<v 10>I must say. They seemed extraordinarily fine. Men soldiers got together,</v>

962
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:59.870
started fires, Cook Christmas dinners, swapped the presidents and drank.

963
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.320
The Germans, hauled out these enormous barrels of beer. They traded stuff,

964
00:57:03.321 --> 00:57:04.850
cigars on trinkets,

965
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.470
even help one another buried the dead and in some places in the western front,

966
00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:13.430
this period of goodwill lasted a whole week.

967
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.110
<v 5>The generals found out</v>

968
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:20.930
<v 20>they were very angry about this. Cindy said,</v>

969
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:23.930
if we didn't send you to the front too, to be nice to the other guys,

970
00:57:23.931 --> 00:57:25.730
we sent him to kill him. If the general says, Hey,

971
00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:30.230
I want you to shoot those Germans, that's an order,

972
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.170
well then they would wouldn't that, oh gee, sorry, general I missed,

973
00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:36.110
but I'll try again better next time. I see where the general is fine.

974
00:57:36.111 --> 00:57:39.800
They figured out how to disrupt this whole thing as they would said, okay,

975
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:44.660
you guys go out on a raid and I want you to bring back a prisoner or a corpse.

976
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.680
In other words,

977
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.930
show me a scalp that's an order and that messed things up or royally

978
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:51.110
[inaudible].

979
00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.530
<v 5>Here's a letter from a British soldier whose unit contained a band,</v>

980
00:57:54.531 --> 00:57:55.700
which was apparently pretty common.

981
00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.290
He writes this letter about one of the moments when the truce vanished.

982
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.250
At six minutes to midnight, the band opened with the voc Tom Ryan,

983
00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.290
which is a German patriotic anthem, so some of the Germans,

984
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.041
according to this letter,

985
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:15.970
climbed up onto the rim of their trench to listen to this English band playing

986
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.863
their song.

987
00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.470
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

988
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:22.730
<v 5>Then there's the last note, sound [inaudible],</v>

989
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.070
every grenade firing rifle,

990
00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:33.100
trench mortar and bomb throwing machine let fly simultaneously into the German

991
00:58:33.411 --> 00:58:34.244
trench.

992
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:39.700
So you can imagine the Germans that weren't killed would have felt betrayed.

993
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.690
They'd just been hanging out with these guys and the next night they would have

994
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:47.200
attacked back and the British would have attacked them back and then the Germans

995
00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:50.370
would have retaliated against them and on and on and on.

996
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.270
<v 20>Then it would kind of echo back and forth forever. And that's what happened.</v>

997
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.820
<v 25>There were immense casualties, uh, uh,</v>

998
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.850
as many as 50,000 casualties in a day.

999
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.330
<v 20>And this says Axelrod is where you see sort of the dark side of different tech.</v>

1000
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.610
What are the weaknesses of the tit for tat strategy?

1001
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:08.220
Or one of the problems with it is these echoes,

1002
00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:12.300
not just that cause of good obviously, but echos of violence could get bad.

1003
00:59:12.301 --> 00:59:17.160
So what I found though was that instead of playing pure tit for tat,

1004
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.320
where you always defect at the other guy defects,

1005
00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.220
there are certain circumstances. He, and this I find completely

1006
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:26.060
<v 5>fascinating where you want to modify that second line of code so that you're not</v>

1007
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:30.350
always retaliating. You're nearly always retaliating, right?

1008
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:32.960
<v 20>If you were a little bit generous,</v>

1009
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:36.080
which by which I mean say 10% of the time you don't effect,

1010
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.360
then what happens is that these echoes will stop and I would call that generous

1011
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:42.194
tit for tat.

1012
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.510
<v 5>So this is kind of interesting like we started with Moses, you know,</v>

1013
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.990
eye for an eye. But here it's saying maybe for every nine parts, Moses,

1014
00:59:49.991 --> 00:59:51.970
you need one part. Jesus. You know what?

1015
00:59:51.971 --> 00:59:53.890
Meaning like turning the other turn the other cheek.

1016
00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:57.970
It sounds like you've described like a cooking recipe or something like nine

1017
00:59:57.971 --> 01:00:01.210
parts once. Yeah, I mean if you abstracted it as kind of a recipe,

1018
01:00:01.211 --> 01:00:02.140
it's a recipe for life,

1019
01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:05.350
but it isn't the recipe that ignores the deep fact of it. Look,

1020
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.830
if I were punching you in the face right now, what are you going to do?

1021
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.640
I'm going to punch you back and I'm going to punch you back.

1022
01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:16.380
You Punch me back on Toback and we're in pain and somehow in the middle of being

1023
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.740
blasted by my powerful fish, you have to come up with the moral courage is,

1024
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.500
I think I'm going to kiss this guy now, and that is not he as you well know,

1025
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:29.430
that is not an easy thing to do. All right? But you make it an all personal.

01:00:29.431 --> 01:00:31.920
My point is if you zoom out,

1027
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.850
this is a strategy that just seems to be woven into the fabric of the cosmos.

1028
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.710
It works for computers, it works for people. It probably works for Amoeba. Okay.

1029
01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.970
It just works. And you think that exists on some higher plane? I do. I do.

1030
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:48.960
I don't. I think this is still, as you just called it, very personal.

1031
01:00:48.961 --> 01:00:52.500
I think a person has to choose to be kind.

1032
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.860
I am gonna make that choice right now then. Okay, you're irritating me.

1033
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.260
I'm going to say to you, Robert, you look very nice today.

1034
01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.010
You know what I'm going to do?
