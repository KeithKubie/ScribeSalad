00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.540
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Members of Congress

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.430
and distinguished guests,
welcome, to the Library

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.730
of Congress and the 8th
Henry A. Kissinger lecture.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.500
I'm John Haskell, director

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.840
of the Kluge Center
here at the library.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.180
The Kissinger program is made
possible by generous donations

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.790
of the friends and
admirers of Dr. Kissinger

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.410
who was the 56th Secretary
of State of the United States

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.690
and a recipient of
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.210
Before we move on, on behalf
of all of us at the library,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810
we join America in
mourning the passing

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.150
of former president
George H.W. Bush.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.860
The Kissinger program
celebrates statesmanship

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.330
and foreign policy, President
Bush's legacy of commitment

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.420
to global diplomacy
is in keeping

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.750
with exactly that tradition.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.010
We all wish the extended
Bush family

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.550
and as many close friends the
best in this difficult time.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.260
In a similar vein, we mourn
the passing last month

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.550
of Dr. James Billington, the
13th librarian of Congress.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.990
The Kissinger program is one
of his many legacies here

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.970
at his distinguished
career at the library,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.970
which spanned 28 years.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.970
The Kissinger lecture has been
delivered by heads of state,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.110
including former Prime Minister
Tony Blair, former president

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.540
of Mexico, Filipe Calderon,
former president of Brazil,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800
Fernando Enrique
Cardoso, former president

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.480
of the French Republic
Valery Giscard d'Estaing,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.100
as well as former United
States Secretaries of State,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.650
James Baker, George Schultz,
and Dr. Kissinger, himself.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.660
As is customary, tonight's
program will include an address

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.400
by our Kissinger lecturer,
Madame Christine Lagarde,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.600
followed by a conversation
with Margaret Brennan,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.870
CBS News senior foreign
affairs correspondent and host

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.700
of Face of the Nation.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.180
At this time, it is
my distinct pleasure

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.510
to introduce Dr. Carla Hayden,
the 14th librarian of Congress.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:13.190
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.100
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Good
evening, Madame Lagarde,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.760
members of Congress, and
distinguished guests.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.860
We are deeply honored to
welcome to the Library

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.100
of Congress tonight Christine
Lagarde, managing director

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.290
of the International
Monetary Fund.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320
As you can see, we
are in the great hall

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.810
of the library's Thomas
Jefferson building,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.340
surrounded by visual art,
symbolizing the progress

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.140
of civilization and the
traditions of knowledge

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.290
and learning, a most
fitting venue

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.720
for the 8th Kissinger lecture.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.860
Madame Christine Lagarde is a
distinguished public servant

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.390
with deep knowledge of
the world's economy,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.590
and the ways financial
architecture can shape the lives

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.730
of individuals in
countries around the globe.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.120
Among her many other high
ranking points and posts

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.100
in government and the
private sector, in June 2007,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.880
she became the first woman
to hold the post of finance

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.550
and economy minister
of a G7 country.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.880
Later, as chairman of the G20,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.060
she set in motion a wide
ranging agenda on the reform

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.180
of international
monetary systems.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.150
And on July 5th, 2011,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.450
Ms. Lagarde became the 11th
managing director of the IMF

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.170
and the first woman
to hold that position.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.450
And on February 19th, 2016, the
IMF executive board selected her

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.750
to serve as managing director
for a second five year term.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.250
She has tackled some of the most
challenging financial issues

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.970
related to European integration,
international trade,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.950
and the development of
global economic governance.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.900
However, I am excited
to be the person

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.970
that will deliver breaking news.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.710
The room just got
a little quieter.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.390
[Laughter].

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:29.620
Well, today, Forbes released
its 100 Most Powerful Women

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.640
in the World and Madame
Christine Lagarde was voted the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.510
third most powerful
woman in the world.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.920
[ Applause ]

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.330
So ladies and gentleman,
please join me

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.510
in welcoming Ms.
Christine Lagarde.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:09.720
[ Applause ]

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.940
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Thank
you, very much, Dr. Hayden,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.180
dear Carla, for this generous
and brief introduction.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.970
They are the best.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.480
They are the best.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.820
I'm so happy to see many
of you here, my friends,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.200
and very much looking forward to
the discussion that we will have

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.370
after these remarks
with Margaret Brennan.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.800
And thank you also, Mr.
Haskell, for the warm welcome

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.200
that you've extended
to all of us.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.070
He could not be here tonight
but I had a conversation

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.230
with him just before arriving
at this beautiful Library

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.360
of Congress and Henry
Kissinger was delighted

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.960
that we were gathering tonight
and he has asked me to express

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.920
to all of you his best wishes
and very strong support

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.970
for continuing the lecture
that he started back in 2001.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.020
I would also like
to indicate myself

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.070
that somebody else is very
much in our thoughts tonight.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.070
And that is, obviously, former
President George H.W. Bush

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.060
and all his family members.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.010
We all mourn his passing, many
others are trying to enter

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.670
into the rotunda as we speak.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.910
And we celebrate
the arc of his life.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.700
The pilot who bravely fought
in World War II, the president

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.950
who helped heal division after
the cold war, and the statesman

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.060
who believed in the power of
international cooperation.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.600
I hope to honor his
spirit tonight.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.970
And I was privileged
to meet him recently

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.860
on several occasions
up in Maine.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.990
And I could appreciate
what a kind,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.940
generous, and noble man he was.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.740
So tonight -- tonight
is December 4th.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.160
It's actually an important
date for a particularly reason

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.110
that I will not mention
to you now.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.230
You'll have to wait until
the end of my remarks.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.530
[Laughter].

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.220
And you're not allowed to look
at your cell phone, please.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.520
[Laughter].

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.890
No. I have to confess
something here.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.390
When I walked into
the great hall

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.090
and was given a lovely private
tour by you, Dr. Hayden,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.590
three thoughts crossed my mind.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:50.070
The first one was, this young
French student who was studying

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.020
for her political science
dissertation back 42 years ago,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.720
and has spent quite a little bit
of time, in the reading room,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.810
thanks to the courtesy of
the Library of Congress,

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.910
I was able to better
research the work that I did

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.490
on Ralph Nader and the American
consumerism of those days.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.790
Thank you.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.720
I am in your debt.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.330
The second person whom I
thought about was my son,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.160
who is a young architect.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.120
He would love this place.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.930
He would love it.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.930
The space, the height,
the creativity.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.300
And the third thought I had
was about my country, France.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.900
And maybe another
country, actually,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.850
that I was just visiting a
couple of days, Argentina.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.000
Now why is that?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.460
Well, when this structure
was completed in 1897,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:55.860
the chief engineer remarked, I
quote, "that the Palais Garnier,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.910
the Paris Opera House,
was the prime suggestion

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.440
for the new Library
of Congress."

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.170
That makes sense, actually.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.070
Because the Paris Opera House
was completed 20 years earlier

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.750
in 1875.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:17.060
Now, I think the French may
have borrowed a little bit

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.360
from others.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.630
Because the Teatro Colón
in Buenos Aires was,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.750
itself, finished in 1857.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.410
And if you look at these
three buildings, well,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.630
it tells you something.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.750
First of all, that valuable
intellectual property was

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.990
of great interest across
borders, even back then,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.080
at least among architects
who happily borrowed

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.820
from each other,
learned from each other,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.740
became inspired as a result.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.010
Second, it reminds us
that they understood

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.310
that building something
lasting means linking the solid

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.340
foundations of the past with
the spark of imagination.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.010
You can't just copycat.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.720
That kind of creativity
and long-term vision rooted

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.440
in history and informed by
our successes and failures

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.610
from the past is my
theme for this evening.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.480
First, where have we been?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.240
How has creativity

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.010
and international economy
cooperation helped bring more

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.310
prosperity and more
peace in the world?

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.300
And second, where can
we travel together?

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.660
How can creativity and informed
visionary thinking help adapt

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.740
the international system
to our current challenges?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.730
So let me begin first with a
little bit of shared history

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.070
between the international
monetary fund

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.970
and the United States
over the last 75 years.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.750
In the first half
of the 20th century,

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.340
the dominant economy [inaudible]
military powers used force

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.440
to assert their self-interests
at enormous costs in terms

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.450
of human life and
physical destruction.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.590
The tragic results compelled
nations to find a better way.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.580
It only took them two wars
and atrocities along the way.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.710
But in 1944, they found it.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.740
The United States emerged
as the major global power

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.310
and did something unprecedented.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.800
Informed by the devastating,
ultimate outcome

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.190
of the Versailles Treaty
at the end of World War I,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.640
for which we just celebrated
the 100-anniversary,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.060
the United States
decided to use its power

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.310
in the service of cooperation.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:00.290
It was an experiment that
would shape our modern world.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.060
And in his inaugural
lecture in 2001,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.090
Dr. Kissinger called
the innovations

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:11.950
of the post war period, I quote,
"a great burst of creativity

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.020
that brought security
to the world."

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.580
How did the U.S. do it?

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.630
Out of generosity?

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.880
Yes. With consideration
to their self interests?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.960
Yes. And with a little help
from some of their friends.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.660
Let us look at that turning
point of 75 years ago

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.260
and think first of the creation

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.590
of the Breton Wood
system, itself.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:46.310
The principle architects,
John Maynard Keynes of the U.K

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.220
and Harry Dexter White of the
U.S. were deeply influenced

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.870
by the period between
the two wars.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.640
They witnessed a
moment in history

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.020
when flawed domestic policies
poisoned international

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.670
relationships, which
themselves were built

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.450
on troubled foundations.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.310
Treaty of Versailles.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.390
The result was protectionism

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.820
and competitive currency
devaluations,

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.600
imploding world trade
deepened the Great Depression

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.530
and caused massive economic,
financial, and social upheaval.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.270
Ultimately, these pressures
gave rise to nationalist

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.220
and populist movements and
eventually catastrophe.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.750
Emerging from the second
world war, the U.S.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.380
and some other 40 countries
gathered in Bretton Woods,

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.690
New Hampshire, and decided

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.590
to create the International
Monetary Fund

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.580
and the World Bank.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.370
They tasked the fund with
three critical missions,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.920
promoting international
monetary cooperation,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.250
supporting the expansion of
trade and economic growth,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.430
and discouraging policies
that would harm prosperity.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.520
It was revolutionary.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.070
It was visionary.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.370
And guess what?

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.670
It worked.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:19.250
From the very beginning, the IMF
held countries address major new

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.210
challenges through
collaboration.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.370
Complimenting the marshal plan,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.810
we at the IMF helped Europe
rebuild from the rubble of war.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.850
Our loans gave countries
breathing space

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.300
to stabilize their
economies in difficult time

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.700
and implement policies
to promote growth.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.890
It's a mission that we
continue to this day,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.380
as you may have recently seen in
countries like Argentina, Egypt,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.250
Ukraine and many others.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.120
The genius of the collaborative
system that they invented was

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.430
that it was designed
to adapt and change.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:07.410
And in the early '70s,
that change arrived.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.170
Some of you might remember
that speech, a landmark speech.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.440
The challenge of peace.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.700
President Nixon suspended the
U.S. dollars convertibility

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.000
into gold.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.870
And that decision
shocked the world

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.490
and forced a year-long
negotiation that led

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.480
to the modern floating
exchange rate structure,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.790
away from the fixed gold
reference structure moving

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.790
into floating exchange
rate structure.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.950
A system that is
still today in place

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.010
in many corners of the world.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.200
But at the time, some thought

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.310
that this particular change
would mean the end of the IMF.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.230
But all our members at the time,
including the United States knew

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.530
that the goal of stability

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.940
and prosperity extended well
beyond fixed exchange rates.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.250
They recognized the benefits

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.850
of a global financial
[inaudible] fighter

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.830
that could help countries
in times of need.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.880
They built on what worked,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.870
changed what did not,
and they adapted.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:22.600
And we moved on,
1973, the oil crisis.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.870
The IMF created new tools

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.280
to help countries facing
an energy emergency in line

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.210
with the funds role
to help smooth shocks

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.370
and prevent harmful spillovers.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:39.700
As a debt crisis hit lots
in America in the '80s,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.090
the IMF with creative
ideas and support

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.990
from the United States
stepped in to calm the waters.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.230
And after the fall
of the Berlin Wall,

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.880
we took on a new challenge,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.290
which was helping the former
Soviet Union block nations

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.630
transform themselves
from centrally planned

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.310
to free market economies.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.240
In the 1990s, the fund
assisted countries

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.030
in overcoming first
the Mexican peso crisis

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.220
and then the Asian
financial crisis.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.660
And throughout all
these challenges,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.820
we continue to help
countries around the world

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.120
with the economic fundamentals.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.400
Their fiscal, monetary,
and exchange rate policies

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.270
and with steps to build
stronger economic institutions.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.670
Because without that
macroeconomic stability growth

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.990
cannot prosper.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.060
These efforts enabled better
policies that opened markets,

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.910
bolstered trade, created jobs,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.300
and unleashed economic
potential.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:48.270
And then came 2008 and
the financial crisis,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.590
the global financial crisis.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:56.460
Most of the other crisis that
I have referred to applied

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.020
to particular regions.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.110
This one was the first of
a completely global nature.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.850
The ensuing great
recession reminded us

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:09.060
that international cooperation
was essential not optional

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.500
and as the French finance
minister at the time,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.730
I certainly was [inaudible]
in that exercise.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:20.900
All G20 nations and the Federal
Reserve took extraordinary steps

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.480
to save the system.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.240
As veterans when we
sort of come together,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.760
we just wonder how we did it?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.290
And how much we transgressed and
had to violate many principles

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.640
and rules and just reinvent.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.590
But at the time, the IMF
deployed its own fire power

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:49.140
committing over $500 billion to
help secure the global economy.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.720
And in the decade since
the 2008 financial crisis,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.120
we supported economic
programs in 90 countries

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.200
and adopted our lending
instruments,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.970
including zero interest loans,
to help low-income countries.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.260
But the global economy did
not only need liquidity

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.930
and stimulus, it also needed

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.100
to reform its financial
architecture.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.970
And we worked with
our membership

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.150
to build a stronger
financial sector

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.690
so that we could together
limit the consequences

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.670
of what will be one
day the next crisis.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.960
So we learned from the past.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.080
We got creative and we
changed for the better.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.810
And none of that -- none of
that would have been possible

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.090
without the United States.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.110
This country challenged the
international economy corridor

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.820
when it needed challenging.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.700
It forged compromise when
compromise was necessary.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.320
Why? Why did it do all that?

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.830
Benevolence?

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.670
It does so because a stronger

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:02.160
and more stable world paid
dividends for the United States.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.630
It enabled the U.S. to enjoy
some of the longest runs

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.570
of sustained economic growth
the modern world has ever known.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:17.890
Since that meeting at Bretton
Woods nearly 75 years ago real

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.850
U.S. GDP increased
by a factor of eight.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.650
And the average Americans
real income has quadrupled.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:33.260
And this success did not come
at the expense of other nations.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.810
On the contrary, this country's
collaborative leadership paved

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.260
the way, not only for decades
of opportunities here in America

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.970
but also for growth that
spread across the world.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.600
Now, today that landscape
is shifting again.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.940
And part of this change
is driven by geopolitics

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.460
and the shift in some economic
power from west to east.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.760
Part of it by the rise

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.990
of non state actors including
multi-national organizations

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.630
and corporates.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.620
Part of it is driven
by technology

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:21.420
and the rapid acceleration
of everything in our lives.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.820
As I'm sure you know,
Dr. Hayden,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.430
90 percent of the world's
data was created just

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.850
over the last two years.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:36.100
Now, I have to say as a daughter
of two classics professors,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.810
I know my parents
would have found

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.370
that very, very depressing.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.290
[Laughter].

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:47.150
But the truth is that everything
moves faster, information,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.570
money, disease, you name it.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.370
And this transformation can
bring enormous opportunities

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.770
but they can also
create massive risks.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.750
Why is that?

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.750
Because more than every before
at least as was demonstrated

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:10.260
in 2008, what happens one nation
is going to impact all nations.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.080
From weapons of mass
destruction to cybersecurity

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.410
to the interconnected
financial system,

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:21.000
many of our current
challenges recognize no borders.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.800
So when support

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.150
for international
cooperation falters,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.440
we must remember the
lessons the United States

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.680
and her allies taught the
world over the last 75 years.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.950
It's a big lesson.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.050
Solidarity is self interest.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:46.510
And that principle endures
in our changing world.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:52.040
Our challenge now is to
yet again adapt and reform.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.450
So I believe that
this year, 2019,

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.220
can be another turning
point in our journey.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.810
A moment when the world delivers
a new burst of creativity

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.130
in solving our shared
challenges.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.300
Actually there's something
up there that you can't see

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.550
but from which we
can draw inspiration.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.860
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.650
But it's something like,
they build too low those

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.130
who build beneath the stars.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.800
It's written up there.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.510
Imagine what the world
could be if we were

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.270
to build beneath the
stars, the [inaudible],

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.120
as I call it, or
the age of anger.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.940
Let's imagine the age of anger.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:47.990
By 2040, inequality could exceed
the levels of the gilded age.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.680
Strong tech monopolice
and weak governments

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.330
with ineffective domestic
policies could make it

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.110
impossible for start ups and
entrepreneurs to succeed.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:03.330
Health breakthroughs could allow
the richest to live past 120,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.400
while millions of
others would suffer

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.280
from extreme poverty
and disease.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.140
Social media would bombard
the left behind population

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.930
and [inaudible] the disparity
between their reality

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.750
and the possibility
of a better life

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:23.910
and the aspiration gap would
fuel resentment and anger.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.840
Trust between nations
would break down.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.960
The world would be more
interconnected digitally

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.060
but less connected
in every other way.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.880
International cooperation
for the benefit

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.840
of all would be a concept
best studied in libraries,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.790
like this one, but rarely
practiced on the world stage due

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.250
to the supremacy of
national interest

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.220
and a singular focus
on domestic policies.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.200
To borrow from Dr. Kissinger's
world order we might be,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.750
I quote, "facing a period

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.020
in which forces beyond
the restraints

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.920
of any order determine
the future."

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.300
That is a very dystopian
scenario.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.280
Isn't it? Not one that we
designed and certainly not one

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.180
that I believe can, and
should be, our destiny.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.810
Neither does Dr.
Kissinger, for that matter.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.220
We have overcome
existential threats before

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.290
and we can do so again.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.960
Think of the world.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.810
If we make 2019 the start
of a different kind of A-I.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.530
Everybody thinks, oh,
she's going to talk

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.400
about artificial intelligence.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.970
No. Age of ingenuity.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:51.100
This would be a future fueled
by creativity and cooperation.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.490
Okay, 2040.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.670
I'm in a new scenario now.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.900
We would see flourishing
economies predominantly running

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.840
on renewable energy.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.170
Women would be fully empowered
in the workforce proving

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.950
to be an economic and
social game changer.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.250
New pension systems

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.800
and healthcare portability would
reflect the changing nature

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.500
of work in the digital economy.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.060
Corporation would embrace
social responsibility as part

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.020
of their business model
because they would be rated

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.850
on that basis as well.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.770
Technology called
wizardry could save lives

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.280
and create millions of jobs.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.920
We would see an end to mass
migration, trade would expand

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.540
across the world and
peaceful coexistence

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.700
between nations would prevail.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.120
Am I being too optimistic?

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.430
Of course.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.730
You know the difference between
the optimist and the pessimist?

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.990
They're both wrong but
the optimist is happier.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.700
[Laughter].

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.820
So I have to be optimistic.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.700
Because I'm thinking about the
world my grown children will

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.420
enter it.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:07.870
But it presents us with a
fundamental choice, stand still

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.940
and watch discord and discontent
bubble over into conflict.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.900
Or, move forward, reimagine
the way nations work together

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.490
and build prosperity and peace.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.800
Okay, nice words.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.170
What does it mean in practice?

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.200
It means countries working
together to put people,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.730
all people, at the
center of all our efforts.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.770
Focusing on real results
to improve their lives.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.070
It also means governments

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.390
and institutions being more
transparent and accountable,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.590
which includes listening
to more diverse voices.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.690
It means ensuring
that economic benefits

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:55.350
of globalizations are shared
by many, not just a few.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.260
I call that the new
multilateralism

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.560
[assumed spelling].

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.860
You might just call
it common sense,

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.700
if that word suits you better.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.870
But let me be very clear here.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.620
Good international cooperation
is never going to substitute

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.070
for good domestic policy.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.440
And of course, individual
countries have the

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.240
responsibility for the well
being of their citizens.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.080
In fact, strong domestic
policies can form the foundation

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.340
for effective international
cooperation

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.820
and in our modern world,
there are some issues

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.940
that can only be addressed

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.170
through international
cooperation.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:38.580
I want to discuss
four such issues.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.300
I promise I'll be brief
on each of the four.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.400
But I think they're
all important.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.440
And to be successful in
delivering on those four,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.200
we will need creativity and
we will need cooperation.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.940
Let me start with
those -- the first one.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.130
First one is trade.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.120
I've been saying
for some time now

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.310
that we need to fix the system.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.070
More recently, I've
been urging countries

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.210
to actually de-escalate
trade [inaudible].

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.450
And it was encouraging to see

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.130
over the weekend
some progress made

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.830
at the G20 meeting
in Buenos Aires.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.160
And we must continue
the de-escalation while

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.620
at the some time improving the
trading system for the future.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:31.280
That would include eliminating
distortionary subsidies,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.930
whichever form or
color they take,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.170
but agreeing on what they are.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.880
It would also mean protecting
intellectual properties rights

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:46.290
without stifling innovation and
getting rid of economic grants.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.300
New trade agreements could
unleash the potential

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.980
of e-commerce and
trade in services.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.160
And all of this is critical.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.970
Not for the sake of trade,

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.590
although Montesquieu
would argue with me.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.500
And he would say, where there
is trade there is good manners.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.860
Is he right?

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.990
Montesquieu is always right.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.560
No, it's critical because
trade lifts productivity.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.210
Trade accelerates innovation.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.810
And we need both.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.830
Second issue where we
need more cooperation is

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.750
international taxation.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.030
Companies now have
world-wide presence,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.330
even when they're small.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.430
In the old days,
you had to be one

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.520
of those top guns
to be international.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.080
Now, very small companies can
be very international companies.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.150
But governments have
not figured, yet,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.420
a world wide answer to tax.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.710
And right now, too many
tax dollars are left

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.010
on the table thanks
to tax optimization

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.250
and the bad kind of creativity.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.710
So countries need to
work closely together

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.030
to collect what is
owed, where it's owed,

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.410
and avoid a race
tax to the bottom.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.180
They can close the
loopholes that lead

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.250
to what is called base
erosion and profit shifting.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.010
We are working with our partners

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.520
so that our members can
share best practices

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.450
and devise regulation
for digital economy

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:29.600
in which many companies have
no single established based

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.720
of operation, and
yet they do operate.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.850
Why do we need this?

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.000
Why do we need revenue?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.170
Because all countries should
be investing in their future.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.690
And public and private funding
working together can strengthen

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:50.180
infrastructure, improve
education, and prepare all of us

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.920
to adjust to the
technical transformations

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.610
of at our doorsteps.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.810
When the return on
those investments is

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.030
so far away it's very unlikely

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.310
that private sector alone
will actually invest.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.940
My third issue is our climate.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.620
From the recent major
hurricanes in the Caribbean

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.360
to the wild fires in California
to the sinking islands

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.900
of the Pacific, the
dangerous effects

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.190
of climate change are becoming
more tangible by the day.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.600
A new U.S. government study
shows that the economic impact

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.890
from climate change could
significantly reduce America's

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.650
GDP in the coming decades.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.800
The collaborative
agreement reached in Paris

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.290
in 2015 is probably the
best toolbox that we have

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.070
to start fixing the
planetary challenge

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.180
and move towards
zero carbon economy.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.510
It also reflects some of
the ideas that I've tried

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:50.120
to highlight tonight,
creativity, visionary thinking,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.090
and a global commitment
to the common good

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.410
that serves self interest.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.100
This is as much of survival
for future generations.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:06.810
Now I've mentioned three
issues, trade, tax, and climate.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.940
And each of them is worthy of
their own Kissinger lecture.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.710
But there is one issue that
I believe is the bedrock

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.300
for progress nearly
everywhere else.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.720
And that is why the fourth
and final area I want

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.950
to discuss is good governance,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.450
free from the shackles
of corruption.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.810
The simple fact is that without
confidence in our institutions,

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.380
none of the change we
seek will be possible.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.740
So let me focus on that briefly.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.130
It's my four and last key point.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.680
Why is corruption so corrosive?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.120
Because when people start people
the economy no longer works

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.080
for them, society no
longer works for them,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.310
they start disconnecting
from economy

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.340
and disconnecting from society.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.570
Corruption saps economic
vitality

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.050
and siphons off desperately
need resources.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.710
The money that is diverted
from education and health,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.360
perpetuates inequality

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.080
and limits the possibility
of a better life.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.330
Do you know what the annual
cost of bribery alone,

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.350
and corruption is more than
just bribery, but the cost

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.060
of bribery every year is 1.5 --

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.550
is estimated to be
at $1.5 trillion.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.690
That's roughly 2
percent of global GDP.

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:30.940
Millennials feel
the problem acutely.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.110
A recent survey of
global youth revealed

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.790
that young people identify
corruption, not jobs,

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.210
not better education,
but corruption

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.540
as the most pressing concern
in their own countries.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.140
There is wisdom in this insight.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.440
Because corruption is
the root cause of many

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.710
of economic injustices that many

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.670
of these young men
and women are facing.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.900
And that is why,
with the support

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.910
of our entire membership
we are going

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.540
to scrutinize [inaudible]
the impact of corruption

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.330
on a country's macroeconomic
health.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.720
So far we've done quite a bit
of work on anti-money laundering

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.570
and combating the
financing of terrorism.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.870
We've done that.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.260
We had 110 of our
country members.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.490
But it's only a small part of
the wider work that is needed

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.770
to promote good governance.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.830
Investing in institution
is indispensable

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.770
as is indispensable
[inaudible] to verify

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:30.690
that those institutions
actually deliver.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:36.030
Because likewise,
corruption knows no border.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.980
Think for a second, how Phintec
[assumed spelling] is changing

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.900
the economic game.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.820
New innovations including
cryptocurrencies,

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.110
crypto-assets can be
used by cybercriminals

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.330
to funnel illicit
financial flows

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.930
and fund illegal activities
on a worldwide basis.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.900
This is not one nation's problem

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.850
or within one nation's
power to resolve.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:06.430
It can only be fixed through
cross border collaboration.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.230
But it is fixable.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.820
Because the same innovations

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.120
that create cross border
challenges can also be used

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.410
to help us fight back
through biometrics,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.770
block chain, and more.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.920
We can find creative
ways to build a better,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.060
safer system for the long term.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.640
Governments can and must work
with the world's best engineers

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.290
to build stronger
cybersecurity systems

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.200
that protect people's bank
account, their well being,

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.220
and even their hotel booking.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:43.680
This is common good that
we must choose to support.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.140
And if we take -- if we take
the challenge of corruption

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:54.100
as the model of cooperation
that we can actually implement,

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:59.650
it can be a model for the
other topics that I mentioned.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.340
It can be the sign that
the brotherhood of man,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.110
as Keynes called it,
is ready once again

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.860
to meet the call of history.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:16.510
Except, by the way, that this
time women will play a role.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:26.220
[ Applause ]

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.710
You should have seen
the photo of those

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.400
who created Bretton
Woods in 1944.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.070
Forty-four men.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.370
Full stop.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.490
So I think it's by doing

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.580
that that we can
start restoring trust,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.850
which is probably the
most precious and most

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.770
in demand commodity
in our society.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.460
And this is how we begin to
adapt once more and reimagine

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.420
that international
cooperation that we need.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.080
Now before I conclude, we
have one more thing to do.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.060
I began my remark by mentioning

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.220
that December 4th was
an important date.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.910
Now, there's one person
who is not allowed

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.760
to answer that question.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.090
That's Mrs. Harmon,
who is the president

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.750
of the Woodrow Wilson Center.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:22.970
Because on December 4,
1918, exactly 100 years ago

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:27.790
to this day, President Woodrow
Wilson set sail for France

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.110
to help negotiate what he
hoped would be a lasting peace.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.860
He became the first U.S. --

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.120
the first sitting U.S.
President to travel to Europe.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.130
And in some way -- some ways,
we can trace the origins

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.870
of modern creativity
and visionary thinking

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.870
in U.S. foreign policy
to this date.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.590
It's also a humbling reminder

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:56.240
that our plans do not
always work out as intended.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:01.680
But it is also a signal that we
must try and try and try again.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.410
We must build on what
worked, change what does not,

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.580
and continually evolve, improve,

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.490
imagine a better
future for all people.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.460
It was the vision that inspired
the leaders of this country

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.380
and it must be the mission that
will guide us in the days ahead.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.180
Thank you, very much.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:39.850
[ Applause ]

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.970
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank
you, Madame Lagarde.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.670
And without further delay I
want to welcome to the stage,

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.230
please join me in welcoming
to the stage Margaret Brennan,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.510
the moderator of
CBS Face the Nation.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.300
[ Applause ]

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.600
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Thanks to all of you

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.590
and what a gorgeous venue
to have this conversation.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.250
I'm privileged to have it today.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.780
You know, your introduction,
you were --

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.570
it was pointed out that
you were named one --

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.400
the third most powerful, I
believe, between Theresa May

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.140
and Chancellor Merkel in
terms of most powerful women.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.700
But I think the correction
that needs to be made is

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.400
that you're actually one of
the most powerful individuals

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.990
in the world, in terms of
some of the work you have done

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.080
to stabilize the global economy.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.530
And that's why, I think,
you laying out your vision

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.800
as you had, there are a
lot of things that we want

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.960
to sort of break apart here.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.990
Let's start off with
what's happening today.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.430
You're seeing recession
fears come out once again.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.360
It was a bad day in the markets.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.000
There are some who looked
at what happened at the G20

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.260
and said, there wasn't progress.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.510
You said you saw some.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.170
How do you define some progress?

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.090
Where's the hope
that you're seeing?

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.820
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Well,
I might be a little bit bias

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.650
because I was also attending
previously the G7 leaders

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.630
meeting in Canada and
then the APEC meeting

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.140
in Papua, New Guinea.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.860
And at the G7 there was
a reneged communicate

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.240
and at the APEC meeting there
was just no communicate.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.340
People could not
agree on anything.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:29.170
So the fact that leaders agreed
on a set of principles, issues,

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.980
points -- the fact
that there was

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.740
that was in a way reassuring.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.860
So that's -- not any agreement.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.450
I think it was probably not
as strong as some expected it

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.660
but it really touched
on many critical issues.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.240
The language was not exactly
according to, sort of,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.040
the example of communicate
drafting.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.040
But there was, you know,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.380
positive news coming
out of that.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.580
There was clearly a
consensus around the fact

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.760
that trade was critically
important.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.600
Trade had to be conducted
according to rules set

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.490
by an institution, the WTO
that had to be reformed.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:15.320
It was a clear agreement on
the principle of reforms,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.300
how it will be reformed is
going to be another matter and,

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.600
I think, it's not going
to take a few weeks

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.490
but probably more
months than weeks.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:30.640
There was willingness to
engage on the part of all.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:37.470
And Saturday night was
not such a bad outcome.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.770
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
You mean, in the meeting

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.070
between Xi Jinping
and President?

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.370
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.670
Yes.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:43.970
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Ninety days?

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.150
Is that enough to come to
sort of trade agreement

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.530
between the two largest
economies in the world?

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:52.220
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Oh, I'm
not sure that's, you know,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.650
the objective is
a trade agreement.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.320
But if at least there
was significant progress

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.720
and a framework under which
they agreed to move forward

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.850
and to address some of
the key issues, I --

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.500
you know, I think what's
clearly important is to come

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.770
to an understanding
on both sides,

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:15.810
to agree on some key principles,
to have definitions of,

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.680
you know, what is a subsidy?

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.360
What warrants intellectual
property right of protection?

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.690
And what is a state
owned enterprise?

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.110
And so on and so forth.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.890
So it is complicated.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.380
And it is going to take time.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.790
But the willingness of these
two presidents to move forward

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.060
and to agree to discuss
those issues, I think,

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.960
is compared with what we have
just gone through is progress.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.260
Yes.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.560
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: So the
nervousness that we're seeing

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.380
in the markets, you're
saying, look, they're talking.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.680
It is a positive.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.980
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes, yes.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.590
And, you know, we
can't just react

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:58.820
on a daily market variations.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.160
These things take time.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.700
Markets get jittery and
react sort of off the cuff

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.900
on the news of the day.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.330
But I think those are
much longer term issues

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:16.300
that warrant time, thinking,
considerations, and you know,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.980
it's also a clear shift
that we are seeing,

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.580
which is being acknowledged.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:27.040
And will turn into, I
hope, some resolution.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.910
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: I
think it was in listening

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.070
to you sketch out, going back to
Bretton Woods, to the present,

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.950
I think it's a good
reminder to many people

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.990
that the U.S. was part and
parcel of creating many

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.630
of these international
institutions because now they,

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:46.180
in our daily political life,
are described or at least felt,

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.990
perceived by some, to be
against U.S. interests.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:55.010
That is how some of the more
popular rhetoric has described

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.630
institutions like yours.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:03.150
Today, in Europe, the Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo listed all

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:07.610
of what he felt were the flaws
of international organizations

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:10.270
and saying that even the IMF
has sort of failed to live

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.910
up to what it was meant to do,
which was to rebuild Europe.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.480
He said now austerity measures,
the things that are doing,

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.630
are actually hurting the
world, not helping it.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.370
What did you make of his speech?

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.670
And that description?

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:25.970
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
Well, first of all,

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.270
I did not read his
entire speech.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.690
I saw bits and pieces
picked up and, you know,

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:34.050
I will very carefully
read his speech.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.590
But, you know, I've heard
this austerity comment made

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.890
in many instances.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:41.190
And --

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:47.010
When we are called upon
to help a country that is

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:52.150
in very dear financial
difficulties,

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.800
we have to restore stability.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.670
We have to restore
public finance discipline.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:07.540
We have to empower the
authorities with financing.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.930
That's one thing that we do.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:15.020
But we are also an instrument
of macroeconomic sanity.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.730
Because if we're
called upon to act,

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.360
it's because there
was mismanagement.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.920
There was poor public
finance organization.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.990
There was poor monetary policy.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.140
For multiple reasons, the
situation was not in order.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:33.840
And we're trying not to bring
austerity but to bring order.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.770
So that's number one.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:40.030
Number two, if we did
not come in to help,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.870
the situation would
be even worse.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.450
Because what happens is when
a country calls for help,

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:50.570
we come in, we do expect
that public finances will be,

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:54.940
you know, re-disciplined,
reorganized,

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.310
and that stability will result.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:00.470
At which point, investors
come in and say, okay,

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.290
now the situation is stabilized.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.380
We can come back in
and we can invest.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.000
So if we did not do that
they simply would not come

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.870
in at that point.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:17.120
So I think it's -- we're not the
merchant of austerity, per se,

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.380
we are merchant of trust in
the stability of a system

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.870
that is needed in order
to attract investors,

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:31.030
generate growth, and, you
know, entail creation of jobs.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.470
And that's -- we are
the enablers of that.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.350
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You
called out for a kind

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.370
of collaborative
leadership, particularly

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.410
from the United States.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:44.890
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Because
that is what has worked.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:48.380
You know, when I look back
and I consider the history

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.720
of the United States role, it's
involvement, what has worked,

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.230
how has it worked for
this country and others.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:01.050
That collaboration has
proven extremely efficient.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.350
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Well, the Secretary

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.530
of State today said the
administration is working

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:11.790
to refocus the IMF and WTO
to promote more prosperity,

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.090
halt lending tenations
[assumed spelling]

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.130
that can already access
global capital market

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.980
and reduce taxpayer
handouts to development banks

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.710
that could raise
capital on their own.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.010
That's his vision.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:24.250
That's the vision that he
describes the U.S. should be

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.550
implementing right now.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.260
What do you make
of that proposal?

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.230
Because it was delivered
in Brussels,

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.360
and it ruffled a few feathers.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.820
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Well,
you know, on the point

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.860
of making sure that
private capital can invest,

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.800
that's exactly what we do.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.180
It is because private capital
has completely lost interest

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.790
in certain countries.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.460
You know, when I look at the
three that I've mentioned,

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.440
Egypt, Ukraine, Argentina.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.910
Why did we come in?

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:54.540
because nobody else
wanted to come in.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.780
Because there was not a single
investor who was prepared

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.280
to take the risk of going
in because the situation was

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.050
in disorder, because
public finances were not

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.350
properly managed.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.650
Because there were
external factors

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.300
that created massive
instability.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.660
So we come in and we
enable the country

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.980
to become attractive again.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.760
So it's not as if
we were a substitute

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.910
to private sector
investors -- investment.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.330
We are the facilitators
of that investment.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.060
Because otherwise
they won't come.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.380
They simply won't come.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.680
Too risky for them.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.970
Once they know that we are
involved, it means that we put

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.110
in place, you know,
debt sustainability.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.820
If restructuring is
needed, we ask for it.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:41.260
If new monetary policy needs to
be implemented, we recommend it

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:46.580
and it's implemented, with
some success, I dare say.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:52.130
So I'm not sure that he
understands very clearly what is

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.490
-- well, our mission
is prosperity.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:59.520
And yes, this is what the
initial founders actually tasked

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.010
us to do and that's
what we need to do.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.750
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: So these
descriptions of the vision

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.670
and the leadership that
America's providing

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:12.600
on this front, for you it is not
achieving what you were saying

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.130
is needed to meet the crisis,
right now, that you see.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:17.900
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
I was curious

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.200
about the taxpayers' money.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.200
Because you know, the --

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.380
we've actually always
paid back and more.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.690
So over the course of time,

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.460
the United States has actually
made quite a bit of money

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.120
out of the IMF involvement
in countries.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.500
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You think
there's just a fundamental

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.260
misunderstanding or
are there portions

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.700
of truth to these criticisms?

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.000
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Well,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.110
the fact that growth must
be generated as a result

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.440
of our involvement is something
that I completely agree with.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.900
It doesn't come overnight.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.710
Because you need to, you
know, restore the situation.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.170
You need to sort
out public finance.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:58.150
You need to reorganize
sometimes, you know,

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.700
through structural
reforms, the economy.

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.910
But growth ultimately
comes back.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:06.530
When I look at -- I'll tell
you, as French finance minister,

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.890
we had to deal with some
difficult cases in Europe.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.290
But when I look at a country
like Portugal, the involvement

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.670
of the IMF was critical in
turning the situation around

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.550
and sorting out quite
a few difficult issues.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.920
Portugal is now doing
pretty well compared

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.510
with other European countries.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.490
When I look at Ireland,
Ireland is thriving.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:29.100
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: These
are countries that needed --

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.670
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Those are
countries where we had to come

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.770
in as the IMF, we had to put

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:36.530
in place significant
lending programs.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.190
And we expected serious
measures to be taken

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.630
on the physical front, because
there was too much fiscal

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:46.590
deficit, and because the
-- in the case of Ireland,

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.620
because the banking system
was completely out of control

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.200
and had gone way too far into
expanding beyond the country.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:59.620
So you know, these programs
have clearly generated a growth.

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.280
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: When you
use that phrase, you know,

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.040
describing, we could
live in an age of anger.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.910
You're putting a timeline
out, decades from now.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.670
If you look at some
of the forces,

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.610
not just in the United
States, that contributed

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.020
to making trade a very
contentious issue during the

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.180
2016 campaign, on the
left and on the right,

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.960
but also what you're
seeing in Europe,

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.590
in your home country
of France right now.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:28.940
Protests around the economy
and specifically the gas tax.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.530
I won't get into President
Trump's tweet about it tonight.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.090
But generally speaking,

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.150
aren't you seeing
those forces of anger.

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:40.510
I mean, you're seeing more
populace governments come

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:45.390
to power or at least use the
economy and anti-insti --

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.730
anti-multilateral
institutional rhetoric

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:50.870
in a lot of places right now.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:52.170
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.470
That is --

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.770
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: Are we in
that age that you're describing?

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.070
I mean, where are
we as the time --

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.220
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: We
are at risk of slipping

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.200
into that kind of age of anger.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.030
Which is why it is
critically important

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.060
to actually address
those issues.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:11.290
As I was trying to explain in
my remarks, those are not issues

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.710
that can be addressed
purely domestically.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.860
Some of them have to be
addressed domestically.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.700
But when it comes to trade,
to tax, to climate change,

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.940
to cybersecurity, to
corruption it has to be

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.510
on an international
cooperation basis, as well.

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:32.230
They come together.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:35.630
But, yes, there has to be
a response to those issues

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:40.590
because many people are not
satisfied with their income,

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.840
are not satisfied with their
future, have this anxiety

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.130
of what the future holds
for their children and it --

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:51.090
all these concerns
need to be addressed.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.540
Need to be addressed
by societies at large.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.210
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: The
challenge there is that lack

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.750
of trust in the institutions
that are tasked with this

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.270
or have been tasked with this.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.570
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:05.870
Yes.

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.170
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
You mentioned your time

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.470
when you were Minister
of Finance in France,

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.770
and clearly one of the most
difficult time periods you could

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.070
have that job.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.930
And I remember from covering
it, that famous story

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:19.570
of you speaking to then
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.470
and advising him against
allowing Lehman Brothers

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:23.770
to go under.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:25.070
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.450
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You
foresaw the domino affect.

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:31.440
Did you see -- did
you draw a line

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.910
between what you predicted
then and where we are now?

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.940
Is that where this shift
began, that you're laying out?

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.310
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.520
I certainly did not
anticipate that at the time.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.280
But looking back, yes, I
think that there is a lot

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.380
in today's anger, resentment,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.230
frustration that is
actually attributable

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.270
to the legacy of the crisis.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:59.860
I think that we did a
reasonably good job in trying

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.780
to strengthen the
financial system,

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.800
avoid that people actually
lose all their savings,

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.610
and that there be bank runs
all over those countries.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:15.040
But, I think, the fact that
we addressed the issues

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.560
of institutions, of the
financial system at large,

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.780
without doing probably
enough explanation

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.850
as what it meant for people.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:28.300
And the fact that many involved

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:36.800
in those financial deals
got away with it and managed

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.000
to reestablish themselves,
I think,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.120
created a sense of impunity.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.600
In other words, some
of the lower,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.970
middle class people
thinking to themselves, okay,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.790
I've lost my job,
I've lost my house.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.310
And those people,
what have they lost?

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.610
Their bonus?

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.990
Yes. But that's about it.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.300
And they reestablished
themselves.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:02.060
So I think this is not at the
root of and the only component

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.710
of the frustration and
the anger that we see,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.970
but it certainly
participates and fueling it.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.530
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: So how --

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:12.830
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
That's what I call the sort

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.050
of untold story of the
legacy of the crisis.

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:18.410
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: So how
do you address that then?

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:21.340
If that age of anger
is simmering.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.640
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
I think it's, you know,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.710
in a way it's too late
to go back to things

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.440
that should have taken
place at that time.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.860
But we also have the possibility
with new technologies,

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:35.270
a digital age, that is clearly
in the making at the moment

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:40.060
and at an accelerated pace,
to organize it in such a way

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.020
that it is transparent,
that it is accountable,

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.210
that it includes people,
that they are brought in to

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:50.530
that digital picture by being
properly trained, educated,

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:55.060
skilled and that they don't
feel there's emasculation

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:59.180
that you have when something is
so alien to you, and so foreign

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.910
to you that yet again you
feel that anger about it.

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:06.800
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You
want another Bretton Woods

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.320
type summit?

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.910
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: There's so
many groups that are thinking,

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.700
oh, let's have another
Bretton Woods.

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.570
Let's just reform.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:15.870
I think it's --

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:17.520
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Who leads this?

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.100
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Oh, there
are multiple leaders everywhere.

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.530
You know. They don't have
to do the job of, you know,

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:26.470
giving advice, drafting and
preparing those programs,

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.010
and providing technical
assistance around the globe

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:31.470
to have an 89 countries.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:35.370
But the beauty of
the institution

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:40.680
that I have the privilege to
lead, is that in its articles,

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.170
in its foundations,
are the seeds

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.640
for constant transformation.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.340
What is changing
massively around it calls

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.390
for probably a different
approach.

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:58.650
I think, that the digital
economy in which we are moving,

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:00.770
which is transforming
the financial sector,

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:06.690
which is transforming
the existing relationship

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:14.180
between value and monetary cost,
all that needs new thinking.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.700
I think it's more new
thinking than a reform

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.420
of the Bretton Woods system.

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.520
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: I know
the IMF has written on this

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.980
and talked about demand for
cash decreasing and, you know,

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.120
money itself is changing,

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.790
not just how we think
and talk about this.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:34.400
You mentioned Phintec in that
context, financial technologies

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.330
and all the various forms of it.

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:41.450
I mean, where there
are advantages

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:44.260
and there are disadvantages,
these days it seems

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:49.700
to be not very well understood,
even by the public at large.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.180
How much more of this needs
to be led, not by the IMF

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.930
or these organizations, but
coming from the corporate world?

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.180
Coming from Silicon Valley?

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.880
You have these hearings on
Capital Hill and the joke is,

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.100
you know, you have these CEOs
come up and answer questions

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.910
and the individuals asking
them don't even know how

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.780
to use the websites that
they're talking about.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.990
You know, I mean, how do you
regulate cryptocurrencies?

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:16.510
How do you talk about
all of this in a way

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.590
that actually leads to some
kind of regulation or reform?

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.050
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
Well, first of all,

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:24.680
I don't think it should be
entirely left in the hands

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.710
of those corporate
sector representatives

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:32.590
or their legal departments
or their public affairs.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.700
Because they are dealing
with a common good.

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.260
They're dealing with
your privacy.

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.990
They're dealing with your data.

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:41.660
And they're dealing
with your freedom.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.960
So --

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.630
So governmental authorities,

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.790
Parliamentarians
have to be involved.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.850
And they have to be held
along the way for those

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:55.440
who are not computer literate,

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.450
for those who feel
completely alien

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.980
to this digital transformation.

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.910
They have to be held by --
including my people like us,

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.390
the IMF, in relation to
financial technologies.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:12.010
Because, you know, we try
to grasp what it means,

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:15.000
how its formed, how those
technologies are used

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.830
to shorten the circuits
to enable payments

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.810
and to include people that
we're not including --

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:26.520
not included in the banking
sector, for instance.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.050
So it is a public
responsibility.

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:34.200
And it has to be done, again, in
cooperation with those engineers

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.010
and in cooperation with those
who understand the future

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:40.150
of data protection, who
understands, you know,

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:44.060
how cloud will eventually
be accessible

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.100
or be raidable and hackable.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.370
So there are many technicalities
that you don't master,

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.320
that I don't master either.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.970
But, you know, having
enough knowledge

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.690
to understand the key
principles that need

01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:01.120
to be respected is something, I
believe, fall on the shoulders

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.990
of Parliamentarians and
members of government

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.630
because they today
have the responsibility

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.140
to represent the people.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.930
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You've
also issued a number of calls

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.080
for some of those
parliamentarians to get rid

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.780
of the legal obstacles
to inclusion of women.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.080
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.380
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
In the economy.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.680
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.980
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Where does that begin?

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.280
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: It
very often begins at home.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.440
Of the 189 countries that are
members of the institution,

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.390
about 90 percent still
have in their constitution

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:35.730
or in the legal system
discrimination against women,

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:44.610
barriers to the participation in
the economy, to the inheritance

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:50.790
when parents die, to
the owning a business

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.400
to the opening bank account,
to be able to bring collateral

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.590
when they try to have a loan.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.650
So I think that's where
the work has to begin.

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.070
And we have demonstrated
in many countries,

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.470
or observed in many
countries such as, you know,

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:06.830
some Latin American
countries like Peru,

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:08.740
some African countries, as well.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.990
That when those changes happen,
it actually has consequences

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:17.930
on the economy and it pushes
growth and it enables women

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:23.190
to become better
integrated into the economy.

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.610
But it's not only that.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.540
It begins there because there
should not be legal barriers

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:33.660
and legal constraints imposed by
governments that prevent women

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.950
from playing their
role in the economy.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.100
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: How much
of an economic benefit is there?

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.400
How do you quantify --

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.700
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Huge.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.000
It's huge.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.300
I mean, it varies
from, you know,

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.600
if you look at the
Nordic countries.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.180
You know, Norway being clearly
one of the best performers.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.100
Finland being very
good, as well.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.170
But from those countries to
say, India, Saudi Arabia,

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.140
you can have an increase in
the economy, which varies

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.760
from 3 percent to 27 percent.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.380
So that's nothing
to be, you know,

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.500
sort of turning your eyes away.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.920
It's pretty big.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.470
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Why the resistance?

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:10.770
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Ha.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.070
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: If you can
make the argument on numbers,

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.590
why is there is such resistance?

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.900
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: I think
you're talking about something

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:20.530
that goes much, much deeper
into culture, into psyche,

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:26.100
into the way in which
societies have been built

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.400
over the course of time.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.700
You're also talking
about the divide

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.790
between urban centers
and rural areas.

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:36.190
You know, India is a case
in point, where clearly

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:40.950
in rural areas, in
particular, women are prevented

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:46.110
from joining the flow from being
economic partners and sometimes

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:49.220
from having access
to sanitation.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.550
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Bigger picture.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:53.610
I know we're running
out of time here.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:56.710
I would be remis if I
didn't ask you about Brexit.

01:03:56.710 --> 01:04:02.340
And what this -- we're talking
about the forces sort of pulling

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.870
at the global order right now.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.440
It's -- that's a rejection

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:12.900
of international organizations
and solidarity there.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.820
Add that in to what you're
seeing here in the U.S. as well,

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.330
in terms of that
kind of rejection.

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:22.220
I mean, it sounds like you're
trying to swim upstream.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.520
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde:
You know, first of all,

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.270
I think that the situation
has changed and is changing

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:30.540
in the U.K. When I look at the
latest polls that was produced,

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:36.050
the shift is now into a
majority of those polled.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:40.030
Now, you can turn surveys and
polls whichever way you want.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:44.320
But it seems that
there are more Brits

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.490
who would rather
remain than exit.

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:49.500
Sad. Number one.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.740
Number two, I think a lot of
the campaign that took place

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.830
at the time, two years ago
now, was geared towards,

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:03.270
watch out the foreigners
are going to take, you know,

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:08.020
your meal away and
they're going to have --

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.040
they're going to go first
in the health benefits

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.820
and healthcare system.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.100
And they're going to take jobs.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.660
And it was the fear
of the foreigners.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.310
And fortunately,
from within Europe.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:26.660
And it was directed at people
from Poland, from Bulgaria,

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:29.320
from Romania, who by the way,

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.830
have been extremely
well integrated

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:36.410
in say the German economy,
as was demonstrated recently,

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:39.450
in a country that needed
additional skilled labor.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:44.720
So that fear factor that was
raised during the campaign may

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.280
have completely missed
the opportunity

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.430
that that particular flow of
migration actually produced

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.690
in an economy next
door, which was Germany.

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.530
So that's a little
bit beside the point.

01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.830
But --

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:08.270
I think there is regret in
many, many European corners.

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:10.740
I think there is more
regret in the U.K

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.910
than there was only
six months ago.

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:16.590
And I think there is
now, the realization

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:22.430
that there will be more
loss as a result of Brexit

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:26.710
than was ever mentioned,
described, accounted for,

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.160
by those who campaigned
for the Brexit.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.120
I can say that with
relative confidence

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.070
because when we produced the
article for, for the U.K.,

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:40.730
which is the annual audit
that we do of all economies,

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:46.650
we did actually gave -- we did
give at the time three scenarios

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:50.570
of Brexit, one of which was the
baseline, which was pretty much

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:53.070
in line with what
everybody assumed.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.970
But another one which was
a [inaudible] scenario

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.170
which is very close
to some of the numbers

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:58.600
that we are seeing now.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.300
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
The dark scenario?

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.040
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: In
terms of forecast coming up.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:08.090
In case of a Brexit development
and in case of a no-deal Brexit,

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:11.300
which is what we had considered.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.600
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: Is that
a warning to brace ourselves?

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.170
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: I think
it was a very clear, you know,

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.860
assessment of what the
consequences would be

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.950
as a result of a no-deal Brexit
scenario, where the terms

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:28.800
of trade between the U.K.
and its main economic

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.730
and trade partner, which is the
European Union would be done

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:37.230
under the WTO rules with
no additional sweetener

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.000
to WTO rules.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.300
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: Wow.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.590
The dark scenario, is a
scary phrase to end on.

01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.490
But, unfortunately,
I'm told that we are --

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:46.790
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Oh, no.

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.100
But you know there was something
very interesting today,

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.770
which is the attorney
general opinion delivered

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.640
to the European Court
of Justice.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.550
So for those like me who would
very much like to keep the U.K.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:08:00.030
within the European Union,
there is apparently a perfectly,

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:03.180
legally acceptable way
to revoke the article 50,

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.530
which is the provision under
which the U.K. pulled out.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:09.590
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: You think
that's a viable scenario?

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:10.890
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: It's
-- at least it's legal.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:12.380
I'm a reformed lawyer.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.560
[ Laughter ]

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.940
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: I
think this is the optimist

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.370
that you described yourself as.

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:18.670
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Yes, yes.

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:19.970
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan: Thank
you so much, Madame Lagarde.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.270
&gt;&gt; Christine Lagarde: Thank you.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.070
&gt;&gt; Margaret Brennan:
Thanks all of you.

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:26.170
