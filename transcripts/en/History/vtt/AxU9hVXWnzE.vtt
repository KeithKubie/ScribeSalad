This is where all

My forge is pretty much,

I don't have
any fancy equipment,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.080
no power hammers, no presses.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.580

with my heat treat oven
this morning.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.750
It wasn't getting
up to temperature.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.580
So I had to go source
a new one

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.880
and ran out and bought that
this morning

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.170

I used to be a big-time gamer
