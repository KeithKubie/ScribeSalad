00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.490
Dark matter is one of the biggest mysteries
of astronomy today.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.710
There’s tons of evidence that it’s there,
but try as we might we haven’t been able

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.710
to find it.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.890
In biology there’s a similar problem: dark
DNA.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.680
When scientists were exploring the sequenced
genomes of certain birds and rodents they

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.289
noticed something odd.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.880
A sequenced genome means everything is laid
bare, and yet certain DNA sequences were missing,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.320
which was weird because these DNA sequences
were very important.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.409
They controlled the production of leptin in
the birds or the secretion of insulin in the

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.079
rodents, genes that the scientists knew had
to be there, otherwise they’d have some

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.990
mighty obese birds and dead rodents on their
hands.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.690
What’s more, the scientists studying the
rodents found the products of the missing

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.969
DNA sequences in their cells, so they deduced
that the genes weren’t missing, but were

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.469
somehow hidden.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.730
They dubbed these elusive sequences “dark
DNA.”

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.110
Sounds spooky, but the reality is this dark
DNA may be more of a blind spot in our DNA

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.089
sequencing technology than anything else.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.019
A closer look at the rodent’s genome found
a heavily mutated section with abnormally

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.910
high amounts of guanine and cytosine, two
of DNA’s four base molecules, called G and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.910
C for short.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.900
It turns out GC rich sequences are difficult
to detect, so the researchers missed this

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.090
mutated pocket of DNA at first.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.360
This dark DNA raises questions about how quickly
mutations occur, and what genes we may have

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.610
missed when we sequenced other genomes like
our own

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.380
Which is crazy to think that there could be
more DNA in us than we realized, especially

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.500
when you consider that we only know what about
1 to 2% of the stuff we have found does.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.250
Those sections code proteins that have some
function.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.670
The other 98%-ish doesn’t make anything
and so we don’t know why it’s there.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.020
This vast amount of genetic code has also
been referred to as DNA’s “dark matter.”

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.160
Apparently biologists love the dark matter
analogy, only the kind we’re talking about

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
now is the opposite of the first example.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.140
Instead of knowing what a gene does but not
finding it, we’ve found a lot of genes but

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.880
have no idea what they do.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.070
Slowly though we’re chipping away at that
riddle too.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.060
It appears that a lot of this non-coding DNA
is still helpful for regulating gene expression,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.830
making sure the right cells have the right
hardware, like hemoglobin in blood cell precursors

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.430
and ion channels in neurons.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.340
Some of these sequences are almost identical
across different species like humans, mice

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340
and chickens.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.030
Considering we’ve been evolving separately
for up to 200 million years, researchers concluded

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.140
that these sequences must somehow be vital
to our survival.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.650
When researchers deleted four of these genes
in mice, they found abnormalities in the mice’s

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.600
brains, and wondered if mutations in these
overlooked non-coding sections of DNA could

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.920
be responsible for brain diseases like alzheimer’s.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.400
So there is a lot of DNA to parse through
and there could be even more we just haven’t

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.320
found because of limitations in our sequencing
techniques.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.110
Our genome is still a pretty dark and mysterious
place, and more research is needed.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.370
One quick thing.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.660
Seeker needs your help!

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.120
Please vote for us to win a People’s Choice
Webby!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.330
You're the people you get to choose, you like
us, it works!

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.810
We made an awesome virtual reality doc that
lets you experience what it’s like to climb

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.960
Mt. Everest, and it is a finalist in the VR
category for the Webby Awards.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.770
The Seeker Everest VR Expedition mixes elements
of interactive documentary with the immersion

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.540
of virtual reality to bring you into a first-person
narrative from one of the most inaccessible

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.670
places on Earth.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.430
We are super excited about receiving this
honor, and we would be even more excited if

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.490
we won, so please, get out and give us a vote,
and if we win, we will give you, our viewers

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.540
a special surprise.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.350
Voting is open until Thursday, April 19th.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.100
Click the link in the description to vote.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.880
What are you waiting for?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520
It's not like climbing Mount Everest, just
click that and go vote!

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520
Awesome!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.500
And then check out VR Mt. Everest, it's super
cool.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.130
Researchers believe that the rodents’ hot
spots of DNA mutation could be evidence of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.430
an undiscovered and rapid mechanism of evolution.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.710
There are known cases of rapid evolution.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.100

in years instead of millenia, check out Trace’s

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.100

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.170
That’s it for now, I’ll see you next time
on Seeker.
