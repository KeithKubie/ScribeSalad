00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.433
We're talking about life
aboard the International Space

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:06.734
Station, featuring my interview
with the guy who was there

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:10.567
for nearly a year, Scott Kelly.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:12.166
I had to ask Scott
the question that we

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.967
all want to know the answer to.

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:18.500
How do bathrooms work in space?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.967
Check it out.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:23.867
The zero-G toilets,
they work OK for you?

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.033
Very complicated toilet,
and it works pretty well.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.567
Why should it be complicated?

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:33.433
You know, you've got to you
separate the air from the urine

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.967
before it's sent to a tank.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.367
OK.
So the whole--

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:38.367
SCOTT: The machinery
- --the whole toilet system.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.633
Oh, the system, and
then some of the urine.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.266
And usually when I
talk about the toilet,

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.467
I'm also talking about
the water processes.

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:45.867
NEIL: Recovery.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.033
The recovery system that turns
our urine into drinking water.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.433
So it's pretty sophisticated.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.066
Even though intellectually I
know that's an entirely doable

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.867
thing.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:54.934
Yeah.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:56.233
Just emotionally,
that just sounds nasty.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:57.266
Yeah.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.367
Yeah, I drank my pee
for a whole year.

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:00.567
Right, right.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.066
Actually, I actually
drank everyone's pee.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:02.867
Exactly.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:03.633
SCOTT: All mixed together.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:11.233
What happens to all
that is not the H2O--

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.033
Yeah.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:12.834
--from the urine.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.233
What happens to that?

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:17.900
It's put into a container and
then eventually, when that tank

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.567
fills, we put them
into smaller tanks,

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:22.600
send them down to
the Russian segment.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.934
They put them in the
Progress, their resupply ship,

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:28.700
and eventually that burns
up in the atmosphere.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.066
And then that tank
will eventually

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.533
come back with urine in it.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.900
We put it into our system.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.800
We turn it into water,
eventually brine--

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.433
So what burns up
in the atmosphere?

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.000
The whole Progress.
NEIL: Oh, I didn't know that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.600
- The whole spaceship.
- OK.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.867
So that spaceship
is designed-- it's

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.133
your garbage disposal system.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:42.967
Exactly.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:43.900
NEIL: I didn't know that.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.033
And that is a
critical resource.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:50.066
The ability to get
garbage off of a spaceship

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.900
is something that is not simple.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.700
[applause]

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.800
Sasheer, what are you doing?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.934
Huh?

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:01.834
It made me thirsty.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:02.633
Sasheer.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:03.567
Do you want some?

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:04.433
No, not now.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.300
It's tart.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.233
Oh, that's nasty.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.633
Nasty.
