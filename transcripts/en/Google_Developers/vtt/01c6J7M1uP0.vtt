TIMOTHY JORDAN: Joining me now
to talk more about Nest Hub Max

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.420
is Prabhu.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.290
Welcome.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.800
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.132
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:12.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So let's
start with a quick overview.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.590
Tell us about the larger
screen, the camera,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.625
and all of the cool
features that they activate.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:18.250
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
So Nest Hub Max

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.080
is our premium smart
display designed

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.450
for the center of
your home, and it

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.383
builds on all of the
great experiences

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:26.050
we built with the
Google Nest Hub, which

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.380
we launched last year.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.560
So we've got a
10-inch inch HD screen

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.439
for an even bigger screen
for your Google photos

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.620
and for watching YouTube TV and
all of the other experiences

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.310
there.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.560
It's got premium
stereo sound built in.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.660
And it's also got a
really helpful camera

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.390
with all kinds of features and
experiences that it can offer--

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.760
everything from video
calling with Google Duo

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.330
to peace of mind through the
built-in Nest Cam functionality

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.120
that allows you to
keep an eye on what's

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.990
happening at home
to personalization

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.990
through a feature that
we're calling Face Match.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.823
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hmm.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:57.370
Very cool.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.810
And what's your
favorite feature?

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.060
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN: So
I personally love the video

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.080
calling with Duo, because I've
got a two-and-a-half-year-old

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.497
at home, and he loves to call
his grandparents on our Nest

00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:07.240
Hub Max at home.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.920
And the auto-framing
feature of our Duo calling

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.570
allows him to run
around the room,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.120
and my parents can still
keep track of what's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.245
happening in his busy life.

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:18.537
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.133
Let's talk for a
moment about privacy.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.550
And there's a huge
consumer demand

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.350
for privacy and
transparency about

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.375
our personal information-- how
it's stored and how it's used.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:28.000
And this seems like
one of those things

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.952
that the team was particularly
passionate about and proud of.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.410
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Absolutely.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.880
You're absolutely right.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.010
We thought about privacy
from the very beginning

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.170
of our process designing
the Nest Hub Max,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.930
and actually, even going
further back, the Nest Hub.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.420
One of the reasons that we
had our first smart display be

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.920
one without a
camera is because we

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.495
wanted to make it
available as a device

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:49.120
that you would feel
comfortable putting

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.920
in any room of your house.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.387
At the same time, we knew
that the camera unlocks

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:54.970
a lot of helpful
functionality, and we

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.242
wanted to provide that
option as well for consumers.

00:01:58.242 --> 00:01:59.950
And so the way we
thought about designing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.630
the camera was very much with
privacy at the forefront.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.450
We thought about easy
and simple controls

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.210
for all of the features,
which are all opt-in features,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.990
and you choose what
you want to use.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.778
And there's simple controls,
like the hardware switch

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.320
on the back of the device that
lets you quickly just turn off

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.390
the camera and the microphones.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.920
On top of that,
taking a step back

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.710
from the individual
products, we as Google Nest

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.910
have also tried to define a
set of privacy commitments

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.092
for the home, which articulates
our point of view on what it

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:30.550
means for us to respect your
privacy in all of the products

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.133
that we build.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.640
And those are really
specific, factual commitments

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.450
about what you can expect
with your personal data

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.560
when you're using our
products in your home.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: One of the
really insightful things

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.387
about the keynote
that resonated with me

00:02:42.387 --> 00:02:45.880
was that there's a fundamental
difference between a smart home

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.290
and a helpful home.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.940
Can you define that difference?

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.148
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN: Sure.

00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:51.910
So smart home
technology is fantastic.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.822
It helps us solve
all kinds of really

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:55.780
interesting and important
problems in our homes

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.033
and in our lives.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:59.200
But one of the challenges
with smart home technology

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.680
is it's kind of complicated.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.180
It's not that easy to use.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.910
And so we wanted
to think about how

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.130
we can solve that
as we push forward

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.170
with our vision for
the helpful home.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.360
And there's a few key
tenets for what we think

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.830
the helpful home looks like.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.660
One is that the
products in it should

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.400
be easy to use for
everyone in the home.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.030
The second is it
should feel personal.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.580
As you use these
devices, they should

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.760
get to know you and be able to
provide an experience that's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.320
tailored to you and your family.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.530
The third is they should
work really well together.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.590
These devices aren't just
operating in a vacuum

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.700
individually.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.040
They're helping fill
out your entire home,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.783
and so your whole home should
work together really well.

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.450
And then the last is,
of course, the one

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.158
we just mentioned--
that it should really

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:44.857
respect your privacy
and that privacy should

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.690
be part of the design
of all of the products

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.645
that you bring into your home.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's talk
about design a bit more.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.590
I think designing
for a screen that's

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.650
meant to be viewed
up close, far away,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.150
and from different angles-- it
seems like a really difficult

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.650
problem.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.490
Can you talk about
your design process

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.823
while addressing that challenge?

00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:03.282
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Absolutely.

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:05.620
So when we started
working on the Google Nest

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.500
Hub, the first smart
display that we built,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.290
we were thinking about
that first and foremost.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.930
Because we wanted this device
to feel like an ambient,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.480
glancing device, not
one that needs your

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.070
focused attention for
long periods of time.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.399
And so we designed the
user experience on a device

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.142
to be readable from a
variety of distances.

00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:25.600
Obviously, the fact
that it's voice

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.680
means that it can be used
from both near and far.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.630
Then when we went
to the Nest Hub Max

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.268
and we added a
camera to the device,

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:34.810
the other thing that
we thought about

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.560
was how can the camera help
solve that same problem for you

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.820
and your family in the home?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.560
And so an important
decision we made

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.160
was to provide a really wide
field of view for the camera.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.820
It's got a 127-degree
field of view.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.670
So if you think about
all of the experiences

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.800
that you're using
the camera for,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.350
from video calling, where
it allows you to move around

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.280
the room with auto-framing,
to the built-in Nest Cam

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.460
functionality, where you can
get a pretty good view of what's

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.370
happening in the room, to
the personalization with Face

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.098
Match, where our
thinking was, the device

00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:08.140
should be able to tell
that you're looking at it,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.943
when you can see it,
and when you would

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.860
be able to receive the
personalized experience

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.910
that it's giving you.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.830
And so all of those
design decisions

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.350
helped us to feel
like we're extending

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.200
that, whether near or far,
it's a great experience

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.920
from the Nest Hub
to the Nest Hub Max.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.370
OK, one last thing.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.920
During user research, what
was the most fun thing

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.840
that you saw someone do
that you didn't expect?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.700
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
So one of the things

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.075
I love about our
user research is

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:35.240
that we get to see how our
products fit into their homes,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.350
and we sort of get to feel
the impact that we're having

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.300
on real homes and real people.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.070
And one small
example of an insight

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.790
that we get from that
research is, hey,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.290
where do people put
our devices when

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.700
we get them in their homes?

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.750
And we learn a lot from, for
example, the other Googlers who

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.820
test our products and
help give us feedback

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.460
before we ship
them to the public.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.675
And there was one
email thread where

00:05:56.675 --> 00:05:59.020
a Googler who was
testing a Nest Hub Max

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.980
showed a photo of his living
room, where he had the Nest Hub

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.000
Max, which is already
a pretty big screen,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.030
sitting right next to his big
flat-screen TV on the wall.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.740
And that was
obviously not what I

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.893
had expected, because I figured
these devices are big enough

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:15.310
that you're going to put this
bigger screen in a room that

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.768
doesn't really have
another screen.

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:20.050
But we had a dialogue
with the Googler,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.860
and we realized the value
of checking your assumptions

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.850
and learning from
what people do to fit

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.100
your products into their home.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.573
So he loved the photo
frame in his living room

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:32.990
and loved that you could see
it from a little farther away

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.910
because it was bigger.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.340
He loved the fact that
it had a clock that he

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.490
could look at at any time.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.010
He loved that he could control
his TV in his home theater

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.930
system by voice
through this device.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.640
And so I think that every
time we actually see

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.650
how our products fit into
people's homes, we learn a lot,

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.220
and that's one of the most
fun examples of research

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.150
that we do.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for swinging by, Prabhu.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.820
This has been really insightful.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.695
PRABHU BALASUBRAMANIAN:
Thanks for having me.

00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:57.390
I appreciate it.
