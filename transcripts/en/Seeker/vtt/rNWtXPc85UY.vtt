00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.510
2015 was the year we saw Pluto and found water
on Mars.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.410
In 2016, we’re going to learn just how the
planets were made.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.650
Hello, everyone and happy new year!

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.510
Amy with you on DNews today looking ahead
at what to expect in space this year.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.349
There’s a lot going on!

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.119
The European Space Agency’s ExoMars rover
will land on Mars, Osiris-REX will launch

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.380
towards the asteroid, and Rosetta will smash
into comet 67P.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.240
But two upcoming missions really stand out
to me.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.290
One is called InSight--

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.480
Oh my gosh you guys, Amy shot this video before
leaving for the holidays and on December 22,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.670
NASA postponed the InSight mission, 26 months
until 2018.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
So!

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.070
I'm subbing in really quick with a mission
that didn't make the cut before!

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.900
JAXA -- the Japanese Space Agency, is launching
a x-ray astronomy telescope ASTRO-H in February

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.190
of next year.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.120
X-Rays are produced when cosmic matter is
heated to millions of degrees.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.050
We physically cannot observe those emission
with surface telescopes because, to x-rays,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.530
the Earth’s atmosphere is OPAQUE!

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.370
By looking at them from space, we can pick
up tons of data impossible to gather from

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.370
Earth.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.930
To pick up as much as possible, the satellite
has four sensor systems allowing it to measure

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.440
hard and soft x-rays, gamma rays and perform
x-ray spectroscopy.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.360
Once launched from Japan, the ASTRO-H will
open up "windows into the distribution of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.620
dark matter in galaxies," and the "the large-scale
structure of the Universe."

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.620
Very cool.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.060
Okay, back to Amy!!

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.240
Sorry about InSight--

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.450
Another mission this year is going to look
into the solar system’s formation as a whole

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.690
by looking at Jupiter.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.350
NASA’s Juno spacecraft will arrive at the
Jovian system on July 5, and like another

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.820
Mars mission, it might seem like we know plenty
about the largest planet.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.049
We've been to Jupiter a lot, but most of those
missions have been flybys on the way to other

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.590
destinations — the Pioneer probes, the Voyager
probes, New Horizons, Cassini, and Ulysses

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100
all flew past Jupiter without stopping.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.229
Galileo went into orbit around the gas giant
from 1995 to 2003, and we haven't had anything

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.409
in orbit since.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.110
We're long overdue for a dedicated Jupiter
mission, particularly one that will measure

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.739
something we don't know about: the amount
of water in Jupiter's atmosphere.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.579
This seems esoteric, but it’s actually going
to help scientists with the major question

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.230
of which planet formation theory is correct,
or tell us if we need an entirely new theory

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.450
by telling us where the water on Earth came
from.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.659
If Juno finds there's little water in Jupiter’s
atmosphere, scientists will be able to conclude

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.269
that icy bodies like asteroids from the distant
Kuiper Belt brought water as ice to the rocky

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.560
inner planets.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.719
And because Jupiter is our best example of
a giant planet, knowing more about its formation

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.959
will help us understand the planets we find
around other stars.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.459
There are so many exciting missions going
on right now, but if you’re like me and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.359
have a soft spot of missions of yesteryear,
like NASA’s 1960s plan to send astronauts

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.769
to Venus, come dive into space history with
me on my own channel, Vintage Space.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RAW5i6ZWv8

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.400
We’ll have a link to that video in the description.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.849
So InSight and Juno are the missions that
*I'm* into, but what missions are you guys

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.590
