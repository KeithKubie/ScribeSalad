00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.180
Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.970
Welcome to Google Developer's
Live.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.660
My name's Ali, and today I'm
going to be talking to you

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.406
about Google Drive and the new
photo experience with Google+.

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.990
So we've launched just recently
one of my favorite

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.620
absolute features.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.900
And it's something
I use a lot.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.950
Why?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.930
Because I store my photos
in Google Drive.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.119
I find it very, very
convenient.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.130
I take my camera.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.230
I have a couple of cameras.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.030
I plug the SD card into my
computer, and I just upload

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.190
them to Drive.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.440
Now, one of the really important
things about Google

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.720
Drive and what I keep going on
about, if you've ever heard me

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.110
say anything, I'm always
going on about this.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.820
So sorry about the
broken record.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.720
But files don't go into to
Google Drive to die.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.360
Google Drive is a place where
files go to live and be happy.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.840
You use them with other
applications, with third party

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.420
applications.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.860
We're always talking about
third party applications.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.460
And example for a photo might
be PicMonkey, something to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.400
touch up the photo or
put a background,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.750
various editing features.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.270
Now, one example of this
application is Google+, and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.540
not just because Google+ is--

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.280
a Google product doesn't mean it
shouldn't be subject to the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.480
same things.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.410
So we launched this
integration.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.030
And it allows you to treat
photos that are in your Google

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.820
Drive as if they were
in Google+.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.610
So we'll have a look
at a computer.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.400
I set up-- this is our test
account, and I had a fun

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.620
morning this morning setting it
up to use Google+, but as

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.780
you can see, I've got
a few photos here.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.190
I've uploaded them.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.770
And as I logged in this morning
to my Google+ account,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.070
it asked me, do you want
to use photos that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.620
are in Google Drive?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.290
So it gave me this prompt to
explain what it was doing and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.650
that's for you to see
how it works.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.690
And it asked me and
I said yes.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.340
And since then, and this was
quite recently, started to--

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.229
I go to Google+.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.400
If I look at my photos,
it started to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.710
upload these into Google+.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.640
You only see a couple of have
come in at the moment, but if

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.470
you see in Google+ in my photos,
you see that this icon

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.375
that says--

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.880
it's the Drive icon, so
I know that this is a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.750
file in Google Drive.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.790
So that's really exciting.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.540
Why is it exciting?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
Well, before we had to--

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.110
if we wanted to insert a photo
into Google+, you could

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.220
actually insert then
from Google Drive.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.580
So I'd go in here, and you see
these are the ones that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.170
haven't yet been indexed.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.500
I would go in here, and I would
look at them, and I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.420
would choose one.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.720
But now, if you see this photo
and this one and the ones that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.480
are being indexed slowly.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880
I can actually insert
them directly.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.430
So let's do one just so
you know this is a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.760
live show, why not?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
Hi, Google Drive developers.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.500
Hi everyone from GDL.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.470
So let's see, where do we
want to share it to?

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.105
Google Drive developers.

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:29.490
Let's see, there's a shameless
plug, why not?

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.330
So now, I'm sharing this and
it's directly from Google

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.450
Drive, so it's treating my
Google Drive photos as if

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.380
they're in Google+.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.350
So my message here is remember,
files going to

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.430
Google Drive is a place where
you can then use them.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.220
You can share them with people
privately inside Google Drive,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.920
if you want to.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.160
They can collaborate on them or
you can share them publicly

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.000
now in Google+.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.180
So that's the first message.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.330
The second message here is
that when I look at these

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.730
files, the whole goal here is to
unify the experience across

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.430
Google products.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.240
Now, I'll be the first to
admit that we haven't

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.300
done a great job.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.130
We have photos here.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.500
We have photos there.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.620
But this is gradually a step
towards unifying the entire

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.250
experience.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.300
And obviously, we realized that
having one place to store

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.089
photos is better than having a
few places to store photos, as

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.269
long as it has the rich features
and the ability for

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.060
people to do what
they want to do.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.950
So we think this integration is
a good step towards that.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.490
We've still got a lot
of work to go.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.820
I just want to show you that
really this is a high

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.710
priority for us.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.670
The user experience here is
really, really important.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.060
And we want you to get the
best out of your files.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.180
This is your media.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.010
This is your content.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.380
This is stuff you created.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.260
So from a developer point of
view, remember, Drive makes

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.630
files live, and we're trying
to unify the experience.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.880
And this is a step in
that direction.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.950
So thanks very much
for joining me.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.040
If you have any questions,
follow up on the community,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.080
email me personally.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.370
I'm happy to talk to you.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.950
So take care, everyone.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.200
Bye, bye.
