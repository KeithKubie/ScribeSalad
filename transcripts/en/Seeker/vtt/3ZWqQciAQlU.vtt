00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.620
If it matters it's matter, but if you're anti-matter
I guess you just don't care about anything

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.870
anymore.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.130
Wait.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.390
What?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.540
family matters
Matter is everything around us.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.370
It's you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere!

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.390
Even the land, and the ship!

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.310
Matter is considered every physical substance
in the universe; if it has mass, it's matter.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.480
But then… there's this other thing called
antimatter.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.489
During the Big Bang, the universe should have
created half-and-half: 1 atom of matter, 1

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.489
of antimatter.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.780
But look around you, matter is everywhere.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.120
Where'd all the antimatter go?!

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.600
It's one of the great mysteries of physics…

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.370
Antimatter is the same as matter -- but opposite.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.319
Scientists have been looking for antimatter
since it was theorized in the 1920s.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.530
Physicist Paul Dirac was trying to reconcile
two new chapters in physics…

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.109
Einstein's theory of relativity, and quantum
mechanics.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:06.530
Think of it this way, when solving for X-squared
equals four, X can be either 2 or negative

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
2.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.299
Up to this point physicists had spent most
of their energy -- physics joke -- on the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.909
positive solution -- not the negative one.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.090
But since both give you the same result, antimatter
must exist!

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.550
Obviously that’s very simplified, but that’s
the idea.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.820
So, if you picture hydrogen, one positively
charged proton, one negatively charged electron:

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.939
that is matter.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.939
Balanced.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:29.939
Simple.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.040
ANTIhydrogen: is made of a negatively charged
antiproton, and positively charged positron!

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.899
This evil antimatter twin version has the
same mass, btw.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.840
Experiments with antimatter in the journal
Nature from November 2015 found antimatter

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.060
behaves exactly like matter… which is actually
confusing, shouldn't the opposite particle

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.060
behave…

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.060
I dunno, oppositely?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.130
More research is needed.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.750
The base rule of old physics, is matter cannot
be created or destroyed, but -- sorry old

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.490
physics textbook -- that's not strictly speaking
true.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.899
In fact, when an electron hits a positron
they annihilate one another, turning into

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.630
energy in the form of gamma rays -- specifically
gamma rays at 511 kiloelectron volts!

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.120
To scale that up, if 1 kilo of antimatter
hit a kilo of matter -- based on E=mc squared

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.330
the resulting explosion would be 3,000 times
the Hiroshima bomb.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.710
So, new physics, energy cannot be created
or destroyed; because matter and energy are

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.710
the same.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.960
Thus, the principle of Star Trek's replicators
and transporters!

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.540
Earl Grey, hot!

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.690
But this annihilation is a big clue as to
where antimatter went.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.050
We know this annihilation happens because
of particle accelerators.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.850
When high energy particles are smashed together,
or go through beta decay naturally, tiny bits

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.280
of antimatter are created.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.260
They clearly want to study this, but they
need to hold onto it, and therein lies the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.260
rub.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.030
Our universe is full of matter.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.110
Whenever scientists create a particle of antimatter,
it hits the mattery walls of the container

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.870
and instantly annihilates itself!

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.110
How frustrating would that be?

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.660
There was literally no way to hold antimatter
in place and get a look at it -- until now.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.400
In 2002, the ALPHA collaboration team at CERN
announced they'd trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.140
for 172 milliseconds each.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.190
A breakthrough at the time, but not a lot
of stuff, or a long time.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.620
Then in 2010, scientists trapped hundreds
of antimatter atoms for more than 15 minutes!

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.000
Giving them time to explore how these mysterious
things work!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.340
With this study, published in Nature Physics,
as a base, cosmologists believe the Big Bang

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.320
somehow created more matter than antimatter.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.700
Not much more… mind you, but more.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.660
A piece in The Guardian describes it as an
"infinitesimally small excess."

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.110
Then, in the seconds after the Big Bang -- all
the antimatter and matter annihilated each

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.670
other leaving just matter, and creating HUGE
amounts of energy!

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.690
Of course, that's just a hypothesis.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.960
So far, the lack of asymmetry-- or the fact
that matter and antimatter seem to behave

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.840
exactly the same -- is super confusing for
scientists…

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.380
IF there was asymmetry, then they could predict
why the matter survived this great annihilation,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.350
but so far… they don't know; one study is
currently using supercomputers to try and

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.800
find any tiny difference between the two.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.800
We'll see.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.090
Otherwise antimatter is dead useful.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.010
Star Trek famously uses it to power spacecraft
-- which makes sense and might actually work

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.570
out of fiction, but closer to home, antimatter
could be combined with traditional nuclear

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.260
technologies to kick off fusion reactors.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.120
Positron Emission Tomography involves putting
these antimatter positrons into the human

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.780
body, knowing they'll annihilate and emit
the predictable 511 keV gamma rays, revealing

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.760
tumors and mapping the patient.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.350
1.1 million of these PET scans were performed
in 2005 alone.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.560
And, with a little more energy in the right
place, those antimatter-matter annihilations

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.520
could even be used to hyperlocally treat cancer
without harming surrounding tissues!

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.650
Matter matters!

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.700
But it's not just about matter vs antimatter.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.170
There are also states…

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.870
Solid liquid gas, plasma…

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.690
And maybe a new one too!

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:22.120
Julia looks into a possible new state 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.340
of matter here.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.620
After all this research, I am so PRO antimatter!

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.260
But what do you think?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.910
Does it even matter?
