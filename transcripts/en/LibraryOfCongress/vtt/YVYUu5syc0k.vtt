00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.270
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.030
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe's first book was
called In My Daddy's Arm I Am Tall,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.290
African-Americans celebrating
fathers.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.870
This actually makes a lot of sense

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.020
because his father was a
well-known author and illustrator.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.520
Javaka Steptoe grew up to
become an author and illustrator

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.490
of children's literature
just like his dad.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.100
He's illustrated many other books,
including Hot Day on Abbott Avenue

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
and Jimmy Sounds Like A Rainbow.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.980
Javaka Steptoe's chosen form
of illustration is collage.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.650
Are you guys familiar with collage,
anyone familiar with collage?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.050
He constructs art by
combining common objects,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.310
such as wooden blocks,
disposable plates, even pocket lint

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.220
with colored paper and paint.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.060 position:56%
Mr. Steptoe's newest book is the
2017 Caldecott award winning Radiant

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.050
Child, The Story of Young
Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.710
which you can have signed
between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.300
in the book signing area.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.510
So, without further ado let's give
a warm welcome to Javaka Steptoe.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.950
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.900
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe: Thank
you, thank you, thank you,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.240
thank you, I am glad to be here.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.540
How are you doing?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.120
Okay whenever I ask a question
and somebody goes yeah,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.640
I'm good that does not sound good.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.590
You got to be like yeah, I'm good.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.180
So, how are you feeling today?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.460 position:56%
All right, I like that, I like that.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.430
So, I guess what I'll do is I'll
talk a little bit about the process

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.110
of creating a book and
then I am going to read

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.590
to you my book Radiant
Child which is --

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.030
what is a book called when you
write a book about an actual person

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360
that has been alive
what is it called?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.660
&gt;&gt; Biography.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe:
A biography right.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.870 position:56%
So, I'll tell you a little bit about
the process of writing a biography.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.970
So, let's get started, first slide.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.930
Is my presentation loaded?

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.370
No, maybe?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.440
Oh, I have a clicker.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.090
[ Applause ]

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.560 position:56%
I'll tell you one thing when you do
presentations anything could happen.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.470
Sometimes it's like really,
really, really catastrophic

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.250
and sometimes it's really
simple as pick up the quicker.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.680
So, in my career I have
created all of these books,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.880
I've illustrated some of them,
well I've illustrated all of them

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.580
and I've actually authored some.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.540
Who knows what an author is?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.020
&gt;&gt; You.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.090
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe: I am an
author, but I'm a lot of things,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.300
so what does author mean?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.970
Yes. A writer and who knows
what an illustrator is?

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.510
Somebody, you sir.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.880
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.230 position:56%
Draw pictures is that what you said?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.550
Did I say it just like you?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.880
All right, so that's my work.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.630
Now this is a story my latest book
is called Radiant Child and it's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.920
about a person his name is
Jean-Michel Basquiat and he's not,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.170
well he is a regular
person, but he does something

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.090
that people love he loves to
draw and he loves to paint.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.930
This is what a piece of his artwork
looks like and this is the piece

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.200
of artwork that inspired
me to create this book

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.940
about Jean-Michel Basquiat.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.210
And one of the things that inspired
me was not only does he paint

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.840
with colors and use line
drawings and things like --

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.130
cool things like monsters and
stick figures, boxing and things

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.810
like that he also writes.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.910
And only does he write things
that he makes up and comes

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.060
to his head he also uses history.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.270
So, I find his artwork very
interesting and I decided

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.820
to write a biography about him.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.970
Now the reason why you see this
little girl with her tongue out is

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.650
because when you write a biography
about someone you have to figure

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.480
out how do find out
information about them.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.400
So, I like to say you use your five
senses right, so tasting right.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.240 position:56%
If they were a baker you would
definitely want to taste their food.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.410
If they came from Puerto Rico you
might say what does Puerto Rican

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.400
food taste like and you might
taste it so that you get

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.700
to know a little more
about who this person is.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.330
So, you had taste,
you have touch right,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.150
you have smell, you have ears.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.370
What do you do with your ears?

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.670
&gt;&gt; Hear.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.470
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe:
Hear and your eyes?

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.770
&gt;&gt; See.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.420
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe: See and those
are all of the different ways

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.470
that you can find out
things about someone.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.540
You can listen to music,
you could see, read books,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.320
you can watch videos,
there's all sorts of ways.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.690
And then I found out something very
important after I found out a bunch

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.190
of information about
Jean-Michel there is a quote.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.830
Jean-Michel said, I say my mother
gave me all the primary things,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.360
the artwork came from her.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.510
And the reason that this was
helpful is when you write a book

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.420
and you have lots of information
you just don't want to have a list

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.820
of stuff you want to have
story that is interesting.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.660
And you know what, what do
you all think about a story

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:23.690
about a little boy and a mother
and the mother loves him so much

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.160
and inspires him to
become a great artist?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.640
What do you feel about
that, is that a good story?

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:37.730
All right, pictures of Jean-Michel
and I'm kind of low on time

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.000
so I'm going to get
right into the story.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.830 position:56%
Somewhere in Brooklyn, in between
hearts that that thump, double Dutch

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.310
and hopscotch, a salty mouth

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.610
that slurps sweet ice there
was a little boy who dreamed

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.650
of being a famous artist.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:06.290
In his house you can tell a
serious artist dwells as he sits

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.320
at his table with pencils
scattered everywhere.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.700
Jean-Michel draws from
morning until night

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:18.630
with a serious face amidst a
storm of papers, refusing to sleep

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.110
until he has created a masterpiece.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.670
At night images [inaudible]
in his mind as he wakes

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.280
from his dreams to
add one more line.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.780
His images are not neat or clean
nor does he color inside the lines,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:44.420
they are sloppy, ugly, sometimes
weird, but somehow still beautiful.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:52.630
His art comes from his mother,
Matilda, a Puerto Rican woman

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:59.370
who designs and sews
and cooks and cleans

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.270
and makes the house look
like a fashion magazine.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.090
But most importantly, she lies
on the floor and she draws

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.580
with Jean-Michel on his
father's old workpapers.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.110
From her he learns that art is not
only in the poetry books she reads

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.560
to him or in the museums and
theaters that they visit art is

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.070
in the street games
of little children,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.340
it's in our style and
the words we speak.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.050
It is how the messy patchwork

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:42.070
of the city creates new
meaning out of ordinary things.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:48.590
While visiting the museum he looks
at his favorite works of art,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.600
reading the story behind
each artist,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.130
reading the story behind
each artwork.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:01.820
This is how Jean-Michel learns what
it means to be a famous artist.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.600
Back at home Jean-Michel
creates art on the floor

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.710
as his father Gerard plays
jazz records and his mother,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.100
Matilda cooks aros compoyo.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.110
Who knows what aros compoyo
is, what is aros compoyo?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.260
Chicken with rice.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.900
And she cooks aros compoyo
and she calls him mi amore.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.780
Who knows what mi amore means?

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.870 position:56%
Oh, you again, you got more answers?

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.670
What does mi amore mean?

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.390
It means my love right.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.290
How many of you know your mother

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.160
or your father loves
you raise your hand?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.330
Oh, that's great, great, great.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.900
And the energy and life
of the city can be felt

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.120
in each line of his drawings.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.390
Jean-Michel soon learns that
art has a healing power.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.540
After a car accident he
is scared and confused

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:18.120
and Matilda gives him a
book to calm his fears.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.840
It is filled with skulls,
bones and other body parts.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.030
Jean-Michel draws from it
until he learns it all by heart

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.380
and he is no longer afraid.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:35.150
Back at home Jean-Michel's body
heals, but his heart breaks,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.570
his mother's mind is not
well and the family breaks.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.680
She no longer sits on the floor
and draws with Jean-Michel,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.300
but stares out the window
singing only to birds.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.480
Jean-Michel is confused and
filled with the terrible blues

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.150
as his mother must be
taken away to be cared for.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.880
He tries drawing the
terrible out of his blues,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.300
but things are not the same.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.490
As he grows older he
visits his mother

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.040
when he can always bringing
his artwork to show,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:17.200
telling her one day it will be in
a museum when I am a famous artist.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:23.070
A teenager now Jean-Michel
decides Papa I will be very,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:29.950
very famous one day with a sly
look, a twinkle in his eye.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:35.930
Jean-Michel moves from Brooklyn to
New York City, the lower east side,

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.280
a concrete jungle where
the tough survive.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.860
During the day, you know what I'm

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.200
so sorry I did not keep
flipping the pages I got

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.720
so into reading the book.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:59.060
All right, during the day dressed
in a green jumpsuit splattered

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.730
with paint Jean-Michel stays
with friends sleeping on couches

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.820
and floors, leaving
a barrage of collages

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.960
and poem filled papers
everywhere he stays.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:21.310
At nighttime Jean-Michel paints
the walls downtown with poems

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.380
and artwork that catches
the eye of artists,

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.590
gallery goers and passersby.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:34.350
Underneath his artwork he sighs the
name SAMO instead of Jean-Michel

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:40.070
and everyone wants
to know who is SAMO.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.670
SAMO moves from street
corners to art gallery walls

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:52.930
with powerful color, composition
and line collaging and painting

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.680
on everything he can find.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.540
His artwork is still
not neat or clean

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:07.450
and definitely not inside the
lines, but somehow still beautiful.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.720
With his magical charm Jean-Michel
draws a crowd, but when it's time

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.700
to work he prefers to be alone.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:27.330
With the TV turned on and the
radio turned on full blast,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.670
now in expensive suits
splattered with paint he flips

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:40.180
through magazines and open
books painting into the night

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.890
and sometimes for days
at a time as sounds

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.610
and images jump into his head.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.680 position:56%
Jean-Michel is an artist among
artists and he never doubts one line

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.170
and he moves to a soundtrack
that is all his own.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:07.970
People describe him as radiant
and wild, a genius child.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:14.240
But in his heart, he is
a king so he draws crowns

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.090
for himself and others he admires.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.110
A grown man now with the art world

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.610
in his hand Jean-Michel still
visits his mother when he can,

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:32.060
but at the most important shows
above all critics and fans

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:38.280
and people he admires the
place of honor is his mother's,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.760
a queen on a throne he
is now a famous artist.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.560
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.740
All right, I just want to let you
know while I was reading the book

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.180
and we got to the mother part
there was a woman in the audience

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.930
with the biggest smile on her face

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.130
and I'm assuming she's a
mother, are you a mother?

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.920
You yeah. Absolutely.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.170
How did that make you feel?

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.450
Nice, she said great I
don't know if you all heard.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.060
So, I think we have
like two minutes left,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.060
so if you have questions
right now is the best time

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.640
to ask me questions.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.820
So, hands up.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.330
Oh, face me you can't just be like
hands up looking at somebody else.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.690
What's the question?

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:45.300
Go to the microphone, there's
a microphone right here

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.840
and there's a microphone
right there.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.350
Yes.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.890
I don't know about
everyone, but I can.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.540
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I was [inaudible].

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.640
But I want -- oh, there you go.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.940
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe: Okay.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.150
&gt;&gt; I went to [inaudible]
in New York and I want you

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.150
to tell them a little
bit about your journey

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.770
as to how you became a
children's illustrator,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.670
as well as about your dad.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.970
&gt;&gt; Javaka Steptoe: Okay, okay.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.960
So, how many of you like to draw?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.870
So, when I was your age guess what
I did every day, I would draw,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.160
I would draw comic book characters,
I would make up my own stories

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.290
and I just would draw, drawing
was something that I loved to do.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.370
And kind of like Jean-Michel
my mother

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.880
and my father were both artists
so I would learn from them.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.560
They would always have paper and
pencils and crayons and things

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.620
like that for me to draw
and if I didn't know how

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.550
to draw a hand I would say mommy,

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.690
dad can you help me
and they would show me.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.210
And so, I would just
draw and draw and draw.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:05.300 position:56%
I went to High School of Art and
Design just like the young lady said

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.830
and then I also went to college
for art and I also learned a lot

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.880
from my father because he wrote
and he illustrated artwork,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.280
his name is John Steptoe.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.620
I don't know if you,
some people are familiar.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.320
So, they have the wrap
it up sign pointed at me.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.510
If you want to ask other
questions I guess you could ask

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.810
when I step down.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.430
But thank you for being
such a great audience

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.510
and I hope you enjoy your day here.
