00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:02.982
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:05.964
Can everybody hear me
comfortably on the sides?

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:06.461
Perfect.

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.449
DICCON BEWES: Can everyone
hear me?

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
more important.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.922
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.140
No one responded to you.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.450
DICCON BEWES: OK.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.114
Ignoring me already.

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: So thank you
for joining us for Zurich's

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.430
first Authors@Google event.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.950
What?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.572
AUDIENCE: I heard there was
something [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:29.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.170
AUDIENCE: Maybe [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.095
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you for
joining us for my first

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:35.654
Authors@Google event
in Zurich.

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:38.375
Tonight, we welcome Diccon
Bewes, who will be chatting

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:42.208
about his experience of life
in Switzerland as an expat.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.136
Diccon has been living in
Switzerland for eight years

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:48.560
and has written three books in
that time about the culture

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.124
that we live in.

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:52.900
He has a history in writing
and books, having been a

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.590
travel writer for 10 years in
the UK before his move,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.367
followed by five years
of managing the

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.920
English bookshop in Bern.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.975
Tonight, he'll be sharing from
his bestselling book, "Swiss

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:03.690
Watching," which was
a "Financial

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.140
Times" Book of the Year.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.550
Please join me in a warm welcome
for Diccon Bewes.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.795
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:16.250
DICCON BEWES: Thank
you very much.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.260
Thank you for inviting me.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.610
It's great to be here.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.115
My first time at Google,
although, of course, I use

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:22.490
Google an awful lot.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.250
The books wouldn't exist without
it, although I do do

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.060
real research, as well, in a
library, not just online.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.150
I am an author and a bookseller,
so I like real

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240
books as well.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.325
Today, I'm going to talk about
what it feels like

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.685
for me to live here.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:41.325
I've been here eight years.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.675
I didn't speak German when
I arrived, and I

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:46.670
knew some Swiss people.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.430
My boyfriend is Swiss.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.770
But I was kind of thrown
in at the deep end.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.290
And I'd like to talk about
what it feels like to be

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.200
living in the land of
milk and money.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.110
So that's just a bit about me to
show you there is a reason

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.060
why I am here.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.850
And I'd like to start by talking
about this made up

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.450
word called "Swissness." It's
a word the Swiss invented to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.240
describe how they feel
about themselves.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.545
It looks like an English word,
and you can kind of guess the

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.730
meaning if you're an
English speaker.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.740
But it doesn't really exist.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.590
It's a bit like another
Swissness word, "wellness,"

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.580
which isn't the opposite
of illness.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.760
It's actually a nice thing.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.760
It's you go to a spa
for a weekend.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.380
But if you say "wellness" in
England, most people won't

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.290
know what you mean.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.460
And wellness in America is
something medical, definitely

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.850
not something enjoyable.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.972
So I'd like to take each letter
of Swissness to try and

00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:48.560
explain what it means to me.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.430
So the first S is for shells,
which might seem a bit

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.960
strange, given that we're
a long way from the sea.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.760
In the book, I call Switzerland
the landlocked

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.850
island because it has this
island mentality, being in the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.640
center of Europe, but not
really part of it.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.100
But this is a very special
sort of shell, and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.350
I brought one along.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.990
Now, you all think this is
a coconut, but it's not.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.660
It looks like a coconut,
I know.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.485
And it feels like a coconut.

00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:25.782
But it is, in fact,
a Swiss person.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.960
And that doesn't mean that I'm
saying all Swiss people are

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.970
small, brown, and hairy--

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.960
although some are, I'm sure--

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.550
or that you want to throw things
at them all the time.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.090
It means that they have a
very hard outer shell.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.340
So it's quite hard to
get to know a Swiss

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.420
person easily or properly.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.565
And it's because the hard outer
shell protects their

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:53.030
private sphere.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.620
So in Switzerland, it's
very normal to

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.480
separate public from private.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.360
And when you arrive here, as an
English speaker especially,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.310
the coconut can feel a little
bit cold, a little bit

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.650
unfriendly, a little
bit distant.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.400
But what it actually is is
respecting your privacy,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.830
respecting your private sphere,
and taking time to get

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.925
to know you, taking time to
let you into their shell.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.810
Now, sometimes it can happen
quite quickly, especially if

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.280
you're dealing with a
Swiss person who's

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.180
lived abroad, for instance.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.720
But other times, it can happen
very, very slowly, because

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.576
once a Swiss person
calls you their

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:32.825
friend, it means something.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.010
A friend here is a friend
for life, not

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.500
just a friend on Facebook.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.063
It actually means something.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:42.240
So they take their time
to call you a friend.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.020
So for example, I go swimming
two, three times a week at an

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.590
indoor pool in Bern.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.480
And if you go the same time,
same day, over and over again,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.860
you see the same faces.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.900
And if you're an ignorant
foreigner, you say hello to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.150
these people you don't
know, because you

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.350
recognize their faces.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.644
And then about three years
later, they say hello back.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.730
English-speaking societies--

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.400
and this isn't my idea.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.620
It's been around for
a long time.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.700
The classifying of societies
as coconuts, or

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.680
English-speaking societies
are peaches, typically.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.775
And that's the soft
outer flesh.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.990
It's quite easy to get
toknow someone.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.315
You can be chatting to someone
at a bus stop, and you've

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:27.570
swapped mobile phone
numbers by the end.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.435
The outer flesh--

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:31.510
every stranger is a potential
friend, rather than a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.710
potential enemy, not
to be let in.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.695
But it can feel a
bit superficial.

00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:39.210
It can feel like you go straight
through to the flesh,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.830
and you don't really
know anyone.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.110
And it's the hard inner core
which is really the bit that

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.880
is protected.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.150
So your very close family.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.260
So it's the reverse
of a coconut.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.390
And the trouble with being a
peach in the land of coconuts

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.320
is you can get very bruised
a lot of the time.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.810
And so I get a lot of emails
from expats living here

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.500
saying, now I understand why my
neighbors are polite, but

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.396
in three years, they've never
invited me around

00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:08.270
for a cup of coffee.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.530
It's not that they're
unfriendly.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.960
It's just they're very formal
and a little bit distant.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.840
So it's all about respecting
boundaries.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.690
W is for weather.

00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:25.590
British people love to talk
about the weather.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.450
It's our main topic
of conversation.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.416
When all else fails, talk
about the weather.

00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:35.390
In Switzerland, it's not such a
great opener with people you

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.660
don't know.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.480
In private, the weather
is a topic.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.090
But using the weather to start
a conversation or to get to

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.030
know someone is kind of
illogical for Swiss people,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.370
because it's not really
worth talking about.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.760
This is a typical British-Swiss
weather

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.720
conversation.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.111
I would come in from outside
and say, oh, it's cold out

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.770
there today.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.300
And the Swiss person would
say, well, it's winter.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.320
And that's because for
me, that's the start.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.630
I'd say, I know, but did you
see, it's going to be 19

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.280
degrees at the weekend,
or it was even worse

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.090
this time last year.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.860
It was minus 30.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.540
And then we would have a
conversation about the

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.800
weather, and it lead to other
things, even if I didn't know

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.670
that person.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.620
Whereas for the Swiss person,
I've stated the obvious.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.520
It's cold.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.660
So therefore, they state
the obvious.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.510
It's winter.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.840
And that's actually the end
of the conversation.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.370
It's not the start of
the conversation.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.670
So it can feel like getting
through this coconut shell

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.567
with small talk is like banging
your head against a

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:36.090
brick wall.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.630
And mainly because small talk
here is about this big.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.350
And it's partly to do with a lot
of small-talk topics are

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.210
too invasive of someone's
shell.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.990
So you don't ask someone's
marital status.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.860
You don't ask if they
have children.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.880
You certainly don't talk about
the price of your house, all

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.270
of which are perfectly
normal topics of

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.371
conversation in Britain.

00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:03.055
Partly, here, because almost
everyone rents, but partly

00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:05.035
because it's much
too personal.

00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:09.540
And to become too personal too
quickly is to invade someone's

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.880
private sphere.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.710
So you have to remember, it's
not being unfriendly.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.920
It's just getting to know you
in a Swiss fashion, which

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.390
takes a little bit longer.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.270
Baby steps.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.670
The small talk needs
baby steps.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.698
And the most important thing
is remember the humor is a

00:08:27.698 --> 00:08:30.911
private thing, generally,
in Switzerland.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:32.520
It's a bit like sex and money.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.600
It doesn't appear in
public very often.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.100
You can tell jokes with
your friends.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.520
You can tell jokes
with your family.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.740
But in a business environment,
especially with people you

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.070
don't know, then it implies that
you're not taking that

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.750
meeting seriously.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.380
If you start the meeting with a
joke or a funny story about

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.125
something that happened on your
way to the meeting, then

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:55.570
very often, a lot of the Swiss
people will look at you and

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.810
thinking, well, are you here
for business or pleasure?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:03.040
Because you're not respecting
the boundaries.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.330
So be very careful about
using humor.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.230
Of course, if you're a
foreigner, you get away with

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.270
an awful lot.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.775
They just think,
oh, foreigner.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:15.290
And so you can tell jokes, and
people will laugh politely.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.380
But it only goes so far.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.775
And of course, the weather
in Switzerland is

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:22.630
worth talking about.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.090
It has great extremes.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.890
Plus 41 is the highest
temperature.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.720
Minus 41 is the lowest
temperature.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.490
So it is often worth
talking about.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.740
I is for introductions.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.040
Very important in Switzerland,
because in almost any

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.020
situation, social or business
but especially social, you

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.570
don't do what I did when I went
to my first dinner party

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.900
here in Switzerland.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.255
I didn't really know anyone.

00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:48.280
I knew my boyfriend.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.050
I knew the hosts.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.900
There were about 30 people
there already.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.500
So I did what any normal English
person would do in

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.150
that situation.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.340
I went and hid in the corner
and waited for the host to

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.810
take me around and introduce
me or for someone who I

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.580
vaguely recognized
to come over.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.840
What I certainly would never do
is go up to someone with my

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.970
hand out and say,
hi, I'm Diccon.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.520
For me, as an English
person, that's very

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.240
American, very forward.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.880
Hi, I'm Diccon.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.130
I'm your waiter this evening.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.710
But for Swiss people, who are
actually quite reserved,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.940
sitting in their little coconut
shells, one of the few

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.310
times they come out
willingly is when

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.950
they arrive at a party.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.880
The first thing you're supposed
to do is go around

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.840
and greet everyone who's
already there.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.700
It takes some time.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.590
And literally, the first
thing you do, before

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.310
you even have a drink.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.790
So it can be that if there
were more than 30 people

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.040
there, half an hour later,
you've just about made it

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.885
around the room, and
you're gasping.

00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:54.150
And you're just like, please,
someone get me a drink.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.670
But it's very important, because
even if you never

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.140
speak to that person the rest of
the evening, you have done

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.380
the polite thing and introduced
yourself.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.110
And of course, if you know the
person, then you can spend a

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.656
couple minutes chatting.

00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:10.280
But you both know that at some
point, you have to move on,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.510
and you will have
to come back.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.430
So it's not impolite to then
say, I'm sorry, off and off

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.460
you go doing the round.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.577
The hard thing is leaving,
because when you leave, you're

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:25.846
supposed to go around and
say goodbye and remember

00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:28.650
everyone's name.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.920
And for me, that's
very difficult.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.935
Very often, I'm the only
foreigner in the room.

00:11:31.935 --> 00:11:35.290
I have a strange name, anyway,
even for English speakers.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.250
So people remember my
name and my face.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.420
And so they come along and say,
well, goodbye, Diccon.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.105
And I'm left, oh, oh,
are you Martin?

00:11:44.105 --> 00:11:45.200
Are you Stefan?

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.842
Because nearly every Swiss
man is Martin or Stefan.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.340
Oh no, you're over 60.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.350
You must be Hans [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.580
It's really embarrassing when
you have to ask everyone's

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.140
name over and over again.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.652
So to get over these two
problems, I have two tips for

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:02.810
you, which work every time.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.212
First--

00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:07.810
and this is why all Swiss
people are punctual--

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.060
arrive first.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.760
Then you stand there.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.640
You have your drink.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640
You can chat with whoever
you want.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.950
You don't have to do anything.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.260
Everyone else has to do the
round, and you stand there

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.890
relaxed, having fun, enjoying
the evening.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.710
So there's always that scramble
for the door at one

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.685
minute past 7:00 when everyone's
been told to arrive

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.891
at 7:00, because everyone wants
to be first and not have

00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:37.450
to do this round.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:43.370
Secondly, when you leave, wait
until someone else is leaving.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.800
Then follow a couple
of steps behind.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.780
Listen to them go,
oh, I'm sorry.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.890
I've forgotten your name.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.680
And then you come along and
say, well, goodbye,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:53.900
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.720
It was lovely to meet you.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.790
And everyone's amazed that you
have this immense memory

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.650
because you've remembered 35
names which you learned in 10

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.630
minutes three hours ago.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.720
But in fact, you're cheating.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.360
And of course, no one cheats
in public in Switzerland.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.690
So no one expects it.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.330
It works every time.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.914
S is for a word which doesn't
exist in any of

00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:25.740
the four Swiss languages.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.990
Spontaneity.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.220
I lived in London
for a long time.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.960
And in London, if you're in
someone's neighborhood, you do

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.930
go and knock on the door and
say, literally, oh, I was in

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:39.420
the neighborhood.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.660
I thought you were in.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.702
Because if they were to see you
walking down the street or

00:13:45.702 --> 00:13:48.264
saw your update on Facebook or
whatever, and say, Diccon

00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:49.650
didn't come and say hello.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.500
They would be really offended.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.340
In Switzerland, it's exactly
the opposite.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.270
What I learned very quickly is
when I first arrived, I didn't

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.920
have a job.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.830
I went to school in the mornings
to learn German from

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.026
[INAUDIBLE] onwards.

00:14:03.026 --> 00:14:04.940
And in the afternoons, I
explored my new city.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.670
And I did know a couple of
Gregor's friends, and I knew

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.470
where they lived.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.870
And I'd be walking past
and think, oh,

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.450
so-and-so lives here.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.460
So I'd ring the bell, and there
would be this person

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.269
with this look of utter
shock on their face.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:22.167
Did we have an appointment?

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:26.390
And I thought, well, it's not
the doctor's surgery, but no,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.460
I was just spontaneously
passing by and thought,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.360
maybe you're in.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.160
It would be nice to chat.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.850
And so we'd stand on the
doorstep, making uncomfortable

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.080
small talk for 10 minutes or
so, and I would finally

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.240
realize that I was never
going to be invited in.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.320
And after this happened two or
three times, I realized that

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.930
spontaneous visits are
uncomfortable because the

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.080
Swiss person is not prepared.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.850
They haven't cleaned the flat.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.870
They haven't bought
the Rivella.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.870
They haven't made the cookies.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.710
The haven't got everything
perfect.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.055
And a lot of Swiss people
are very house proud.

00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:06.156
And because the house is inside
the shell, whereas a

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:09.140
lot of British and American
people use the house as a

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.350
social extension, in
Switzerland, the house is part

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.960
of inside the shell.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.810
So they're very proud of it and
always keen to show it in

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.820
the best possible light.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.280
So if you turn up unannounced,
it may be always perfect,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.840
anyway, but it could not
be quite perfect.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.400
So you have to plan
a little bit.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.890
If I say to my Swiss friends now
I'm used to, well, let's

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.670
go to the cinema sometime.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.240
And they'll get out
their handy--

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.960
not their mobile phone but their
handy-- and say, well,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.960
how about 17:35 on the
14th of April?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.470
And you go, OK, that's fine,
and get used to making

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.290
appointments three
months ahead.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.320
But I have learned that you
can be spontaneous.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.345
You just have to plan
your spontaneity.

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.180
It's a very Swiss concept.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.110
So I send a text or put a
message on Facebook or

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.130
whatever and say, I'm
off next Friday.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.825
And if the weather's nice,
there's a high chance I'll go

00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:10.450
for a walk, and I may wander
through your neighborhood.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.880
And about 11 o'clock, it's
possible I might

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.870
ring on your doorbell.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.655
And if you happen to be home,
we could maybe sit down and

00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:19.930
have a chat for a few minutes,
if you're free.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.690
If not, no problem.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.440
And of course, they know that I
will turn up, and I turn up

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.600
at about two minutes to 11:00,
just to feel a little bit

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.320
spontaneous.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.610
And everyone's happy.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:38.150
I ring on the doorbell
unannounced, roughly, and

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.605
they're ready for me.

00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:43.610
Everything's tip top, another
phrase that went out of

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.103
fashion in England about 1935.

00:16:46.103 --> 00:16:49.480
But here, people love
to say tip top.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.066
It feels like I'm talking to my
grandmother all the time.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.760
Swiss francs.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.630
Swiss people love money.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.839
And I'm not saying that
in a mean way.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.884
I'm saying actual, real money,
not pretend money like we have

00:17:07.884 --> 00:17:11.589
in America and Britain, plastic
and money that you

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.710
never really see.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.740
Real money here.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.970
I worked for five years in a
bookshop, and it was a big

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.170
surprise to me, having worked
five years in an English

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:26.829
bookshop 100 years ago, where
most people pay with plastic.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.710
Here, over half of the customers
still pay with cash.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.800
And it's no surprise at
all if you're Swiss.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.300
But if you're British, and it's
your first week at work,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.850
and you're on your own on the
shop floor, and the woman

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.460
comes up and puts a book on the
counter, which costs 25

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.485
francs or so.

00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:46.466
And she gives you a purple
piece of paper.

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:50.330
And you look at it and think,
I've never seen a note with

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.580
three zeroes on it.

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:56.300
1,000 francs.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.310
It's like $1,000 just
on the counter.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.770
And so I look at it and look at
here, and she looks at me

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.330
and looks at it.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.840
And she's obviously thinking,
why is this stupid man not

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.650
just giving me my change,
like in any other shop?

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.420
And I'm thinking, well, I didn't
even have 1,000 francs

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.360
of change in my till.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.420
But also, shouldn't I hold it
up to the light or call the

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.906
police or something?

00:18:20.906 --> 00:18:23.750
Because in Britain, our largest
note is a 50-pound

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.498
note, which you never see,
really, unless you're a bank

00:18:27.498 --> 00:18:29.610
robber or a drug dealer.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.265
But normal people, you tend not
to get them very often.

00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:34.440
But here, 1,000-franc
notes are normal.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.630
People think they are normal.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.930
And it's a sure sign that you
are a tourist or a newly

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.950
arrived foreigner if when you
go to co-op with a 200-franc

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.099
note, you still apologize when
you hand it over, you say, I'm

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:47.391
awfully sorry.

00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:49.690
It's all I've got.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.300
Because you're buying a bottle
of Coke for one franc 20, and

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.770
the cashier looks at you, well,
why are you apologizing

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.761
for giving me money?

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:58.410
It's normal.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.110
My father has been visiting
Switzerland

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.416
for eight years now.

00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:05.616
And he's still surprised when
the cash machine gives him a

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:08.925
200-franc note, because in
England, you're lucky

00:19:08.925 --> 00:19:09.750
if you get a 20.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.720
It's normally 10s and 5s.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.260
And what's interesting here
is the attitude to

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.170
money is very different.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:23.815
It's all about trust, because
Swiss society runs on trust.

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:26.807
Swiss people trust each other to
make the right decision, in

00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:29.970
a political sense, because
we have direct democracy.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.855
So it's a system of referenda.

00:19:31.855 --> 00:19:35.625
So the people always have a say,
or can always have a say,

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:38.440
either at the beginning of a
process, like with the ban on

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.670
new minarets.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.760
It was a referendum which now
has to be turned into law.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.120
Or it's at the end of the
process that they have to

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.840
ratify a treaty or say yes to
joining the United Nations,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.710
for instance, which didn't
happen for many, many years.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.940
So the Swiss people are
involved, but they trust each

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.540
other to make the
right decision.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.230
And the same with many shops.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.000
I worked in a bookshop
in Bern.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.670
We had tables outside the shop
with books piled up on them,

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.060
no member of staff there.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.730
And the shop trusts people to
just pick them up and bring

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.782
them inside.

00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:14.430
Rather like my local co-up,
brings down the shutters at

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.800
night and on a Sunday.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.620
And outside, there's still
compost and plants and

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.520
everything.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.100
And they're still there
in the morning.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.160
So it's all about trust.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.085
And the cash society promotes
that trust, because if, like

00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:29.340
us, you order a new fridge,
you go to the

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.440
shop, you order a fridge.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.310
You give them your
name and address.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.980
A few days later,
they deliver it.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.165
No one's taking a deposit.

00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:38.434
No one's taking a credit
card number.

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:41.500
All they've done is deliver a
rather expensive fridge and

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.262
say the bill will
be in the post.

00:20:43.262 --> 00:20:45.960
And the bill comes in the
post, and you have a

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.020
month to pay it.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.750
And it's all very different
from when I worked in a

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.310
British bookshop, where if we
took an order over the phone,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.610
it's like ordering on Amazon.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.120
You have to give your credit
card details before you even

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.330
send the book out.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.900
So it's very much a
trustful society.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.320
And the cash is part of that,
because a lot of Swiss people,

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.600
debt is a four-letter word.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.510
They don't have mortgages.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.680
And a lot of Swiss people do
not have a credit card.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.130
About a third have
a credit card.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.580
About a third don't have
a credit card.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.700
And about a third have a credit
card for going shopping

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.200
in America.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.360
And really, it's because they
don't trust credit.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.880
They don't trust internet
shopping in the

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.840
same way as we do.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.110
We've got a lot of customers
who would find a book on

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.070
Amazon, print it out, and come
and order it in this shop,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:44.265
which for me was wonderful, as
a bookseller, but completely

00:21:44.265 --> 00:21:49.250
strange that they didn't trust
putting their personal details

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.410
into a big website like
that or give them

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.540
their credit card details.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.810
I pay my mobile phone bill
here by direct debit.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.020
A lot of my Swiss friends
think I'm crazy.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.400
Why on earth do you let a
company have your bank details

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.440
and take money each month?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.740
It's because it's convenient.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.130
But it's all about trust.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.890
So it's a very interesting
reversal, or maybe a throwback

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.600
to how it used to be.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.760
The other interesting thing
about the Swiss money is the

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.665
coins haven't really changed
since about 1870s.

00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:27.310
In 1874, Helvetia, stood
up on the coin.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.210
She used to be sitting down.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.770
She stood up.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.580
That was a momentous change.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.090
And in 1978, an extra star was
added around the edge of the

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.640
two-franc, one-franc, and
half-franc coins.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.835
Those are 23 stars
for the cantons.

00:22:41.835 --> 00:22:43.310
There used to be 22.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.000
And they had to squeeze an extra
one in when Jura became

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.760
a separate canton in 1978.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.710
But apart from that, they're
pretty much the

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.780
same as they were.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.740
So it's quite usual for
sometimes in my change, I'll

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.170
get a coin, which is 1930s,
1940s, and it's still doing

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.050
the rounds.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.500
I don't really like
to touch it.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.360
I don't know where it's been.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.110
It's been in many, many
different hands.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.350
But I come from a country where
we change our coins

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.860
practically every 10 years.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.460
They get smaller.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.010
They change shape.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.600
They introduce new ones.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.440
And here, it's very stable.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.185
It doesn't really change.

00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:21.445
Whereas the notes, there was a
major revolution in the notes

00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:23.390
about 10 years ago.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:28.425
They used to be taller as well
as longer, each note rather

00:23:28.425 --> 00:23:29.935
like the British notes.

00:23:29.935 --> 00:23:32.690
And then they decided, one,
you couldn't use automatic

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.090
machines that easily.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.110
And two, the big notes, like
the 1,000-franc note, were

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.940
just too big for people's
wallets.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.055
So they made them all the same
width, but each note 11

00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:44.740
millimeters longer than
the one before it.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.410
It's very precise.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.220
And then you get wonderful
things, like each note has a

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.050
little symbol for blind people
to know what the note is.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.320
So 10-franc note is a
little dot inside a

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.945
circle that is raised.

00:23:58.945 --> 00:24:01.470
And this is the kind of thing
you never really notice until

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.720
you research a book.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.095
N is for names.

00:24:08.095 --> 00:24:10.720
And that's not me.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.820
That is Basel Fasnacht, which
is coming up, one of the

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.080
biggest festivals
in Switzerland.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.100
Really worth visiting, but
only if you like lots of

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.120
music, lots of confetti,
and lots of people.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.605
If you don't like any of the
above, then don't go.

00:24:24.605 --> 00:24:27.060
Just watch it on television.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.220
Names here are also very
important, partly because you

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.690
have to introduce yourself all
the time, even on the phone.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.100
If you phone a Swiss person,
particularly in the

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.460
German-speaking part, not so
much in the French and

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:40.980
Italian-speaking parts.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.455
But in the German-speaking part,
very often, they'll pick

00:24:43.455 --> 00:24:47.450
the phone and just say their
last name, which is very

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.081
unfortunate if they have
a funny last name.

00:24:50.081 --> 00:24:52.800
I had a customer who
was Herr Wank.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.888
And every time I called him,
he would just go Wank?

00:24:56.888 --> 00:24:58.256
I was like, really?

00:24:58.256 --> 00:24:58.712
Here?

00:24:58.712 --> 00:25:00.540
Now?

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.910
And it's too abrupt for me,
whereas in England, it's like,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:06.470
well, good morning.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.630
This is Diccon speaking.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.785
How can I help you,
if you're working

00:25:08.785 --> 00:25:09.940
in a shop, for instance.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.150
But names are very important.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.720
I once had a customer who I
had said, good morning.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.400
Diccon speaking.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.140
Can I help you?

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.731
And she said, well, I need to
know your last name before you

00:25:18.731 --> 00:25:20.275
can help me.

00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:22.840
I said, OK, it's obviously
very important.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.150
The actual name itself
is partly controlled.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.180
It's not very strictly
controlled.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.510
There isn't a list of first
names that you have to give,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.460
have to choose from.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.930
But the first name you give your
baby has to be approved

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.790
by the community registrar.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.630
You have to give the baby a
name within three days.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.920
You can't take the baby home
and think, well, she looks

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.355
like a Michelle.

00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:49.410
We'll call her Michelle
after a week or so.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.200
The name has to be given before

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.390
the baby leaves hospital.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.680
And there are certain rules.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.330
So you can't use bad-boy names,
like Judas and Cain.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.230
You can't use family names
as first name,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.475
so no Harrison Ford.

00:26:07.475 --> 00:26:09.440
You can't use place names.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.850
No Paris Hilton.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.100
Hurrah.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.180
You can't make up names just
because they sound nice.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.270
Or you can't give a
baby a name which

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.420
would open it to ridicule.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.140
So for instance, if your surname
is Head, you can't

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.300
call your son Richard
if it were in an

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.270
English-speaking country.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.800
You can't call your son Adolf
Hitler like a couple in

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.960
America did a few years ago.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.000
So anything that will harm the
child emotionally, physically,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.930
mentally, is not allowed.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.820
And it has to be approved
by the registrar.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.820
It sounds very controlling, but
it's actually for the well

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.210
being of the child so that you
don't get children like the

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.115
little girl in New Zealand who
was called Talula-Does-The-

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:58.885
Hula-From-Hawaii,
all hyphenated.

00:26:58.885 --> 00:27:01.110
That was her given name.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.880
That would never be allowed
here, and probably

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.210
rightly so, I think.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.925
Which is why you get a lot of
women called Doris Muller.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.560
E is for Emmentaler, possibly
the most famous Swiss product,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.570
Swiss cheese, as it's generally
called in some parts

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.160
of the world.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.080
And the interesting thing about
Emmentaler, it's one of

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.940
those Swiss products that
everyone knows is Swiss.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.190
And typically, Swiss
firms, like Swiss

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.850
people, are very modest.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.230
They're not wonderful at
shouting to the world, we've

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.830
invented this thing.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.520
It's wonderful.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.510
It's great.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.424
This is the best thing
in the world.

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.794
They say, oh yeah, by the way,
we've invented something

00:27:41.794 --> 00:27:43.545
rather interesting, and
maybe you'd like it.

00:27:43.545 --> 00:27:44.520
Or not even that.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.930
They just put it out there and
hope it sells itself somehow.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.135
So there are lots of Swiss
inventions which are famous

00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:54.740
but not famous for
being Swiss.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.778
So Velcro, for instance, the
Toilet Duck, electric

00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:04.990
toothbrush, LSD, absinthe,
really useful everyday things.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.752
Cellophane, tin foil.

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:10.870
These are all Swiss inventions,
but pretty much,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.572
even Swiss people probably
don't know they're Swiss,

00:28:13.572 --> 00:28:15.655
because they've just been
invented, and they think, oh,

00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:16.350
that's great.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.740
And out they go.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.390
And so it's very interesting
to see Swiss firms now

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.530
changing slowly to deal with
social media, to deal with

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.380
different forms of selling,
because it's not really in

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:35.650
their genes to be very forward
and to be very proactive.

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:41.080
So sometimes, it can be hard
for them to enter into the

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.310
big, wide world outside
their coconut.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.070
So Switzerland, in a way,
is like a coconut.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.312
The mountains are the shell,
and it's very nice and

00:28:48.312 --> 00:28:49.720
comfortable in the
internal market.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.941
But selling to the outside
world can be scary.

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:56.900
And as for the Emmentaler
itself, well, the holes are

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.920
officially called eyes.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.180
And they are, officially,
the CO2 released during

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.470
fermentation by the bacteria
that are added So in other

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.150
words, they're bacteria
farts that are

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.170
trapped inside the cheese.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.720
But it has to be said,
Emmentaler, my favorite part

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.125
of the cheese is the hole.

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.375
I tend to leave the rest.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.340
Penultimate S--

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.210
unfortunately, "Swissness"
has lots of Ses.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.435
I had to work really
hard with the Ses.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.670
It's for Sundays.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.220
Sundays were abolished in
America and Britain

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.870
about 20 years ago.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.620
Basically, Sunday is
like any other day.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:38.995
You can go shopping.

00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:42.240
You can do pretty much whatever
you want, whereas

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.830
here, Sundays are still
something special.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:51.542
Not necessarily a day of
religion, because although

00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:53.410
it's a little bit more religious
here than in other

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.730
countries, it's not
that religious.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.470
Some cantons are Catholic.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.370
Some cantons are Protestant.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.040
You only really notice when
the Catholic cantons have

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.780
holiday which the Protestant
cantons don't.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.660
And you think, oh, I'll
go to Lucerne today.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.750
And you get there, and
everything's shut because

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.872
they're celebrating Mary going
to heaven or Mary having a

00:30:09.872 --> 00:30:13.700
little lamb or Mary
doing something.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.442
And the Protestant cantons, of
course, are hardworking.

00:30:16.442 --> 00:30:18.330
They have far fewer holidays.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.600
The best place to live,
by the way, is Ticino.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.620
That's 15 public holidays, as
opposed to eight in Bern,

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.790
because they celebrate whatever

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.760
their saints are doing.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.370
It's an excuse for a day off.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.660
So Sundays is not down
to religion.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.720
It's about having
a day of rest.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.285
That's why the shops aren't
open, except in the stations

00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:39.190
or the airport.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.965
That's why you can't
do your recycling.

00:30:43.965 --> 00:30:46.940
It may be God's holy day, but
you can't save the planet,

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.510
because if you do what I did
and put some bottles in the

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.180
bottle bank on a Sunday, you get
told off very quickly for

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.170
creating too much noise.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.290
You also very often can't do
things like clean your car,

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.460
mow the grass, wash the windows,
do any DIY, because

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.541
that's all disturbing someone
else's peace.

00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:08.910
And in buildings where you
have communal laundries,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.678
sometimes the laundry room is
actually locked on Sunday.

00:31:12.678 --> 00:31:14.820
So you can't even
do your washing.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.670
And it's not about controlling
your life.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.390
It's about making sure
that everyone

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.730
has a good life balance.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.350
So what do Swiss people
do on Sunday?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:28.492
Well, typically, there's
the cinema.

00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:30.770
Visit friends, as long as you've
told them in advance

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.020
that you're coming.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.630
Go to a museum, because they're
usually shut on

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.180
Mondays, because they can't
cope with opening

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.070
every day of the week.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.380
That's too much.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.430
Or you go for a walk through a
lovely place like this, the

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.720
Eiger Nordwand, north
face of the Eiger.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.550
It's one of my favorite walks.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.439
But a Swiss walk is not
a British walk.

00:31:56.277 --> 00:31:58.800
A British walk is a stroll
through a meadow for an hour

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.310
or so, finishing at
a pub with a pint.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.850
A Swiss walk is at least five
hours long, has height

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:13.490
differences of 500 meters,
definitely no pub at the end,

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.370
and you're a panting wreck
behind all your Swiss friends,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.725
who have marched off with their
sticks and their boots.

00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:20.410
I went on one walk.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.405
Never again.

00:32:23.405 --> 00:32:25.290
I now meet my friends
at the top.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.905
I take the cable car and
say, well, I'll meet

00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:27.650
you there for lunch.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:28.420
That's fine.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.560
And I bring the picnic.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.950
And they do the exercise.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.356
And I just get up three hours
late, because they all get up

00:32:35.356 --> 00:32:37.440
at 6 o'clock in the morning
on a Sunday.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.560
And the train is packed, because
it's a beautiful day.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.960
And it's like rush hour.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.759
And you have to run
to get a seat.

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:45.980
And I say, I'll get up at 9:00
and catch a later train and

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.345
meet them at the top.

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:49.810
That's what Sundays
are about here.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.790
And it actually takes a bit of
getting used to, after living

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.010
in London where everything
is 24 hours.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.510
At the beginning, I was
thinking, oh my lord, it's 4

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.410
o'clock on a Saturday.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.520
Nothing's going to be open until
9 o'clock on Monday.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.620
And you have to rush to the
supermarket, because

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.270
otherwise, you're not going
to have anything to eat.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.780
Or you have to face the scrum
that is the Migros in the

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.730
station, where very often, it's
one in, one out, because

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.650
it's so busy inside.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.776
But you get used to it,
and you actually

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:21.560
appreciate your Sundays.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.760
The difficult thing when you
first arrive is that Sundays

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.140
aren't just Sundays.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.300
Holidays are Sundays as well.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.020
So on holidays, everything
is shut.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:39.600
So logically, the day before a
holiday is a Saturday, even

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.040
when it isn't, because a
holiday is a Sunday.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.460
So on the day before Good
Friday, for instance, Maundy

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.935
Thursday, everything
shuts at 5 o'clock

00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:52.362
because it is a Saturday.

00:33:52.362 --> 00:33:54.720
Now, that you can just about get
your head around, because

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.350
Good Friday is the same
all the time.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.570
When it gets difficult is the
holidays that move around and

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.910
take you by surprise.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.552
So like the 1st of August, and
then suddenly, you have to

00:34:04.552 --> 00:34:06.480
remember, oh, it's
the 31st of July.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.679
Not that it's Wednesday, but
it's the 31st of July, so it's

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.940
a Saturday.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.639
Or again, going to Lucerne or
another Catholic canton when

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:18.835
they're celebrating something
that Mary did, allegedly, then

00:34:18.835 --> 00:34:22.370
you have to remember that the
day before the day that Mary

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.804
did something, everyone has to
get ready and rest and close

00:34:27.804 --> 00:34:31.389
early to celebrate Mary's
doing things.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:35.110
So you have to remember that all
these religious holidays,

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.520
which in England, we got rid
of and made into very

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.035
anonymous spring bank holiday,
here are still called

00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:44.085
Ascension Day and Pentecost.

00:34:44.085 --> 00:34:45.695
I didn't even know what
happened on Pentecost

00:34:45.695 --> 00:34:46.665
until I came here.

00:34:46.665 --> 00:34:48.690
And I learned very quickly,
something to do

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.060
with the Holy Spirit.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.630
In my children's book, it had
the apostles with little gas

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.704
flames above their heads.

00:34:55.704 --> 00:34:57.930
That's how I learned
what Pentecost was.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.230
But of course, remember, the
day before Pentecost is

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.426
therefore a Saturday.

00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:05.210
So you just have to be
a bit more prepared.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.270
The last S is for Swinglish.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.950
And Swinglish is the English
that a lot of

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.982
Swiss people speak.

00:35:12.982 --> 00:35:15.672
A lot of Swiss people speak
wonderful English.

00:35:15.672 --> 00:35:17.540
[GERMAN].

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.140
And a lot of Swiss people
speak their version of

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.710
wonderful English, which
isn't always the same.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.500
And the problem is, as the
English speaker, you are

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.690
expected to understand their
English, because they think

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.780
it's English.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.540
So for instance, in this
picture, if you were to park

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.960
your car in a space marked
"car," as a friend of mine

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:50.150
did, she did notice it
was a very big space.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.630
So she parked at right angles,
thinking that everyone had to

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:56.742
do the same so that we could fit
lots of cars in the space.

00:35:56.742 --> 00:35:57.940
It's logical.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.330
Space marked "car."
I have a car.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:01.430
I park my car.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.200
Two hours later, I come back to
my parked car in the "car"

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.200
space, and I have a ticket,
because, of course, "car"

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.130
doesn't mean car.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.860
"Car" means coach or bus,
typically a tour bus.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.990
That's why the space
is so big.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.117
But to English speakers, it's
blindingly obvious that it's a

00:36:19.117 --> 00:36:20.990
space for cars.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.000
So you're very surprised
to get a ticket.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.640
Or your handy.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.387
Go back to England and ask
someone for their handy

00:36:28.387 --> 00:36:32.280
number, and they will look
at you, what's a

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.250
number that's handy?

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.190
One of those I wrote on my hand
in a club last night?

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.730
I'm not really sure.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.300
Because you forget that some
English words-- because

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.940
"handy" is an English word
meaning "convenient." But you

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.290
forget that they have different
meanings here.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.605
You get so used to the Swinglish
meaning that you use

00:36:49.605 --> 00:36:51.975
it when you go back to England,
and everyone think

00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:55.020
you're a little bit strange.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.890
Far more embarrassing is, for
instance, if you're talking

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.440
about your hobbies-- you're
making small talk--

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.620
and you're an English
speaker--

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.720
sorry, if you're a Swiss person
speaking English, as a

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.320
friend of mine did.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:15.182
And she said her hobby was
riding old timers, which, of

00:37:15.182 --> 00:37:17.330
course, for her meant she loved
riding around in vintage

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.710
cars and vintage car rallies,
because an old timer is a

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.330
vintage car.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.655
But the English person she was
speaking to, who was an old

00:37:25.655 --> 00:37:30.920
man, thought that she liked
having sex with old men, and

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.290
she was being very,
very forward.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.620
But for her, the meaning
was clear.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.419
And for him, the meaning
was clear.

00:37:41.257 --> 00:37:43.190
It was only when I explained
the two different meanings

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.106
that they both went very red.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.980
And then you get invited to very
formal functions, dress

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.379
code smoking.

00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:58.163
And I'm thinking,
I don't smoke.

00:37:58.163 --> 00:37:59.582
And I go--

00:37:59.582 --> 00:38:03.020
or even if I did smoke, how
can I wear a smoking?

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.650
How can I wear a verb?

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.850
Sounds like some weird,
fancy dress party.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:09.723
Come as your favorite
verb participle.

00:38:09.723 --> 00:38:13.180
But of course, a smoking is a
dinner jacket or a tuxedo.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.320
So it can be very confusing
when same words

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.060
have different meanings.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.473
There are lots of English
words which

00:38:19.473 --> 00:38:20.170
have the same meaning--

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.235
snap, online, quickie, Google.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.590
But there are lots of words
which have different meanings.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.480
And sometimes, it can be
very embarrassing.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.480
I remember a customer in the
shop came in and spoke in

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.350
English, so I presumed we were
speaking English together.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.980
And she said, do you have that
book about a shag in the woods

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.230
with Jesus?

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.800
I was very professional.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.270
I kept a straight face.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.060
And I thought, well, it's the
wrong bookshop for that.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.480
And then I realized that for a
Swiss German, the "G" at the

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.176
end is the same as
a "K" at the end.

00:39:07.176 --> 00:39:09.666
So it was the shack,
not the shag.

00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:11.820
And of course, there is a very
famous book called "The Shack"

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.515
about a man who spends
a weekend in

00:39:13.515 --> 00:39:14.140
the woods with Jesus.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.550
I don't know what they
were doing there.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.235
But then to I went and got
the book, "The Shack,"

00:39:20.235 --> 00:39:21.900
and gave it to her.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.851
And it's very hard, sometimes,
for the Swiss ear to hear the

00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:29.562
difference at the end between
a "guh" and a "kuh," whereas

00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:33.020
for an English ear,
it's much clearer.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.280
And then, of course, there are
situations where you end up

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.870
looking really, really
stupid--

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.260
or I do, anyway--

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.510
which is why I think this is one
of many people's favorite

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.500
part of the book, because I do
look particularly stupid.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.750
But I'll read it anyway.

00:39:52.314 --> 00:39:55.440
Lots of Ses, so I
need some water.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.030
And this, I haven't been
in the bookshop long.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.500
I didn't realize that people
didn't speak my English at

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.420
that point.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.930
"Swiss customer--

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.810
'I need a book on cheeses.'
'OK, I'll show you what we

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:07.960
have in the cookery section.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.624
I'll get out our three books on
cheese.' Customer shaking

00:40:10.624 --> 00:40:13.680
her head, 'Not cheese,
cheeses.'

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.350
At this point, I'm wondering,
does cheese have a plural?

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.310
Was it like sheep, with none, or
more like fish, plural when

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.140
there's more than one type?

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.060
Or was this a Swinglish
plural, like

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.190
informations and behaviors?

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.850
Not wanting to get into a
discussion on that, I try

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.140
again, going with her plural
in the hope that it helps.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.730
'So, you're looking for
something on cheeses.' ' Yes,'

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:47.960
the customer says, 'books on
holy cheeses.' 'Oh, you want a

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.785
book on Swiss cheeses.'
Customer, looking me as if I'm

00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:59.790
simple, 'there is no Swiss
cheeses.' I'm now thinking

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.892
about her singular verb
with her plural noun.

00:41:02.892 --> 00:41:06.986
'We do have something on Swiss
cheeses.' Customer now very

00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:11.510
irritated, 'cheeses
was not Swiss.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:17.520
Cheeses was the son of God.'
'Oh, you mean Jesus.' 'This is

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.100
what I'm saying.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.290
Books on cheeses.'"

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.970
And of course, for me,
it was very clear.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.400
And for her, it was
very clear.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.820
And we just weren't talking
about the same thing.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.690
And for all the other customers
and my Swiss

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.038
colleagues, who were helpless on
the floor laughing, no one

00:41:33.038 --> 00:41:35.870
coming to my aid, it
was also very clear

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.434
that I was very stupid.

00:41:39.434 --> 00:41:42.150
And Swiss friends of mine who
have heard me tell that story

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.203
many, many times now say,
I still can't hear the

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:47.500
difference.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.150
Because, of course, a J for
Swiss German speakers is a

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:57.230
"yuh," and a CH is a "huh." So
they're very distinct, where

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.250
to a Swiss ear, a juh and a chuh
sound exactly the same.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.740
So if you happen to be a man
called Jerry from Vancouver,

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.020
you have to be very careful
what you say when you

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.080
introduce yourself.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.187
"Hi, I'm Cherry from Wankouver"
is what you tend to

00:42:11.187 --> 00:42:15.530
get, because Jerry and Cherry
are exactly the same name.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.270
My boyfriend goes chogging.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.130
The first time, he said, I'm
just going chogging with

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.535
friends, I thought, should
I be jealous?

00:42:21.535 --> 00:42:24.640
What is he doing?

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.660
Something in parked cars that is
vaguely illegal, I'm sure.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.810
So that's Swinglish.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.152
It's the last part
of Swissness.

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:37.115
And that's really the funny
side of what it's

00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:37.585
like to live here.

00:42:37.585 --> 00:42:39.615
Obviously, there's a serious
side-- the political system,

00:42:39.615 --> 00:42:42.910
the geography, the history, the
wars, the people, all of

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.550
which I go into in the
book in some detail.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.550
So I learned a lot very quickly,
because, of course,

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:51.180
in Britain, we learn nothing
about Switzerland, apart from

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.463
banks and "Heidi."
That's about it.

00:42:53.463 --> 00:42:55.954
We certainly don't learn about
Swiss history and the original

00:42:55.954 --> 00:42:58.710
cantons or about the direct
democracy system, partly

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.930
because we don't even understand
our own system, and

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.400
partly because we'd probably
be jealous if we actually

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.520
thought, wow, they get asked
every three months what they

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.540
think, not every four years.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.460
Seems amazing.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.360
And the country actually
functions.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.040
How can a country function if
the people keep having to make

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.730
the decisions?

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.220
It's just not democracy
at all, really, is it?

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.270
So there is a serious
side to living here.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:27.190
But I focus on some of the
serious parts and some of the

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.620
more amusing parts.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.710
The book came out originally
in 2010.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.930
Very happily for me, it became
the bestselling English book

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:36.370
in Switzerland.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.265
And as Dana said,
the "Financial

00:43:39.265 --> 00:43:40.710
Times" Book of the Year.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.160
It's also in German.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.090
So my mother-in-law is very
happy, because she speaks two

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:51.270
words of English, "happy
Christmas." She has progressed

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.200
to "happy birthday" now.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.710
So she was very happy
to finally

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.980
read the book in German.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.265
It has a different title.

00:43:57.265 --> 00:43:59.580
I have progressed from
being a watcher to an

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.700
understander, [GERMAN].

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.270
It also, very interestingly,
has a toilet on the cover.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.500
This is a very famous Swiss
toilet up in the mountains,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.160
one which you have to walk
to get to, obviously.

00:44:13.686 --> 00:44:16.820
And I've even had people send
me pictures-- not of them on

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.870
the toilet but of the toilet,
sending me GPS coordinates to

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.940
show me where it is
in Graubunden.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.910
It is, apparently, a famous
toilet, but it's a toilet

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:27.540
nonetheless.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.940
And then the French edition
comes in June this year,

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.700
again, with a different title,
different cover, just to

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.960
confuse everyone, especially
the booksellers.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.730
And last year, a little book
of facts came out called

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.270
"Swisscellany," or

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.860
Swiss-cell-any, if you're American.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.372
And it's one of those books of
facts that you dip in and out

00:44:47.372 --> 00:44:49.870
of and think, well, I never
needed to know that, but it's

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.170
quite interesting.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.170
So the Swiss people on the
"Titanic" and which ones died,

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.520
which ones survived.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.635
Which cantons have
the most cows?

00:44:58.635 --> 00:45:00.230
It's Canton Bern, by the way.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.560
All the Emmentaler cheese.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.150
Or all the characters in
"Heidi," or Swiss winners at

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.370
the Oscars and the Olympics,
things like that.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.500
Kind of useful, but
not really.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.370
In England, it's the kind of a
book we keep in the smallest

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.620
room in the house.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.870
English people are
famous for that.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.390
You have a little bookshelf
in the loo.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.470
We do in our house.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.990
And all my Swiss friends think
it's very strange.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.200
And my Swiss publisher--

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.790
this one was published
in Switzerland--

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.468
she still says, but there are
more comfortable places in the

00:45:34.468 --> 00:45:36.705
house to sit and read.

00:45:36.705 --> 00:45:38.693
But that's missing the
point entirely.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.326
So the first two, the English
version and the German

00:45:47.326 --> 00:45:49.950
version, are available
as e-books,

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.250
"Swisscellany," not yet.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.850
And my new project, which I've
been working on the last two

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:58.340
years, will come
out in October.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.791
Because this year is the 150th
anniversary of Thomas Cook

00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:04.710
coming to Switzerland, the
very first guided tour of

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.870
Switzerland.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.230
And he brought a very
adventurous group here.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:11.460
And it was so successful that
he brought more and brought

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.240
more and was brought more.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.710
And Swiss tourism exploded,
whereas before, you had to

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.980
have lots of time and lots
of money to get here.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.570
It took two weeks to
get here by coach.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.795
And then suddenly, the train
line arrived, and you could

00:46:21.795 --> 00:46:23.770
get here in two days.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.710
And coming as a group
made it affordable.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.010
So it was the trains but also
Cook organizing groups that

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.010
suddenly started
Swiss tourism.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.140
So Swiss tourism see it
as their birthday.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.140
So they're celebrating 150
years of Swiss tourism.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.410
And what I did is I did the
original tour that Thomas Cook

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.670
did 150 years ago.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.620
Very luckily, a woman
wrote a diary.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.510
I didn't put on a big skirt
and say, I'm a lady.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.020
But I did do what they did,
going around the same places,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.750
the same itinerary, the same
overnights, same hotels where

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.260
possible, to see how much
a change, see what

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.160
had stayed the same.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.420
This is Switzerland.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.810
Quite a lot had stayed
the same.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.930
Change happens very
slowly here.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.372
Change would not be a winning
election theme for anyone in

00:47:07.372 --> 00:47:09.180
Switzerland.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.970
But a lot of things had
changed, obviously.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.460
And those changes, a lot of
the time, the British were

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.707
involved, because the British
were too lazy to walk up

00:47:16.707 --> 00:47:19.696
mountains, so the Swiss built
trains to take them up.

00:47:19.696 --> 00:47:22.820
And they wanted bathrooms, so
the Swiss built nice hotels

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.040
with bathrooms.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.620
And so a lot of the stuff
we take for granted in

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:30.150
Switzerland, 150 years
ago, didn't exist.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.950
Switzerland was a very
poor country.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.170
There's parts of the diary where
she talks about beggars

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.830
and parasites.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.370
And it reads like she's visiting
an Indian slum.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.172
But actually, she's on
the lake at Lucerne.

00:47:41.172 --> 00:47:43.140
And it's a very different
picture of Switzerland.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.305
So it was quite interesting
in that respect.

00:47:45.305 --> 00:47:47.560
That comes in October
this year.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.490
It's the anniversary.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.630
I have a website, also, where
I write once a week about

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.360
Switzerland--

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.190
different topics.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:58.690
So last week, I wrote about
these strange building poles

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.856
you get on flat pieces of
land in Switzerland.

00:48:01.856 --> 00:48:03.550
The first time you come,
what are they?

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.010
They look like anorexic martian

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.790
spaceships have landed.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.030
And of course, they're showing
you how big the building will

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.380
be that is going to be built,
because they have to by law,

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.550
so that people can object
if they want.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.425
And if it's going to be a tall
building, they have these

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:18.220
giant [INAUDIBLE] type things
with guide wires to stop them

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.700
falling over.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.870
So just little things I notice
or about Swiss news.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.950
Obviously, Facebook and Twitter,
where I also talk

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.430
about different Swiss things.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.210
And you're more than welcome
to have a look at them.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:34.230
You can contact me through
any of them or even

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.850
ask a question now.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.470
And I will have some
books afterwards if

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.610
you want to buy one.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.735
For those of who didn't get one,
I'm happy to sell them

00:48:41.735 --> 00:48:42.806
and sign them for you.

00:48:42.806 --> 00:48:43.792
Thank you very much.

00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:53.159
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:53.159 --> 00:48:55.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, we want to
open the floor to questions,

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:58.215
if anyone has questions about
his book, about life in

00:48:58.215 --> 00:48:59.995
Switzerland, or anything else.

00:48:59.995 --> 00:49:01.290
I'll bring the microphone
around.

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.490
Oh, [INAUDIBLE] is setting
one up there.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.875
DICCON BEWES: You can ask
anything you want.

00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:09.060
I may not answer,
but you can ask.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great, so if
anyone else has a question,

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.367
then we'll just line up
at this microphone.

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:14.834
That'll make things
really easy.

00:49:14.834 --> 00:49:16.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:21.631
I have observed that the Swiss,
in general, seem to

00:49:21.631 --> 00:49:23.873
have very beautifully taken
care of gardens.

00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:26.817
But you never seem to actually
see them in them.

00:49:26.817 --> 00:49:27.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:27.314 --> 00:49:29.302
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:29.302 --> 00:49:30.793
Have you noticed that--

00:49:30.793 --> 00:49:31.787
DICCON BEWES: It's little
elves at night.

00:49:31.787 --> 00:49:33.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
going on there?

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.850
Are they just for show?

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.710
If they have these amazing
gardens, why don't they--

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.922
DICCON BEWES: Because a lot of
Swiss people don't own their

00:49:39.922 --> 00:49:41.475
own property--

00:49:41.475 --> 00:49:44.410
it's about half the ownership
rate that it is in Britain,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:44.880
for instance.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.835
It's about 35% here own
their own property.

00:49:47.835 --> 00:49:48.910
Most people rent.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.340
And in the cities,
it's even lower.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.600
In Bern, for instance,
it's 11% owners.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.040
So very often, it belongs to the
building, and there will

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.650
be a man responsible for them.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.020
And he will come around during
the day at some point and do

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.750
the garden, as well as clean
the staircase and make sure

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.765
the laundry room is working and
everything, sort of like a

00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:10.200
janitor for each building.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.700
And very often, it's a man who
has retired from his normal

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.325
job, and he'll have two or three
buildings to look after.

00:50:17.325 --> 00:50:20.170
But for people who do own their
own property and own

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:23.125
their own gardens, I think
it is a labor of love.

00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:29.260
And they do do it, like most
things in Switzerland, to

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.740
immense detail so that it looks
wonderful all the time.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.135
Of course, a lot of people have
what in England we call

00:50:36.135 --> 00:50:37.380
an allotment.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.710
So it's a communal
patch of land

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.210
belonging to the community.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:44.810
And you get a small patch
which you can rent.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.895
And there are rules about what
you can and can't grow and how

00:50:47.895 --> 00:50:49.685
much thereof.

00:50:49.685 --> 00:50:52.050
And you can only have a certain
size summer house and

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.072
things like that.

00:50:53.072 --> 00:50:55.560
But for many people, especially
if they live in

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.770
bigger blocks or flats,
that's their escape.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.070
And they use that instead.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.950
But no, it is beautifully kept,
most of the country.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.250
I think the biggest problem
here is graffiti.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.990
You see a lot of graffiti,
far more than

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:08.855
I ever say in England.

00:51:08.855 --> 00:51:12.730
And maybe that's just one
release for a certain part of

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:16.700
society, because society is
quite controlled and quite

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.580
perfect in many ways.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:23.190
The graffiti is an acceptable
way of rebelling.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.440
Thanks.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:26.510
Hi.

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.210
Just a small remark about
the car thing.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:34.800
The word "car" from "coach"
actually comes from French,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.960
and it seems to have been
completely independent of the

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.070
English word, "car."

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.200
DICCON BEWES: Yeah, it is.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.770
But the confusing thing is is
that when you're in the

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.930
German-speaking part, you don't
really expect to see it.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.920
I mean, that picture
I took was in Bern.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.600
So even if you speak French, you
might think, oh well, but

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.300
I'm in the German-speaking
part now.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.715
But I noticed that a
lot of Swiss German

00:51:55.715 --> 00:51:57.160
words are French words.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.360
So that when I arrived
I had schoolboy

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.420
French, not very good.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.400
And I didn't have any German.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.140
But I knew what [FRENCH]

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:05.972
and [FRENCH]

00:52:05.972 --> 00:52:09.640
meant, because they were French,
even though Swiss

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.760
German speakers used them.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.830
In a menu, you only
ever see [FRENCH].

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.487
It's only when you go to Germany
you realize, actually,

00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:20.370
I don't know the German word
for chicken because I never

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.420
had to learn it.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.640
Or I don't actually know what
a bicycle is in German,

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.820
because you can get by with
using the French.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.010
So yes, that is true.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.850
A lot of French words do creep
into Swiss German.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.248
AUDIENCE: And Italian.

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:34.120
DICCON BEWES: And Italian.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.008
And of course, you get a lot
of Swiss men who have

00:52:37.008 --> 00:52:38.995
perfectly Italian names because
they're second or

00:52:38.995 --> 00:52:41.736
third generation, and they speak
no word of Italian and

00:52:41.736 --> 00:52:43.390
have never been to
Italy, probably.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.020
But they are Swiss Germans
with Italian names, which

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.303
confuses me always when they
pop up on television.

00:52:53.213 --> 00:52:54.195
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:54.195 --> 00:52:55.070
DICCON BEWES: Hi.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.520
AUDIENCE: Switzerland is
one of the wealthiest

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.810
countries in the world.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.590
Could you give top three
reasons for that?

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.870
DICCON BEWES: I think the quick
answer is I don't know,

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.660
I don't know, and
I don't know.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:15.900
It is a mystery, and it's one
I'm trying to come to terms

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.160
with given that 150 years
ago, it was one

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.820
of the poorest countries.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.440
There were pockets of wealth--

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.270
Zurich, Bern.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.590
The cities with their
guilds and their

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.580
traders were very wealthy.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.830
But the countryside was very
poor and really scraping a

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.050
living off of the land
and nothing else.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:37.580
Which is why tourism was taken
on so quickly, because if

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:41.350
you're earning one franc a day
working in the field, which is

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.850
what they were-- and
that was what a

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.200
breakfast cost in a hotel.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.180
So the Thomas Cook tourists
would come.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.100
And they'd pay for breakfast
what would take

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.480
a whole day's wages.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.065
But if you then can earn 10
francs a week, or 5 francs a

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.510
day, or whatever working in the
tourist industry, then of

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.010
course, you give up the land
and move to tourism.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.300
It's partly that.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.310
It's partly the banks,
obviously.

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.420
The banks have been here
for a long time.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.190
Geneva banks have been around
for hundreds of years.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:12.830
But banking secrecy, for all
its problems that it's now

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.050
giving, did mean that a
lot of money was here.

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.350
And the banks were able
to lend it out to help

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.601
businesses set up.

00:54:20.601 --> 00:54:22.940
It's partly the Swiss
are very careful.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.880
They don't spend beyond their
means, generally.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.900
There's no national debt
here to speak of.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.500
And you get votes
in communities.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.640
Like Lucerne, for instance,
recently had a problem with

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.440
their finances.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.230
So they voted to put up the tax
to cover the hole in the

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:44.370
finances, which is kind of not
what most voters in other

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:45.706
countries would do.

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:53.585
But they see it as a
responsibility to look after

00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:56.628
their community but also
for long-term planning.

00:54:56.628 --> 00:54:59.118
So you have a lot of investment
in the train system

00:54:59.118 --> 00:54:59.900
and other things.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.020
So it is partly the Swiss
nature to be very

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.200
cautious, to plan.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.590
And if you think, even when they
were farmers, they were

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.390
farming in some of
worst country in

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.660
Europe in terms of farmland.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.460
And yet, they still made
a living from it.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.210
So I think they're very
resourceful, very innovative,

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.910
as I saw with all those
inventions.

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.625
You can't invent LSD and
not become rich.

00:55:24.704 --> 00:55:27.232
Hurrah, a woman.

00:55:27.232 --> 00:55:30.118
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
confirming my theory of the

00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:33.004
little elves coming out in
the night [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:33.004 --> 00:55:34.447
It's totally what
I think happens.

00:55:34.447 --> 00:55:39.046
DICCON BEWES: It's about 3:30
AM when they come down our

00:55:39.046 --> 00:55:40.768
street, anyway.

00:55:40.768 --> 00:55:44.800
AUDIENCE: So the public
transport here and the

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.380
facilities always astonish me,
because if you were to

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.790
transplant that to where I come
from, it would be a wreck

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:52.375
within a week.

00:55:52.375 --> 00:55:53.576
DICCON BEWES: Which is where?

00:55:53.576 --> 00:55:54.980
AUDIENCE: Pakistan.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.670
So you give the people the
facilities, they'll use them,

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:04.887
they'll tear the seats apart,
they'll take whatever can be

00:56:04.887 --> 00:56:06.137
moved, et cetera.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.680
What is this attitude?

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.430
How can you build an attitude
of so much respect for

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.010
property that we have here?

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.400
You said hundreds of years
ago, they were very poor.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.812
Did they have the same attitude
then as well?

00:56:19.812 --> 00:56:21.100
DICCON BEWES: Probably.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.330
I mean, I think it's
two things.

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:25.080
One, it's partly the trust that
I talked about, that they

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.810
trust each other to
behave properly.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:32.190
But it's also the fact that
because the system, from the

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.200
very beginning, from 1291, when
Switzerland was founded,

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.668
it was three cantons together.

00:56:38.668 --> 00:56:41.590
They'd never had a president
who's had any power.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.025
They have a president who
changes every year to shake

00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:45.486
hands but doesn't
have any power.

00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:46.947
They've never had an emperor.

00:56:46.947 --> 00:56:48.895
They've never had a
military governor.

00:56:48.895 --> 00:56:52.520
They've never had any form of
central control, really.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.990
Napoleon came.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.015
He tried, he failed, he went.

00:56:56.015 --> 00:56:59.130
A bit like the story of
Napoleon, really.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:00.700
And it was the same
in Switzerland.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.090
He invaded, he conquered.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.110
He set up the Helvetic
Republic.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.650
It lasted five years, because
the Swiss just couldn't deal

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:08.100
with central control.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.600
And because they've always
had a sense of,

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.640
we are in this together.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.450
We are a community, whether
we're three cantons or 23

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.290
cantons or eight
million people.

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:20.430
And so if you make a mess
of the train, then I

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.420
have to pay for it.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:27.160
And so if there's that sense
of communal responsibility,

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.780
which possibly used to be there
in other countries-- my

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:35.210
parents talk about Britain in
the 1950s as if it was some

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.060
sort of utopia, which
I'm sure it wasn't.

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.570
But there is that feeling that
Switzerland sometimes is the

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:44.940
same as another country was
maybe 30 years ago.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.670
And so there's still that
feeling of community here.

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.440
And if you have a problem, or if
someone wrecks the trains,

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.940
then it can be decided by the
people what happens in terms

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.305
of, does the train company
get more money?

00:57:58.305 --> 00:58:00.200
Because at every level--

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.120
community, canton,
or country--

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.850
the people can decide.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.830
So in Bern, for instance, we
recently voted on should we

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.990
extend the tram line
out to the suburbs.

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:14.000
Where else in the world would
you vote on that sort of

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.590
minute detail?

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:20.790
Or should we build bus stops
with a roof over them of not?

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.130
Or should we extend opening
hours to 8 o'clock

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:25.010
instead of 7 o'clock?

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:26.360
And things like that.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.110
It sounds like very detailed,
boring stuff.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.730
And sometimes, it is.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:33.850
But if the people are asked all
the time what they think,

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.140
and the rules are made by the
people, then I think there is

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:41.252
a bigger sense of communal
responsibility than if they're

00:58:41.252 --> 00:58:43.682
told what to do.

00:58:43.682 --> 00:58:46.112
It's just a theory.

00:58:46.112 --> 00:58:46.610
Hi.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.917
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:58:47.917 --> 00:58:52.490
I'd be curious, since you only
hear an outsider's view of

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.465
Switzerland, I'm curious what
Switzerland thinks of all its

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:59.012
outsiders here in the country
and if we're changing the

00:58:59.012 --> 00:59:01.630
country or they're changing
us, sort of that whole

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:02.660
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.135
DICCON BEWES: Oh, how diplomatic
should I be?

00:59:08.105 --> 00:59:13.460
I think as in any country,
you will have a divide--

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.340
typically a left-right
divide--

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.340
on the view.

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:22.260
When I first arrived in 2005,
the first election campaign I

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.630
experienced was the one with the
black sheep, the one that

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:29.180
would be classed as racist in
Britain, with three white

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.920
sheep kicking a black sheep
off the Swiss flag.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:37.300
Now, of course, even my not
right-wing Swiss friends say,

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.960
well, it's just turn of
phrase, the black

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.060
sheep of the family.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.590
But for me, it was overtly
racist and

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:46.280
shouldn't have been allowed.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:51.290
And I think it fostered a
climate of latent xenophobia,

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.100
even if you're white
and Christian,

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.910
an acceptable immigrant.

00:59:55.910 --> 01:00:00.970
I have still experienced
insults, abuse, because I

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:03.610
speak high German, although my
German isn't so high anymore.

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.090
It's a bit polluted.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:08.410
But in the shop, people would
speak to me in Swiss German,

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:09.830
and I'd reply in high German.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.710
And a couple of people got so
angry we had to call the

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:17.810
police because I was speaking
that Nazi language.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.090
But you get that in any
society, of course.

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.840
There's intolerance.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.160
But I think here, it's accepted
by the general

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.110
populace in a way that I don't
think is acceptable.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:34.660
So therefore, what in other
countries would be passed as

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.820
extreme becomes mainstream
here.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.200
And I've noticed that over
the last few years.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.350
And of course, it is exacerbated
by the increasing

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.430
number of immigrants.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.486
Since Switzerland joined
the [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:47.486 --> 01:00:51.830
area and free movements of
people within the EU, despite

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:55.405
not being an EU member, a lot
of Germans, especially, have

01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:57.150
moved here.

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:01.290
And in Zurich and Zug, you hear
a lot of German voices.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.951
And to me, that's wonderful,
because I can

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:06.090
understand them perfectly.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.430
But I can understand also why
a lot of Swiss people--

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.170
Swiss Germans--

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:13.610
feel insecure about that.

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.325
There's this big love-hate
relationship between

01:01:16.325 --> 01:01:17.720
Switzerland and Germany.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.780
It's a bit like Canada
and America, only

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.720
the other way up.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.530
It's like they're taking
over our culture.

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.560
We're different from
them, but we speak

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.600
roughly the same language.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.240
Is it a dialect?

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:28.860
Is it a language?

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.800
Is it an accent?

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.500
And it's all to do with Swiss
national identity.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.103
And then, of course, you just
have the fact that Switzerland

01:01:38.103 --> 01:01:39.830
never had an empire.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:44.490
So whereas Britain has had
centuries of immigration from

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:48.150
different cultures, different
races, different religions, in

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.320
Switzerland, it's a
fairly new thing.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.850
Even the immigrants in the '60s
were Catholic and white

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.295
because they were Italian or
Portuguese or Spanish.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:58.660
And then in the '90s came white
Muslims from the former

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.036
Yugoslavia.

01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:02.860
And so it is a new thing for
Switzerland to have to deal

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.324
with multiculturalism.

01:02:05.324 --> 01:02:07.700
And that's why you have a lot
of insecurities about

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.800
minarets, about wearing the
burka in public, about

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.650
swimming lessons for girls.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:16.850
And it's a very public debate,
which is good.

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.205
And it's probably more of a
debate than you would get

01:02:19.205 --> 01:02:21.290
about it in Britain, because
things are decided by

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:22.710
referendum.

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:25.280
But that being said, because
it's a public debate, you

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.490
sometimes hear and see things
which you think, actually, I

01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:31.910
don't want to hear
and see that.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.120
It's an interesting situation.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.910
It's sometimes uncomfortable.

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:37.290
As a foreigner here, I
feel uncomfortable.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:40.270
And sometimes, I feel
more than welcome.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:44.565
Learning the language changed
everything, except when I go

01:02:44.565 --> 01:02:47.690
to Neuchatel somewhere
and then have to

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.100
speak my awful French.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.180
But learning German has
obviously made a difference,

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.250
because then people actually
know you are making the effort

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.940
to integrate.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.180
Integration is a two-way street,
as far as I see it.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.270
Hi.

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.490
I'm just curious to know how
much of the things you were

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:05.280
talking about--

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.667
like spontaneity and the habits
in parties and things

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:12.600
like that-- apply also to the
French and the Italian

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.950
cantons, if at all.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:19.180
DICCON BEWES: They do
to a certain extent.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:22.770
I think the interesting thing is
when I go and give talks in

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.720
Lugano and Lausanne, which are
not the same place, by the

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.740
way, with different names,
as someone once asked me.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.795
Is Lucerne, Lausanne and Lugano,
is that just all the

01:03:31.795 --> 01:03:34.980
same place with German, French,
and Italian names?

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.910
It's kind of logical.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:41.620
Genf is Geneva is Ginevra.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.310
They all change.

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:45.910
But I think the interesting
thing is when I go and give

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:49.310
talks in the Swiss [INAUDIBLE]
in Ticino, the Swiss people

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:52.130
there say, oh, and of course,
that's German-speaking

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.450
Switzerland.

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:54.400
That's not us.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.450
But the expats living there,
almost all of them say, this

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:02.930
is my life, just in French
instead of German.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.750
And it's partly a perception
thing.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:08.295
It's partly the Italian
and French--

01:04:08.295 --> 01:04:10.927
and we mustn't forget the
14 Romansh speakers in

01:04:10.927 --> 01:04:12.177
Graubunden.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.310
They want to be part
of Switzerland.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.600
They don't want to be part of
France or Italy, because they

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.580
know they would just be another
ignored province and

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.270
totally forgotten about.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:24.188
Whereas in Switzerland,
they have a role.

01:04:24.188 --> 01:04:28.720
They have a voice, which they
wouldn't have if they were in

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.670
their respective language
countries.

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:34.545
So they want to be part, but
they still feel like a

01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:35.910
minority, because they
are a minority.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:39.500
65% of the population
is German speaking.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.445
And so they want to feel
like they're different.

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:42.815
And of course, there
are differences.

01:04:42.815 --> 01:04:44.750
There are differences
in every country.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.220
If I go to the north of
England, I don't even

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.936
understand what they're
saying.

01:04:49.936 --> 01:04:53.070
Spend the day in Newcastle,
and I'm lost.

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.037
And there are very big
differences in any country.

01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:58.422
And here, the differences
appear bigger

01:04:58.422 --> 01:05:00.330
because of the language.

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:04.060
And I think, actually, from an
outsider's point of view, the

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.320
differences are much smaller.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.640
They're still there.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.740
So for instance, you can quite
easily go out for a business

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.820
lunch, as I have done, in the
French-speaking part, and

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.120
everyone will drink wine.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.577
Which here, doesn't normally
happen so much, because we all

01:05:19.577 --> 01:05:21.625
know we'll fall asleep
during the afternoon.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.290
But you still get the thing
where people in

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.996
Geneva contact me--

01:05:28.996 --> 01:05:31.940
I've lived here four or five
years, and still, my Swiss

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.690
neighbors haven't really
said more than hello.

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:38.182
So it's still breaking through
that clique, breaking through

01:05:38.182 --> 01:05:39.590
that coconut.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:42.720
And so every town can
be different.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.780
And I get emails from people,
why didn't you

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.810
talk about my village?

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.658
It's so different.

01:05:47.658 --> 01:05:49.660
It's like, I'm really
sorry I couldn't

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.510
talk about every village.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:51.780
It's not a guidebook.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.380
And of course, there
are differences.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:58.560
But I would say as a general
rule, what makes the Swiss

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.630
Swiss applies in all areas.

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:05.555
Otherwise, they would feel
French and seem French and not

01:06:05.555 --> 01:06:06.805
just speak French.

01:06:11.703 --> 01:06:12.689
Oh, dear.

01:06:12.689 --> 01:06:14.661
A second question.

01:06:14.661 --> 01:06:16.180
I must have said something
wrong.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.835
AUDIENCE: When speaking of
languages, why do you think a

01:06:18.835 --> 01:06:24.290
country that has four official
languages works in

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.510
Switzerland, whereas, for
example, it doesn't work in,

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:28.710
say, Belgium?

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:32.730
DICCON BEWES: Well firstly, I
should point out that Romansh

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.680
is a national language, not
an official language.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.870
It's a typically Swiss
hair-splitting definition.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.850
But it means that it's a
national language, but all

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.510
documents and everything
and signs don't

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:46.100
have to be in Romansh.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.300
So if you get official stuff on
the government website, for

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.260
instance, it doesn't have
to be in Romansh.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.731
But if they're dealing with a
Romansh speaker, then they

01:06:53.731 --> 01:06:54.840
have to do it in Romansh.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.540
It is a national language.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.470
But it's only been a national
language since a referendum

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:00.480
decided that in about 1935.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.570
I think here, it is
interesting as to

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:04.200
how they can coexist.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.850
Partly, they all had to learn
one of the other languages in

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.200
school, as well as learning
English as well.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.252
And there's a big debate as to
which should come first.

01:07:12.252 --> 01:07:15.720
And partly, it's again that
sense of community.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.580
We all choose to be together
as a country.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.560
So we all have to get along,
even though we speak different

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.922
languages, because if we didn't,
we would fall apart,

01:07:23.922 --> 01:07:25.172
like Belgium.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.135
But what they do is
make it very easy.

01:07:31.135 --> 01:07:34.220
So in Parliament, you can speak
in your own language.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.743
And the presumption is is that
people will understand.

01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:41.378
And if they don't, it's their
fault, because they haven't

01:07:41.378 --> 01:07:43.850
learned your language.

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:45.640
And so there is that
presumption.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.860
I find the further
you get away--

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.340
it's called the Rostigraben, the
divide between the German

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.439
and the French bit, because the
Germans speak [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:54.439 --> 01:07:57.433
and the French speak as
[INAUDIBLE], basically.

01:07:57.433 --> 01:07:59.429
Oversimplification.

01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:00.830
But it's called the
Rostigraben.

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:05.520
And the further east you get
from it, the less likely you

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.870
are to get by in French.

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.910
So in Bern, you can get by in
French and in [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:13.325
almost not at all, whereas
the same applies.

01:08:13.325 --> 01:08:15.550
Gregor, my boyfriend,
speaks no French.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.979
He grew up in Liechtenstein,
so he learned English.

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:21.840
So as soon as we cross the
imaginary border, he can get

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.149
by in German in Fribourg,
for instance,

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:26.540
because it's almost bilingual.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.960
But as soon as we get further
into the French-speaking part,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.924
they actually will speak
English with

01:08:30.924 --> 01:08:33.319
you rather than German.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:35.630
And he'll say something in Swiss
German, and they'll say,

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:37.050
oh, I don't speak
that language.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:38.370
And I say something in
English or my bad

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:40.420
French, and it's fine.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.744
And of course, you can go to
Geneva and speak English

01:08:42.744 --> 01:08:46.165
almost everywhere, because a
third of the population is not

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:48.229
even Swiss.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:54.149
But I think it is-- it's an
interesting conundrum, two

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:55.509
religions as well.

01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:58.479
And the last war of religion was
1847 with the Sonderbund

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.416
[INAUDIBLE].

01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:03.000
How come they can get along
with four languages, two

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.649
religions, 13 parties
in Parliament?

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:08.939
And yet, it still functions.

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:13.630
And it's partly to do with
everyone is included all the

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:15.720
time or has the chance
to be included.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.438
Not everyone is included,
because a lot of

01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:18.666
people don't bother.

01:09:18.666 --> 01:09:21.612
And obviously, none of the
foreigners can be included,

01:09:21.612 --> 01:09:23.470
because we don't count
in electoral

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.650
terms, political terms.

01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:28.470
But everyone has the chance
to have their voice heard.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.870
No one can say, I
wasn't asked.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:32.670
No one can say, I'm
not important.

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:34.862
What I think isn't important.

01:09:34.862 --> 01:09:38.210
And so you always have that
chance to have your voice

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:43.172
heard, which I think is possibly
what makes it work.

01:09:43.172 --> 01:09:46.796
In Germany, you say [GERMAN],
which means a nation that is

01:09:46.796 --> 01:09:48.240
only held together because
they have the

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.120
will to be held together.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.899
It's much easier in German.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:56.010
They exist because they want
to, not because of

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.508
geographical boundaries or
political boundaries or

01:09:58.508 --> 01:10:00.745
religious boundaries or
language boundaries.

01:10:00.745 --> 01:10:02.453
They exist because
they want to.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.200
This side of the room
is being very quiet.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.853
I'm not leaving until we get one
question from over here.

01:10:14.304 --> 01:10:17.262
Well, that worked.

01:10:17.262 --> 01:10:17.755
Hi.

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:19.420
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Pascal.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.176
DICCON BEWES: I know.

01:10:20.176 --> 01:10:21.128
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:21.128 --> 01:10:22.560
So much for my nationality.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.495
No, I was actually wondering
if you have noticed any

01:10:26.495 --> 01:10:29.541
particularities when the Swiss
is actually outside of the

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:32.668
coconut, when he goes
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:32.668 --> 01:10:34.320
DICCON BEWES: You mean
outside Switzerland?

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when he
goes abroad, is he--

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.160
DICCON BEWES: He
becomes Swiss.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.556
AUDIENCE: He's probably
easy spottable.

01:10:38.556 --> 01:10:40.420
DICCON BEWES: Basically,
he becomes Swiss.

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.443
There is a famous saying that a
Swiss is only Swiss when he

01:10:44.443 --> 01:10:45.660
leaves the country.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.450
And when he's in Switzerland,
he's Bernese or

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:51.174
Ticinese or a Thurgauer.

01:10:51.174 --> 01:10:54.170
And so you're only Swiss when
you leave, because when you're

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.780
here, your canton is
more important.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.950
Because Switzerland, as an
entity, is only 150 years old,

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:00.683
roughly 1848.

01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:05.650
Before then, it really was a
confederation of individual

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:07.750
almost city-states or
country-states.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:08.430
I call it an island.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:11.190
It was really more like
an archipelago.

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:13.790
And sometimes, it feels like
26 little countries roughly

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:16.840
going in the same direction,
because each canton has its

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.780
own laws and flags and police
and education system and tax.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.890
It's a bit like the states in
America but even more so.

01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:27.020
So I think Swiss people
can become more Swiss

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.910
when they're abroad.

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:29.880
And they actually talk to other
Swiss people much more

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.260
willingly than they do when
they're in Switzerland.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.750
And they become much more house
proud about Switzerland

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:45.445
and become a little bit less
accepting of criticism than

01:11:45.445 --> 01:11:47.710
they would from people
who are actually

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.470
living here, for instance.

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:52.440
But I think that's the case
for a lot of people

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.898
when they go abroad.

01:11:53.898 --> 01:11:56.465
They defend their country a lot
more than they would at

01:11:56.465 --> 01:11:57.270
home, obviously.

01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:02.340
And also, Swiss expats, the
so-called "fifth Switzerland."

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.340
You have the four national
languages here, and then the

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:07.080
fifth is all the Swiss
living abroad.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.860
Some of them, I get emails from
them saying either, oh,

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.315
it made me so homesick.

01:12:13.315 --> 01:12:14.800
That's just what I remember.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.880
And when I visit my family
and everything,

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.270
it's just how it is.

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:19.470
And then others say, you're
got it completely wrong,

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:22.560
because they are remembering,
little bit rose colored, what

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.341
Switzerland was like
before they left.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.420
And so they feel the urge to
defend it if they feel I'm

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.860
being too critical.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.465
But I think that's true of
almost any nationality abroad.

01:12:33.465 --> 01:12:36.090
I don't think the Swiss are
actually any different.

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.770
When they're outside
the coconut,

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.310
they become more peachy.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:43.460
Still waiting.

01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:47.314
A questioner.

01:12:51.443 --> 01:12:53.888
See now, we're all going
to watch you walk.

01:12:53.888 --> 01:12:55.138
It's here.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:59.320
It'd better be worth it.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.776
AUDIENCE: The very left edge
of the room, as you wanted.

01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:11.540
So first thing, please assure
me if I understood well.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:18.740
In the beginning, Swiss people
are not asking questions which

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.090
might be private, against
me, for example, right?

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:23.340
So not--

01:13:25.255 --> 01:13:26.580
DICCON BEWES: Invading
your privacy.

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.580
AUDIENCE: Violate my
coconut, right?

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.075
So how--

01:13:30.075 --> 01:13:36.015
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:39.975
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
coconut [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:39.975 --> 01:13:42.770
as well, right?

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:45.584
DICCON BEWES: Mental image was
very, very [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:45.584 --> 01:13:46.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.960
DICCON BEWES: Better than
violating your peach, I think.

01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:53.415
AUDIENCE: Whatever you like.

01:13:53.415 --> 01:13:55.890
DICCON BEWES: Yes, OK.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.860
Pick a fruit, any fruit.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.345
Not the banana, please.

01:14:00.345 --> 01:14:04.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.285
AUDIENCE: OK, and--

01:14:06.285 --> 01:14:07.770
DICCON BEWES: And
the question.

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:13.540
AUDIENCE: So the question is,
how they dare to ask private

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.178
questions when you want to
rent a flat, they ask

01:14:17.178 --> 01:14:18.480
[INAUDIBLE].

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.980
Depending on who you meet,
they go in more or less

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.460
private stuff, right?

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:28.300
And they are ready to reject
you once you don't want to

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.540
share some private
information.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.750
They ask about--

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.441
DICCON BEWES: I think that's--

01:14:34.441 --> 01:14:37.450
AUDIENCE: In my country, I feel
violated with many of

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:41.328
those questions that I see on
those forms and when I am

01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:44.304
asked in my face when
I look for a flat.

01:14:44.304 --> 01:14:46.075
And how does it go
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:14:46.075 --> 01:14:46.920
DICCON BEWES: I think--

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.684
I've been lucky in that I've
never had to look for a flat

01:14:49.684 --> 01:14:52.120
here, thank goodness.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.140
It's party a difference
between business--

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.050
AUDIENCE: Lucky you.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:57.290
DICCON BEWES: Yes.

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.050
Renting a flat is a business
thing, rather

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.400
than a social thing.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.580
So different rules apply.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.660
And it's also they want to
be sure that you are an

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.530
upstanding person, because you
are going to be living in

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:09.930
their property.

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:13.160
And so they ask you what they
probably think of as moral

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.230
questions, like do you do
drugs, or whatever.

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:17.410
I don't know what
they ask you.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:22.420
But it's also a question here
of sometimes political

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.215
correctness or that
privacy boundaries

01:15:26.215 --> 01:15:27.400
don't actually apply.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.830
I have a friend who applied--

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:33.220
she was working in a company
already, and she

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.470
applied for a promotion.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.700
She's a 30-year-old
woman, married.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.790
In her interview, they asked
her, so when are you planning

01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:42.886
to have children?

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:45.600
Now, in England, that kind of
question would be illegal,

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.200
because it's nothing
to do with her

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.810
ability to do the job.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:53.170
But as far as the employer is
concerned, it is, look, are

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.080
you a good risk for the next
three years or whatever?

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.240
So those kind of what we think
of as very personal

01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.530
questions--

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:03.570
maybe personal questions about
your lifestyle, for instance--

01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:06.640
are actually, in the Swiss
eyes, seen as practical

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.810
questions to determine whether
to go ahead or not for a

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:12.840
longer term.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.030
I know it's a very two sides of
one coin, and sometimes it

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:19.780
can feel very invasive.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:23.820
Like for instance when I applied
for jobs here, first

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.330
thing my boyfriend says is,
well, your CV hasn't got a

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:29.470
picture on it, because
pretty much, CVs here

01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:30.620
have pictures on them.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.870
And I said, well, what I look
like has nothing to do with my

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:34.970
ability to do the job.

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:36.970
He said, yes, but how will
they know if you fit in?

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.470
Well, exactly.

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:44.640
Whether I fit in or not has to
do with whether I'm qualified

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.305
or whether I'm experienced
enough to do the job, not

01:16:47.305 --> 01:16:50.710
whether I'm male or
black or whatever.

01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:53.810
And so there are different
rules.

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:58.050
And I think if you come from a
society which has slightly

01:16:58.050 --> 01:17:00.520
different expectations
and rules, it

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.910
can seem very intrusive.

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:04.670
But I think it's seen
as practical

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.290
here, rather than intrusive.

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:11.280
It doesn't help, I know.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.055
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because during
talk, you said that during

01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:21.860
business events, you should
apply some of those Swiss

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.720
rules, right?

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.990
To not bring our humor on
the table, et cetera.

01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:29.930
But now, I hear that when
there's a business event, some

01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:31.095
rules might be broken.

01:17:31.095 --> 01:17:33.090
DICCON BEWES: Well, yeah,
but you're not the one

01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:33.880
breaking the rules.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.790
That's the thing.

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.460
If you then turn around to your
prospective landlord and

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:41.375
say, well actually, are you
married or do you have a

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:43.362
boyfriend or whatever, he would
probably not take too

01:17:43.362 --> 01:17:45.722
kindly to that.

01:17:45.722 --> 01:17:48.350
So different rules apply
in terms of status.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.590
AUDIENCE: The nature of
my question was how to

01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:51.560
distinguish, right?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.970
We, as foreigners,
how to behave.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:54.760
That was the meat
of the question.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.220
DICCON BEWES: I think the best
advice, really, is behave the

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.490
way the people around
you are behaving.

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:02.780
If your boss and your colleagues
almost never make

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:07.160
jokes in meetings, then the idea
is don't make a joke in

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:07.520
the meeting.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.720
AUDIENCE: And still protect
your fruit.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.560
DICCON BEWES: Well, I've really
developed a thick skin,

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.456
become a little bit
more of a coconut.

01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:17.424
Turn from a peach
to a coconut.

01:18:17.424 --> 01:18:19.884
Become a hairy peach.

01:18:19.884 --> 01:18:22.590
It is difficult, and it's one
of the hardest things about

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:26.580
integrating here is keeping
your own sense of self and

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.290
your own culture but
also fitting in.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.173
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, I think
we have run out of

01:18:36.173 --> 01:18:37.416
people to ask questions.

01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:38.350
DICCON BEWES: Well,
we can leave.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:39.838
Now we've had one
from this side.

01:18:39.838 --> 01:18:40.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, good.

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:42.318
We've had both sides of
the room represented.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.310
So it's good.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:45.294
DICCON BEWES: I obviously didn't
look at them enough

01:18:45.294 --> 01:18:45.790
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:48.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: So thank
you very much for the

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.652
presentation, Diccon.

01:18:50.652 --> 01:18:51.133
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:51.133 --> 01:18:52.576
He's staring you down now.

01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:57.386
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:57.386 --> 01:19:00.272
DICCON BEWES: Thank you.

01:19:00.272 --> 01:19:02.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: We'll be
moving from here to the

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.590
Android tent in just
a few minutes.

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.160
We have App Row set up there.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.110
There will be books for sale in
case someone wants to buy

01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:11.445
one of Diccon's other books.

01:19:11.445 --> 01:19:13.920
Or if you didn't get a free copy
of the book today, he's

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.455
selling the book we
discussed, also.

01:19:15.455 --> 01:19:17.855
DICCON BEWES: Or I can
sign the one you were

01:19:17.855 --> 01:19:18.400
given, if you didn't--

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:18.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yes.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:21.022
And he's happy to sign, if you
brought one from home or you

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.340
got one today.

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.440
Great.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.570
Before you go, we wanted to
present you with a thank-you

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:28.025
present for your time.

01:19:28.025 --> 01:19:29.275
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:33.845 --> 01:19:36.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
a very googly gift.

01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:37.240
It's a "don't panic."

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.558
DICCON BEWES: Oh, wow.

01:19:39.558 --> 01:19:40.027
Thank you.

01:19:40.027 --> 01:19:42.372
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] for
the hitchhikers on their

01:19:42.372 --> 01:19:44.248
adventurous travels.

01:19:44.248 --> 01:19:47.080
DICCON BEWES: That's perfect
for-- if you've never been to

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.792
Bern, which I suggest you do,
because it's Switzerland's

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:52.636
most beautiful city--
sorry, Zurich.

01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:54.970
In the summer, you can go
swimming in the river.

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:56.400
And it's a very fast-flowing
river.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.450
It's like a liquid traveling
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:00.900
Basically, you jump in, and you
don't have to do anything.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.660
It carries you around
the whole city.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.057
It's wonderful.

01:20:05.057 --> 01:20:07.502
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we have
a nice Swiss theme.

01:20:10.925 --> 01:20:14.837
DICCON BEWES: Of course, when
they invented Google+, they

01:20:14.837 --> 01:20:18.279
thought Swiss-themed cushions.

01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:19.758
Thank you very much.

01:20:19.758 --> 01:20:21.237
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you, again.

01:20:21.237 --> 01:20:27.153
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:27.153 --> 01:20:29.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: So anyone who
wants to join for App Row can

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.630
make their way to the Android
tent, and we'll see you there

01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:33.980
in just a few minutes.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.230
Thanks.
