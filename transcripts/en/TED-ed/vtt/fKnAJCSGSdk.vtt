00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:09.446
Today ,more than half of all people in the world

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.366
live in an urban area.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.694
By mid-century, this will increase to 70%.

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:16.782
But as recently as 100 years ago,

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.491
only two out of ten people lived in a city,

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.615
and before that, it was even less.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.700
How have we reached

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.785
such a high degree of urbanization,

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.180
and what does it mean for our future?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.250
In the earliest days of human history,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.000
humans were hunter-gatherers,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.709
often moving from place to place

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.645
in search of food.

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:36.744
But about 10,000 years ago,

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.831
our ancestors began to learn the secrets

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:40.204
of selective breeding

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.612
and early agricultural techniques.

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:43.881
For the first time,

00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:45.113
people could raise food

00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:46.555
rather than search for it,

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:47.938
and this led to the development

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:49.521
of semi-permanent villages

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.775
for the first time in history.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.271
"Why only semi-permanent?" you might ask.

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.036
Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:58.460
every few years

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.441
as the soil became depleted.

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.329
It was only with the advent of techniques

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.502
like irrigation and soil tilling

00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:06.044
about 5,000 years ago

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:07.664
that people could rely on a steady

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:09.501
and long-term supply of food,

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.913
making permanent settlements possible.

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:13.434
And with the food surpluses

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.056
that these techniques produced,

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.595
it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm.

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.992
This allowed the development

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.680
of other specialized trades,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.906
and, by extension, cities.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.986
With cities now producing surplus food,

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:26.974
as well as tools,

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:27.438
crafts,

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:28.572
and other goods,

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:30.509
there was now the possibility of commerce

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.405
and interaction over longer distances.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:34.742
And as trade flourished,

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:37.549
so did technologies that facilitated it,

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.467
like carts,

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:40.901
ships,

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:41.962
roads,

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.154
and ports.

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:45.320
Of course, these things required even more labor

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.789
to build and maintain,

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.987
so more people were drawn

00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:49.794
from the countryside to the cities

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:51.247
as more jobs and opportunities

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.960
became available.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.141
If you think modern cities are overcrowded,

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.461
you may be surprised to learn

00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.906
that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:03.909
nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.902
One reason for this

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:07.524
was that transportation was not widely available,

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:10.150
so everything had to be within walking distance,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.156
including the few sources of clean water

00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:13.774
that existed then.

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:15.407
And the land area of the city

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.648
was further restricted by the need for walls

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:20.116
to defend against attacks.

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:22.990
The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.043
to overcome these limitations,

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:26.327
but other than that,

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:27.628
modern cities as we know them,

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:28.943
didn't really get their start

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:30.940
until the Industrial Revolution,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.697
when new technology deployed on a mass scale

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:36.386
allowed cities to expand and integrate further,

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.672
establishing police,

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:38.271
fire,

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.782
and sanitation departments,

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:41.342
as well as road networks,

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:43.815
and later electricity distribution.

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:46.572
So, what is the future of cities?

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.475
Global population is currently more than 7 billion

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:52.227
and is predicted to top out around 10 billion.

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:53.730
Most of this growth will occur

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.023
in the urban areas of the world's poorest countries.

00:02:57.023 --> 00:02:58.943
So, how will cities need to change

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:01.134
to accommodate this growth?

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:03.309
First, the world will need to seek ways

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:04.754
to provide adequate food,

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:05.714
sanitation,

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:07.954
and education for all people.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.831
Second, growth will need to happen

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:11.713
in a way that does not damage the land

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:13.796
that provides us with the goods and services

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:16.513
that support the human population.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.590
Food production might move

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.713
to vertical farms and skyscrapers,

00:03:20.713 --> 00:03:21.795
rooftop gardens,

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:24.272
or vacant lots in city centers,

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:25.802
while power will increasingly come

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:28.689
from multiple sources of renewable energy.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.728
Instead of single-family homes,

00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:33.338
more residences will be built vertically.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.299
We may see buildings that contain everything

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.616
that people need for their daily life,

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.579
as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.701
focused on local and sustainable production.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.794
The future of cities is diverse,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:45.466
malleable,

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.328
and creative,

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:48.593
no longer built around a single industry,

00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:50.968
but reflecting an increasingly connected

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:53.087
and global world.
