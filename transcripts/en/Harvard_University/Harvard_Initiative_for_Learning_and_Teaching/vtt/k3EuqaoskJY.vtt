00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.300
So I want to make three
points about the theme

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.940
of evaluating teaching
in a research university.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.400
It's really important,
it's really hard,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.860
and it takes collaboration.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.980
So I'm going to take each
one of these in turn.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.680
On the point about it
being really important.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.450
One of our graduate school
of education faculty members

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.660
who does research on teaching
effectiveness in the K-12

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.930
sphere was corresponding
with me and others recently

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.910
and noted that when you
compare student achievement

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.380
gains between schools
or between teachers

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.040
within a particular school,
the difference between teachers

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.190
within a particular school
is two to four times

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.770
greater than between schools.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.120
What that means is that teaching
effectiveness, more than school

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.470
culture, is really what we
should pay attention to.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.120
And the way he thought about
the implications for higher Ed,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.050
given that research
in K-12, is that,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.680
if we care at Harvard,
not just about bringing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.990
in the smartest and
the best students,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.074
who are going to do great.

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:27.990
They're just going to
do great because they're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.220
so great when they come in.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.300
If we care about the
so-called value added,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.040
then there may be
no other issue that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.470
is important as evaluating
teaching and teaching skills.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.770
So the second point is
coming back to those issues

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.360
around that I mentioned about
these lunches and dinners,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.920
putting down the
foundation for what

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.760
the theme of the
conference would be.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.280
What we heard here in
the past couple of years

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.820
in particularly the faculty get
togethers, always, every one

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.350
of these discussions,
there would

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.070
be a moment where somebody
would say, how do we know?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.539
How do we know what we're doing
or whether if we try things

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.410
it's any good?

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.880
How do we understand whether
what we're doing matters?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.220
And so that question of
evaluating what works

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.640
and what doesn't is really
important and crucial

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.004
to the faculty who are
coming to these discussions.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:24.670
And then there's a
second point about it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.530
that I think is really
important, which is evaluation

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.730
makes people vulnerable.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.060
It's hard to be
evaluated for anybody.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.960
That's human nature.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.520
It's hard to be evaluated.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.980
And so what we heard in these
discussions among faculty

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.040
also is the incredible
care that they

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.000
have for teaching, and
wanting to do well,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.730
and the vulnerability
that they feel

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.940
over course
evaluations, evaluation,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.120
the structure of the university
and how we incentivize teaching

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.640
or don't incentivize teaching.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.940
I want to just say, at these
dinners, there were tears.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.360
They were there was intense
moments because it really

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.680
matters to people.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.720
So that's point one, importance.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.500
Point two, it's hard.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.390
Thanks to the amazing team
of archives at the Harvard

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.700
University Library, we found
out that people at Harvard

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.280
have been thinking about these
same issues for a long time,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.950
at least since 1874.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.656
In 1874, 1875 annual report of
the president to the overseers,

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:38.030
there were
suggestions about ways

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.950
to improve teaching
so that, quote,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.330
even the most
indifferent student

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.030
will find it
desirable to attend.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.510
And so that these
two, quote, banes,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.990
the banes being
absenteeism in body or mind

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.510
and the second one
being cramming,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.700
will become less prevalent.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.760
In 1902, a committee on
improving instruction

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.520
surveyed all faculty
and all students.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.840
And their responses are
in these paper volumes

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.040
that are just beautiful.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.090
There's these giant,
yellowed, rough

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.634
edged volumes that
exist in our libraries,

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:15.050
and you can go
through and you can

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.500
look at these handwritten
comments that students wrote

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.060
and instructors wrote.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.126
And the themes are
really the same.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:24.500
The language is
really different.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.950
You know, there was there
was a Department of Hygiene,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.380
Department of Mineralogy.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.350
Those departments don't exist,
and the students would say--

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.960
I've got this one
quote that I liked--

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.360
my style was often
criticized as stiff,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.990
and justly so, but when one
stock of interesting themes is

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.100
gone, one cannot
help being stiff.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.460
I don't think that's the way
a student would talk now,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.200
but they might
mean the same thing

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.400
when they talk about something
that came up in a classroom.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.270
In the report-- and
the report was authored

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.860
by a group of
faculty, one of whom

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.850
was Lowell before he was
president of Harvard.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.190
It brought up issues like the
average amount of studying

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.550
was discreditably small.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.487
Problems with large
lecture courses,

00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:16.820
but that they were here to stay.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.320
Large lecture courses
have problems,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.000
but they're here to stay.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.610
They suggested the use of
frequent quizzes, which we now

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.560
know is a really important
for teaching and learning.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.480
They talked about
the bifurcation

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.420
of students who are either
interested to go deep

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.550
and have specialized
knowledge, to kind of go

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.970
in an academic way, or
those who really needed

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.740
general background, and how to
try to design a curriculum that

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.940
met both of those needs.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.250
They recommended some changes.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.320
And they urged that
instructors should

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.170
read the comments of the
students in their own courses

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.000
and that the chairs
of departments

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.610
should read the comments
of all of the students

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.330
in the faculty
within a department.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.990
And as far as I can tell--

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.840
and I would love to
know differently--

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.190
all of the efforts
that came after that,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.530
no one knew that
there was a precursor

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.990
to course evaluations in 1902.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.440
We just keep reinventing things.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.680
All right.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.500
Just to give a sense of
how this keeps coming up.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.510
There was a report
of the Committee

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.220
on Instruction in 1927.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.730
A report in 1945.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.250
A series of essays in 1969.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.190
Through the '70s and the '80s,
there were a bunch of efforts

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.850
that, as far as I can tell, were
led by President Bok and Dean

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.380
Rosovsky at the time.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.050
And that really
was around trying

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.370
to formalize course evaluations.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.150
A report of the task force on
pedagogical improvement in 1977

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.630
takes multiple
pages to lay out how

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.980
to evaluate teaching, guidelines
for how to evaluate teaching.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.490
You could have written it today.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.150
It's a great summary of all
the things that you could do.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.440
It's multi-method, it's there.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.630
I'm not going to keep listing
these throughout time.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.890
I want to read one
note from a letter,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.260
from a professor of English
and comparative literature.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.290
It was written in
1975 to his dean.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.230
And I just thought it helped
to underscore another way

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.780
in which these issues are hard.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.380
The only thing that
can conceivably

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.750
be said in favor of the
course evaluation project

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.360
is that its finished product
is virtually unreadable.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.640
But I would sooner resign
my professorship at Harvard

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.510
than collaborate in any way
with such a hateful undertaking

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.260
which demeans those
who participate in it.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.468
It goes against everything
Harvard ought to stand for

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.000
and is postulated on an
almost total misunderstanding

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.740
of what education is about.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.450
It seems to me,
a graphic example

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.180
of the perversion of
values that characterizes

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.790
the entire undertaking that the
Dean of Undergraduate Affairs

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.450
should ask me to forego 15
minutes of educational time

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.110
to enable students to fill out
a meaningless questionnaire.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.560
It is also, I might add,
practically impossible.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.560
My lectures are not
haphazard musings.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.630
They are each carefully
contrived to present

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.110
a specific body of material
to precisely 53 minutes.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:32.010
So it's hard to make
change at this institution.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.370
So to the last point,
requires collaboration,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.390
I think it's precisely
because it's so hard.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.100
Meaningful evaluation
of teaching,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.280
it requires
collaboration and trust.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.390
And collaboration and trust
across different roles.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.830
And again, I want to pause for
a moment and come back to today.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.440
We've designed this
conference with people

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.830
with lots of different
roles on purpose.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.830
Partnerships between
academic professional staff

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.720
who support teaching
and learning,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.100
and instructors, and faculty,
and deans, are so important.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.690
And building up
those lines of trust,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.530
if we want to make a
difference, is so important.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.720
So when I think about really
trying to make progress

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.240
on evaluating teaching,
I think there's

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.350
no way it doesn't involve
chairs of departments, faculty

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.540
and instructors talking
with one another,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.940
really listening to students.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.240
What the students need,
what do they care about?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.017
Where do they come in
understanding or not

00:09:35.017 --> 00:09:35.600
understanding?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.016
How did they think
about teaching?

00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:39.140
How did they think
about their instructors?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.300
And this is something
that we, in hilt,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.570
have not been able to do
as well as I would like to.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.240
An initiative around
learning and teaching,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.370
how do we involve
students, I think

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.980
it's critically important
that we all do better

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.350
at listening to our students.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:01.060
I would like to invite president
Faust and our distinguished

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.120
university professors
to come up and we'll

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.890
start this conversation.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.040
Thank you, Erin.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.314
I love listening to those
historical tidbits, obviously.

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:17.140
But Erin shared a substantial
amount of material

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.410
with us about the past as
preparation for this panel,

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.066
so I thought it might be
good to begin with that.

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:24.940
By the way, does everyone
know who's up here?

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.420
You have bios, and I don't
have to introduce anybody?

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.970
Should I introduce people?

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.670
No.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.920
OK.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.770
So I thought I'd just begin
by asking your reflections

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.910
on the opportunity that Erin
gave us to dive into some

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.400
of the elements of the
past and I'll go historian

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.070
to historian here to start.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.041
And again, if you would.

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.790
Well, I thought the
research was terrific.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.720
And obviously, her point
that these issues have long

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.990
been with us is amazing.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.865
The students seem to
have gotten to it first.

00:10:55.865 --> 00:10:57.977
So in 1925, they set
up the Confi Guide,

00:10:57.977 --> 00:10:59.560
which was still going
in the '80s when

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.518
I was an undergraduate.

00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:03.550
But then it sort of faded
at some point between then

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.180
and now as Hugh really
stepped up its work.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.330
What really struck me was a
comment from a student in I

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
think it was the 1902
survey that she described

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.940
saying that he had taken
a particular course

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.037
with a particular
goal, and he'd gotten

00:11:18.037 --> 00:11:19.870
what he wanted out of
it, the literary work,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.130
the grade he'd hoped for, but
he hadn't felt it as satisfying.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.590
And he says, as is usual
when one engages in things

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.270
for mercenary purposes.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.060
That was a fascinating entry
into how students, even then,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.830
were conscious of
their different motives

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.630
for taking courses.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.940
And when always hopes that
takes courses out of interest.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.920
Other reflections, Gary?

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.940
Or Doug?

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.285
First of all, congratulations
on your promotion

00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:49.270
back to the faculty.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.820
So I think that the
history was great because,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.060
in the social and
behavioral sciences--

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.100
Drew is going from
division to the division--

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.420
we actually know a lot
more about evaluation

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.190
and about how to elicit
information from people

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.700
than they did in 1875.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.740
So right now, we're
evaluating at the wrong time,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.310
we're asking the
wrong questions,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.960
and we have the wrong
outcome variable.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.870
So it's the wrong time because--

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:27.420
imagine the Olympic
diving practice

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.830
where someone
dives and the coach

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.414
says, no, your toe was
wrong, get up, do it again.

00:12:33.414 --> 00:12:34.330
Then they do it again.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.340
And they say, no,
your leg went off.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.471
Suppose instead, the coach just
watched for the whole weekend.

00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:41.970
And then, at the
end of the weekend,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.830
they patted somebody on the
back, and said, good job.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.090
How much would they learn?

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.360
Not very much.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.272
So if you're one us
as teachers to learn,

00:12:49.272 --> 00:12:51.230
you don't evaluate once
at the end of the year,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.840
you do it in continuous time.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.820
That doesn't mean you
ask students questions

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.200
in continuous time.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.600
You find ways of doing it
in unobtrusive ways that

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.550
doesn't get in the
way of teaching,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.620
but it needs to be frequent.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.980
Instant feedback helps learning
of students and of faculty

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.370
as well.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:13.000
Second, it's we have the wrong
questions a lot of times.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.500
If you go have an
operation at the hospital,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.480
suppose they ask you a survey,
how was the doctor's technique?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.530
That's not information
you actually have.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.071
If we want to know
who's going to win

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.520
the presidential election,
we don't ask a random sample

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.160
of people who you
think is going to win

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.437
the presidential election
for each and every person,

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:35.020
because you don't have access
to information unless you happen

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.050
to be a researcher.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.550
Right?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.070
We asked you what
you know, which is,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.890
who are going to vote for?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.480
So we need to ask the
questions the right way.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.130
And finally, the
outcome is not what

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.110
the students say they learned.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.710
It's whether they
actually learned

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.280
and whether they remember
it a long time from now.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.370
Right?

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.829
And so we should
measure the things

00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:57.994
that we actually care about.

00:13:57.994 --> 00:13:59.710
We actually know about
these things now.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.390
We should bring
some social science

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.674
into what we're studying.

00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:05.640
Doug, any thoughts?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.390
I agree with what Gary said.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.590
What struck me in reading it was
maybe dispiriting in the sense

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.340
that things haven't
really changed,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.940
that the challenge between
the teacher and the student

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.930
remains the same.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.960
Students who want to
be entertained or have

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.730
some other reason
for taking the class.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.660
And the teachers are trying
to convey information.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.118
And that-- I don't know what
that's called-- that contract,

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:29.110
or that interaction
remains a challenge.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.000
But what struck me
more than anything

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.960
was that Harvard
professors gave low grades.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.160
There were many comments
about A's, B's, C's and D's.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.140
And I mean, if I were
to ask in this room

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.700
to raise your hand
if you've given a D,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.620
let's see how many people
have given a D. Yeah, right.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.200
It's a very small number.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.630
And so grade inflation has
been the biggest change

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.630
I would say comparing to what
they were concerned about

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.074
and how we evaluate
students now.

00:14:58.074 --> 00:15:00.490
But Gary brought up another
point that also struck me that

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.460
made me think about
evaluations in the longer term,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.450
and if I had any idea about
how to change evaluation--

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.760
and I don't have many ideas--

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.600
one would be, to Erin's
point of cooperation,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.460
to engage with the--

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.600
I forgot what HAA stands for,
Harvard Alumni Association--

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.410
and to give tests or evaluations
five years after students

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.130
have graduated.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.440
They ask them, what
do you remember?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.760
What's been useful?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.340
And they were to challenge
departments and the faculty.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.650
Like, what kinds of questions
would you want to ask?

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.399
Which would clearly
be different from what

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:38.380
you would ask, as Gary said,
during the rush of learning,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.970
the discipline at the time.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.340
You know, I get a kind
of anecdotal window

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.400
into that often when
I'm meeting with alums.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.850
One of my favorite aspects of
that is when one will tell me,

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.930
I will never forget this course
that I took 25 years ago.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.530
And I've thought
about it every day.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.800
And maybe I should be more
systematic and make a list

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.480
and at least tell the people,
if they're still alive,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.856
what the course was.

00:16:03.856 --> 00:16:05.230
If I can say
something about what

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.771
Erin said that makes
me a little more

00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:08.982
optimistic than the assertion
that nothing's changed,

00:16:08.982 --> 00:16:11.440
it just seems to be the way
everyone laughed at the comment

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.430
from the comparative
lit professor in 1975--

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.050
is that right?

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.550
That's the year I got my PhD.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.820
So it doesn't seem all
that distant in time to me.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.640
But no one would dare
say that now, right?

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.210
It's more embedded in our
expectations of ourselves

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.740
and our students'
expectations of us

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.720
that there will be evaluations.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.220
And it was while
I was at Harvard,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.594
I can't remember
if I was at grad

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:38.050
or was yet president that the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.720
voted that there
should be course

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.890
evaluations in every course.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.390
Up until then, it was voluntary.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.010
So I think it's become
more a part of the culture,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.840
that there should be
evaluation of teaching.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.300
One thing, Gary, that your
comments raised in my mind

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.674
and that I've been
thinking about

00:16:53.674 --> 00:16:55.360
since we began
having conversations

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.270
about this session
is, if we're thinking

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.870
about what successful teaching
is, that's so hard to define.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.950
Is it helpful to think about
what is unsuccessful teaching?

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.550
And what would be
information about teaching

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.829
that you would think, this
is a science, not working.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.720
So I'm going to connect
to your last two points.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.410
So I actually did collect some
of the information you thought

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.839
of collecting
systematically, only I

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.260
have a much narrower sample.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.230
So my sample is I go--

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.750
like everyone else
here-- go to give talks

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.980
at other universities.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.880
And I'll see a student that
took my course 20 years ago.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.650
So what I started
doing a few years ago

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.360
is asking them about it.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.640
And what they say
is, you know, I

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.500
remember when you
did that thing.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.000
Are you still doing that thing?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.010
And most of the time,
the answer is yes.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.810
But I actually want to know
whether I'm doing that thing,

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.460
right?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.330
And so I actually have a
systematic collection--

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.270
What is that thing?

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.029
Is it something--

00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.570
That's right.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.182
So that thing is different
for different people.

00:17:58.182 --> 00:18:00.780
Oh, OK.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.310
And that's the way
that they describe it.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.920
I mean, I could describe it
now, but probably shouldn't.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.060
But so I collected those things.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.390
And then I went to psychology
and asked them, well,

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.630
what things do we remember
20 years from now?

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.880
And so there's actually
an answer which

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.010
helps me design new classes.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.470
So the answer is
that there are things

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.980
that are surprising, unusual,
and have emotional content.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.450
So if you can't make
your students cry,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.340
then you can make
them laugh, you

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.610
can make them surprised
and interested.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.810
But doing something doing
something different.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.090
You know, I do this
thing where I climb up

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.451
on chairs for a particular
substantive purpose.

00:18:44.451 --> 00:18:46.950
Like, you don't want them to
remember that you did something

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.140
dumb, you want them to
remember that it connects

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.410
to some intellectual point.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.790
So there's research
on this, too.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.577
Any thoughts about
unsuccessful teaching?

00:18:59.577 --> 00:19:00.910
Gary, you had talked about that.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.540
Sorry, just to connect
it, the unsuccessful part

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.640
was all the parts
they didn't remember.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.430
And sometimes, that's
why we teach, right?

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.513
If they don't take it with
them, what's the point?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.704
Well, on the notion of
asking alums, first of all,

00:19:19.704 --> 00:19:20.620
it's going to be hard.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.420
It's hard enough to get
undergraduates to fill out

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.030
these questionnaires, and now
we've made them conditional,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.280
they can get their grades
early if they fill them out.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.610
So that got our
percentage of completion

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.120
much high up into the
'90s of percentages.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.950
And it's still not 100% now.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.740
So I worry about asking
alums to do tests,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.374
it's not going to
necessarily work.

00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:42.790
You know, I was just thinking,
there are all these surveys

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.180
that the HAA takes of alums.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.330
Like, did you ever hear
about the sex survey

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.770
that one class took?

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.930
Every single alum showed up for
the session on that reunion.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.720
But I wonder if they do put
questions about teaching

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.296
into HAA surveys?

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.420
We should think about that.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.440
I think that would
be fascinating.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.460
Anyway, excuse me
for interrupting.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.950
I think the next question to ask
is, what kind of course, also,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.658
do they remember?

00:20:03.658 --> 00:20:05.590
Was it the elective or
thing they took sort of

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.300
at the last minute or on a whim?

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.980
Or was it a required course?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.760
Or especially, a vivid one?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.470
I think, clearly, just
remembering which courses

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.970
you took is the first rule.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.800
And if you can get
remembered for something

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.587
you didn't class as
a tremendous success.

00:20:22.587 --> 00:20:24.670
Have you ever had an
experience where you thought,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.400
this was an unsuccessful
teaching experience?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.930
And you thought again about how
you were approaching something?

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:38.780
Yeah, I mean, revamping a
course and restructuring it,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.310
deciding that--

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.320
and I think I'm still
wanting to restructure

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.820
the course I'm
currently teaching

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.650
on the history of the book.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.250
So I've never felt like a
complete disaster, usually.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.080
But of course, immediately
after lecturing,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.464
I always have a list of
things I wish I'd said.

00:20:53.464 --> 00:20:55.130
And of course, now
I've learned to thing

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.070
to do is to write those
down and to put them

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.180
at the top of the
lecture for next time

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.860
so that they can get
factored in earlier.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.655
And restructuring, I
suppose, that's the challenge

00:21:07.655 --> 00:21:09.530
that it might be good
to share with students,

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.300
is how teaching
is a constant set

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.520
of decisions about tradeoff.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.400
And there isn't a perfect
solution, frankly.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.814
And so sometimes--
I remember one

00:21:17.814 --> 00:21:19.480
of the questions we
got in the head was,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.070
what's the most powerful
question you'd ask a student?

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.570
And I was thinking
I might ask them,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.221
what would you do differently?

00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:26.720
You know, ask them
to put themselves

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.680
in my position of having
to structure a course

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.680
and make decisions
that work more or less

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.620
well for different people, too.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.700
We're talking to so
many different audiences

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.380
in the same classroom.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.230
So all three of you are
university professors,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.960
highly honored scholars,
and teachers and members

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.710
of the community.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.620
And that both
reflects your impact

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.420
on the university
as a whole, but also

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.510
encourages you to reach
beyond your own fields

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.000
and your own
particular disciplines.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.200
How is teaching different?

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.390
What have your experience
has been teaching

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:04.340
outside the particular
field or area in which you

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.959
got your graduate
degree or in which

00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:07.250
you were originally identified?

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.360
What's that been like?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.090
And what have you
learned from that?

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.940
Maybe I'll take a stab at it.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.560
If I think of what's
been the best learning

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.830
experience for me,
it's teaching a course

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.640
with a person many of you
know, Michael Sandel, called

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.479
Biotechnology and The
Future of Human Nature.

00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:28.020
And I've learned a
lot about teaching

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.210
from teaching with
Michael, who is really

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.170
an excellent professor.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.732
The broader question
to ask is, what's it

00:22:35.732 --> 00:22:37.440
like to, say, teach
in the medical school

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.170
versus the college, or teach
different kinds of courses?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.720
I find each experience
quite different.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.360
Frankly, I don't
enjoy much, and I

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.490
do rather a little teaching
of medical students,

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.800
because they're, on
the whole, trying

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.450
to learn discipline
and learn facts.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.340
The graduate students
are different.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.140
Maybe one of the
most enjoyable things

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.310
I do, but I don't do it
very often, every few years,

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.580
is teach a freshman seminar.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.630
That's so fun because they
don't know what to expect.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.080
And it's really nice to
just have people completely

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.890
come unbiased to say what
college is going to be like.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.440
I guess the other
thing I've learned

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.090
is, unfortunately, impractical.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.490
If you ask me, how would
I-- to Gary's point--

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.850
best evaluate teaching?

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.990
It's by oral exams.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.600
And I only give those
as makeup exams.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.220
Because, I mean, even for
a class of 20 students,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.150
you can't give 20,
three hour oral exams.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.571
It's just not possible.

00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:36.070
If someone could
solve that problem,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.800
I think an oral exam
is probably the best

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.780
way to evaluate teaching.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.440
But I think we can't do it.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.050
So it's not a very good answer.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.574
Not great.

00:23:44.574 --> 00:23:46.490
Well, this semester, I
am, for the first time,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.510
teaching an extension
in addition to

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.070
teaching in a college.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.340
And I'm very grateful for the
way the Extension School has

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.920
worked out lots of pieces
of technology and ways

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.340
of using technology as part
of your teaching, which

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.120
I'm trying to take onboard
even in the classroom, too.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.670
And it makes one
aware, obviously,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.480
the extension school
is very different.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.610
Being a bit older--

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.990
not necessarily, though, I have
a high school student in there.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.640
And yeah, it's a
feeling of reaching out

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.275
beyond just our little world,
is a good one, I think.

00:24:22.275 --> 00:24:24.650
Although, I see there are
limits to how that can be done.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.220
But I'm very pleased.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.130
Do you find that these students
bring different questions

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.060
to the material?

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.800
Absolutely.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.560
And they also are each
very passionate about it.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.830
They're putting more on the
line as it were, taking time out

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.910
of working lives, and expenses
for that course, which

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.280
is a very unusual interaction.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.567
Is this course worth what
you're spending on it?

00:24:46.567 --> 00:24:48.150
Which is, thankfully,
not a a question

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.410
I have to ask the undergrads
in quite that direct a way,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.620
but it does mean they're
also very invested.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.340
And they do bring
different questions.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.470
Sometimes it hasn't
been a long time

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.830
since they've taken a
course or had a grand scheme

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.820
of historical periodization.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.820
But it's really helpful.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.860
I mean, I learn a tremendous
amount from my students.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.751
You know?

00:25:09.751 --> 00:25:11.250
Also, the undergraduates,
of course.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.958
And that's what's so
great about teaching

00:25:12.958 --> 00:25:14.610
is that it's
constantly a learning

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.030
experience for oneself.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.154
So I teach this
course where I have

00:25:19.154 --> 00:25:20.820
students from lots
of different schools,

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.340
and the undergraduates as
well, and graduate students.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.890
And I've actually had
students from every school,

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.440
but unfortunately, not
in the same semester.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.240
But there are lots.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:29.990
There are lots.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.904
And what you said, actually,
is exactly my experience,

00:25:33.904 --> 00:25:35.070
it's the questions they ask.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.670
That's really the only thing
that differs across the areas,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.150
because they're united by
their interest in research

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.240
in some way, or the products
of research, or maybe doing it.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.090
I teach methods, so it's
sort of how to do it.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.860
Myself, actually, I've been
trying to write something

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.510
on exactly this question.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.070
And I'm designing a component
of my class for the spring

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.570
that's--

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.730
the issue is that
from kindergarten

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.480
up through graduate school,
people are given a question

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.150
and then good students
do their absolute

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.110
best to answer that immutable,
unchangeable, fixed question.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.810
But the moment we graduate,
we're given any question we

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.310
want.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.018
We can change the
question along the way.

00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:24.210
If we're researchers,
and we've decided

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.980
to go interview
Indian legislators,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.460
but we trip over an archive
of interesting information

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.530
in New Jersey, like,
a great thing to do

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.210
is to switch topics.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.880
Students are never
given that task.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.660
And so I've often tried to get
them to change the question.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.020
But it's much easier
in the context

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.930
of people whose
discipline defines

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.589
questions in different ways.

00:26:48.589 --> 00:26:50.130
So when the
undergraduates see people

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.530
from the School of Public
Health and they realize

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.524
that could be an interesting
question, or across

00:26:56.524 --> 00:26:57.190
all the schools.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.745
And so I'm trying to figure
out how to bottle that.

00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:03.120
Because that's an important
part of the learning process.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.310
They're learning from
the different culture

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.020
of public health, or the
different culture of whatever.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.610
That's great.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.430
In their silo,
they learn what is

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.740
culturally important in
that group of people.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.350
And they're very
different groups.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.530
Like, in economics, you
take two graduate students,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.220
send them to different
graduate schools

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.830
on different parts
of the planet,

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.416
they take the same courses.

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:26.790
You take to
political scientists,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.330
send them to the same program,
they take different courses.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.790
In public health or in
medicine or whatever

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.850
it is, they analyze
questions very deeply

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.030
that, in many areas,
you would never

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.150
think in the sciences would be
acceptable as a broad enough

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:42.880
area.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.250
But we need people doing that.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.102
And so giving people
the understanding that,

00:27:47.102 --> 00:27:48.810
you know what, there
could be an audience

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.500
for your interesting
question in a different area.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.880
And what is an
interesting question

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.550
is just-- it's
culturally defined.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.960
You can find an important
question in lots

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.960
of different areas,
can be important.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.900
Listening to Gary
reminds me that one thing

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.610
I think the university's
done extremely well,

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.450
and you've supported, Drew,
is to bring to us a much more

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.720
diverse student body.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.970
And that's definitely
changed in my time here.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.530
And I think, for me, one
of our next challenges

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.020
now is to change this
national discussion about,

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.770
what do I get out of college
in terms of how much money I'll

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.170
make or what job I'll get,
and recenter the discussion

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.540
on changing who you are as a
person, you know, how to think,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.450
what a liberal arts
education means.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.750
And I think our nation
is losing that aspect

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.850
of advanced education.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.720
I don't have any idea
what to do about it.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.327
I mean--

00:28:38.327 --> 00:28:40.410
I think you raised a really
important point, which

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.440
is the external pressures
that would have us evaluate

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.080
our teaching and our
effectiveness based

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.640
on salary at first job.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.630
That was one right
one suggestion

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.960
that is so reductionist.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.140
And I'm often asked, well,
what would you use instead?

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.360
So that really puts
the question of,

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.900
how do we evaluate,
front and center,

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.010
in defining what our mission is?

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.430
Because essentially, this
question of evaluation is what

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.920
makes this a successful
institution and what doesn't?

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:14.070
So it really has enormous
implications as you point out,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.682
Doug.

00:29:14.682 --> 00:29:16.070
It's true.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.970
Well, Gary, you kind
of started this off

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.970
with a pretty searing
critique of the current way

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:25.460
of evaluating, or at least
with student evaluations.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.910
Do you think they have any use?

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.110
Should they be supplemented?

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.670
Should they be abandoned?

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.460
And how would you move us to
the suggestions that you --?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.620
So during the era of
big data, of the ability

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.160
to collect and analyze many
more forms of information

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.040
than we ever had
before, the books

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.120
that Erin found by sleuthing
through the library

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.590
have unstructured text.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.000
Which, for a century, we
didn't know how to analyze.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.990
And there were too
many of them to read

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.510
and really comprehend
all at once because

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.740
of so many different classes.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.690
Actually, we know how
to analyze them now.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.030
What a great project
for someone Somebody

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.290
should go back and do that.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.690
But I think we should go collect
a lot of forms of information.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.050
I don't want my teaching
evaluated based only

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.620
on whether students get a
job that make a lot of money,

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.890
at a famous place,
or whatever it is.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.510
But I would like to
know that information.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.090
Moreover, I think
my students might

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.330
like to know that information
as one of many components.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.920
And actually,
there's a lot more.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.590
So I think with digital
technology in particular,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.230
we can give faculty
continuous time

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.920
feedback on certain
aspects of what they do,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.230
and exactly how students read.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.880
Eric Mazur and I have a project
called Perusall where students

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.200
read, and they annotate a
reading, and collaboratively,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.630
answer each other's questions.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.840
We then know every movement
they make, everything they're

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.070
reading, everything about it.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.690
We use that for them.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.432
So it feeds back
information to them.

00:30:56.432 --> 00:30:58.140
And we can say, you
know, you are reading

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.300
in a particular way, that
in previous semesters,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.650
hasn't really worked.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.755
Here's a suggestion,
in an automated

00:31:03.755 --> 00:31:07.380
or non-humiliating private way.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.780
Similarly, if the
instructor is assigning

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.930
something that is not working,
the instructor gets to know.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.370
If there is material
that, on particular pages,

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.376
that students don't understand
or engaging with because

00:31:20.376 --> 00:31:22.500
they're making comments so
they're going back to it

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.860
and they're reading it
again, we can print off--

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.410
and we do-- a one page
student confusion report,

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.220
that the instructor can walk
into the class the next time,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.136
and just say, you know,
there's three things

00:31:33.136 --> 00:31:34.260
that you're confused about.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.970
Which is so much
better than what

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.490
I used to do, which is I would
walk into a class and say,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.450
any questions?

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.830
They all have questions.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.610
They never know them
when you ask them.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.110
Right?

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.507
Because they just
trumped across campus,

00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:47.340
they dropped their book
bag, and their coat,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.100
and they're preparing to
be entertained, right?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.940
But if we actually
know what's going

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.440
to generate the questions-- so
there's three things that you

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.104
don't understand,
here's the first one,

00:31:57.104 --> 00:31:58.770
and then they ask
questions because they

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.870
remember what it is.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.140
I love the idea of
a confusion report.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.180
I'm thinking of
all kinds of ways

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.586
we can benefit from
confusion reports.

00:32:08.586 --> 00:32:09.960
Anne, are there
things you'd like

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.860
to know that your teaching?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.860
I mean, you said you'd
like to know what someone

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.620
thinks 10 years later, but
other than that or in addition

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.152
to that?

00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:19.110
I think one thing I
learned from the Bok center

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.720
actually is this
quick response survey

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.790
at the end of class,
one thing you learned,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.820
one question you have.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.480
And to start sending
out an index card

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.400
is the efficient way of doing
that, and collecting them,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.600
which, actually, then gives you
fodder to start up next time.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.230
But I have also used
clickers to ask questions

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.270
that I wouldn't want
even a show of hands for,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.600
but that people can answer.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.790
So yes, I think some kind
of continuous feedback

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.550
would be fantastic at the level
of the lecturer or the class

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.390
meeting.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.360
And then also, I think a
mid-semester questionnaire

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.080
is key in any case.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.490
And there, a quick form
that people check boxes off

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.722
so there's no
handwriting and so on.

00:32:58.722 --> 00:33:00.930
But even a kind of a journal,
I think, would be good.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.092
If we could ask students to
think about what's going on,

00:33:04.092 --> 00:33:06.300
I don't know, every two
weeks or something like that.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.883
And actually, I
think, for me, to keep

00:33:07.883 --> 00:33:10.900
a journal would also be good
and trying to do more of that.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.380
So annotate my syllabus
for my own use next time.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.070
You know, what worked, what
didn't work, and so on.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.570
So that we could have-- and
then how that might be shared?

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.290
I don't know.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:23.640
If the continuous thoughtfulness
of thinking about the process,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.829
of teaching and of learning.

00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:27.120
Actually, one thing I find
really helpful in a freshmen

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.110
discussion group, in
those opening days,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.382
was to ask what their
vision of teaching is.

00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:33.840
I suppose one of
the classic models

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.760
if you have a pitcher
of stuff that you're

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.410
pouring into someone's brain.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.351
And you know,
obviously, no one can--

00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:41.850
that is actually an underlying
metaphor that a lot of people

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:42.520
have.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.631
And yet when you think
about it, it's ridiculous.

00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.130
You know, you're asking someone
to form, in their own brain,

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:52.590
on their own, by interaction
with their peers, us,

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.860
and just to get them thinking
about what learning means

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.310
and what might be involved
on their part versus my part

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.800
I think is great.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:07.780
So more metacognition
all along the way, maybe.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.090
Obviously, you don't
want to over analyze.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.820
That's another risk, you know.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.320
Right.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.960
Doug, any thoughts on this?

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.460
Well, I agree with
what's been said.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.369
And another aspect I
think we might consider

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:20.710
is something I know I've
discussed with Rob Liu,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:25.630
and Bill Anderson, and others,
is it's more difficult to do,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.139
but it's using the faculty
to evaluate the teaching.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.600
That's really very
touchy business, right?

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.020
To have your colleagues come
into class and say, you know--

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.290
It's retainment in law school
in the business school.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.155
It is, right.

00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:41.969
But I can tell you it's a
touchy business in the FAS.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.179
OK.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.510
And I think that
that's something

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.880
that we should somehow
encourage more.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.610
We had an unfortunately
bad experience

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.130
in my department, where I
think we try to pride ourselves

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.770
on good teaching, is a
new course was offered

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.670
and it was, by any
measure, a failure.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.480
The faculty didn't think it went
well and the students didn't.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.440
And so we had a faculty
meeting with the two faculty

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.990
members who taught it and
a lot of student feedback.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.230
And that turned out to be a
very good event, is to say,

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.300
this is our responsibility
as a department

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.510
to make this course better.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.790
How do we help you
teach it better?

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.300
How do we listen to
student complaints?

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.750
Really, there were complaints.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.390
But I don't have a good idea.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.990
I know more about how the
business school does it,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.460
where they have people
sit-in on classes.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.092
That takes faculty time.

00:35:30.092 --> 00:35:31.300
I don't know how to solve it.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.340
But I think in
terms of evaluation,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.890
evaluating teachers
as well as students.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.129
I guess part of this is--

00:35:37.129 --> 00:35:39.670
I don't know about others, but
I find the cue guide very hard

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.560
to read for my own assessments.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.940
I tend to focus--

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.430
because of my ego, I guess--
on all of these bad comments.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.050
You know?

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.420
Those are the ones I remember,
that he was a terrible teacher,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.000
he didn't care about
students, he was unavailable,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.310
he was intimidating.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.060
And even if that's a
small number of them,

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.160
those are the ones
that I remember.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.290
So I started to not
read them so often.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.450
I'd wait till the summer
and read them when

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.400
I'm on vacation or something.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.170
We've been focused on
teaching as classroom,

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.900
I think, mostly here.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.520
And one of the things
that I'm struck

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.740
by when I see ad
hoc files and we're

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.690
trying to evaluate teaching by
people who are being suggested

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.940
for promotion or appointment.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.650
Is there are many
kinds of teaching?

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:27.070
And not everybody is a performer
in a large lecture course,

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:34.580
or the kind of charismatic
actor that is so valued

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.330
in the student evaluation.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.860
So how do we think about the
other dimensions of teaching?

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.777
One's being a thesis advisor,
being in a small group.

00:36:42.777 --> 00:36:44.360
And Doug, I was
thinking that you also

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.340
are involved in a
form of teaching that

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.980
goes beyond the
academic program itself

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.920
in your role as a faculty
dean at Elliott House.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.330
You were teaching day and night.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.820
And that is the Harvard
model for the college,

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.560
that teaching takes
place everywhere.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.410
So how do we think
about evaluating?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.550
What should I do when
I get a ad hoc file

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.760
and I'm thinking about
teaching and wondering

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.350
is someone a good
graduate teacher,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.220
or a good mentor,
or a good colleague,

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.590
and teaching junior faculty.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.760
All those things.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.200
I wouldn't pay
too much attention

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.030
to the Q Guide scores.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.490
I'm not convinced that
that's the best measure.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.410
I think it's helpful
to some, but I don't

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.240
think that's the best measure.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.630
But you're right,
the one house I know,

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.030
Elliot House, when I asked the
students, the most interesting

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.190
conversations about
how they weave together

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.070
the things they've learned
in Anne or Gary's course,

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.390
and try to make
those connections.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.822
And so how we do that as a
faculty is a real challenge.

00:37:43.822 --> 00:37:45.530
The other thing I'm
sorry to tell you all

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.600
is when I usually ask them
who's teaching that course,

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.670
they can't remember the
name of the professor.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.540
They have no idea.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.820
They can sometimes describe
what he or she looks like,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.040
but they seldom know
the professor's name.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.870
That I find surprising.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.349
But it is a universal
effect among the students.

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.390
Particularly, if the course
was taught last year,

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.690
they have no idea.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.315
They have to look it
up on their iPhone

00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:07.730
to remember who taught them.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.140
I find that when
I ask students--

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.640
you know, making
conversation, when

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.690
I interact with
them-- say, you're

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.070
taking x, who's teaching it?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.590
That's about teaching outside.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.460
To answer your question about in
your position and the ad hocs,

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.250
how to evaluate teaching,
that's an important issue.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.170
I don't know.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.430
What do you two think?

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.010
Well, one on one teaching
is a crucial part

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.960
of what goes on
in the humanities.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.490
And those people
don't remember who

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.229
they are thesis advisor was.

00:38:36.229 --> 00:38:36.770
That's right.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.950
That's one way the teacher,
actually, I think, sticks.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.900
And one thing I have seen
done at other institutions

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:48.220
is to have students write
for their teachers, actually.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:54.890
But it is difficult to get
insight into that very direct--

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.830
obviously, though, you can
judge by how many, perhaps.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.210
In some cases, someone who--

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.835
because there's a
lot of word of mouth,

00:39:00.835 --> 00:39:03.290
I think, which
sort of translates

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.160
into student behavior.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.670
I would say the cue guide
is doing a real service

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:10.184
to the students in
terms of advising them,

00:39:10.184 --> 00:39:11.600
what the science
courses will say,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.391
well, I have this
background, and I thought

00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:15.080
this course was hard or easy.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.760
And you know, those
kinds of things

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.430
are valuable students advice.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:24.410
I agree about when to
read one's cue scores.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.030
Well, after the
fact, when relaxed,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.620
and when having a chance to
sort of decompress afterwards.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.210
Because there are always
inevitable disappointments.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.240
One thought that
someone suggested is you

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.220
could throw out the
lowest eval and highest

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:44.030
eval, sort of way of detracting
from the overall score being

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.220
brought down by a fluke.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.940
And the other phenomenon
to be aware of,

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.020
too, is that the bigger the
course, the lower the score,

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.960
then the course shrinks, then
the course gets higher cue

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.880
scores, then of course grows,
then it gets lower cue scores.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.690
And on we go.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.800
I mean, that's
sort of the cycle.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.410
So I suppose the course
reaches equilibrium somewhere

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:07.310
in between these gyrations.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.080
But it's hard.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:15.070
For you to get a
view is difficult.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.740
So Gary, is there a way to
use big data to evaluate?

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.550
Well, the answer's
always yes, but I'm going

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.380
to give a different question.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.490
That's comforting.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.640
So I think even the amazing
people that you consider,

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.480
these ad hocs have a finite
amount of time in their lives.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.530
And so one of the additional
questions that I would hope

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.840
you would ask is,
is there teaching

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.560
and research life incentive
compatible with each other?

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.360
Because if it's
not, then they need

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.550
to be devoting as much time
as they can to research

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.450
and as much time
they can to teaching.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.825
But if they're
teaching something

00:40:49.825 --> 00:40:52.124
unrelated to the
research, you know,

00:40:52.124 --> 00:40:53.540
they're just not
going to be doing

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.310
as well as the sum of the two.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.080
So this is actually
important for another reason.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.870
I think that we want all of the
people that through ad hoc--

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.370
and you're shaking
your head yes--

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:09.280
they all are going to be
above some level of teaching.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.094
But 100% of them,
without any question,

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:12.510
are going to be
great researchers.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.290
And we have to spend most
of the time in the ad hoc

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.520
on the research.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.730
So the thing that gets them up
in the morning, the thing that

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.480
got most people here, the
thing that is of most interest

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.780
and most exciting to people,
actually is research.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.050
But if you want to be a great
teacher, what do you teach?

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.100
What gets you excited?

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.558
That's the thing
that's going to be

00:41:32.558 --> 00:41:34.950
most interesting to the
students, it's your research.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.980
So I think-- and
then let's look at it

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.390
from the student perspective.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.000
I think it is almost a
travesty for a student

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.940
to go four years through
an institution like this

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.020
and not at least once have
an experience where they're

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.080
sitting at the table, making
some contribution that they're

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.320
capable of making, when they
see a discovery being made.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.990
I'm not talking about
them doing research.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.730
They should do that,
but that's separate.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.720
I mean, when Doug
or Ann says, ah-hah,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.310
that is a life
changing experience

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.324
akin to the kind of
stories that we tell

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:08.240
about when a student
goes to a foreign country

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.410
and spends a year.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.360
But this is an experience
that Harvard can give them.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.390
So that's the
question I would ask.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.030
So that raises the
question of how

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.440
is teaching different
and special in a research

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.620
university?

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.900
And I think you framed an
important aspect of that

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.650
in what you've just said.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.920
Any other thoughts about the
research, teaching connection,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.480
Anne or Doug?

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.930
It's a very tight one,
for me, absolutely.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.170
And I suppose that speaks to how
many different kinds of courses

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.800
one teaches.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.133
I always feel that you should
stretch yourself and teach

00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:42.080
in different-- but then, you're
actually actively researching

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.080
one of those different areas
you might be teaching in.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.439
And that's a delicate
balance, as you say.

00:42:47.439 --> 00:42:49.730
Because on the one hand, if
I keep teaching things that

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.646
are sort of adjacent to
your current research,

00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:54.080
you're bringing in new
insights into that research.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.400
And yet, if you spread
yourself too thin, then

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.030
maybe you don't have the same
level of enthusiasm or ability

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.820
to translate research
into teaching.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.650
So it is a delicate balance.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.404
But think that the two are--
that is the excitement, really.

00:43:10.404 --> 00:43:12.070
And of course, there's
graduate teaching

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:13.910
that's happening in here, too.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.420
And that the undergraduate
teaching is also

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.090
mentoring graduate
students, teachers

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:21.070
of those undergraduates,
and when all three levels

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.840
sync nicely, it's really great.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.380
Now that I think
of it, it relates

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.450
to your question about
how you evaluate teaching.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.120
And maybe I'll
exaggerate a bit, but I

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.730
don't think in the natural
sciences in undergraduate

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.250
would ever say the thing
that changed their life was

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.050
of course they took.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.580
It was instead the lab
in which they worked.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.300
It was, to Anne's point, about
establishing a relationship

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.990
with a mentor and a teacher
that they saw out of class.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.590
And I don't actually know how
much that counts in the ad hoc.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.910
I can't remember.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.880
I mean, same in my
lab, which I know best,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.120
there's about seven to 10
undergraduates every term

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.680
working in the lab.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.470
I don't even think I get
credit for that-- maybe I do.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.880
I can't remember
how that counts.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.640
But I mean, that's sort of
the most intense teaching

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.190
that you do, in a laboratory.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.500
And again, I know
Rob Liu's been very

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.290
keen on making
laboratory experiences

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.080
available for undergraduates.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.410
And the way we count that
both as course credit

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.510
and in terms of
your evaluation, it

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.290
might be something
worth revisiting.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.890
Well, we get lists
often of, these students

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.890
worked in the lab, or I
have this many PhD students.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.500
But we don't get much evaluation
of the quality of that.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.020
We have to assume that
the quantity of them

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.990
is a reflection of the
quality of the instruction.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.730
And it strikes me
also that we're

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.720
learning a lot from each other
about how to teach better based

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.730
on the evaluative mechanisms.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.889
We talk a lot about what
makes a good classroom,

00:44:47.889 --> 00:44:49.930
but I don't think we
thought very much about what

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:54.280
makes a good lab instructor, or
what makes a good dissertation

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.350
director.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.754
How do you work most
effectively in those realms?

00:44:58.754 --> 00:45:00.670
And that would be something
that I would think

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.836
would be really interesting.

00:45:01.836 --> 00:45:03.280
Big data has the answer to that.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:11.230
So you're asking a deep
research question, not one

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.360
that we can answer by
just sort of writing up

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.370
a couple of questions
and asking somebody.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:22.030
You're asking the causal effect
of a researcher, of a professor

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.010
or a mentor on the student.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.500
So let's first define
the quantity of interest,

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.670
what we actually care about.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.680
And then let's figure out
how we can estimate it.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.180
Right?

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.480
So let's just separate the two.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.760
So the thing that we
actually want to know

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.330
is you have two students that
are identical, let's imagine,

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:38.740
coming through the program.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.840
And one is mentored
by me and one

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.250
is mentored by someone else.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.820
And we want to know
what the effect is

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.130
of their whole career,
and how much they

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.570
liked it, and all
of the outcomes

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.070
that you could
possibly think of.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.350
That's a very difficult
thing to estimate.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.540
In the last 20 or 30
years, actually, we've

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.230
learned a lot about
causal inference.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.080
This is a very
difficult subject.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.810
We could design studies
to answer this question.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.176
You match students that
are not exactly the same.

00:46:04.176 --> 00:46:05.800
Then you correct for
the fact that they

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.780
differ in certain ways.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.210
You can't randomly
assign them to faculty.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.770
They get to choose,
but those are

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.090
threats to inference
that we can deal with.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.050
It's a big research
project, but I

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.210
think we should engage in that.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.930
And I'm thinking just about
a very utilitarian dimension

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.220
of knowing that.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.990
Let's say you're a
scientist in a lab

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.940
and you have nine
students working with you.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.240
And there's another
scientist who has two.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.790
And that scientist is aware
she or he is struggling

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.820
to figure out why don't
students want to work with me,

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.200
it's not my field.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.240
What is it that you
say to that person

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.490
or that somebody could
say that person about what

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:47.335
your magic fairy dust is that
the other person doesn't have?

00:46:47.335 --> 00:46:48.700
Do we know that?

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.370
I don't think we do, because
if we observe differences

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.357
between the two, there's an
entirely different question.

00:46:54.357 --> 00:46:55.690
So we observe these differences.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.850
I do this thing,
they do that thing.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.904
I have two students,
they have 10 students.

00:46:59.904 --> 00:47:02.570
And so if I start-- then there's
an entirely different question,

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.490
which is, suppose I start to
do what that person is doing,

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:10.330
would I get 10 students or
would I lose my two students?

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.330
We know democracies do better
than the non-democracies.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.790
But we know also that when
you take a non-democracy

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.350
and you try to make
it a democracy,

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.170
that doesn't actually work.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:20.999
That's great.

00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:22.540
Doug, you said
something a minute ago

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.490
that raises a
question in my mind

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.810
about the moment in
which we find ourselves.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.100
And it was your comment that
most meaningful experience

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.250
for a science student
is almost inevitably

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.430
a laboratory experience rather
than a classroom experience.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.920
And as you said that, I was
thinking about the implications

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.850
of that for digital learning
and how we now are in a moment

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:47.060
where we need to say, we have
residential education which is

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.540
incredibly complicated,
incredibly expensive,

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.140
because we believe it cannot be
replaced entirely by learning

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.210
online.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:03.690
So what are the aspects of
the residential, face to face

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:08.370
in Cambridge or in
Boston experience that we

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.650
need to foreground and nurture?

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:16.290
And what have the digital
tools added to your quiver

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.140
in terms of teaching options?

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.670
And how do you see
the relationship

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.340
between what you do
face to face and what

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.692
you can't do face to face?

00:48:25.692 --> 00:48:26.650
There's a lot in there.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:30.190
I would say digital tools
have been extremely valuable

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.860
and sort of data transfer.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.790
So that you could say gets
around just a lot of data

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.900
dumping to students for facts
they can learn on their own.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.420
They're very good at that.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.570
But your point about
hands on experience,

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.270
which is almost
a hackneyed term,

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:50.250
is extremely important in my
area of the life sciences.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:54.340
So you can watch a video
of a mouse being dissected,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.390
but it's nothing like picking
that mouse up, killing it,

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:01.041
slicing it open, and looking
inside its body parts.

00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:01.540
Thank God!

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.710
That's something--
that's something

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.210
you don't ever forget the first
time you looked inside a mouse.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.730
And that's true for
all aspects of sort

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.650
of experimental science.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:18.040
And again, in my field,
in biomedicine, we are,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.625
I think, unquestionably
in the richest community

00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:21.500
of that in the world.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.260
There's opportunities
for the students

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.680
to work in the biotech
industry at the hospitals.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.720
That is nothing
you can even come

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.880
close to experiencing online.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.070
And to your point, I
think that is something

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.740
we should emphasize for
the residential learning,

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:41.350
is that hands on experience
of dealing with nature.

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.030
That's something
you just can't do.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.420
Even though I do like those
Attenborough nature programs,

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.190
whatever they're
called, Planet Earth.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.140
I've learned a lot from them.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.420
It's just different
doing it yourself.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.700
And evaluate how we're
getting the proper balance

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.590
or not is evolving.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.200
Well, of course,
hands on experiences

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.460
are much more expensive.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.790
But I wouldn't be opposed to
reducing the number of classes

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.950
students took and increasing
their laboratory experiences.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.330
There's hands on in the
humanities, absolutely.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.750
For me, what comes to mind is,
in Houghton Library, you know,

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:17.270
you get to handle books that
are hundreds of years old.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.240
It's the oldest thing
most students will ever

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.221
touch barring some European
building in the Middle Ages,

00:50:22.221 --> 00:50:22.720
maybe.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.990
But it's very powerful for them.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.390
And it is something
that, obviously, can only

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:33.040
be done in small numbers.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.419
And yet, it's well worth
the considerable expense.

00:50:37.419 --> 00:50:39.460
That's one of the great
privileges of being here.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.630
And that goes back
in some ways, I

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.171
think, to what Gary said early
on about what people remember,

00:50:43.171 --> 00:50:45.390
something that they're
emotionally linked to.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.910
A live experience has, I
think, more emotional resonance

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.980
than a digital medium.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.540
Absolutely.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.710
Books are now digitized.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.660
And they're great tools for
accessing the text at any hour,

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.410
and looking at it
closely, and zooming in,

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.480
and all that good stuff.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.000
But I really hope that digital
engagement is married to one

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.787
a physical one, where you
still see the book itself,

00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:08.620
and you can ask different
kinds of questions

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.550
from looking at
the object itself.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:14.280
Should we be taking this
into account in some way

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.030
and should we be concerned about
colleagues or should students

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.030
be concerned about
colleagues who aren't taking

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:22.840
advantage of these
opportunities?

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.080
Is that an important
dimension of how

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.110
we think about our teaching?

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.450
If we actually do the
research and we demonstrate

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:32.760
that it has an
effect then there has

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.970
to be a reason to not use it.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.870
But I don't think
we know the answers

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.030
to all the questions
yet or to many of them.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.880
Well, obviously, a colleague--

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.330
I mean, designing your
own form of experience

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.530
is the key element.

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.620
And for some people, it may be
a really engaging discussion

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.030
on a difficult topic, could
have a similarly powerful

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.490
experiential component
to working in a lab,

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:00.770
going to see a real book.

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.890
So I wouldn't want to
put any constraints

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.810
on what constitutes
active learning

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.020
that way, hands on learning.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.210
One of the elements
that we often

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:17.030
use as a justification purpose
for a liberal arts education

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:22.900
is to talk about critical
thinking and ways of thinking.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:27.100
Do we understand
that and how we're

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.800
doing in meeting that goal?

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.340
Is there a way to
see an evolution?

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.930
I know there was a
critical thinking

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:39.170
exam that was given in a
number of institutions.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.710
And I think it was
difficult for our students--

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.600
it was so easy for our
students, actually,

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.460
that we didn't get
much variation.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.950
They all turned out to be
fabulous critical thinkers

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:48.770
on this scale.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.980
So the scale was wrong, I guess.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.310
But are there ways
that you evaluate that?

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:56.320
You evaluate whether
you're succeeding

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.720
at that in your students,
with your students?

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.460
Can I go tell
everybody in Congress

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.740
that we're building
critical thinkers

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.620
and I have the
evidence to prove it?

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.630
I don't know.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.740
I'm not sure I know what
critical thinking means.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.850
But in the sciences,
one thing we try to do

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:18.400
is to force students
to design experiments

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.627
that answer your questions
about the unknown.

00:53:20.627 --> 00:53:22.210
So if that's critical
thinking, then I

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.520
think that is an important
thing about what we do.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.660
Rather than telling
them what is known,

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.540
saying these are
interesting problems,

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.740
how would you solve it?

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.770
And I'd hope that we
teach them the kind

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.110
of disciplinary knowledge
they need to know what

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.870
techniques and approaches
they could take to a problem.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.520
But that's when they
get most excited,

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.440
is something where they can
make, as Ann said, a discovery.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.590
And in another way, you make
me think about how do we

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.860
encourage curiosity
rather than simply what

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.629
I call data transfer?

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.670
That's really what's so
exciting in the freshmen,

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:58.660
is they're just curious
about everything.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.720
I'd say, in history,
we've built ourself

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.050
a tutorial around
writing and rewriting,

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.540
and critically engaging
with secondary sources

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.310
and primary sources.

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:12.660
And I really do think we see a
progression in the way students

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.020
write at the beginning of
the term and at the end.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.990
In particular, the
big hurdle, usually,

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.421
is the concept of
historiography,

00:54:20.421 --> 00:54:22.170
in other words, what
other historians have

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.150
said about the past,
and how you can

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.120
engage with the
past in conversation

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.140
with those historians.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.810
And it's not what
people expect when

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.520
they walk into history course.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.510
And it takes a certain
amount of going over it

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:40.920
in from multiple
angles, but I hope

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.810
that by the end of the
semester, most people

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:46.290
have gotten that key
move, sort of, meta move.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:48.940
And they may or may
not deploy it later.

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:55.050
But the whole point is to
create that possibility,

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.070
for example, a senior thesis.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:00.520
Anything thoughts on
critical thinking?

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.900
Big data on critical thinking?

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.362
Well, I mean, like
Doug, I also don't

00:55:05.362 --> 00:55:06.570
know exactly what that means.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:07.730
And that's definitely
not the right thing

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:08.980
to say to members of Congress.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.890
I would say that it
basically involves

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:18.080
some kind of deep thinking
about a subject, which

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.174
involves a real motivation.

00:55:20.174 --> 00:55:21.590
It sort of connects
all the things

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:24.630
that we've been talking about.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.800
And so what I was thinking
about when you were talking

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.680
is sometimes I get
to talk to a student

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.600
and they explain their paper to
me-- this is back to my theme

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.840
about getting them
involved in research,

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.072
and either they're
involved in my research,

00:55:40.072 --> 00:55:41.780
or I'm helping them
with their research--

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.960
and there's a moment, in
addition to the one I described

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.500
earlier, where I point out
something in their research,

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.900
and I say, I didn't know this.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.797
And they look at
me and they said,

00:55:52.797 --> 00:55:54.380
what do you mean you
didn't know that?

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.860
You're the professor.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.540
And I get to say, no,
you don't understand.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.450
Not only did I not know this,
but no one in the history

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.430
the world has ever known this.

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.580
And you know this.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.826
Right?

00:56:06.826 --> 00:56:08.200
I remember when
I was a sophomore

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.770
and I had that experience.

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.100
And I thought, like, I
don't know what cocaine is,

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.530
but I'm glad I got this first.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.890
Because I have to do
it again and again.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.950
And that's the kind
of thing that it's not

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.110
critical thinking,
it's motivation.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:25.820
But once you have
that motivation,

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.280
you devote all of
your efforts to it.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.460
You think critically, you think
obsessively, you work on it.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.560
I love the cocaine.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.515
In the course of the discussion
so far, a couple of you

00:56:39.515 --> 00:56:41.570
have raised the issue
of vulnerability.

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.230
And when Doug said he finds
it hard to read his teaching

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.730
evaluations, and I have
to say, if he finds

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.530
it hard to read his
teaching evaluations,

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.803
I can imagine they're
only wonderful, Doug, so--

00:56:51.803 --> 00:56:52.303
No.

00:56:52.303 --> 00:56:54.240
They're not.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.000
But what about that element?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.420
Erin was talking about it.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:03.950
To be open to evaluation, to
really make evaluations work,

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:08.880
we have to have a willingness
for faculty to be vulnerable.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.450
And Erin talked about
building communities of trust

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:17.010
and a variety of other ways
of enhancing that welcoming

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:18.290
of critical feedback.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:20.040
How do you see that
among your colleagues?

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.870
Do you think it
is a problem as we

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:27.740
consider trying to enhance
our evaluative capacity?

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.750
What would get my attention
is if the university announced

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:37.230
that next term when I
teach, say, Introduction

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:38.760
to Human Development,
there would

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.920
be faculty members
from other departments

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.460
that came to take the class
and evaluate my teaching.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.820
That would get my attention.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.880
I'd be really
interested to know what

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:52.770
a historian thought about how I
teach that introductory course.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.190
And I think it would be
really fun for me, too.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:56.550
Of course, I think that's right.

00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:00.822
Creating a community of
teachers to talk about this.

00:58:00.822 --> 00:58:02.280
So at the level of
the departments,

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.470
at first level, and
then beyond that,

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.680
would be really valuable
not in terms of--

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.410
talking about teaching makes
us all conscious of what

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:13.770
we do often frankly,
out of imitation or out

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.650
of expediency because we
run out of other ideas.

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:21.120
And looking to someone else
in this spirit of exchange

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.820
and trust would be fantastic.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.520
Looking to a
professional teacher.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.020
Yeah.

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:29.285
Right, so sort of normalize
imperfection in a way.

00:58:29.285 --> 00:58:30.285
Gary, what do you think?

00:58:30.285 --> 00:58:32.720
We should collect
all this information.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.086
We don't know exactly
what to collect.

00:58:35.086 --> 00:58:36.710
Having teachers in
the back of the room

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.140
would definitely
get my attention,

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.960
but how should I react
to their opinions?

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.320
Like, you said something
that sounded clear to me.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.190
OK, that's fine.

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:49.280
But was it actually clear
to the freshmen in my class?

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.690
I don't know.

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.894
And that person doesn't
necessarily know the answer

00:58:52.894 --> 00:58:53.560
to the question.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.580
So listening to that
person's opinions

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.420
might not be the right answer.

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.690
On the other hand, they
might have useful feedback

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:01.010
for certain purposes.

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.720
So I just think that
there's a lot more

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.190
information we could collect.

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:07.010
It's becoming so much
more easier to do.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:10.000
It can be used for so
many more purposes.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.390
You know, just
think of students.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:13.890
Where do they get advice
about what subjects to take?

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:16.110
The other students in
their entry way, right?

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.740
Well now, it's pretty easy to--

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.200
and we should--
collect the whole path

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.750
that every student takes
all the way through Harvard.

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:26.060
And pretty much everything
that happens to them.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.100
And then we do that
for a little while.

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.650
And then the next person,
the next freshmen comes

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.540
into the dorm and
asks a question--

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.230
they can also ask
their friends--

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:36.709
but we can also give them advice
from the last 5,000 people

00:59:36.709 --> 00:59:38.000
that have gone through Harvard.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.300
I think it's a much more
systematic in summation.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.860
It doesn't tell them what to
do, it just says, you know,

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.630
you've taken this course, and
then this course, and then

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:46.640
this course, and you've
had this experience,

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.360
you know, at that point,
there's been about 50 people

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.770
that have gone that path.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.457
And they forked off
in two directions.

00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:54.540
Here are those directions.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.748
These are interesting things.

00:59:55.748 --> 00:59:57.470
You might actually
want to know that.

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.200
So that's useful
for the students.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.130
And there's very similar
kinds of information

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.960
we could have for faculty.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.880
You know, if people
have a, let's

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.340
say, 50 year
teaching experience,

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.760
that's an n of 50, that's
50 observations of teaching

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.750
evaluations.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.820
We can give them
an enormous amount

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.470
more information
than that, that they

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:17.980
couldn't have done in 1875.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:21.020
I think it would be really
salutary in many ways, too.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.910
And very valuable
for the Humanities

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.240
because I think we find
many maps of people

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.730
who went through Harvard
concentrated in humanities

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.740
and are now running the world.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.550
They're not unemployed.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.657
They're not living in
their mother's basement.

01:00:34.657 --> 01:00:35.740
They're running the world.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.690
And that would be
helpful, I think,

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:43.370
in making the case for choice,
and selection, and variety.

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:45.230
I do worry a little
bit about the big data

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:48.010
and how the
individual is still--

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:51.230
it just can feel like
a cog or a statistic.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.380
And you want to preserve
the sense of themselves

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.080
as blazing their trail.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.120
And so it would have to
be presented with care.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.860
And also the idea
that we do, in fact,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.610
know every time they
swept into their dorm

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.760
and where they
went, but in fact,

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.120
we don't use that information
because we want people

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.860
to be able to live the way--

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.559
I feel I lived largely
untracked in the old days.

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.100
And I just sort of
worry a little bit

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.890
about creating so much
self-consciousness.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.590
And so there's a balance.

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:25.030
It can be there if you want
to know maybe, rather than--

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:27.700
We should do it in
a way that helps.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.014
So yes, there's definitely
huge disadvantages.

01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:33.430
But these are things that are
possible now that have never

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:34.750
been possible before.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.670
We can use them in
really bad ways.

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.800
We ought to be able to use them
that empowers the students.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.710
So for technology,
we always say there's

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:44.001
a continuum from
fully automated, which

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:46.000
is like a driverless car
where you don't tell it

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.970
where to go, to fully
human, where a human being,

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.850
it's no longer possible for them
to include all the information

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:55.892
that they have access to.

01:01:55.892 --> 01:01:57.891
What you really want is
something in the middle.

01:01:57.891 --> 01:01:58.570
Right.

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:03.730
And it's not only a balance,
really, it's computer assisted.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.950
It's computer assisted
human lead technology.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:07.150
That's really what you want.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.610
But you want it assisted
in the right way

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.567
so that you get to lead.

01:02:11.567 --> 01:02:13.900
If we have a whole bunch of
computers that go to school,

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.590
that's fine.

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.950
But that's not what we're after.

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:19.990
So we have just a
few minutes left.

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.640
So what I want to do
is ask each of you

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.700
if you could do one
thing to advance

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.815
the evaluation of teaching
at Harvard, what would be?

01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:31.190
Not that it would be the only
thing, but the first thing.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:32.300
And I'm going to
leave Gary last,

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.216
because he's going to
give us a whole research

01:02:34.216 --> 01:02:37.400
plan that we will embark on.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.790
So Doug, I'll start with you.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.130
What would be one step that
you would take to improve

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.205
the evaluation of teaching?

01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:46.580
I think I come
back to this thing

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.610
I said earlier on,
is I'd like to know

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.740
what is change students'
lives when they reflect on it

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.250
five to 10 years
after they graduate.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.260
So not, whether they
got into graduate school

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.440
or medical school, but are
they happy with their life?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.240
What did they learn in our
concentration, in our classes?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.210
And what really
mattered to them?

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:09.040
And the trouble is, I don't
know how to ask that question.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.949
And you could ask that
in a conversation,

01:03:10.949 --> 01:03:12.740
but I don't know how
to ask it in a survey.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.010
But maybe the psychology
and sociology departments

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:19.130
can help figure out,
how do you probe that?

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:22.790
Because that is, after all,
the essence of a liberal arts

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:23.410
education.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.820
It's not to learn a fact
so that I can get a job,

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.040
it's to change who you are.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.390
So it's not a very good answer.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.931
So that's what I'd like to do,
but I don't know how to do it.

01:03:32.931 --> 01:03:34.350
I think it's a great answer.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:35.250
I agree entirely.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.260
The conversation, actually, one
on one conversation with alum,

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.270
the long graduated student,
is the greatest gift.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.970
You know, when a student comes
back to town and gets in touch.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.540
And so there's nothing
that you can supplement it,

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.060
but that's a key.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:53.790
Just, obviously, it's a small,
small piece of feedback.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:58.260
I suppose I would be interested
in seeing more of the peer

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.800
group faculty discussion
and working with the the Bok

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.356
center, and amongst ourselves.

01:04:03.356 --> 01:04:04.980
Maybe at the department
level to start,

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.080
because these conversations
are still pretty new, actually.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.500
And obviously,
what HILT has done,

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.210
and these kinds of gatherings
have been really important.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:16.030
So creating more sense of
shared interest in one another's

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:16.650
teaching.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:20.970
And just for fun, going
to other people's classes.

01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.950
Possibly, just for
the content, really.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.290
And to get ideas.

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.930
I think I think
that's a really low--

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.280
you know, obviously, it
would have to be voluntary.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.320
And it could be really rewarding
for all the people involved.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.410
So the concept that teaching
is a form of ongoing learning.

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:37.980
Absolutely.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.560
So that you have to be
vulnerable to learn.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.580
Because it has to mean--

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.929
you don't know everything yet.

01:04:42.929 --> 01:04:44.220
You don't have you're perfect--

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:44.845
what were they?

01:04:44.845 --> 01:04:47.230
50 minute lectures in which
they are entirely balanced

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.120
and thought there wasn't
time for one thing?

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:49.620
Yeah.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.340
That's great.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.720
OK, Gary.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.940
Drew put me last because
she knew I had no idea what

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.231
the answer to the question was.

01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:57.170
So it gave me time to think.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.440
So what I would suggest is--

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.530
so the-- I'm still thinking.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:07.050
The most important innovation
in statistics and data science

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.600
in the last few centuries
has been separating,

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.700
as I did a minute
ago, the quantity

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.360
that we're trying to estimate
from the way of estimating it.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.670
So I think we should
completely separate that.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:21.630
Let's have a committee
and have people come up

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:25.140
with all of the ways that all
of the things that we would

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.350
actually like to know, separate
from how we go and estimate it.

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:30.030
Over time, it's
going to be easier

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.770
to estimate those things
better and better.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:34.320
But let's figure
out, unconstrained

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.940
from the difficulties
of actually doing it,

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.262
what we would
actually want to know.

01:05:39.262 --> 01:05:40.720
I think that would
be enlightening.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.080
I think we talked about
a lot of them here.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.350
What we do is, before that
innovation in statistics,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.990
people would conflate the two.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.489
They'd say, oh, we want to
know about how well teachers

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:51.030
are teaching.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.113
So we'll ask the students.

01:05:52.113 --> 01:05:53.370
We'll write a question down.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:55.470
Actually, that's
a really bad way.

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:57.630
Writing your question
down is not a bad way,

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.380
but survey research
is really difficult.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.072
Just, let me make
one little eddy here.

01:06:02.072 --> 01:06:03.780
You think you can
write a question that's

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.080
really clear so a lot of other
people can understand it,

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.130
people that you don't know,
people that you really

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:14.887
don't know the details about
or their personal lives.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:15.720
And you can do that.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.340
We all think we
can do that, right?

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.900
We'll just write
it very clearly.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.610
After all, we're
all writers, right?

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.110
OK.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:23.510
So and you're not going to
have any misunderstandings.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.890
But how often have you
had misunderstandings,

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:30.000
massive misunderstandings, with
your spouse, or your parents,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.620
or your kids, that you've
known for 20 or 30 years?

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.280
Right?

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.490
So I that is actually
really difficult.

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.400
So not only is it
difficult to get it right

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.860
and get to get the
understanding right between two

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.070
people, a little bit like we
were talking about earlier,

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:45.660
but figuring out
whether that actually

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.780
estimates the thing
that we care about,

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.410
is an entirely
separate question.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:52.530
So I would I would hope that
we would separate the two.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:55.350
The second is a research
project, absolutely,

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:56.130
as you said.

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.350
But the first one is, we
might be able to set up

01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:00.000
what our goals are.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.930
And so let's have a
committee and focus on that.

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:04.710
Well, thank you.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:07.000
This was an extraordinarily
rich discussion.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.370
And I certainly learned a lot.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.210
And I'd evaluate your
teaching, just now,

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:11.880
as really outstanding.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.030
So thank you.
