about scale like all of you do right we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
about scale like all of you do right we
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.340
about scale like all of you do right we
want to maximize our reach and our

want to maximize our reach and our
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.550
want to maximize our reach and our
impact and we believe that fundamentally

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560
impact and we believe that fundamentally

you know our phones we have them with us
 

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.490
you know our phones we have them with us
everywhere and they have some amazing

everywhere and they have some amazing
 

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.900
everywhere and they have some amazing

look at this coffee table here it's not

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.290
look at this coffee table here it's not
 

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.650
look at this coffee table here it's not
just a bunch of pixels as humans we look

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:20.660
just a bunch of pixels as humans we look
 

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.450
just a bunch of pixels as humans we look
at it and we know that there's important

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:22.460
at it and we know that there's important
 

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.910
at it and we know that there's important
features that there are edges that are

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920
features that there are edges that are
 

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.740
features that there are edges that are
sharp and corners that we might bump

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:26.750
sharp and corners that we might bump
 

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.690

that it has a top and a bottom we know

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:31.700
that it has a top and a bottom we know
 

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.550
that it has a top and a bottom we know
that that object doesn't just exist in

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560
that that object doesn't just exist in
 

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.890
that that object doesn't just exist in
isolation we know that there are other

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:35.900
isolation we know that there are other
 

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.930
isolation we know that there are other
objects around it that that Vaes is on

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:37.940
objects around it that that Vaes is on
 

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.580
objects around it that that Vaes is on
top of the coffee table that the coffee

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:39.590
top of the coffee table that the coffee
 

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.740
top of the coffee table that the coffee
table is on you know near the sofa and

table is on you know near the sofa and
 

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.080
table is on you know near the sofa and
in fact we know not just about objects

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.090
in fact we know not just about objects
 

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.490
in fact we know not just about objects
in their relationship we know we think

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:45.500
in their relationship we know we think
 

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.620
in their relationship we know we think
about spaces we think about how this

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:47.630
about spaces we think about how this
 

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.660
about spaces we think about how this
coffee table is in a room and that room

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:49.670
coffee table is in a room and that room
 

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.550
coffee table is in a room and that room
has many things in it and as you start

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560
has many things in it and as you start
 

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.050
has many things in it and as you start
to think about and understand a space

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.060
to think about and understand a space
 

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.290
to think about and understand a space
you can actually consider not just the

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:56.300
you can actually consider not just the
 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.420
you can actually consider not just the
physical objects but what might also be

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:58.430
physical objects but what might also be
 

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.430
physical objects but what might also be
there you can imagine that if this

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440
there you can imagine that if this
 

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.710
there you can imagine that if this
family had a baby they might add some

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720
family had a baby they might add some
 

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.360
family had a baby they might add some
additional objects in fact it's not just

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.370
additional objects in fact it's not just
 

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.550
additional objects in fact it's not just
about what might be there it's about how

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560
about what might be there it's about how
 

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.830
about what might be there it's about how
the objects behave that there are things

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:08.840
the objects behave that there are things
 

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.870
the objects behave that there are things
like doorknobs and light switches that

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880
like doorknobs and light switches that
 

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.340
like doorknobs and light switches that
are interactive that have special

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:12.350
are interactive that have special
 

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.560
are interactive that have special
meaning and special functionality in the

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:14.570
meaning and special functionality in the
 

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.200
meaning and special functionality in the
context of that space and tango is all

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:17.210
context of that space and tango is all
 

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.840
context of that space and tango is all
about enabling phones to understand the

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:19.850
about enabling phones to understand the
 

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.060
about enabling phones to understand the
world exactly like we do in the

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.070
world exactly like we do in the
 

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.650
world exactly like we do in the
structure in a structured in deep

structure in a structured in deep
 

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.750
structure in a structured in deep
fashion and there's really three

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760
fashion and there's really three
 

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.880
fashion and there's really three
technologies that allow us to do that

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:27.890
technologies that allow us to do that
 

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.330
technologies that allow us to do that
the first is motion tracking there's

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:31.340
the first is motion tracking there's
 

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.060
the first is motion tracking there's
depth perception and aerial learning and

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.070
depth perception and aerial learning and
 

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.440
depth perception and aerial learning and
these are kind of the pillars that tango

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.450
these are kind of the pillars that tango
 

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.230
these are kind of the pillars that tango
is built on top of so with motion

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240
is built on top of so with motion
 

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.030
is built on top of so with motion
tracking it's all about how

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040
tracking it's all about how
 

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.980
tracking it's all about how
bring the phone understand where it is

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:41.990
bring the phone understand where it is
 

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.720
bring the phone understand where it is
in space both its position and

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.730
in space both its position and
 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.870
in space both its position and
orientation as you move around and you

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880
orientation as you move around and you
 

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.400
orientation as you move around and you
know I think well I have GPS doesn't

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.410
know I think well I have GPS doesn't
 

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.170
know I think well I have GPS doesn't
that already give me position I've got a

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.180
that already give me position I've got a
 

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.210
that already give me position I've got a
gyro and accelerometer doesn't that give

gyro and accelerometer doesn't that give
 

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.579
gyro and accelerometer doesn't that give
me orientation well they do but they're

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:54.589
me orientation well they do but they're
 

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:56.740
