way and we will intermingle the times so

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.110
way and we will intermingle the times so
 

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.560
way and we will intermingle the times so
don't forgive us but that's the basic

don't forgive us but that's the basic
 

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.290
don't forgive us but that's the basic
structure so let me start by those of

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300
structure so let me start by those of
 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.650
structure so let me start by those of
you and who don't really know much about

mostly a little bit of a pedagogical
 

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.040
mostly a little bit of a pedagogical
thing in the beginning as most of you

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.050
thing in the beginning as most of you
 

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.810
thing in the beginning as most of you
were trained in in high school and

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:04.820
were trained in in high school and
 

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.030
were trained in in high school and
possibly in college is you learnt about

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040
possibly in college is you learnt about
 

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.560
possibly in college is you learnt about
Newton's theory of gravity which is a

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:08.570
Newton's theory of gravity which is a
 

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.960
Newton's theory of gravity which is a
theory in which there are forces that

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:10.970
theory in which there are forces that
 

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.240
theory in which there are forces that
between masses and that force gets

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.250
between masses and that force gets
 

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.189
between masses and that force gets
smaller the bigger the distance between

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:15.199
smaller the bigger the distance between
 

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:18.850
smaller the bigger the distance between
the masses and it is a wonderful theory

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:18.860
the masses and it is a wonderful theory
 

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.879
the masses and it is a wonderful theory
it does almost all you need in fact it

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:21.889
it does almost all you need in fact it
 

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.710
it does almost all you need in fact it
got the space program working there's

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720
got the space program working there's
 

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.420
got the space program working there's
nothing terribly wrong with that theory

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:25.430
nothing terribly wrong with that theory
 

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.210
nothing terribly wrong with that theory
but it isn't right okay

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.220
but it isn't right okay
 

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.730
but it isn't right okay
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:30.740
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly
 

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.129
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly
after he developed the special theory of

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:33.139
after he developed the special theory of
 

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:35.590
after he developed the special theory of
relativity it doesn't have a way in it

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600
relativity it doesn't have a way in it
 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.220
relativity it doesn't have a way in it
of dealing with very large masses moving

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.230
of dealing with very large masses moving
 

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.069
of dealing with very large masses moving
at high velocities that's not in in in

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079
at high velocities that's not in in in
 

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:45.009
at high velocities that's not in in in
an Newton's theory at all and nor does

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:45.019
an Newton's theory at all and nor does
 

00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:46.930
an Newton's theory at all and nor does
it have a way of communicating

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:46.940
it have a way of communicating
 

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.240
it have a way of communicating
information in the gravitational field

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.250
information in the gravitational field
 

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.670
information in the gravitational field
from one place to the other for example

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680
from one place to the other for example
 

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.069
from one place to the other for example
if the Sun disappeared and we know it

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079
if the Sun disappeared and we know it
 

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.870
if the Sun disappeared and we know it
takes about nine minutes for us to see

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880
takes about nine minutes for us to see
 

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.150
takes about nine minutes for us to see
that it also should take something like

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160
that it also should take something like
 

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.129
that it also should take something like
nine minutes for us to find out

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:00.139
nine minutes for us to find out
 

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.559
nine minutes for us to find out
navigational e that it has something has

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:02.569
navigational e that it has something has
 

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:04.210
navigational e that it has something has
happened to it and that's something that

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:04.220
happened to it and that's something that
 

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.790
happened to it and that's something that
again was not in in the Newton theory

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800
again was not in in the Newton theory
 

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.180
again was not in in the Newton theory
and so this picture which is hardly

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.190
and so this picture which is hardly
 

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.420
and so this picture which is hardly
complete but in some way to imagine this

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:13.430
complete but in some way to imagine this
 

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.819
complete but in some way to imagine this
new theory that Einstein developed is if

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:15.829
new theory that Einstein developed is if
 

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:18.790
new theory that Einstein developed is if

where I was there were lots of those and

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:23.630
where I was there were lots of those and
 

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.330
where I was there were lots of those and
you take a cut through it

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.340
you take a cut through it
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.700
you take a cut through it
and you have laid out all those bars and

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:27.710
and you have laid out all those bars and
 

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.650
and you have laid out all those bars and
you've done one more thing which isn't

put clocks everywhere and what the
 

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.519
put clocks everywhere and what the
Einstein theory says is what this

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:39.529
Einstein theory says is what this
 

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:41.260
Einstein theory says is what this

cut through it there will be when you're
 

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.579
cut through it there will be when you're
far away from the Sun that's the Sun and

but and the clocks that are running on

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.470
but and the clocks that are running on

all those intersection points they all
 

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.950
all those intersection points they all
read the same time but as you walk

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:02.960
read the same time but as you walk
 

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.380
read the same time but as you walk
toward the Sun in this plane you'll

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:05.390
toward the Sun in this plane you'll
 

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.930
toward the Sun in this plane you'll
notice that the distortion in space you

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:07.940
notice that the distortion in space you
 

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.490
notice that the distortion in space you
don't see the distortion in time because

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:09.500
don't see the distortion in time because
 

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.079
don't see the distortion in time because
I didn't put your clocks there but the

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:11.089
I didn't put your clocks there but the
 

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.180
I didn't put your clocks there but the
clocks in here are running a little more

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.190
clocks in here are running a little more
 

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.820
clocks in here are running a little more
slowly than the clocks out there and a

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:15.830
slowly than the clocks out there and a
 

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.350
slowly than the clocks out there and a
little bit of that also happens that the

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360
little bit of that also happens that the
 

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.030
little bit of that also happens that the
earth is a little dimple that the earth

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040
earth is a little dimple that the earth
 

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.030
earth is a little dimple that the earth
does and the way John Wheeler explained

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040
does and the way John Wheeler explained
 

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.280
does and the way John Wheeler explained
Einstein's theory he says matter

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.290
Einstein's theory he says matter
 

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.540
Einstein's theory he says matter
distorts space and time and then matter

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:28.550
distorts space and time and then matter
 

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.940
distorts space and time and then matter
moves because of the distortion in space

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:30.950
moves because of the distortion in space
 

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.800
moves because of the distortion in space
and time and that's the best I can do

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:32.810
and time and that's the best I can do
 

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.690
and time and that's the best I can do
for you keep will do better okay

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:34.700
for you keep will do better okay
 

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.750
for you keep will do better okay
and in that theory there is also

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760
and in that theory there is also
 

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.860
and in that theory there is also
gravitational waves and I want to show

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:41.870
gravitational waves and I want to show
 

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.380
gravitational waves and I want to show
you first a gravitational wave the and

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:44.390
you first a gravitational wave the and
 

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.600
you first a gravitational wave the and
the gravitational waves move at the

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:46.610
the gravitational waves move at the
 

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.920
the gravitational waves move at the
speed of light you've heard that already

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:47.930
speed of light you've heard that already
 

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.950
speed of light you've heard that already
and but there they are as you'll see in

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:50.960
and but there they are as you'll see in
 

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960
and but there they are as you'll see in
a minute and what's this picture will

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:52.970
a minute and what's this picture will
 

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.090
a minute and what's this picture will
show is there a transfers wave there a

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.100
show is there a transfers wave there a
 

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.090
show is there a transfers wave there a
wave that the store space

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.100
wave that the store space
 

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.750
wave that the store space
perpendicular to the direction in which

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:58.760
perpendicular to the direction in which
 

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.240
perpendicular to the direction in which
the wave moves and so let me turn on

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.250
the wave moves and so let me turn on
 

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.460
the wave moves and so let me turn on
this little animation but before I do

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.470
this little animation but before I do
 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.810
this little animation but before I do
that before you because you'll get sick

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:04.820
that before you because you'll get sick
 

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.880
that before you because you'll get sick
looking at it there you are right there

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:06.890
looking at it there you are right there
 

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.190
looking at it there you are right there
that's you in that little red square and

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.200
that's you in that little red square and
 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.440
that's you in that little red square and
now I'll turn on the sound and animation

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.450
now I'll turn on the sound and animation
 

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.240
now I'll turn on the sound and animation
so you can see the wave coming by you

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.250
so you can see the wave coming by you
 

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.130
so you can see the wave coming by you
and you'll see some patterns in this

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.140
and you'll see some patterns in this
 

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.360
and you'll see some patterns in this
which are important for understanding

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.370
which are important for understanding
 

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.540
which are important for understanding
how we detected these things first of

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:19.550
how we detected these things first of
 

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.090
how we detected these things first of
all you'll notice that in let's say the

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:22.100
all you'll notice that in let's say the
 

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.579
all you'll notice that in let's say the
horizontal direction let's say it's

00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:24.589
horizontal direction let's say it's
 

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:27.040
horizontal direction let's say it's
expanding but in the in the vertical

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.050
expanding but in the in the vertical
 

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.930
expanding but in the in the vertical
direction is contracting now any one

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:28.940
direction is contracting now any one
 

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.180
direction is contracting now any one
moment these things will flip but when

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.190
moment these things will flip but when
 

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.620
moment these things will flip but when
they there will be opposite motions

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:32.630
they there will be opposite motions
 

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.350
they there will be opposite motions
vertically and horizontally that's one

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360
vertically and horizontally that's one
 

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.150
vertically and horizontally that's one
thing so that's a pattern that you you

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160
thing so that's a pattern that you you
 

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.260
thing so that's a pattern that you you
exploit by the way you'll see where how

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.270
exploit by the way you'll see where how
 

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.390
exploit by the way you'll see where how
exploit that the other thing about it is

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:41.400
exploit that the other thing about it is
 

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.640
exploit that the other thing about it is
that that these are the objects that you

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:43.650
that that these are the objects that you
 

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.560
that that these are the objects that you
threw out into the space as the

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:45.570
threw out into the space as the
 

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.730
threw out into the space as the
gravitational wave comes through I

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740
gravitational wave comes through I
 

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.440
gravitational wave comes through I
should have told you that so you look

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:48.450
should have told you that so you look
 

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.870
should have told you that so you look
here with not near you these let's say

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880
here with not near you these let's say
 

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.610
here with not near you these let's say
these little masses they don't move very

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620
these little masses they don't move very
 

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.950
these little masses they don't move very
much but the masses that are far away

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:54.960
much but the masses that are far away
 

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.700
much but the masses that are far away
from you they move a lot and that's a

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:58.710
from you they move a lot and that's a
 

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.520
from you they move a lot and that's a
picture of a constant strain along at

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:01.530
picture of a constant strain along at
 

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.710
picture of a constant strain along at
any one moment the change in distance

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720
any one moment the change in distance
 

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.260
any one moment the change in distance
between objects is proportional to their

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.270
between objects is proportional to their
 

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.720
between objects is proportional to their
separation and that change in distance

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:08.730
separation and that change in distance
 

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.300
separation and that change in distance
divided by the separation is called the

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:11.310
divided by the separation is called the
 

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.280
divided by the separation is called the
strain and we will talk about that a lot

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.290
strain and we will talk about that a lot
 

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.890
strain and we will talk about that a lot
that's the quantity we measure but while

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:15.900
that's the quantity we measure but while
 

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.360
that's the quantity we measure but while
we actually measure the distance

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.370
we actually measure the distance
 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.980
we actually measure the distance
separations but the quantity you

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:18.990
separations but the quantity you
 

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.320
separations but the quantity you
describe as the field corner he in the

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:21.330
describe as the field corner he in the
 

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.040
describe as the field corner he in the
theory is the strain and so let me tell

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.050
theory is the strain and so let me tell
 

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.230
theory is the strain and so let me tell
you a little bit of history now we

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240
you a little bit of history now we
 

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.790
you a little bit of history now we
talked already about the theory being

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800
talked already about the theory being
 

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.000
talked already about the theory being
developed about a hundred years ago in

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.010
developed about a hundred years ago in
 

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.070
developed about a hundred years ago in
1915 Einstein gave the world the general

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.080
1915 Einstein gave the world the general
 

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.840
1915 Einstein gave the world the general
theory of relativity is which was

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:35.850
theory of relativity is which was
 

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.600
theory of relativity is which was
described somewhat by that first picture

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:37.610
described somewhat by that first picture
 

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.630
described somewhat by that first picture
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper I'm

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:41.640
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper I'm
 

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.920
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper I'm
gonna have to drink something just to

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:42.930
gonna have to drink something just to
 

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:51.650
gonna have to drink something just to
bear with me stop forever in that theory

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660
bear with me stop forever in that theory
 

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.010
bear with me stop forever in that theory
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.020
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
 

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.560
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
where he describes a lot of things that

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:57.570
where he describes a lot of things that
 

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.040
where he describes a lot of things that
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.050
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
 

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.990
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
he also shows that there are

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000
he also shows that there are
 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.270
he also shows that there are
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.280
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper
 

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.340
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper
and the only reason why I bring this up

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.350
and the only reason why I bring this up
 

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.260
and the only reason why I bring this up
here is because of a very interesting

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:09.270
here is because of a very interesting
 

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.720
here is because of a very interesting
statement he made at the very end of the

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:11.730
statement he made at the very end of the
 

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.880
statement he made at the very end of the
paper he's described these things and

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:13.890
paper he's described these things and
 

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.290
paper he's described these things and
I'll talk to them about them in a minute

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300
I'll talk to them about them in a minute
 

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.540
I'll talk to them about them in a minute
but he describes an equation which is up

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:17.550
but he describes an equation which is up
 

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.760
but he describes an equation which is up
here I want to tell you what that is it

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:19.770
here I want to tell you what that is it
 

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.320
here I want to tell you what that is it
says this is the strength of gravity of

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.330
says this is the strength of gravity of
 

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.360
says this is the strength of gravity of
gravitational waves and this is the

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.370
gravitational waves and this is the
 

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.270
gravitational waves and this is the
source of gravitational waves

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:25.280
source of gravitational waves
 

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.920
source of gravitational waves
oscillations and accelerations of matter

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:27.930
oscillations and accelerations of matter
 

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.600
oscillations and accelerations of matter
and he says something extremely

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:29.610
and he says something extremely
 

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.230
and he says something extremely
interesting

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240
interesting
 

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.820
interesting
I haven't here in German but I'll read

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:31.830
I haven't here in German but I'll read
 

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.340
I haven't here in German but I'll read
it to you in English in any case one can

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.350
it to you in English in any case one can
 

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.440
it to you in English in any case one can
think of a that quantity will have a

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.450
think of a that quantity will have a
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.110
think of a that quantity will have a
practically vanishing value this is to

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120
practically vanishing value this is to
 

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.370
practically vanishing value this is to
the end of that paper since you'll never

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380
the end of that paper since you'll never
 

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.840
the end of that paper since you'll never
be able to measure this it's of no

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:41.850
be able to measure this it's of no
 

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.060
be able to measure this it's of no
consequence to science that's

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.070
consequence to science that's
 

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.470
consequence to science that's
effectively what he was saying and so he

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480
effectively what he was saying and so he
 

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.910
effectively what he was saying and so he
makes a mistake in this paper but that

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920
makes a mistake in this paper but that
 

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.830
makes a mistake in this paper but that
has nothing to do with it in 1918 he

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:51.840
has nothing to do with it in 1918 he
 

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.940
has nothing to do with it in 1918 he
corrects that

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:52.950
corrects that
 

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.920
corrects that
but I want to be I'll be presumptive a

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:54.930
but I want to be I'll be presumptive a
 

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.020
but I want to be I'll be presumptive a
little bit and we have I've asked the

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.030
little bit and we have I've asked the
 

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.640
little bit and we have I've asked the
people who will have the Einstein papers

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:58.650
people who will have the Einstein papers
 

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.950
people who will have the Einstein papers
to try to find what I'm about to show

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:00.960
to try to find what I'm about to show
 

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.140
to try to find what I'm about to show
you and they haven't found this on the

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.150
you and they haven't found this on the
 

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.210
you and they haven't found this on the
back of an envelope or in his notebooks

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220
back of an envelope or in his notebooks
 

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.160
back of an envelope or in his notebooks
but I'm sure it's there somewhere

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.170
but I'm sure it's there somewhere
 

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.050
but I'm sure it's there somewhere
so let's I'm trying to give you a little

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:09.060
so let's I'm trying to give you a little
 

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.329
so let's I'm trying to give you a little
feel for why he made that statement and

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339
feel for why he made that statement and
 

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.520
feel for why he made that statement and
you have to put yourself in the context

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:13.530
you have to put yourself in the context
 

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.210
you have to put yourself in the context
of 1915 1916 what did people know about

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220
of 1915 1916 what did people know about
 

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.000
of 1915 1916 what did people know about
and what do they have and the first

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.010
and what do they have and the first
 

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.069
and what do they have and the first
thing you might have thought about is

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079
thing you might have thought about is
 

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.530
thing you might have thought about is
two trains colliding how much

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540
two trains colliding how much
 

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.569
two trains colliding how much
gravitational waves come out of that and

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579
gravitational waves come out of that and
 

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.180
gravitational waves come out of that and
so let me give you a I won't use this is

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.190
so let me give you a I won't use this is
 

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.250
so let me give you a I won't use this is
not oh it's the only formula but I'll

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
not oh it's the only formula but I'll
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
not oh it's the only formula but I'll
explain it to you okay so here's the

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.270
explain it to you okay so here's the
 

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.770
explain it to you okay so here's the
strain that's H and this is the quantity

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780
strain that's H and this is the quantity
 

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.330
strain that's H and this is the quantity
that when you want to estimate how much

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340
that when you want to estimate how much
 

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.370
that when you want to estimate how much
strain you get from some kind of motion

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380
strain you get from some kind of motion
 

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.100
strain you get from some kind of motion
is the a very simple estimation formula

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.110
is the a very simple estimation formula
 

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.530
is the a very simple estimation formula
it has the Newtonian constants in it the

the United States don't go much faster

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:43.530
the United States don't go much faster
 

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.620
the United States don't go much faster
than this nowadays that that does not be

much advanced in that maybe in Europe

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700
much advanced in that maybe in Europe
 

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.310
much advanced in that maybe in Europe
but not here not not in the United

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320
but not here not not in the United
 

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.190

so yeah and you have to be far enough

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:02.550
so yeah and you have to be far enough
 

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.760
so yeah and you have to be far enough
away so you're not looking at Newtonian

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:04.770
away so you're not looking at Newtonian
 

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.169

you have to go far away enough so that

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220
you have to go far away enough so that
 

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.919
you have to go far away enough so that
you're looking at the radiation field

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:09.929
you're looking at the radiation field
 

00:19:09.929 --> 00:19:12.470
you're looking at the radiation field
the field that carries these waves so

the field that carries these waves so
 

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.850
the field that carries these waves so
you have to go out a wavelength about

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860
you have to go out a wavelength about
 

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.310
you have to go out a wavelength about
that's 300 kilometres and the H value

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320
that's 300 kilometres and the H value
 

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.700
that's 300 kilometres and the H value
you get is 10 to the minus 42 and that

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:19.710
you get is 10 to the minus 42 and that
 

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.669
you get is 10 to the minus 42 and that
is truly impossible we can't even do

00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679
is truly impossible we can't even do
 

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:24.499
is truly impossible we can't even do
that now and that's why I stopped

00:19:24.499 --> 00:19:24.509
that now and that's why I stopped
 

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:27.350
that now and that's why I stopped
probably made that statement so he might

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:45.770
telescope in fact the one that got in
 

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.070
telescope in fact the one that got in
the trouble in the big hurricane and and

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080
the trouble in the big hurricane and and
 

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.140
the trouble in the big hurricane and and
they they listened and they heard a

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.150
they they listened and they heard a
 

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.170
they they listened and they heard a
thing going like that and it was going

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:53.180
thing going like that and it was going
 

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.270
thing going like that and it was going
in about 17 times a second that's the

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280
in about 17 times a second that's the
 

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.820
in about 17 times a second that's the
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:57.830
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars
 

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.220
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars
made completely of neutrons and they are

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:00.230
made completely of neutrons and they are
 

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.780
made completely of neutrons and they are
but they have the mass of the Sun and

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:01.790
but they have the mass of the Sun and
 

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.090
but they have the mass of the Sun and
they're about the size of Stockholm it's

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.100
they're about the size of Stockholm it's
 

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.600
they're about the size of Stockholm it's
really unbelievably dense thing and what

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:07.610
really unbelievably dense thing and what
 

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.850
really unbelievably dense thing and what
they heard is the pulse is coming from

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:09.860
they heard is the pulse is coming from
 

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.770
they heard is the pulse is coming from
that but they weren't going at a regular

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:11.780
that but they weren't going at a regular
 

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.410
that but they weren't going at a regular
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.420
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster
 

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.090
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster
sometimes they're going a little slower

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.100
sometimes they're going a little slower
 

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.160
sometimes they're going a little slower
and it turns out when they mapped this

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.170
and it turns out when they mapped this
 

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.080
and it turns out when they mapped this
they kept looking at it they found that

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.090
they kept looking at it they found that
 

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.960
they kept looking at it they found that
for about four hours and this is a model

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:22.970
for about four hours and this is a model
 

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.760
for about four hours and this is a model
of it it turns out it turns out to be a

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:24.770
of it it turns out it turns out to be a
 

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.950
of it it turns out it turns out to be a
pair of neutron stars and they're going

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960
pair of neutron stars and they're going
 

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.410
pair of neutron stars and they're going
around each other and when this pulsar

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:29.420
around each other and when this pulsar
 

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.240
around each other and when this pulsar
which is sending its pulses to the radio

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.250
which is sending its pulses to the radio
 

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.100
which is sending its pulses to the radio
telescope is moving toward the earth

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.110
telescope is moving toward the earth
 

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.870
telescope is moving toward the earth
which is over here it goes a little

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880
which is over here it goes a little
 

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.450
which is over here it goes a little
faster from the Doppler effect and when

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:37.460
faster from the Doppler effect and when
 

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.190
faster from the Doppler effect and when
it's moving away from the earth it goes

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200
it's moving away from the earth it goes
 

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.990
it's moving away from the earth it goes
a little slower and that's what they saw

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000
a little slower and that's what they saw
 

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.510
a little slower and that's what they saw
and they map that and they watched it

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520
and they map that and they watched it
 

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.210
and they map that and they watched it
through many many years this is time

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:46.220
through many many years this is time
 

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.180
through many many years this is time
over here and they saw in 1973 and they

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:49.190
over here and they saw in 1973 and they
 

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.940
over here and they saw in 1973 and they
kept watching it and what they noticed

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:51.950
kept watching it and what they noticed
 

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.190
kept watching it and what they noticed
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests
 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.320
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests
and general relativity were done by that

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.330
and general relativity were done by that
 

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.600
and general relativity were done by that
system but the one that was most telling

also and they saw he saw coincident

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:16.490
also and they saw he saw coincident
 

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.960
also and they saw he saw coincident
pulses and in 1969 he published the

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:19.970
pulses and in 1969 he published the
 

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.210
pulses and in 1969 he published the
paper which said he had discovered

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:22.220
paper which said he had discovered
 

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.789
paper which said he had discovered
gravitation waves and it turns out that

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799
gravitation waves and it turns out that
 

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:28.330
gravitation waves and it turns out that
many many other people became interested

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:28.340
many many other people became interested
 

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.010
many many other people became interested
in doing that in science that's what

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.020
in doing that in science that's what
 

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.230
in doing that in science that's what
always happens a stunning result like

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240
always happens a stunning result like
 

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.480
always happens a stunning result like
this can be tested by everybody else and

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.490
this can be tested by everybody else and
 

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.720
this can be tested by everybody else and
to his misfortune nobody else saw these

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:37.730
to his misfortune nobody else saw these
 

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.200
to his misfortune nobody else saw these

nobody else saw these pulses and now we

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:40.580
nobody else saw these pulses and now we
 

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.460
nobody else saw these pulses and now we
know why people didn't see the pulses

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:42.470
know why people didn't see the pulses
 

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.740
know why people didn't see the pulses
the strength will fall and this is

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:44.750
the strength will fall and this is
 

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.440
the strength will fall and this is
something useful

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.450
something useful
 

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.230
something useful

ultimately you needed okay I'm sorry

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740
ultimately you needed okay I'm sorry

okay I didn't realize that was happening
 

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.350
okay I didn't realize that was happening
so what happened is people began to

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360
so what happened is people began to
 

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.120
so what happened is people began to
think of other methods of doing this and

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.130
think of other methods of doing this and
 

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.669
think of other methods of doing this and
one method of doing it I'll describe

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679
one method of doing it I'll describe
 

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:14.690
one method of doing it I'll describe
here is not with a bar but rather with a

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700
here is not with a bar but rather with a
 

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.879
here is not with a bar but rather with a
thing which you really in the end was

00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:16.889
thing which you really in the end was
 

00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:18.710
thing which you really in the end was
more successful in making the real

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720
more successful in making the real
 

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.620
more successful in making the real
measurements and that is to look at free

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:21.630
measurements and that is to look at free
 

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.840
measurements and that is to look at free
masses but like that picture of the

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:23.850
masses but like that picture of the
 

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.240
masses but like that picture of the
gravitational wave a mass over here and

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.250
gravitational wave a mass over here and
 

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.279
gravitational wave a mass over here and
you put another mass over there a goodly

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:28.289
you put another mass over there a goodly
 

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:31.370
you put another mass over there a goodly
distance away and you take and measure

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380
distance away and you take and measure
 

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.430
distance away and you take and measure
the time it takes you want to measure

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440
the time it takes you want to measure
 

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.279
the time it takes you want to measure
their separation as changing as the

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:37.289

their separation as changing as the
gravitational wave comes by that's the

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.090
gravitational wave comes by that's the
 

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.789
gravitational wave comes by that's the
same picture of all those knots that I

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799
same picture of all those knots that I
 

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.580
same picture of all those knots that I
showed you and so the idea is really

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:43.590
showed you and so the idea is really
 

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.360
showed you and so the idea is really
simple you take and have a light send

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:47.370
simple you take and have a light send
 

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.879
simple you take and have a light send
that and put a clock on those month put

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:49.889
that and put a clock on those month put
 

00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:52.610
that and put a clock on those month put
clocks on the masses or we actually

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620
clocks on the masses or we actually
 

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.680
clocks on the masses or we actually
let's start that way clock here clock

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:54.690
let's start that way clock here clock
 

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.419
let's start that way clock here clock
there on those masses send light

00:26:56.419 --> 00:26:56.429
there on those masses send light
 

00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:58.460
there on those masses send light
measured the moment when the light left

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:58.470
measured the moment when the light left
 

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.649
measured the moment when the light left
this mass and find out with another

00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659
this mass and find out with another
 

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:01.549
this mass and find out with another
clock over here

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559
clock over here
 

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:03.440
clock over here
the time when it hits that mass that's

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:03.450
the time when it hits that mass that's
 

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.700
the time when it hits that mass that's
the way of measuring the distance

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:04.710
the way of measuring the distance
 

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.940
the way of measuring the distance
between those two masses and then let

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:07.950
between those two masses and then let
 

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.529
between those two masses and then let
the thing unfold and as a gravitational

00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539
the thing unfold and as a gravitational
 

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:12.200
the thing unfold and as a gravitational
wave comes along it'll change that time

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.210
wave comes along it'll change that time
 

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.570
wave comes along it'll change that time
because it's changing that distance it's

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580
because it's changing that distance it's
 

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.190
because it's changing that distance it's
as simple as that now if you here's the

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200
as simple as that now if you here's the
 

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.009
as simple as that now if you here's the
idea and this is as a way which a key

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:19.019
idea and this is as a way which a key
 

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:21.860
idea and this is as a way which a key
almost works and you don't you here you

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:21.870
almost works and you don't you here you
 

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.799
almost works and you don't you here you
have a laser and the beam splitter which

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:24.809
have a laser and the beam splitter which
 

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:26.419
have a laser and the beam splitter which
is a device that splits the light and

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:26.429
is a device that splits the light and
 

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:28.820
is a device that splits the light and
that's as in the picture I showed you

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:28.830
that's as in the picture I showed you
 

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.259
that's as in the picture I showed you
that would be the red square that I

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:30.269
that would be the red square that I
 

00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:33.169
that would be the red square that I
showed you here is a distant mass and

00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179
showed you here is a distant mass and
 

00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:34.730
showed you here is a distant mass and
that's a mirror and there's another

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740
that's a mirror and there's another
 

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.930
that's a mirror and there's another
distant mass and remember the

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940
distant mass and remember the
 

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.700
distant mass and remember the
gravitational wave is coming down and

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:37.710
gravitational wave is coming down and
 

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.889
gravitational wave is coming down and
what it'll do is is a stretch one of

00:27:39.889 --> 00:27:39.899
what it'll do is is a stretch one of
 

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:42.500
what it'll do is is a stretch one of
these and compress this and it'll flip

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:42.510
these and compress this and it'll flip
 

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.539
these and compress this and it'll flip
then this one will stretch and that one

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:44.549
then this one will stretch and that one
 

00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:46.460
then this one will stretch and that one
will compress and here is the way you

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.470
will compress and here is the way you
 

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.930
will compress and here is the way you
make that measurement which is

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940
make that measurement which is
 

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.230
make that measurement which is
effectively timing light so with us but

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240
effectively timing light so with us but
 

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.610
effectively timing light so with us but
I'll describe as it goes along

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620
I'll describe as it goes along
 

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.220
I'll describe as it goes along
where it's red is light and we're

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:55.230
where it's red is light and we're
 

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.570
where it's red is light and we're
thinking of red lasers when they made

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580
thinking of red lasers when they made
 

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.000
thinking of red lasers when they made
its picture but what you see is the way

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.010
its picture but what you see is the way
 

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.610
its picture but what you see is the way
these are the actual waves inside the

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620
these are the actual waves inside the
 

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.620
these are the actual waves inside the
power of the light and where it's red is

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:03.630
power of the light and where it's red is
 

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.180
power of the light and where it's red is
where there's light if you do it right

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:05.190
where there's light if you do it right
 

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.100
where there's light if you do it right
and make the time here equal to the time

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.110
and make the time here equal to the time
 

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.740
and make the time here equal to the time
of light there you get no light going to

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:09.750
of light there you get no light going to
 

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.840
of light there you get no light going to
the photo detector that's the idea and

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:11.850
the photo detector that's the idea and
 

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.760
the photo detector that's the idea and
so if you will show that's for the photo

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:13.770
so if you will show that's for the photo
 

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.100
so if you will show that's for the photo
tech now when you move these masses one

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.110
tech now when you move these masses one
 

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.020
tech now when you move these masses one
out the other one in you'll see that

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.030
out the other one in you'll see that
 

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.210
out the other one in you'll see that
there is light when the motion makes it

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220
there is light when the motion makes it
 

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.370
there is light when the motion makes it
so the path links are no longer equal

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380
so the path links are no longer equal
 

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.810
so the path links are no longer equal
and that is in fact the basis for the

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820
and that is in fact the basis for the
 

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.360
and that is in fact the basis for the
entire experiment because it's no more

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:29.370
entire experiment because it's no more
 

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.530
entire experiment because it's no more
complicated than that

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:30.540
complicated than that
 

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.600
complicated than that
the big problem comes you have to do it

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:32.610
the big problem comes you have to do it
 

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:41.570
the big problem comes you have to do it
extremely well and here is how well kick

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580
extremely well and here is how well kick
 

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.500
extremely well and here is how well kick
comes on the scene I met kit in 1975

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:44.510
comes on the scene I met kit in 1975
 

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.090
comes on the scene I met kit in 1975
when he and I met in Washington DC he

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100
when he and I met in Washington DC he
 

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.590
when he and I met in Washington DC he
was thinking at that time he was giving

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600
was thinking at that time he was giving
 

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.470
was thinking at that time he was giving
testimony to a committee and he and I

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480
testimony to a committee and he and I
 

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.360
testimony to a committee and he and I
spent the night talking about what kind

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.370
spent the night talking about what kind
 

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.190
spent the night talking about what kind
of experiments are interesting to do and

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200
of experiments are interesting to do and
 

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.919
of experiments are interesting to do and
he was at that time had already the most

00:29:00.919 --> 00:29:00.929
he was at that time had already the most
 

00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:02.720
he was at that time had already the most
successful group I think in the country

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:02.730
successful group I think in the country
 

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.690
successful group I think in the country
doing theoretical gravitation and he was

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700
doing theoretical gravitation and he was
 

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.669
doing theoretical gravitation and he was
hoping to start a group hab Caltech

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679
hoping to start a group hab Caltech
 

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:11.000
hoping to start a group hab Caltech
start a group in in in experimental work

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.010
start a group in in in experimental work
 

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.940
start a group in in in experimental work
and what we came on is that Kipp at that

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:13.950
and what we came on is that Kipp at that
 

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.860
and what we came on is that Kipp at that
meeting he and I talked about that

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:15.870
meeting he and I talked about that
 

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.630
meeting he and I talked about that
ultimately there's this technique that

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640
ultimately there's this technique that
 

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.490
ultimately there's this technique that
we were just talking about here would be

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500
we were just talking about here would be
 

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.520
we were just talking about here would be
a good thing for Caltech to work on and

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:21.530
a good thing for Caltech to work on and
 

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.380
a good thing for Caltech to work on and
but he told us something then already

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:24.390
but he told us something then already
 

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.990
but he told us something then already
that you couldn't just do it in this

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000
that you couldn't just do it in this
 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.290
that you couldn't just do it in this
haphazard way that was it had to be done

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:30.300
haphazard way that was it had to be done
 

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.240
haphazard way that was it had to be done
and he was one of the first to tell us

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.250
and he was one of the first to tell us
 

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.220
and he was one of the first to tell us
that if you want to get in the business

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:34.230
that if you want to get in the business
 

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.890
that if you want to get in the business
you had to measure h's or these strains

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:36.900
you had to measure h's or these strains
 

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.810
you had to measure h's or these strains
tell two changes in length divided by

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820
tell two changes in length divided by
 

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.320
tell two changes in length divided by
the length of 10 to the minus 21 I think

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.330
the length of 10 to the minus 21 I think
 

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.240
the length of 10 to the minus 21 I think
this is Kip about that time he'll tell

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.250
this is Kip about that time he'll tell
 

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.930
this is Kip about that time he'll tell
us if I'm wrong yeah he's agreeing okay

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:46.940
us if I'm wrong yeah he's agreeing okay
 

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.910
us if I'm wrong yeah he's agreeing okay
and the big thing is that if you make

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:49.920
and the big thing is that if you make
 

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.350
and the big thing is that if you make
something and now we're getting on

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360
something and now we're getting on
 

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.960
something and now we're getting on
mixing times but that's too bad suppose

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:53.970
mixing times but that's too bad suppose
 

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.580
mixing times but that's too bad suppose
if you go to something as long as 4

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:55.590
if you go to something as long as 4
 

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.980
if you go to something as long as 4
kilometers you then and you do the a

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:57.990
kilometers you then and you do the a
 

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.030
kilometers you then and you do the a
little bit of arithmetic that's

00:29:59.030 --> 00:29:59.040
little bit of arithmetic that's
 

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.919
little bit of arithmetic that's
associated with that you find out that

00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:00.929
associated with that you find out that
 

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.990
associated with that you find out that
you have to measure distances at the

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000
you have to measure distances at the
 

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.690
you have to measure distances at the
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18
 

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.790
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18
meters that's something like a

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:07.800
meters that's something like a
 

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.160
meters that's something like a
thousandth the size of a nucleus of an

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.170
thousandth the size of a nucleus of an
 

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.230
thousandth the size of a nucleus of an
atom that's very hard

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240
atom that's very hard
 

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.270
atom that's very hard
and here is the challenge that this

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.280
and here is the challenge that this
 

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.180
and here is the challenge that this
threw at us if you want to use light to

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.190
threw at us if you want to use light to
 

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.280
threw at us if you want to use light to
make that measurement light has a

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:19.290
make that measurement light has a
 

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.680
make that measurement light has a
wavelength of about ten to the minus six

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:21.690
wavelength of about ten to the minus six
 

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.680

he was telling us if you want to use

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:33.660
he was telling us if you want to use
 

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.940
he was telling us if you want to use
light to do this but then you had

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:34.950
light to do this but then you had
 

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.950
light to do this but then you had
another problem which an nhien turned

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960
another problem which an nhien turned
 

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.570
another problem which an nhien turned
out to be much harder than that problem

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580
out to be much harder than that problem
 

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.720
out to be much harder than that problem
and that is even though you might have

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:41.730
and that is even though you might have
 

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.270
and that is even though you might have
made a wonderful measure method of

made a wonderful measure method of
 

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.220
made a wonderful measure method of
measuring things their position with

they're gonna be kicked around by
 

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.690
they're gonna be kicked around by
everything in the world especially the

around by the ground by about one micron

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:00.150
around by the ground by about one micron
 

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.840
around by the ground by about one micron
at least a few microns so ten minus six

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:02.850
at least a few microns so ten minus six
 

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.000
at least a few microns so ten minus six
so he got another factor of a million

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.010
so he got another factor of a million
 

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.130
so he got another factor of a million
times a million and that one was a

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140
times a million and that one was a
 

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.480
times a million and that one was a
really hard one and so here is the

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:11.490
really hard one and so here is the
 

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.640
really hard one and so here is the
things that went on and now the rest of

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:13.650
things that went on and now the rest of
 

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.370
things that went on and now the rest of
this is really about people because

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380
this is really about people because
 

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.410
this is really about people because
people are critical to getting that

really helped a lot in this thing was a

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:29.370
really helped a lot in this thing was a
 

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.490
really helped a lot in this thing was a
guy named who was not so heralded as a

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500
guy named who was not so heralded as a
 

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.280
guy named who was not so heralded as a
man named Pirani who was a theorist who

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:34.290
man named Pirani who was a theorist who
 

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.340
man named Pirani who was a theorist who
told us yes it was possible to measure

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:37.350
told us yes it was possible to measure
 

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.680
told us yes it was possible to measure
gravitational waves with things freely

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:39.690
gravitational waves with things freely
 

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.960
gravitational waves with things freely
floating around that was a big big

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:41.970
floating around that was a big big
 

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.420
floating around that was a big big
challenge there was a lot of worry about

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:44.430
challenge there was a lot of worry about
 

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.670
challenge there was a lot of worry about
whether you could ever extract any kind

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:46.680
whether you could ever extract any kind
 

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.700
whether you could ever extract any kind
of measurable signal from gravitational

the coordinates that you use of showing
that a gravitational wave was mu was

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:58.800
that a gravitational wave was mu was
 

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.160
that a gravitational wave was mu was
moving the masses changing the space and

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.170
moving the masses changing the space and
 

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.180
moving the masses changing the space and
that's of course exploited in this and

anymore to say the following thing we
 

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.450
anymore to say the following thing we
knew already that God used lasers you

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460
knew already that God used lasers you
 

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.920
knew already that God used lasers you
couldn't use just one a very weak light

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:24.930
couldn't use just one a very weak light
 

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.220

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.630
source
the other thing you needed to is you're

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:27.640
the other thing you needed to is you're
 

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.160
the other thing you needed to is you're
somehow had to make the light to go more

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.170
somehow had to make the light to go more
 

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.900
somehow had to make the light to go more
than once back and forth you have to

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:30.910
than once back and forth you have to
 

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.880
than once back and forth you have to
bounce the light back and forth and you

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:32.890
bounce the light back and forth and you
 

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.440
bounce the light back and forth and you
had to do tricks to get around the noise

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.450
had to do tricks to get around the noise
 

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.700
had to do tricks to get around the noise
and that would tricks you have to

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:35.710
and that would tricks you have to
 

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.350
and that would tricks you have to
modulate the light you have to use all

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360
modulate the light you have to use all
 

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.450
modulate the light you have to use all
the cunning tricks yeah and the other

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:39.460
the cunning tricks yeah and the other
 

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.920
the cunning tricks yeah and the other
thing you had to do is you couldn't put

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:40.930
thing you had to do is you couldn't put
 

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.810
thing you had to do is you couldn't put
the masses right on the ground

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:42.820
the masses right on the ground
 

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.910
the masses right on the ground
you had to somehow float them so the

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:44.920
you had to somehow float them so the
 

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.550
you had to somehow float them so the
ground and motion would not make a

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:47.560
ground and motion would not make a
 

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.290
ground and motion would not make a

00:38:38.739 --> 00:38:41.099
the interferometer and build up the
light inside the interferometer for that

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:41.109
light inside the interferometer for that
 

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:43.349
light inside the interferometer for that
reason and that makes it as though you

00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359
reason and that makes it as though you
 

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:45.120
reason and that makes it as though you
had a very much more powerful laser a

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.130
had a very much more powerful laser a
 

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:47.089
had a very much more powerful laser a
very clever idea

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099
very clever idea
 

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:51.299
very clever idea
then here's Brian Mears idea and that is

00:38:51.299 --> 00:38:51.309
then here's Brian Mears idea and that is
 

00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:53.549
then here's Brian Mears idea and that is
that you put another mirror which is not

00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:53.559
that you put another mirror which is not
 

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:55.890
that you put another mirror which is not
this is not immediately something that

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:55.900
this is not immediately something that
 

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.449
this is not immediately something that
everybody can capture because you need

00:38:57.449 --> 00:38:57.459
everybody can capture because you need
 

00:38:57.459 --> 00:38:59.400
everybody can capture because you need
to know a lot more than I told you why

00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.410
to know a lot more than I told you why
 

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.499
to know a lot more than I told you why
this works so well but what does it do

00:39:01.499 --> 00:39:01.509
this works so well but what does it do
 

00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:03.870
this works so well but what does it do
by putting a mirror between the detector

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880
by putting a mirror between the detector
 

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.059
by putting a mirror between the detector
and the beam splitter it makes it so you

00:39:06.059 --> 00:39:06.069
and the beam splitter it makes it so you
 

00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.920
and the beam splitter it makes it so you
can Taylor

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:06.930
can Taylor
 

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.710
can Taylor
the response of the interferometer you

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720
the response of the interferometer you
 

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.990
the response of the interferometer you
can make it have different shapes make

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000
can make it have different shapes make
 

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.519
can make it have different shapes make
it have so that it's more sensitive at

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:13.529
it have so that it's more sensitive at
 

00:39:13.529 --> 00:39:15.289
it have so that it's more sensitive at
certain frequencies and stuff like that

00:39:15.289 --> 00:39:15.299
certain frequencies and stuff like that
 

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:17.329
certain frequencies and stuff like that
and that's called this is called a power

00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339
and that's called this is called a power
 

00:39:17.339 --> 00:39:19.160
and that's called this is called a power
recycling mirror and that's called a

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.170
recycling mirror and that's called a
 

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.349
recycling mirror and that's called a
signal recycling mirror and that's an

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359
signal recycling mirror and that's an
 

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.720
signal recycling mirror and that's an
important part of advanced LIGO so this

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:23.730
important part of advanced LIGO so this
 

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:29.200
important part of advanced LIGO so this
is the advanced LIGO detector okay now

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.210
is the advanced LIGO detector okay now
 

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.420

that is the technology of the how do you

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:32.430
that is the technology of the how do you
 

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.059
that is the technology of the how do you
make the light get that factor of 10 to

about how you build build up begin to

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:44.430
about how you build build up begin to
 

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.640
about how you build build up begin to
build up the idea that you don't want to

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:46.650
build up the idea that you don't want to
 

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.980
build up the idea that you don't want to
do just prototypes you would like to

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:48.990
do just prototypes you would like to
 

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.140
do just prototypes you would like to
actually build a detector and that

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.150
actually build a detector and that
 

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:58.160
actually build a detector and that
happened in about 1988 II know that we

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.170
happened in about 1988 II know that we
 

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.700
happened in about 1988 II know that we
began to think hard about how might how

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:01.710
began to think hard about how might how
 

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.760
began to think hard about how might how
expensive how might you build a systems

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:04.770
expensive how might you build a systems
 

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.519

attitude about this but the thing is
 

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.650

that what we began to think about is

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660
that what we began to think about is
 

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.680
that what we began to think about is
really we asked the NSF if we could do

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:27.690
really we asked the NSF if we could do
 

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.930
really we asked the NSF if we could do
and we were also encouraged by the NSF

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940
and we were also encouraged by the NSF
 

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.410
and we were also encouraged by the NSF
and we'll get to that at the very end to

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:32.420
and we'll get to that at the very end to
 

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.359
and we'll get to that at the very end to
make an industrial study with industry

thing that was big enough and we thought

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240
thing that was big enough and we thought
 

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.529
thing that was big enough and we thought
of five kilometer arms maybe even ten

00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:42.539
of five kilometer arms maybe even ten
 

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:44.660
of five kilometer arms maybe even ten
kilometer arms and could you get the

kilometer arms and could you get the
 

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.309

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.010
this thing for example how well can you
get rid of the ground noise and at the

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020
get rid of the ground noise and at the
 

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.600
get rid of the ground noise and at the
time when we were designing this this

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:41.610
time when we were designing this this
 

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.670
time when we were designing this this
limit is the noise that shakes the

there's seismic noise and that makes a

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:46.050
there's seismic noise and that makes a

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:47.550
limited low frequencies
 

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.880
limited low frequencies
then there's here this limit is the fact

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:49.890
then there's here this limit is the fact
 

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.840
then there's here this limit is the fact
that everything is a room temperature

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:50.850
that everything is a room temperature
 

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.640
that everything is a room temperature
and when everything is at room

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:52.650
and when everything is at room
 

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.860

it's proposed we build one that we know

it's proposed we build one that we know

it's proposed we build one that we know
how to build now or almost know how to

how to build now or almost know how to
 

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.810
how to build now or almost know how to
build now and another one we hope to

build now and another one we hope to
 

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.150
build now and another one we hope to
build in the future and that would need

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160
build in the future and that would need
 

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.100
build in the future and that would need
much better vacuum than this and back

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:40.110
much better vacuum than this and back
 

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.920
much better vacuum than this and back
down here and that getting that whole

we have we succeeded with that in a very

we have we succeeded with that in a very
unique and interesting way and so what

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920
unique and interesting way and so what
 

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.190

just the acceleration and this was a
 

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.060
just the acceleration and this was a
contribution to LIGO for the advanced

suspension here's a spring that's
 

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.000
suspension here's a spring that's
attached to the ground and there's a

attached to the ground and there's a
 

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:01.400
attached to the ground and there's a
mass and this is a suspension and if you

you do it once again you do it once
again you do it four times and here's

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420
again you do it four times and here's
 

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.120
again you do it four times and here's
that very precious mirror that's gonna

stage suspension is a critical part of
 

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.250
stage suspension is a critical part of
LIGO and especially a critical part that

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260
LIGO and especially a critical part that
 

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.440
LIGO and especially a critical part that
we made a detection but even more

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:24.450
we made a detection but even more
 

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.120
we made a detection but even more
important as far as I'm concerned is

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:26.130
important as far as I'm concerned is
 

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.560
important as far as I'm concerned is
this thing which is much too complicated

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:27.570
this thing which is much too complicated
 

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.390
this thing which is much too complicated
to tell you about but I'll tell you what

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400
to tell you about but I'll tell you what
 

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.570
to tell you about but I'll tell you what
it does it's an active system that gets

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:32.580
it does it's an active system that gets
 

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.070
it does it's an active system that gets
rid of the ground noise and you have a

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:34.080
rid of the ground noise and you have a
 

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.050
rid of the ground noise and you have a
lot of experience with that in in your

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060
lot of experience with that in in your
 

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.240
lot of experience with that in in your
hearing I don't know how many of you use

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:38.250
hearing I don't know how many of you use
 

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.760

these noise-canceling headphones I'm

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:40.770
these noise-canceling headphones I'm
 

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.490
these noise-canceling headphones I'm
sure that people here yeah okay it's the

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500
sure that people here yeah okay it's the
 

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.530
sure that people here yeah okay it's the
same principle what you do is you put a

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:45.540
same principle what you do is you put a
 

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.780
same principle what you do is you put a
very sensitive seismometer on a platform

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:47.790
very sensitive seismometer on a platform
 

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.150
very sensitive seismometer on a platform
and measure the motion of the platform

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160
and measure the motion of the platform
 

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.880
and measure the motion of the platform
and then what you do is you push on that

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:52.890
and then what you do is you push on that
 

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.700
and then what you do is you push on that
platform to get rid of the signal in the

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:55.710
platform to get rid of the signal in the
 

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:58.070
platform to get rid of the signal in the
seismometer that's the same thing you do

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:58.080
seismometer that's the same thing you do
 

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.540
seismometer that's the same thing you do
with the headphones that the headphones

00:49:59.540 --> 00:49:59.550
with the headphones that the headphones
 

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.370
with the headphones that the headphones
listen to the sounds like are coming in

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380
listen to the sounds like are coming in
 

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.680
listen to the sounds like are coming in
they generate a sound that's the

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:03.690
they generate a sound that's the
 

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:06.230
they generate a sound that's the
opposite sign in the headphones and you

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240
opposite sign in the headphones and you
 

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.849
opposite sign in the headphones and you
don't hear the outside world you only

00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859
don't hear the outside world you only
 

00:50:07.859 --> 00:50:10.130
don't hear the outside world you only
hear the music and that's on the other

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140
hear the music and that's on the other
 

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.450
hear the music and that's on the other
part of the headphone that's how that

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460
part of the headphone that's how that
 

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.760
part of the headphone that's how that
works it's the same idea it's an active

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:13.770
works it's the same idea it's an active
 

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.620
works it's the same idea it's an active
system and that is absolutely could

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:15.630
system and that is absolutely could
 

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.960
system and that is absolutely could
to us and that's was that was developed

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:17.970
to us and that's was that was developed
 

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.540
to us and that's was that was developed
both people I go and Stanford University

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:20.550
both people I go and Stanford University

both people I go and Stanford University
okay now people again I want to give

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300
okay now people again I want to give
 

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.490
okay now people again I want to give

who is in the audience and I know he's

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:30.690
who is in the audience and I know he's
 

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.120
who is in the audience and I know he's
gonna be shirking and when his name is

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:32.130
gonna be shirking and when his name is
 

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.800
gonna be shirking and when his name is
mentioned but I want to tell you what he

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:33.810
mentioned but I want to tell you what he
 

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.020
mentioned but I want to tell you what he
did for us first of all he was a

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.030
did for us first of all he was a
 

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.580
did for us first of all he was a
first-class scientist in this business

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:37.590
first-class scientist in this business
 

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.950
first-class scientist in this business
to begin with and he wrote a paper quite

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960
to begin with and he wrote a paper quite
 

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.550
to begin with and he wrote a paper quite
early in in the sixties where he showed

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560
early in in the sixties where he showed
 

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.740
early in in the sixties where he showed
a thing that was very controversial at

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:45.750
a thing that was very controversial at
 

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.720
a thing that was very controversial at
the time that gravitational waves

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:47.730
the time that gravitational waves
 

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.970
the time that gravitational waves
actually carried energy away from a

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980
actually carried energy away from a
 

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.730
actually carried energy away from a
source that was heavily debated a lot of

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740
source that was heavily debated a lot of
 

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.990
source that was heavily debated a lot of
people thought it was just a coordinate

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000
people thought it was just a coordinate
 

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.360
people thought it was just a coordinate
problem but he showed there was actually

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:56.370
problem but he showed there was actually
 

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.190
problem but he showed there was actually
energy leaving a gravitational wave

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200
energy leaving a gravitational wave
 

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.670
energy leaving a gravitational wave
source and here is and what he did he

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680
source and here is and what he did he
 

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.980
source and here is and what he did he
became the discipline chief for gravity

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:03.990
became the discipline chief for gravity
 

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.860
became the discipline chief for gravity
at the NSF and he convinced his boss

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:06.870
at the NSF and he convinced his boss
 

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.350
at the NSF and he convinced his boss
Martha Marcel Barton at this crazy idea

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:09.360
Martha Marcel Barton at this crazy idea
 

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.590
Martha Marcel Barton at this crazy idea
that we all had really had merit and he

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:12.600
that we all had really had merit and he
 

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.780
that we all had really had merit and he
did it at a time when it was not so easy

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:14.790
did it at a time when it was not so easy
 

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.000
did it at a time when it was not so easy
to do that we didn't have the technology

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.010
to do that we didn't have the technology
 

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.340
to do that we didn't have the technology
in hand and we didn't know what sources

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:19.350
in hand and we didn't know what sources
 

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.920
in hand and we didn't know what sources
were gonna see and he had to sell this

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:21.930
were gonna see and he had to sell this
 

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.870
were gonna see and he had to sell this
idea to his boss and he did a

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880
idea to his boss and he did a
 

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.180
idea to his boss and he did a
magnificent job of it then he sold the

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:26.190
magnificent job of it then he sold the
 

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:30.290
magnificent job of it then he sold the
whole agency on this okay and that's

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300
whole agency on this okay and that's
 

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.600
whole agency on this okay and that's
something which is spectacular without

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:32.610
something which is spectacular without
 

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:35.510
something which is spectacular without
him this would not have worked and these

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520
him this would not have worked and these
 

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.800
him this would not have worked and these
are some of the people who were

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:36.810
are some of the people who were
 

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.410
are some of the people who were
influenced by that and I want to say

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420
influenced by that and I want to say
 

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.730
influenced by that and I want to say
something special about these are

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740
something special about these are
 

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.550
something special about these are
directors of the NSF which were critical

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:43.560
directors of the NSF which were critical
 

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.820
directors of the NSF which were critical
to our development rich Isaacson was

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:46.830
to our development rich Isaacson was
 

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.740
to our development rich Isaacson was
actually deeply mixed up with Eric block

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:48.750
actually deeply mixed up with Eric block
 

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.990
actually deeply mixed up with Eric block
with his boss and Eric Bloch was an

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000
with his boss and Eric Bloch was an
 

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.720
with his boss and Eric Bloch was an
engineer and and I the same thing

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:53.730
engineer and and I the same thing
 

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.280
engineer and and I the same thing
happened in MIT the engineers were the

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:55.290
happened in MIT the engineers were the
 

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.680
happened in MIT the engineers were the
first to recognize and then at MIT that

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:57.690
first to recognize and then at MIT that
 

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:59.210
first to recognize and then at MIT that
this might have some value the

00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220
this might have some value the
 

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.010
this might have some value the
electrical engineers around me it wasn't

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020
electrical engineers around me it wasn't
 

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:04.370
electrical engineers around me it wasn't
so much the physicist and so he had the

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380
so much the physicist and so he had the
 

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.530
so much the physicist and so he had the
idea that this was exactly the right

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540
idea that this was exactly the right
 

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.900
idea that this was exactly the right
thing for the NSF to get into something

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:08.910
thing for the NSF to get into something
 

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.420
thing for the NSF to get into something
very risky but had a tremendous payoff

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:11.430
very risky but had a tremendous payoff
 

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.540
very risky but had a tremendous payoff
and so Eric block pushed it and then

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:14.550
and so Eric block pushed it and then
 

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:16.220
and so Eric block pushed it and then
when things really began to happen and

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:16.230
when things really began to happen and
 

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.170
when things really began to happen and
there were people who didn't like the

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180
there were people who didn't like the
 

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.450
there were people who didn't like the
idea that LIGO was beginning to use

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460
idea that LIGO was beginning to use
 

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.760
idea that LIGO was beginning to use
money from the NSF there were people in

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:22.770
money from the NSF there were people in
 

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:24.290
money from the NSF there were people in
the Astronomy community that actually

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300
the Astronomy community that actually
 

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.180
the Astronomy community that actually
resisted it you can read the newspapers

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:26.190
resisted it you can read the newspapers
 

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.090

told these people who were very

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.150
told these people who were very
 

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.900

influential no no we're gonna do this

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:35.910
influential no no we're gonna do this
 

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:37.310

country and it's the right thing for the
 

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:41.840
country and it's the right thing for the
NSF and it was quite a struggle and he

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:41.850
NSF and it was quite a struggle and he
 

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.940

was a magnificent person for doing that

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:43.950
was a magnificent person for doing that
 

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:46.430
was a magnificent person for doing that
and then to make it all happen the head

helped NSF figure out how to go to

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:56.070
helped NSF figure out how to go to
 

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:58.910
helped NSF figure out how to go to
Congress and say look the NSF needs a

00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920
Congress and say look the NSF needs a
 

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.760

line item for big projects that hadn't
 

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.620
line item for big projects that hadn't
done big projects before but that's what

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:03.630
done big projects before but that's what
 

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.420

we need to do and so there was something

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:05.430
we need to do and so there was something
 

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.010
we need to do and so there was something
new invented and that's how you get

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020
new invented and that's how you get
 

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.450

money you don't go to Congress

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460

money you don't go to Congress
complaining you never go to Congress and

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:10.110
complaining you never go to Congress and
 

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:12.260
complaining you never go to Congress and
complaining stop this and give it to us

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:12.270
complaining stop this and give it to us
 

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.180

that's the wrong way to do it what you

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:14.190
that's the wrong way to do it what you
 

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.400
that's the wrong way to do it what you

it so we had to be able to evolve the

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:25.220
it so we had to be able to evolve the
 

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.920
it so we had to be able to evolve the
instrument and in ways that we weren't

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:26.930
instrument and in ways that we weren't
 

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:29.170
instrument and in ways that we weren't
sure how to do it so we as much as

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:29.180
sure how to do it so we as much as
 

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.590
sure how to do it so we as much as
possible we asked the NSF for more

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:32.600
possible we asked the NSF for more
 

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.360
possible we asked the NSF for more
funding at the beginning and made as

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:34.370
funding at the beginning and made as
 

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.270
funding at the beginning and made as
flexible an instrument as we possibly

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280
flexible an instrument as we possibly
 

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.860
flexible an instrument as we possibly
could we build it by the end of maybe

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:40.870
could we build it by the end of maybe
 

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:43.960
could we build it by the end of maybe
1999 we had it built and then we started

1999 we had it built and then we started
 

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.480
1999 we had it built and then we started
making it work and this picture kind of

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:46.490
making it work and this picture kind of
 

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.690
making it work and this picture kind of
illustrates how we approach the next 15

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:49.700
illustrates how we approach the next 15
 

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.400

we basically this is the same curve that
 

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.440
we basically this is the same curve that
was shown by Ray where it's limited on

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:56.450
was shown by Ray where it's limited on
 

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.840

this is the frequency band that's
 

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.200
this is the frequency band that's
available to us to look for

basically subsequently a different time
so our strategy basically was to turn

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440
so our strategy basically was to turn
 

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.099

this on it was that whatever sensitivity
 

01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:37.400
this on it was that whatever sensitivity
it was this isn't very sensitive look

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:37.410
it was this isn't very sensitive look
 

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:39.170
it was this isn't very sensitive look
our wounds look at what we did wrong

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180
our wounds look at what we did wrong
 

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.339
our wounds look at what we did wrong
what was limiting it take time off run

01:02:43.339 --> 01:02:43.349
what was limiting it take time off run
 

01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:46.190
what was limiting it take time off run
it again and it evolved to a better

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200

at each at each time we would search for

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240
at each at each time we would search for
 

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.200
at each at each time we would search for
gravitational waves each time we

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:00.210
gravitational waves each time we
 

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.230
gravitational waves each time we
wouldn't find gravitational waves each

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240
wouldn't find gravitational waves each
 

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.000
wouldn't find gravitational waves each
time we would have a better limit

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:05.010
time we would have a better limit
 

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:07.970
time we would have a better limit
because this was better on how well we

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980
because this was better on how well we
 

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.000
because this was better on how well we
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.010
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote
 

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:12.559
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote
a series of papers but they basically

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:12.569
a series of papers but they basically
 

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:16.450
a series of papers but they basically
were null papers during that period

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:16.460
were null papers during that period
 

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.720
were null papers during that period
along the way we got to the point where

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:19.730
along the way we got to the point where
 

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:22.910
along the way we got to the point where
we were as good as we had proposed

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920
we were as good as we had proposed
 

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.920
we were as good as we had proposed
except maybe a little bit at the low

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:24.930
except maybe a little bit at the low
 

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.109
except maybe a little bit at the low
frequencies and this that's this curve

01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119
frequencies and this that's this curve
 

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:30.109
frequencies and this that's this curve
here so this is the initial detector

01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119
here so this is the initial detector
 

01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:33.020
here so this is the initial detector
that we were funded for by the National

graph as good as we could we knew very

01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339
graph as good as we could we knew very
 

01:03:38.339 --> 01:03:41.180

early as Ray had indicated that we

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:41.190
early as Ray had indicated that we
 

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.220
early as Ray had indicated that we
wanted to do this in two stages that we

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:43.230
wanted to do this in two stages that we
 

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.650
wanted to do this in two stages that we
could incrementally improve things but

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660
could incrementally improve things but
 

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.380
could incrementally improve things but
only so far without making some major

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:48.390
only so far without making some major
 

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:52.730
only so far without making some major
changes so we had done the detailed Rd

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.740
changes so we had done the detailed Rd
 

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.200
changes so we had done the detailed Rd
necessary to develop the techniques and

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:57.210
necessary to develop the techniques and
 

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.630
necessary to develop the techniques and
the apparatus itself the detailed

designs that would go into a second

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680
designs that would go into a second
 

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.059
designs that would go into a second
generation detector and that was what we

01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:05.069
generation detector and that was what we
 

01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:07.190
generation detector and that was what we
called advanced LIGO interestingly we

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200
called advanced LIGO interestingly we
 

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.460
called advanced LIGO interestingly we
called it like o2 but the NSF in their

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:10.470
called it like o2 but the NSF in their
 

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.920
called it like o2 but the NSF in their
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:12.930
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly
 

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:16.099
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly
talking about like a 1 2 3 4 so they

01:04:16.099 --> 01:04:16.109
talking about like a 1 2 3 4 so they
 

01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:17.750
talking about like a 1 2 3 4 so they
asked us to change the name and it

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760
asked us to change the name and it
 

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.859
asked us to change the name and it
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:21.869
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO
 

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:26.329
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO
we then build it between 19 2010 and

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339
we then build it between 19 2010 and
 

01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:30.180
we then build it between 19 2010 and
2013 or so and started turning it

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.190
2013 or so and started turning it
 

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.280
2013 or so and started turning it
we could we basically had learned a lot

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:32.290
we could we basically had learned a lot
 

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.440
we could we basically had learned a lot
so we turned it on a lot faster than we

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:34.450
so we turned it on a lot faster than we
 

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:37.230
so we turned it on a lot faster than we
had the initial LIGO getting nearer

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240
had the initial LIGO getting nearer
 

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:45.330
had the initial LIGO getting nearer
design sensitivity by 2015 it started to

01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:45.340
design sensitivity by 2015 it started to
 

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.400
design sensitivity by 2015 it started to
work well enough so that it was better

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.410
work well enough so that it was better
 

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:51.630
work well enough so that it was better
than what we had built for initial LIGO

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640
than what we had built for initial LIGO
 

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.410
than what we had built for initial LIGO
and that is shown here the key people by

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:55.420
and that is shown here the key people by
 

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.600
and that is shown here the key people by
the way for advanced LIGO some of the

incredible optics that we use and the
way the interferometer works itself and

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520
way the interferometer works itself and
 

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.810
way the interferometer works itself and
two people one in each laboratory who

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:30.820
two people one in each laboratory who
 

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.910
two people one in each laboratory who
have been the most responsible for the

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920
have been the most responsible for the
 

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.460
have been the most responsible for the
making this thing actually work in the

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:35.470
making this thing actually work in the
 

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:40.290
making this thing actually work in the
field and so we started to make it work

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:40.300
field and so we started to make it work
 

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.030
field and so we started to make it work
and the two detectors are in the two

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:42.040
and the two detectors are in the two
 

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.710
and the two detectors are in the two
different colors here and what they

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720
different colors here and what they
 

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720
different colors here and what they
indicate is that despite the fact that

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:45.730
indicate is that despite the fact that
 

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:47.880
indicate is that despite the fact that
they're physically in very different

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:47.890
they're physically in very different
 

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.570
they're physically in very different
locations so basically in design and as

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:51.580
locations so basically in design and as
 

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.670
locations so basically in design and as
long as we do the same thing at the same

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680
long as we do the same thing at the same
 

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.740
long as we do the same thing at the same
time they were essentially identically

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:55.750
time they were essentially identically
 

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.440
time they were essentially identically
to each other at this point

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.450
to each other at this point
 

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.900
to each other at this point
this had improved about a factor of

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:00.910
this had improved about a factor of
 

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:05.880
this had improved about a factor of
three beyond where we were in in initial

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:05.890
three beyond where we were in in initial
 

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.670
three beyond where we were in in initial
LIGO our goal was to improve things a

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680
LIGO our goal was to improve things a
 

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.690
LIGO our goal was to improve things a
factor of 10

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:09.700
factor of 10
 

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.150
factor of 10
this is improving the sensitivity a

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160
this is improving the sensitivity a
 

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.540
this is improving the sensitivity a
factor of 3 and what you realize is that

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:15.550
factor of 3 and what you realize is that
 

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:18.930
factor of 3 and what you realize is that
the sensitivity tells you how far out

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:18.940
the sensitivity tells you how far out
 

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.580
the sensitivity tells you how far out
you look in the universe so if we

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:20.590
you look in the universe so if we
 

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:23.730
you look in the universe so if we
increase the sensitivity a factor of 3

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:23.740
increase the sensitivity a factor of 3
 

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.320
increase the sensitivity a factor of 3
we actually improve how much of the

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:28.330
we actually improve how much of the
 

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:30.210
we actually improve how much of the
universe we're looking at by the cube of

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:30.220
universe we're looking at by the cube of
 

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.640
universe we're looking at by the cube of
that because that's the volume that

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:32.650
that because that's the volume that
 

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.120
that because that's the volume that
scanned so an improvement of a factor of

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.130
scanned so an improvement of a factor of
 

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.820
scanned so an improvement of a factor of
3 basically gave us the ability to do

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:38.830
3 basically gave us the ability to do
 

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.510
3 basically gave us the ability to do
what we had done an initial LIGO or more

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520
what we had done an initial LIGO or more
 

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.940
what we had done an initial LIGO or more
in one year what we could have done in

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:44.950
in one year what we could have done in
 

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.820
in one year what we could have done in
27 years with initial aegyo so we

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:47.830
27 years with initial aegyo so we
 

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.490
27 years with initial aegyo so we
decided not to go all the way to here

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:50.500
decided not to go all the way to here
 

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.710
decided not to go all the way to here
but have a similar strategy to what we

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720
but have a similar strategy to what we
 

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.650
but have a similar strategy to what we
had an initial LIGO and use this as a

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:55.660
had an initial LIGO and use this as a
 

01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:01.430
had an initial LIGO and use this as a
first search because we had improved the

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440
first search because we had improved the
 

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.290
first search because we had improved the
concept for how we treat low frequencies

01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:04.300
concept for how we treat low frequencies
 

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.790
concept for how we treat low frequencies
which was described by Ray the

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:08.800
which was described by Ray the
 

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.280
which was described by Ray the
improvement as say 40 Hertz was actually

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:11.290
improvement as say 40 Hertz was actually
 

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:14.670
improvement as say 40 Hertz was actually
a factor of a hundred shown here a

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680
a factor of a hundred shown here a
 

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.550
a factor of a hundred shown here a
factor of a hundred is cubed in terms of

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:17.560
factor of a hundred is cubed in terms of
 

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.770
factor of a hundred is cubed in terms of
the sensitivity we get so we were really

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:19.780
the sensitivity we get so we were really
 

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.540
the sensitivity we get so we were really
a million times better than we were an

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:21.550
a million times better than we were an
 

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.640
a million times better than we were an
initial aegyo and that answers a

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:23.650
initial aegyo and that answers a
 

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:25.349
initial aegyo and that answers a
question that's often asked to us how

01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359
question that's often asked to us how
 

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:27.630
question that's often asked to us how
could we turn this thing on and after a

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640
could we turn this thing on and after a
 

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.030
could we turn this thing on and after a
few days which is what happened make a

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:30.040
few days which is what happened make a
 

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.920
few days which is what happened make a
discovery when we had run it for ten

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:31.930
discovery when we had run it for ten
 

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:33.810
discovery when we had run it for ten
years before that are almost ten years

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:33.820
years before that are almost ten years
 

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.650
years before that are almost ten years
and it's really this factor of a million

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660
and it's really this factor of a million
 

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:42.089
and it's really this factor of a million
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made

01:07:42.089 --> 01:07:42.099
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made
 

01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:43.920
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made
that improvement again this is just a

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:43.930
that improvement again this is just a
 

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:46.440
that improvement again this is just a
picture to emphasize that the big

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:46.450
picture to emphasize that the big
 

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:49.079
picture to emphasize that the big
improvement that made this detection may

01:07:49.079 --> 01:07:49.089
improvement that made this detection may
 

01:07:49.089 --> 01:07:51.300
improvement that made this detection may
be the take-home message if you want to

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:51.310
be the take-home message if you want to
 

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.280
be the take-home message if you want to
tell anybody why and how we made the

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:53.290
tell anybody why and how we made the
 

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:56.300
tell anybody why and how we made the
detection was the improvement in this

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:56.310
detection was the improvement in this
 

01:07:56.310 --> 01:08:00.900
detection was the improvement in this

that Ray mentioned that by the way have
two reason they're how so hard it has to

to know where the earth is shakiness

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:32.140
to know where the earth is shakiness
 

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.959
to know where the earth is shakiness
what direction and correct for it

01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:33.969
what direction and correct for it
 

01:08:33.969 --> 01:08:36.690
what direction and correct for it
and that makes the system quite a bit

01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:36.700
and that makes the system quite a bit
 

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:42.059
and that makes the system quite a bit
more difficult we turned on and a few

01:08:42.059 --> 01:08:42.069
more difficult we turned on and a few
 

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.269
more difficult we turned on and a few
days later this is what we found so this

01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279
days later this is what we found so this

most of us for what we first see I would
 

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.460
most of us for what we first see I would
have expected if I thought about what we

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:02.470
have expected if I thought about what we
 

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:05.130
have expected if I thought about what we
would see that we start to see hints of

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:05.140
would see that we start to see hints of
 

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.950
would see that we start to see hints of
gravitational waves where our detector

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960
gravitational waves where our detector
 

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.780
gravitational waves where our detector
wasn't quite sensitive enough yet to

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:09.790
wasn't quite sensitive enough yet to
 

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:12.060
wasn't quite sensitive enough yet to
make it definitively and then we keep

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:12.070
make it definitively and then we keep
 

01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:13.830
make it definitively and then we keep
working in the future and making it more

01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:13.840
working in the future and making it more
 

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.640

we were lucky instead we of course made
 

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:19.560
we were lucky instead we of course made
big improvements but we immediately saw

big improvements but we immediately saw
 

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:22.740
big improvements but we immediately saw
a signal that stood out and looked very

scale that we were detecting and got to

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440
scale that we were detecting and got to
 

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.400

degrees between Livingston Louisiana and
Hanford Washington but there was a

01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:58.680
Hanford Washington but there was a
 

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.160

rather large debate whether we take the

two l-shaped detectors and make them
 

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.260
two l-shaped detectors and make them
parallel to each other or rotate them by

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:07.270
parallel to each other or rotate them by
 

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:10.260
parallel to each other or rotate them by
45 degrees the reason you would rotate

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:10.270
45 degrees the reason you would rotate
 

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.210
45 degrees the reason you would rotate
by 45 degrees is it gives you the

waves so the argument to rotate them is

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:24.730
waves so the argument to rotate them is
 

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:27.450

exactly that the argument to put them in

for some period of time we calculated
how long that had to be and it was

the to correlate them together and see
what the probability is that you could

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520
what the probability is that you could

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.400
are the probabilities less than one in
some hundreds of thousands of years so

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:08.410
some hundreds of thousands of years so
 

01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.770
some hundreds of thousands of years so
basically that was the first thing the

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:10.780
basically that was the first thing the
 

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.060
basically that was the first thing the
second problem was maybe somehow we were

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.070
second problem was maybe somehow we were
 

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:18.030
second problem was maybe somehow we were
being fooled by somewhat mischievous

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040
being fooled by somewhat mischievous
 

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.180

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760
this on the data
 

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.090
this on the data
and we just looked at the data and it

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:25.100
and we just looked at the data and it
 

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.320
and we just looked at the data and it
really wasn't there that again had to be

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:28.330
really wasn't there that again had to be
 

01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:31.229
really wasn't there that again had to be

the idea was the following the data

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:33.770
the idea was the following the data
 

01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:35.920
the idea was the following the data
comes together at Caltech and from that

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:35.930

this first event was seen first in
 

01:13:40.489 --> 01:13:42.340
this first event was seen first in
Germany it was the middle of the night

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:42.350
Germany it was the middle of the night
 

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:47.530

in the States and the data comes

01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:47.540
in the States and the data comes
 

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.720
in the States and the data comes
together once it's together you could

that we have to take it back to the

01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320
that we have to take it back to the
 

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.320
that we have to take it back to the
laboratories where we had traced the

01:13:59.320 --> 01:13:59.330
laboratories where we had traced the
 

01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:01.780
laboratories where we had traced the
signals and what they recorded along the

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:01.790
signals and what they recorded along the
 

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:03.970
signals and what they recorded along the
way and that required another study

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:03.980
way and that required another study
 

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.700
way and that required another study

of October I think we had really
 

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.570
of October I think we had really
confidence that we had made this

December of 2015 we were about a week

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.310
December of 2015 we were about a week
 

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:54.250
December of 2015 we were about a week
late because we were arguing too long on

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:54.260
late because we were arguing too long on

which adjectives to use in the paper and
 

01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.950
which adjectives to use in the paper and
at that point Physical Review Letters

01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960
at that point Physical Review Letters
 

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.820
at that point Physical Review Letters
who had agreed that they would allow us

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:03.830
who had agreed that they would allow us
 

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:05.650
who had agreed that they would allow us
to make the article longer than the

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:05.660
to make the article longer than the
 

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.510
to make the article longer than the
standard article and that they would

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520
standard article and that they would
 

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.600
standard article and that they would
review it especially both very secretly

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:10.610
review it especially both very secretly
 

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:15.580
review it especially both very secretly
and quickly informed us that we were now

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:15.590
and quickly informed us that we were now
 

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.680
and quickly informed us that we were now
too close to Christmas and they couldn't

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:17.690
too close to Christmas and they couldn't
 

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:21.160
too close to Christmas and they couldn't
do it so we held the article until

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:21.170
do it so we held the article until
 

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:23.650
do it so we held the article until
January and interestingly our second

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:23.660
January and interestingly our second
 

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.920
January and interestingly our second
event which I show now came on December

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:26.930
event which I show now came on December
 

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:30.100
event which I show now came on December
26th so when we announced this event on

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:30.110
26th so when we announced this event on
 

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:35.290
26th so when we announced this event on
February of 20 2016 we knew but we

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:35.300
February of 20 2016 we knew but we
 

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.550
February of 20 2016 we knew but we
didn't yet bring that

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560
didn't yet bring that
 

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.500
didn't yet bring that
public that we also had a second event

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:38.510
public that we also had a second event
 

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.360
public that we also had a second event
so it's convincing as the first of that

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:40.370
so it's convincing as the first of that
 

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:43.420
so it's convincing as the first of that
was we all had a second event it looks

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:43.430
was we all had a second event it looks
 

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.550
was we all had a second event it looks
very different you can see this has many

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560
very different you can see this has many
 

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.900
very different you can see this has many
many oscillations it's smaller but we

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:49.910
many oscillations it's smaller but we
 

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:51.580
many oscillations it's smaller but we
detect it as well because there's so

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:51.590
detect it as well because there's so
 

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.650
detect it as well because there's so
many oscillations that's a reflection of

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:53.660
many oscillations that's a reflection of
 

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.840
many oscillations that's a reflection of
the fact that they're lighter the two

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:55.850
the fact that they're lighter the two
 

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.970
the fact that they're lighter the two
black holes that are colliding it's also

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:57.980
black holes that are colliding it's also
 

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.650
black holes that are colliding it's also
black hole collisions this graph here

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:02.660
black hole collisions this graph here
 

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.960
black hole collisions this graph here
just illustrates it's the so-called

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:04.970
just illustrates it's the so-called
 

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:09.490
just illustrates it's the so-called
chirp graph this is basically time going

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:09.500
chirp graph this is basically time going
 

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.860
chirp graph this is basically time going
this way frequency going this way it

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:11.870
this way frequency going this way it
 

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:15.640
this way frequency going this way it
gets louder as the frequency goes up and

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:15.650
gets louder as the frequency goes up and
 

01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:17.710
gets louder as the frequency goes up and
this is getting this so-called chirp

01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:17.720
this is getting this so-called chirp
 

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.450
this is getting this so-called chirp
that we described as a signal the second

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:22.460
that we described as a signal the second
 

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.610
that we described as a signal the second
one which is weaker but in there longer

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:24.620
one which is weaker but in there longer
 

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.520
one which is weaker but in there longer
so we are able to pull out the signal is

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:27.530
so we are able to pull out the signal is
 

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.160
so we are able to pull out the signal is
down here but if we look at basically

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:30.170
down here but if we look at basically
 

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.840
down here but if we look at basically
the low frequencies that weren't

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:31.850
the low frequencies that weren't
 

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:34.450
the low frequencies that weren't
available to us until we made the big

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:34.460
available to us until we made the big
 

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.280
available to us until we made the big
improvement in the suspension and the

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:36.290
improvement in the suspension and the
 

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:39.040
improvement in the suspension and the
isolation system both of these signals

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:39.050
isolation system both of these signals
 

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:41.530
isolation system both of these signals
were enabled by making those

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:41.540
were enabled by making those
 

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.620
were enabled by making those
improvements at low frequencies of

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:44.630
improvements at low frequencies of
 

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:47.800
improvements at low frequencies of
course we've kept running we finished

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:47.810
course we've kept running we finished
 

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:50.440
course we've kept running we finished
that first data run with these two

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:50.450
that first data run with these two
 

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:56.740
that first data run with these two
events in January of 2016 and at that

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:56.750
events in January of 2016 and at that
 

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:00.190
events in January of 2016 and at that
point we changed things fix things in

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:00.200
point we changed things fix things in
 

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.030
point we changed things fix things in
the same spirit that I presented our

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040
the same spirit that I presented our
 

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.550
the same spirit that I presented our
activities through the period of initial

which may be for most of us we expect it

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:12.470
which may be for most of us we expect it
 

01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:14.620
which may be for most of us we expect it
couldn't possibly be as exciting as what

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:14.630
couldn't possibly be as exciting as what
 

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.930
couldn't possibly be as exciting as what
we saw in the first day to run that

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:16.940
we saw in the first day to run that
 

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.990
we saw in the first day to run that
turned out to be wrong as I'll show you

01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000
turned out to be wrong as I'll show you
 

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.930
turned out to be wrong as I'll show you
in the second date of run I show here

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:22.940
in the second date of run I show here
 

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.510
in the second date of run I show here
that we haven't analyzed all the data

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520
that we haven't analyzed all the data
 

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.580
that we haven't analyzed all the data
yet we haven't made all our reports yet

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:27.590
yet we haven't made all our reports yet
 

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:29.950
yet we haven't made all our reports yet
but this is where we are today we

01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960
but this is where we are today we
 

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.810
but this is where we are today we
basically have reported five

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:31.820
basically have reported five
 

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.990
basically have reported five
observations of probably black holes one

01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000
observations of probably black holes one
 

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.960
observations of probably black holes one
of them we don't call a black hole just

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:37.970
of them we don't call a black hole just
 

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.360
of them we don't call a black hole just
because it's further away and doesn't

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:40.370
because it's further away and doesn't
 

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:42.480
because it's further away and doesn't
give us quite the five Sigma's

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:42.490
give us quite the five Sigma's
 

01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:45.400
give us quite the five Sigma's
significance as a single event but

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:45.410
significance as a single event but
 

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.650
significance as a single event but
otherwise it appears to be like the

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:47.660
otherwise it appears to be like the
 

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.930
otherwise it appears to be like the
others so we have a set of events

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:49.940
others so we have a set of events
 

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.450
others so we have a set of events
we start to let us look at distributions

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:52.460
we start to let us look at distributions
 

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.170
we start to let us look at distributions
of the alignments of spins the masses of

01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:56.180
of the alignments of spins the masses of
 

01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:58.090
of the alignments of spins the masses of
them and the difference in how long they

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:58.100
them and the difference in how long they
 

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.280
them and the difference in how long they
are is the difference in how much their

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:00.290
are is the difference in how much their
 

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:04.990
are is the difference in how much their
masses are and so forth so the fifth one

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000
masses are and so forth so the fifth one
 

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.150
masses are and so forth so the fifth one
here actually has a different

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:07.160
here actually has a different
 

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.760
here actually has a different
significance that's this one here the

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:09.770
significance that's this one here the
 

01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:16.150
significance that's this one here the
dates are the 17th the 8th month the

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:16.160
dates are the 17th the 8th month the
 

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.080
dates are the 17th the 8th month the
14th day in 2017 so just this last

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:20.090
14th day in 2017 so just this last
 

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:24.400
14th day in 2017 so just this last
August so this last August we detect an

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:24.410
August so this last August we detect an
 

01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:28.450
August so this last August we detect an
event that at the same time was detected

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:28.460
event that at the same time was detected
 

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.370
event that at the same time was detected
for the first time also in the Virgo

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:30.380
for the first time also in the Virgo
 

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.060
for the first time also in the Virgo
detector in Italy the Virgo detector is

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:34.070
detector in Italy the Virgo detector is
 

01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:36.130
detector in Italy the Virgo detector is
very much like like oh I don't have time

01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:36.140
very much like like oh I don't have time
 

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.620
very much like like oh I don't have time
to show some interesting differences in

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:38.630
to show some interesting differences in
 

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:41.980
to show some interesting differences in
how they approach the problem but it

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:41.990
how they approach the problem but it

and it's very near Pisa in Italy it's

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:22.370
and it's very near Pisa in Italy it's
 

01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.670
and it's very near Pisa in Italy it's
not just this confidence which of course

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:24.680
not just this confidence which of course
 

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.010

the same thing that's great and at this

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:30.020
the same thing that's great and at this
 

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.800
the same thing that's great and at this
point we don't really need that we're

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:32.810
point we don't really need that we're
 

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.000
point we don't really need that we're
pretty convinced that we're seeing

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:34.010
pretty convinced that we're seeing
 

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:37.180
pretty convinced that we're seeing
gravitational waves but and we were in

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:37.190
gravitational waves but and we were in
 

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.400
gravitational waves but and we were in
competition for twenty years I think to

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:39.410
competition for twenty years I think to
 

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:41.470
competition for twenty years I think to
see who could see gravitational waves

01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:41.480
see who could see gravitational waves
 

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.600
see who could see gravitational waves
first but it gives us new information

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:43.610
first but it gives us new information
 

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:47.380
first but it gives us new information
and that's shown here with just the

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:47.390
and that's shown here with just the
 

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:51.240
and that's shown here with just the
first detectors we were able to locate

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:51.250
first detectors we were able to locate
 

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:53.860
first detectors we were able to locate
even on the first event that it came

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:53.870
even on the first event that it came
 

01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:56.200
even on the first event that it came
from the southern hemisphere and we knew

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:56.210
from the southern hemisphere and we knew
 

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:58.780
from the southern hemisphere and we knew
to some number six or seven hundred

01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:58.790
to some number six or seven hundred
 

01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.090
to some number six or seven hundred
square degrees where it came from and

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:01.100
square degrees where it came from and
 

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.649
square degrees where it came from and
the various events are shown here

01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659
the various events are shown here
 

01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:05.239
the various events are shown here
and how well we could tell where they

01:20:05.239 --> 01:20:05.249
and how well we could tell where they
 

01:20:05.249 --> 01:20:07.850
and how well we could tell where they
came from before we turned on the Virgo

01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860
came from before we turned on the Virgo
 

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.489

the time difference in the arrival time
 

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:21.560
the time difference in the arrival time
with the different detectors and the

with the different detectors and the
 

01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:23.509
with the different detectors and the
difference in the signal because the

01:20:23.509 --> 01:20:23.519
difference in the signal because the
 

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.029
difference in the signal because the
antenna patterns are somewhat different

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:25.039
antenna patterns are somewhat different

01:20:28.459 --> 01:20:28.469
gave us this signal down here and you
 

01:20:28.469 --> 01:20:31.159
gave us this signal down here and you
can see that we now can locate with the

feel great is that we're the ones that
 

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.420
feel great is that we're the ones that

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:02.250
actually have the better location even
though we're a beginners at this game so

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:02.260
though we're a beginners at this game so
 

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.870
though we're a beginners at this game so
and that's very important for the future

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880
and that's very important for the future
 

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.380

heavier elements in nature we don't
really know we do know how to make them

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:22.750
really know we do know how to make them
 

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:24.450

the periodic table has gone up quite

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:26.170
the periodic table has gone up quite

the periodic table has gone up quite
high we basically take a heavy element

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:28.510
high we basically take a heavy element
 

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:30.840
high we basically take a heavy element
and bombard it with neutrons it sounds

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:30.850
and bombard it with neutrons it sounds
 

01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:33.810
and bombard it with neutrons it sounds
familiar neutron stars so the neutrons

01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:33.820
familiar neutron stars so the neutrons
 

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.370
familiar neutron stars so the neutrons
are the way we do it in the laboratory

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:35.380
are the way we do it in the laboratory
 

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.370
are the way we do it in the laboratory
so the idea is very tempting that maybe

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:38.380
so the idea is very tempting that maybe
 

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:41.070
so the idea is very tempting that maybe
in nature its collisions like we just

01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080
in nature its collisions like we just
 

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.380
in nature its collisions like we just
observed that is neutron star collisions

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:43.390
observed that is neutron star collisions
 

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:46.470
observed that is neutron star collisions
that made heavy elements this graph here

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480
that made heavy elements this graph here
 

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.440
that made heavy elements this graph here
is one phenomenological interpretation

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:49.450
is one phenomenological interpretation
 

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:52.650
is one phenomenological interpretation
of that and the yellow parts which

01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:52.660
of that and the yellow parts which
 

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.660
of that and the yellow parts which
you'll notice are mostly yellow for gold

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:54.670
you'll notice are mostly yellow for gold
 

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:56.370
you'll notice are mostly yellow for gold
and platinum which you might have on

01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:56.380
and platinum which you might have on
 

01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:00.690
and platinum which you might have on
your hand are come from merger of

01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:00.700
your hand are come from merger of
 

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.820
your hand are come from merger of
neutron stars at least in this analysis

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:02.830
neutron stars at least in this analysis
 

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:05.760
neutron stars at least in this analysis
and so maybe all the gold and platinum

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:05.770
and so maybe all the gold and platinum
 

01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:07.920
and so maybe all the gold and platinum
that we sell on the earth we finally

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:07.930
that we sell on the earth we finally
 

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:09.810
that we sell on the earth we finally
discovered comes from collisions like

we've been looking at another approach
which is to make basically a LIGO liked

01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:29.300
which is to make basically a LIGO liked
 

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.020
which is to make basically a LIGO liked
detector but much bigger that is to make

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:32.030
detector but much bigger that is to make
 

01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:34.090
detector but much bigger that is to make
a detector that's 40 kilometers instead

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:34.100
a detector that's 40 kilometers instead
 

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.950
a detector that's 40 kilometers instead
of 4 kilometers you'll remember from

01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960
of 4 kilometers you'll remember from
 

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.530
of 4 kilometers you'll remember from
Ray's talk that length basically you

01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:38.540
Ray's talk that length basically you
 

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:41.109
Ray's talk that length basically you
gain linearly so if we can make it 40

01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119
gain linearly so if we can make it 40
 

01:34:41.119 --> 01:34:43.030
gain linearly so if we can make it 40
detectors and do everything else as well

01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040
detectors and do everything else as well
 

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.240
detectors and do everything else as well
we're ten times better basically and

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:45.250
we're ten times better basically and
 

01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:47.290
we're ten times better basically and
this would be then on the Earth's

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:47.300
this would be then on the Earth's
 

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:49.390
this would be then on the Earth's
surface which is cheaper but we have to

01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400
surface which is cheaper but we have to
 

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.590
surface which is cheaper but we have to
worry about the fact that there's

01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600
worry about the fact that there's
 

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.250
worry about the fact that there's
Earth's curvature in that length it's

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:54.260
Earth's curvature in that length it's
 

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:57.090
Earth's curvature in that length it's
has arms that are 40 kilometers and

01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:57.100
has arms that are 40 kilometers and
 

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:01.000
has arms that are 40 kilometers and
basically would have to have the

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:01.010
basically would have to have the
 

01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:03.820
basically would have to have the
instrumentation that we use in initial

that's black hole binary to black holes

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400
that's black hole binary to black holes

so it seemed clear to us that the talk

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:50.240

that's obviously largely luck that we
