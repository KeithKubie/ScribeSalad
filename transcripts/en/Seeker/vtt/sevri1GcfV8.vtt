00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.029
If you're on your way to Mars you can't exactly
turn around if your stomach hurts, or if you

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.399
cut your finger.

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.950
How DO we solve medical emergencies in space?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.520
Hey gang, Trace here with your DNews Weekly
Space Update.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.440
Astronauts are REALLY far from Emergency Rooms
and hospitals if a health crisis comes up.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.630
As of now, only 24 people have left low-earth-orbit,
we've not spent much time away from the cradle

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.630
of humanity.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.100
But, we are planning missions to Mars and
elsewhere in deep space, and we need to figure

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.469
this stuff out before we can go safely.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.230
Of the around 540 people who have been to
space, most of the medical issues have been

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.120
due to space sickness, but there have incidence
of arrhythmia -- irregular heartbeat, renal

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.179
colics -- or kidney stones, and infections.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.269
Luckily, no one has been TOO badly injured
yet.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.300
Most injuries actually occur during takeoff
or landing.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.749
Of those, the most common is a near-syncopal
episode due to orthostatic hypotension...

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.039
or passing out from low blood pressure.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.821
Of course, all of this has been based on the
HISTORY of space travel; the FUTURE is going

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:07.970
to see a whole different set of issues.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.110
Chronic illness, trauma, injury, and maybe
even unknown medical conditions, not to mention

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.110
the psychological strains!

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.640
According to a study from the University of
York in Canada, emergency incidents occur

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.560
at about 0.06 per person, per year in the
general population.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.420
So, for a two-and-a-half year trip to Mars,
with seven crewmembers, the math says we WILL

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.880
HAVE one emergency.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.730
Unfortunately, there's no way to know what
that emergency will be, so we'll just have

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.970
to prepare for everything.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
The space shuttle would always have two crew
medical officers trained in first aid and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.950
a Shuttle Orbiter Medical System to deal with
pre-planned issues.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.020
The CMOs were trained in dealing with minor
illnesses and injuries.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.650
They could give injections, provide medications
and antibiotics and even stitch their fellow

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.650
crewmember up!

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.500
On the International Space Station, the Routine
and Emergency Medical Operations Manual lists

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.890
what to do for scrapes, nausea, broken bones,
ulcers, infections, burns and even how to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.490
handle space-based pregnancy tests.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.450
They have the equipment to deal with it all,
but bleeding in space isn't the same as on

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.450
Earth.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.319
Without gravity, blood droplets could float
into eyes, mouths and equipment and even small

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.599
arteries could spurt fluids.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.200
As we venture deeper into space, surgery is
GOING to happen, and it could be a HUGE mess.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.739
A neurosurgeon in Pittsburgh came up with
the idea of putting a fluid-filled dome over

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.420
an open, bleeding wound.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.209
The water pressure and surface tension could
stem the bleeding until a surgeon could sew

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.290
it closed.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.409
It's been built and will be put through a
final test on Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo,

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.409
once it gets running.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.120
But before you cut someone open, modern doctors
need to know what they're going to find in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.120
there.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.739
This month, A group of Stanford students tested
a portable ultrasound machine in microgravity

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.200
on the famed, "Vomit Comet," a special 747
that lets people simulate microgravity by

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.709
flying in a parabola.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.270
The ultrasound works fine here on the ground,
but in space because of microgravity, things

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.270
behave differently.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.859
This means they need to test it and alter
the design or parameters so it will work properly.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.529
The lead student told Popular Science astronauts
will need everything we have on a ground-based

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.060
ER available to them in space.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.110
And they'll need to make sure they all work
properly.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.950
It's a big job.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.890
There are other things being implemented and
tested in the years leading up to our deep

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.890
space missions.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.279
They're testing communications uplinks, so
astronauts can confer with doctors on the

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:31.620
ground and medical devices to use in case
of everything they can think to plan for.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310
The portable ultrasound machine works great,
by the way, so hopefully they'll have that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.060
one to check off the list.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.609
Are you worried about hurting yourself in
space?

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.799
Tell us about it in the comments and maybe
we'll make an episode about it!

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.290
