00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.070
We are all apes.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.540
All of you are apes--

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.495
every single one of you.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:18.870
If we look in the
animal kingdom,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.180
our closest living relatives
are chimpanzees, bonobos,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.100
and gorillas.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.850
So here's one of my cousins.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.930
We look very different.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.060
So when did our family trees
split apart from each other?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.920
What makes him a gorilla?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.885
What makes me a human?

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.571
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:04.211
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.560
This is Albert the gorilla.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.870
I'm Professor Alice Roberts.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.500
Welcome to the second of
this year's Royal Institution

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.120
Christmas Lectures.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.150
Now, Albert is going to come
and say hello to some of you.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.740
He's very interested in you.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.420
I'm sure you're
interested in him as well.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.300
On the surface, he
looks really different.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.310
But maybe when you
get a bit closer,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.350
you can see some similarities.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.180
If you hold up your hand--

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:37.740
he's looking right at
you there in the hoodie.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.500
If you hold up your hand,
he should hold up his hand

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.670
as well.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.290
And you can compare
your hand to his.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.040
You can see that his
hand's very large.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.010
But he's got four
fingers and a thumb.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.510
He's got fingernails.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.650
Try smiling at him.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.570
Show your teeth.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.460
He'll recognise that as a smile.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.200
He knows that you're
being submissive.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.525
He's baring his teeth as well.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:57.650
I think he quite likes you.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.770
Do you want to say, hello?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.952
Hello.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:01.740
It's all right.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.270
He's harmless.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.620
He does like you.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.240
Oh.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.530
He's found a friend--

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.389
a cousin and a friend.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.190
Albert, come back
down here though.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.210
Come on.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.320
Come down

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.300
Albert is a great ape.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.230
We're part of this family
of great apes as well.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.920
And so those great apes include
gorillas and chimpanzees

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.400
and bonobos and orangutans.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.050
And then our family
of great apes

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.830
is part of an even bigger group
of animals called primates.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.200
And all primates have
various things in common.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.890
So [LAUGHS] we're all
very good with our hands.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.080
We've got grasping hands.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.550
All primates have clavicles.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.050
You've got collarbones,
haven't you?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.810
There's one thing that
makes you a primate.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.230
And also, all primates
are really, really good

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.388
at climbing.

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:57.874
[AUDIO OUT]

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:55.144
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.850
Alex and Dane, that
was absolutely amazing.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.130
How wonderful to
see people who can

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.160
use their bodies in
that way and move around

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.350
in 3D space like that.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.269
It reminds us just how flexible
the human body really is.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.790
I think a lot of us move
around in a really boring way

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.050
in comparison.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.630
Which one of you
here has ever tried

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.500
to climb a climbing
frame or a tree?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.520
You've all done it.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.130
So we are primates at heart.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.510
Thank you very much.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.463
And Alex and Dane, what
an amazing performance.

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:38.130
I thought you were
absolutely brilliant.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.240
Let's ask Albert what he thinks.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.139
What do you think, Albert,
to their parkour performance?

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.410
[GRUNTS]

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.910
Aww.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.370
Oh, I think it was
better than that.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.210
Oh well.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.830
A big round of applause
for our great ape.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.170
Alex and Dane showed
just brilliantly

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.160
how we can still move
around in 3D space

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.610
as primates do if we want
to and if we train at it.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070
But in fact, there
are other clues

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.830
to our primate connections.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.220
And there's one clear one
I'd like to show you now,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.820
which is only there for a
fleeting moment in our lives

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.500
when we're very, very young.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.260
So I'd like you to do a very
gentle round of applause

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.110
now for Vicki and Aria.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.210
Hello, Vicki.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.710
Hello.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.260
Hello, Aria.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.030
So Aria is very, very small.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.770
She's a very new person.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.860
How old is she?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.720
She's six weeks.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.510
She's six weeks?

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.060
Yes.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.850
You're gorgeous.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.270
Aren't you lovely?

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.870
Now, Aria is so
small that she still

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.430
has a reflex that all of
you will have lost long ago.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.270
But I might be able
to show it to you.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.290
I want to at her hand.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.740
Is this all right, Vicki?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.430
Yes, of course.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.240
And what I'm trying to do is
put my finger in her hand.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.420
And she closes her fingers.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.950
[CRYING]

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.783
She doesn't like it.

00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:00.190
Oh, no, Aria.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.280
I'm sorry, poppet.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.245
[CRYING]

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:02.745
Oh.

00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:03.330
It's OK.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.130
Oh.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.690
She's really gripping my
finger really strongly.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.560
She's got this incredible
reflex which is elicited.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.020
I'm making it happen just by
slightly tickling the palm

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.850
of her hand, and she grabs on.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.161
[CRYING]

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:17.905
Oh, baby.

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:19.160
Good girl.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.120
So this reflex disappears
by about six months of age.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.980
But it's something
that we think is

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.610
leftover from our ancient
primate ancestors.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.460
And Vicki and Aria,
I've got a little video

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.840
here to show you some cousins.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.550
So these are chimpanzees.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.700
And what you can see
here is a chimpanzee baby

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.130
on its mother's back.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.870
And you can see how the
mum's moving pretty swiftly.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.670
And that chimp baby,
even though it's tiny,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.530
has to cling on for dear life.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.720
So it's really gripping
with its hands.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.880
So this is where we think
this grasp reflex is

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.090
leftover from in our babies.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.078
But by about six months, she'll
have forgotten how to do it.

00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:56.120
Thank you so much, Vicki.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.620
Thank you.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.590
Thank you, Aria.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.260
Another gentle
round of applause.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.840
Thank you.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:06.350
So we've seen now evidence of
primate connections in the way

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.320
that we can move with
our bodies if we want to.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.040
We've seen primate connections
in this amazing grasp reflex

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.920
that we're all born
with but then lose.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.920
And there are other signs
of these connections

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.150
when we look at anatomy.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.380
I'm an anatomist.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.240
So I go under the skin
and I start looking

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.140
at the structure of the body.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.750
And what I've got
here are two bones

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.270
from two different species.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.420
One of them is from a
human, and one of them

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.430
is from a chimpanzee.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.700
First of all, there's this
very, very narrow groove

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.925
at the top of this bone.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.550
If we look at the
bottoms of the bones,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.008
there are some
differences as well.

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:45.270
So both of these bones have
got a ball shape at the bottom.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.720
And on this bone, you can
see that there's a much more

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.550
prominent lip on it.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.230
So there are really
subtle differences

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.400
that tell me that this bone
is the chimpanzee humerus,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.130
and this one is a human humerus.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.280
But they're kind of
shockingly similar.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.940
Now, we're going to
put them in context

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.400
and bring in two
complete skeletons--

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.520
a human skeleton and
a chimpanzee skeleton.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520
And when you look at a
whole skeleton like this,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.937
I think you notice
the differences

00:08:11.937 --> 00:08:14.270
more than the similarities
at first, especially

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.160
because the human has
been hung like this,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.402
so he looks like he's
walking on two feet.

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:21.110
And the chimpanzee is
arranged like this,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.280
so he looks like
he's just getting

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.697
ready to go knuckle
walking, which

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:26.210
is what chimpanzees tend
to do when they drop down

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.500
to the ground.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.450
So that was the humerus
that we were looking

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.650
at in both of these animals.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.372
That's a very similar bone
in the chimp and the human.

00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:35.580
There are other bones, which
are much more different.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.640
So if you look at
the pelvis here,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.140
that's a completely
different shape.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.039
It's got a very
long, flat blade.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.870
Whereas our pelvis
is kind of a basin

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.380
shape, and it's adapted to us
walking upright on two legs.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.810
But there are other bits
that are quite similar still.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.090
And our hands is a
great example of that.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.840
So we'll hold up the chimp
hand and the human hand.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.180
You can see that the chimp
thumb is a bit weedy compared

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.530
to the human thumb.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.890
But still, base of those hands
are capable of doing something

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.390
that you can all do.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.180
Those thumbs can move
in a very special way.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.070
The thumb can move
right across the palm,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.740
and you can touch
the tip of your thumb

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.240
to your little finger.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.230
It may not feel like a really
special thing to be able to do.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.650
But this opposable thumb is
really important in grasping.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.070
It's something that other
primates have as well.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.170
But our opposable
thumbs are exceptional.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.310
So they're really great when
you're making and using tools.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.620
But I want to demonstrate
just how useful they

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.660
are with two volunteers.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.080
So can I have two volunteers
from the audience, please?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.880
So I'd like you in the
mustard jumper and, yes,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.350
in the grey hoodie.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.980
Come down.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.820
Come down.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.190
And we've got a little
challenge for you.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.110
As you can see, it
involves grapes.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.040
What's your name?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.760
Esme.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.260
Esme.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.980
So you're there with
the green grapes, Esme.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.188
Are you right or left handed?

00:09:56.188 --> 00:09:56.938
I am right-handed.

00:09:56.938 --> 00:09:57.438
OK.

00:09:57.438 --> 00:09:59.330
Can you put your left
hand behind your back?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.260
Lovely.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.340
And what's your name?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.890
Lena.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.720
Lena.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.960
So Esme and Lena,
you're going to be

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.240
pitted against each other in
a grape picking challenge.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.470
You're both right-handed.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.790
So Lena, if you put your
left hand behind your back

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.370
as well so you're not
tempted to use it at all.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.740
What I want you to
do, when I say go,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.280
is pluck grapes from that
bunch just using one hand.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.290
And put the grapes
in this empty bowl.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.740
So that's the challenge.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.240
All right?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.640
So taking grapes off--

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.390
I'll put the bowls
around that way for you

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.470
as well, as it might
be a bit easier.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.373
Thank you.

00:10:31.373 --> 00:10:32.540
So you pluck the grapes off.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.710
You put them in the bowl.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.960
And you've got 15
seconds to do it.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.940
I'm going to give
you a countdown--

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.250
1, 2, 3, 4, I
declare a thumb war.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.055
Go!

00:10:44.055 --> 00:10:44.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.854
15 seconds.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.980
Who's going to do
better at this?

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.820
I think that might be cheating.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.240
[LAUGHS]

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:02.490
All right, stop--
stop, stop, stop.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.350
Drop the grapes.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.600
Now, the really amazing thing
about this demonstration

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.250
is it's meant to show
how, if you don't

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.940
have your opposable
thumb, you're

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.470
much worse at plucking grapes.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.070
Do you know what, Lena?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.870
We've done it with so
many people this afternoon

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.520
in rehearsals, and
we always ended up

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.230
with a great pile
of grapes over here

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.980
and a very small pile
of grapes over here.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.210
I think possibly you cheated
by picking up the bunch

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.406
and shaking it.

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.170
But this does show
something really important.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.180
So if you don't pick up
the bunch and shake it,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.570
then you're going to end up
with fewer grapes in here.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.370
Humans are also rather
ingenious and very good

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.590
at problem solving.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.710
So thank you very much to
Lena and Esme for testing out

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.400
their thumbs.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.636
Thank you.

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:48.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.000
So lots of things,
then, that we've

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.090
got in common with
our primate cousins--

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.370
anatomy, behaviour.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.040
But actually these
similarities go down

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.870
to the level of molecules
inside your cells.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.870
You can actually look for
similarities like this

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.570
when you get down
to the level of DNA.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.370
So this is when I'd
like to introduce

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.450
my friend, the geneticist,
Professor Aoife McLysaght.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.408
Thank you!

00:12:19.408 --> 00:12:20.900
Oh!

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.720
OK, thank you so much.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.850
Well, one of the really useful
things about genetics and DNA

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.640
analysis is that we can
actually put a number

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.700
on these similarities that Alice
has already been describing.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.420
So the people in row 5 all
have a very special ribbon

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.950
in front of you
all around there.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.020
So could you just take
hold of that ribbon?

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.437
I'm going to tell
you to stand up.

00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:42.145
So are you ready?

00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:42.645
OK.

00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:43.740
Can you stand up please?

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.350
And we're going to show
this ribbon to everybody.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.190
OK, great.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.490
So what you can see
here across the room,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.082
that's a DNA sequence.

00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:53.790
And that's not just
any old DNA sequence.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.090
That's real DNA sequence.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.930
The top ribbon is
showing you DNA sequence

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.480
from the human genome,
and the bottom ribbon

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.490
is DNA sequence from
the chimpanzee genome.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.650
It's a real sequence.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.420
This actually comes
from a gene called

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.120
factor IX, which makes part
of your blood clotting system.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.660
So the first thing you might
notice when you look at these

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.080
is that the top and the
bottom are mostly the same.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.080
And this is what we see.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.125
The human and the
chimpanzee DNA sequences

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:20.250
are really, really similar.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.583
But there are a few differences.

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:24.070
So I'd like the people in
row 4 to help me out here.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.320
If you could just have a look.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.990
And I just want to see
letter differences.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.870
So raise your hand and
show me if you've got one.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.310
So, yeah we've got one up here.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.420
Thank you.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.610
So what we see here is in
the human sequence on the top

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.443
we have a C and a G. And
in the chimpanzee sequence

00:13:41.443 --> 00:13:43.110
on the bottom we've
got a T and an A. So

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.735
we've got two letter
differences there.

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.130
And have we got somewhere else?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.890
Got a difference?

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.670
Give me a wave.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.020
Yeah, over there.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.440
So, yeah.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.070
So this one here, just one
letter that's different here.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.070
So we've got a T in human
and a C in chimpanzee.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.160
But the rest, they're
all pretty much the same.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.800
So that's just one kind of
difference that we can look at.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.260
And if we looked over
the whole genome,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.840
we find that this
amount of difference

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.240
is actually quite
representative of what we see

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.460
over the whole DNA comparison.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:17.030
So that's about 1% different,
or 99% the same, you could say.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.510
But that's just one way of
counting the differences.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.790
There are actually other
kind of differences.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.870
So somewhere in
this ribbon, we've

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.300
got a loop that's sticking out.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.990
Give me a wave if
you can see the loop.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.830
OK, over here.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.060
Yeah.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.470
So in this loop here, so
that's the human sequence

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.620
going across the top; chimpanzee
sequence across the bottom.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.830
And there's this bit that's
looping out in human.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.110
There's nothing to match it
against on the other side.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.050
So there's a piece
of DNA that's either

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.990
been inserted into
the human genome,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.240
or deleted from the
chimpanzee genome.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.250
But we can't match those up.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.590
And there are other bits
like that around the genome,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.360
if we were to do the
whole comparison.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.350
And that adds about
another 3% different.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.350
So if we put these together,
we get it's about 4%

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.475
different, or 96% the same.

00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:05.850
It's the kind of thing you
might like to see on a t-shirt

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.290
or something, don't you think?

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.062
Alice, I'd like it on a t-shirt.

00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:10.930
[LAUGHS]

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:11.430
OK.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.040
OK, then.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.540
Yeah.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.710
We'd better do
countdown, haven't we?

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.645
OK, yeah, we should do
a countdown for this.

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:16.145
OK.

00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:16.820
Three!

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.260
Two!

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.770
One!

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.660
[POP]

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.910
OK.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.080
So thank you so much.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.510
So the people in
row 5 can sit down.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.040
Who got the t-shirts?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.840
Can we have a look at them?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.170
99% chimp.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.110
Yeah, great.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.850
What does your one say?

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.420
96% chimp, including
insertions and deletions.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.310
Very good.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.840
Who's going to wear
those t-shirts?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.340
Yeah?

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.370
Wear them with pride.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.770
96% chimp, and proud.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.530
We made that comparison
kind of easy for you.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.730
We just showed it to you.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.070
Now I'm actually going
to test you on something

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.640
we were not telling
you in advance.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.380
So we've got some other
species we want to compare.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.400
So what we have here; so Alice
has a human and a chimpanzee.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.258
And I have a mouse and a rat.

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.550
They're very cute, aren't they?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.380
They're very sweet.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:09.960
Yes.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.490
So I'm going to ask you to
tell me which pair you think

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.010
is more similar at
the genetic level.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.880
So hands up if you think that
human and chimpanzee are most

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.490
similar at the genetic level.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.680
So, a good few hands.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.570
Hands up who thinks
mouse and rat

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.565
are most similar at
the genetic level.

00:16:29.565 --> 00:16:30.550
Oh, not as many.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.050
OK.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.920
This is interesting.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.162
So even though mouse and
rat look much more similar--

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.370
they're actually very similar
looking-- at least they

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.520
are to me-- they are much
more different genetically

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.250
than human and chimpanzee are.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.420
So we have 99%, or 96%,
taking into consideration

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.070
the insertions and deletions.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.730
But in rat and mouse, when we
compare them, just the genes

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.400
we can align, it's about 93%.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.660
And then there's lots
and lots of those loops.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.720
So lots more that
we can't compare.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.477
These animals look
very, very similar.

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:04.810
I mean, you've got DNA here
making a very similar body--

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.500
little ears, little
paws, little tail.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.680
These animals look much, much
more different from each other.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.542
So that small
percentage difference

00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:14.250
translates into a big
difference in body.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.319
A huge difference.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.410
A huge difference.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.010
Yeah.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.810
But what we've done
now, anyway, is

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.027
we've learned how to
count those differences,

00:17:21.027 --> 00:17:22.319
and describe those differences.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.967
But the thing we
really want to know

00:17:23.967 --> 00:17:26.550
is how the genetic differences
make those physical differences

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.300
that you see.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.820
Because despite
the similarities,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.550
there are these big
differences, aren't there?

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.120
There's a big gulf between
us and our closest relatives.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.140
I mean, chimpanzees
don't go to school.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.830
Chimpanzees don't go
to Christmas Lectures.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.750
And I don't think
Father Christmas even

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.920
knows that chimpanzees exist.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.140
Very sad, indeed.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.940
There is another big
difference, and that's

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.030
when chimpanzees stop
climbing around in trees

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.770
and come down to
the ground, they

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.390
don't do what we
tend to do, which

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.670
is walking on our two feet.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.520
They tend to walk on all fours.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.200
They knuckle walk.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.590
So when did we start
walking on two feet?

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.090
In order to answer
that, I'm going

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.550
to need a very brave
volunteer, and somebody

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.670
who's brilliant at balancing.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.950
Christmas jumper in
the second row back,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.246
please come down That's
a fantastic jumper.

00:18:21.246 --> 00:18:24.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:26.206
Thank you very much
for that volunteering.

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:26.956
You're very brave.

00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:27.694
What's your name?

00:18:27.694 --> 00:18:28.690
Steven.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.240
Steven.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.290
Right.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.130
Now, Steven, you can see exactly
what you volunteered for.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.160
So this is a
tightrope challenge.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.330
So I'd like you to go
and stand on there.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.970
I'll help you get up.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.200
And before you start doing
this tightrope challenge,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.390
let me just show you what
I want you to start doing.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.970
Because I'd like you
to behave a little bit

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.350
like one of your
primate cousins.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.540
And we've got a little
video to show you

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.650
of a capuchin monkey making
its way across a tightrope.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.340
So, Steven, what
I'd like you to do

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.495
is bring your hands
down to the cable here.

00:19:07.495 --> 00:19:09.120
Bring your hands down
to the tightrope.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.280
Can you go across on all fours?

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.230
Are you going to
be able to make it?

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.810
Is he going to be able to
do it, ladies and gentlemen?

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.010
No.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.180
I'm sorry, Stephen.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.673
I don't think anybody in the
audience could do it, either.

00:19:21.673 --> 00:19:22.840
I don't think you can do it.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.465
There's plenty of
people that are keen.

00:19:24.465 --> 00:19:25.990
We've tried it with
lots of people.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.160
Nobody can do it.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.530
Nobody can get all the
way from there to there.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.390
We are apes.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.360
We've got quite big bodies
compared with the capuchin

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.280
monkey that you just saw.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.060
He's a little, tiny,
small-bodied monkey.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.900
He can run along.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.790
He can-- he can
keep his body weight

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.830
above quite a narrow
branch, or even a tightrope.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.170
How would you prefer
to travel across that?

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.877
Standing on two legs with
weights on each side.

00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:54.460
OK, I'm not going
to give you weights.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.210
But if you pop back up there--

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.220
shall I give you a hand.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.660
You all right?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.280
You can do it on two feet then.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.060
Have a go, then.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.230
Let's be nice and quiet.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.730
Let's give him some.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.710
That's it.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.860
Yeah.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.730
Try that.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.180
I'm going to let you go now.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.740
Steven.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.656
You all right?

00:20:09.656 --> 00:20:12.572
[LAUGHS]

00:20:12.572 --> 00:20:16.540
It's really difficult.
It's really difficult.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.650
And it's also quite terrifying,
even though you're only

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.942
a foot or two above the ground.

00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:23.400
I'm going to do
something now which

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.570
I think will make it an
awful lot easier for you.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.060
So can you see
that rope going up?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.620
So if you walk
underneath that rope,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.540
and back up on the pedestal, now
you can use this to help you.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.510
Don't pull on it hard,
and just use one hand.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.000
But I think it will
give you a lot of help.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.570
So let's see how
Stephen does this time.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.670
He's using the rope just
to help him balance.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.420
He's not putting much
weight on it at all.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.570
You can see, he's weight
bearing on his feet.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.866
Well done!

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.300
Well done!

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.140
Steven, that was
absolutely brilliant.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.240
And I now want to show
you an ape doing something

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.640
very similar, shot from
a slightly strange angle,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.242
I must say.

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:06.700
But let's have a look at an
orangutan doing the same thing.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.730
So what that orang
is doing is walking

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.270
along that rope on his feet like
you walked along the tightrope,

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.000
and using his hands
to stabilise him.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.010
So you were doing
exactly the same thing.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.360
Thank you very much.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.349
Thank you.

00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:26.223
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.080
We can do this thing of
walking along a tightrope

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.080
and suspending ourselves-- or
at least stabilising ourselves

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.920
by holding onto other things.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.800
And as we've seen
with the orangutan,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.660
other apes do this as well.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.380
So what we think happened
deep back in our ancestry--

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.530
oh, hello-- what we
think happened deep back

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.060
in our ancestry is that our
ancient tree-living ancestors

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.538
were doing this, were
walking around in trees.

00:21:53.538 --> 00:21:55.830
And then, when they started
walking on the ground more,

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.330
it was quite a
simple thing for them

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.600
to do to drop out of the
tree and just continue

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.400
walking on two legs, on
two feet on the ground.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.200
So we don't have
to explain how you

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.280
go from being a four-legged
quadrupedal animal to being

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.690
an upright animal.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.940
We think our ancestors
always were upright.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.040
And then they just swapped
walking in the trees

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.620
for walking on the ground.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.300
And then, by the time we get to
about 4 to 3 million years ago,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.760
we find ancestors
who have started

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.300
to adapt in their bodies to
this new way of getting around.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.250
So their skeletons
have started to change.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.160
So they're getting better
and better at walking.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.310
And I want to introduce you
to one of these ancestors.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.410
So this is a reconstruction
of the fossil of a very, very

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.210
famous fossil discovery.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.890
She's called Lucy.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.340
And she was discovered
in Ethiopia.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.740
She belongs to a species called
Australopithecus afarensis.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.900
Australopithecus
means "southern ape."

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.630
And afarensis means
she comes from the Afar

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.670
Region of Ethiopia.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.020
And this is a
reconstruction of Lucy here.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.430
Se we can imagine what she would
have looked like in the flesh.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.670
So we can see from her skeleton
that she's got adaptations

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.140
to walking on two legs.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.550
Her pelvis has changed.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.580
It's become adapted
to bipedalism--

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.010
to two-legged walking.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.530
Her femur-- her thigh bone-- is
curving in to bring her knees

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.190
and her feet underneath
her centre of mass.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.560
She's still got some
adaptations to climbing

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.760
left in her skeleton, though,
including quite curved finger

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.600
bones.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.308
And we're not quite
sure if she was still

00:23:35.308 --> 00:23:37.860
doing a lot of climbing,
or whether these are just

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.650
leftover from her ancestors.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.928
But she's quite small.

00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:44.970
There are some other
individuals from her species

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.813
who are a bit bigger than her.

00:23:46.813 --> 00:23:49.230
But there's something else
that's quite striking, I think,

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.820
about her limb proportions.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.310
She's got longish
arms and short legs.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.550
So she doesn't really
look like us, yet.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.450
And there's a
change to long legs

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.820
that happens about
2 million years ago

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.060
with a new species appearing.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.530
And this species is
called Homo erectus.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.910
And Homo erectus appears
about 2 million years ago.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.450
This particular reconstruction
is based on a fossil

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.550
for 1 and 1/2 million years ago.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:18.330
And he's called Nariokotome Boy,
because his fossilised remains

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:23.080
were found near the
Nariokotome River in Kenya.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.370
And he's quite interesting
when you look at his bones,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.740
because he looks like he's 15.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.180
Have we got any 15-year-olds
in the audience tonight?

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.880
If I were to do an X-ray,
and look at your bones,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.590
I'd see that some of
your bones would--

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.000
still had gaps at the ends.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.520
They haven't fused yet,
because you're still growing.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.200
And his skeleton
looks a bit like that.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.910
But you're nearly fully grown.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.460
So he's got the skeleton
of a 15-year-old,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.655
almost fully grown.

00:24:44.655 --> 00:24:47.030
But then if we look carefully
at his bones and his teeth,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.610
it turns out that he was only 8.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.610
So he was only 8, but with
the body of a 15-year-old.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.240
He grew up really, really fast.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.740
He didn't have the long
childhoods that we have.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.176
And those childhoods
are really important--

00:25:03.176 --> 00:25:04.850
important to us as humans.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.390
They allow us time to learn
before we grow up into adults.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.360
We can see other
things in his skeleton.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.270
In his back here, he's
got strong back muscles.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.953
And then, moving
down to his legs,

00:25:15.953 --> 00:25:17.120
he's got strong leg muscles.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.100
And he's got really
springy tendons--

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.320
particularly this one
here-- the Achilles tendon

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.880
that attaches at the heel.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.180
We can see from the bones
that he had a really lovely

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.160
big springy Achilles tendon.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.770
And that's why we've
reconstructed him like this.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.910
Because we think Nariokotome
Boy was a runner.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.760
But in order to see just
how good the human body is

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.470
at running, we're going
to look at it in action.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.630
And Aoife is in the
library with a runner.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.290
Hi, Alice.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.550
Yeah, I'm here in the library.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.220
And I'm with Marcus from
Sheffield Hallam University,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.327
and also our very
wonderful volunteer Tom,

00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:54.410
who's been running here
on the treadmill for quite

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.280
a few minutes.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.500
So Marcus, you've been
capturing his movements.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.680
Yeah, exactly.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.030
So you might see that
Tom's covered in all

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.310
of these spherical markers.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.050
And what we can do, we can use
these motion capture cameras

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.050
that you can see dotted
around in the red cameras.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.990
And they can really
accurately measure

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.630
the position of those markers.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.850
Yeah, and we see his head
is staying quite steady.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.830
And we also see
that his shoulders

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.200
are moving back and forth.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.760
So motion capture
is a technology,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.640
which people like Marcus,
who is a sport scientist,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.240
can use to analyse how
the human body moves,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.600
but also to help athletes
improve their performance.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.200
And we can see, looking at that
little stick man there of Tom,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.820
his shoulders are moving.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.360
So by the point in time
we've got Nariokotome Boy,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.920
we've got a nice, low waist.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.048
And that enables your
shoulders to rotate.

00:26:44.048 --> 00:26:45.590
And that helps you
to balance, and it

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.630
makes running more efficient.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.660
And we've also got his
head staying quite still.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.090
So like Nariokotome Boy, he's
got nice, strong muscles,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.280
and that strong ligament
in the back of the head,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.818
and strong back muscles to
stop his body pitching forward.

00:26:57.818 --> 00:26:59.360
Because actually
when you're running,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.020
you're pretty much falling
over almost at every step,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.410
and you've got to stop
yourself doing that.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.962
So we're seeing these
adaptations in action.

00:27:06.962 --> 00:27:08.420
But actually there's
something else

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.070
that would stop you in
your tracks with running.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.390
And I think, Aoife, you're
measuring that as well.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.890
Yeah.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.080
So Tom is a pretty
wonderful volunteer,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.140
because he has also
swallowed one of these.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.300
This is a really
small thermometer.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.150
And he was asked to do
this by Doctor Danny

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.010
Longman from Cambridge
University, who's

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:29.210
also joining us here.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.750
So what have you been measuring?

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.250
Sure.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.040
So the pill that Tom
swallowed earlier

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.020
is transmitting data
wirelessly to this laptop here.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.570
And that's giving us information
about Tom's deep core body

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.970
temperature, letting us
know how warm he really is.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.380
And what do you see here?

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.750
So we've got a graph
of his temperature.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.280
We do indeed.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.980
So we see here at rest, Tom
had a core body temperature

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.160
of 37 degrees, which is
that of a healthy human.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.410
However, when he started
to run, about here,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.660
we see that his core body
temperature started to rise.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.880
And that was because his
muscles were activated.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.493
And muscle activation
generates a lot of heat.

00:28:01.493 --> 00:28:02.910
He looks quite
hot, I have to say.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.830
He does indeed.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.320
So when Tom started to warm
up, his evolved heat-loss

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.090
mechanisms began to kick in.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.040
And he was able to lose
heat at the same rate

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.840
as his muscles were
producing them.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.028
And we can see here, we
actually get a plateau

00:28:14.028 --> 00:28:15.070
in core body temperature.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.570
Yeah.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.510
And is this the same
then for other animals?

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.360
Well, if we were to have
a gazelle or a cheetah

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.160
during this experiment
in place of Tom,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.952
we would see that the
core body temperature

00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:25.238
would continue to increase.

00:28:25.238 --> 00:28:27.530
They don't have the mechanisms
to lose heat that we do.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.870
So a cheetah would have to
stop despite being so fast.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.370
Absolutely.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:30.870
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.860
So Tom here is
better than a tomcat.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.650
So there's obviously something
that our bodies are doing

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.690
in order to regulate
that temperature,

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.960
and to try to keep us cool
whilst everything we're doing

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.085
is trying to make us hotter
and hotter and hotter.

00:28:45.085 --> 00:28:46.460
And the amazing
thing about being

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.560
able to regulate our
temperature like this is it

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.280
means we can just
carry on running.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.250
We're really good at
endurance running.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.610
We can even outrun
horses and dogs.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.668
And there's a particular
secret to how we do it.

00:28:57.668 --> 00:28:58.710
That was good, wasn't it?

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.270
And Aoife, you
happen to be back--

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:00.770
Oh, yeah.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.590
--in the theatre.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.300
Uh-huh.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.360
So you're going to
demonstrate for me, Aoife--

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.110
Yeah.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.690
--what our superpower is.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.590
How we manage to keep
our temperature down.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.670
Yeah.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.450
There's a spike.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.052
Uh-huh.

00:29:12.052 --> 00:29:13.260
And we've got these balloons.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.468
And we've got these balloons.

00:29:14.468 --> 00:29:17.460
So this balloon represents
the amount of sweat

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:23.550
that a 70-kilogramme dog sweats
out during an hour of exercise.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.130
70 kilogrammes is
bigger than me.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.630
Yeah.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.170
Its quite a big dog.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:26.820
That's a big dog.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.280
Yeah.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.600
I'm going to go and
stand over here.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.100
OK.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.730
You're making me worried, Alice.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.310
I'm wearing my good shoes.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.978
OK.

00:29:33.978 --> 00:29:35.020
Well, I need a countdown.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.228
I'm not doing this by myself.

00:29:36.228 --> 00:29:36.970
OK?

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.528
3, 2, 1!

00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:40.504
[POP]

00:29:40.504 --> 00:29:41.970
[SHRIEK]

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.860
OK.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.360
OK.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.870
So it wasn't as
bad as I expected.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.300
So that's a 70-kilogramme--

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.570
No, it's not too bad, is it?

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.020
That was a 70-kilogramme dog.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.145
Dogs don't sweat that much.

00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:51.770
They have to stop, and they had
to bring their temperature down

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.330
by panting.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.160
But humans sweat quite a bit.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.120
So this balloon contains
the amount of sweat

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.270
that a human sweats out
during an hour of exercise.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.900
So we probably need
a countdown again.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.560

That was two litres.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.480
Oh, yeah.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.880
Two litres of sweat.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.980
I think I felt it.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.730
Yeah.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.610
Are you a bit wet?

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.720
I'm a bit wet now, yeah.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.440
I'm sorry, Aoife.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.550
You're not really
sorry, though, are you?

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:19.940
Not really.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.440
No.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.200
Not really.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.270
So Aoife has magnificently--

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.320
I'm so sorry, Aoife.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.660
She's going to get me back
now in lecture 3, isn't she?

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.910
She's going to be thinking
of something to do to me.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.040
Aoife's demonstrated
brilliantly,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.280
I thought-- absolutely
brilliantly-- the secret

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.570
of sweat.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.720
This is how we humans manage
to keep our temperature down.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.510
And there's something about
us that's very, very different

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.820
from our closest
living ape relatives,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.320
and that is it looks
as though we've

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.940
lost the fur over our bodies.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.810
In fact, that's not quite
true, because over the surface

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.170
of the human body we've got
5 million hair follicles.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.750
And that's actually the
same as a chimpanzee has.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.215
It's just that our hairs are
so much finer over our bodies.

00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:02.090
And that's really
important, because it means

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.860
those hairs don't trap sweat.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.950
The sweat spreads out on
the surface of the skin,

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.770
and then it can evaporate off.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.170
And as it evaporates off
it takes heat with it.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.350
So we're really, really
good at sweating.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.510
And so we're able to
run long distances.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.870
And we think this was
incredibly important

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.610
to our ancient ancestors--
people like Nariokotome Boy.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.390
So going back 2
million years ago,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.200
we've got the expansion
of grasslands in Africa--

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.310
savanna.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.890
And with the expansion
of these grasslands

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.480
we've got the expansion
of populations

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.690
of animals who are eating
that grass-- so, grazers.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.690
And then the predators
are eating the grazers.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.020
And if you could run
fast, and get to a carcass

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.970
that a predator had taken down--

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.880
perhaps those lions have gone
off to sleep in the shade--

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.710
you can steal some of that meat.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.660
So our ancestors were
certainly scavenging.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.500
They may have been
hunting as well.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.370
And we also know that they were
making stone tools that can

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.190
cut through flesh and sinew.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.090
And now I want to introduce
to you two people who

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.070
make stone tools today.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.500
And they make stone tools
that are very much like those

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.790
of our ancestors--

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.060
Antony and Nada, from the
Ancient Technology Centre

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.410
in Dorset.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.968
Let's give them a
round of applause.

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:20.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.670
Now before they get started,
some very sharp flakes

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.510
can fly from this.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.040
So I'm going to put goggles on.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.710
And those of you in the
front row have got goggles.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.840
I think, yeah, front
and second row.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.340
We may get some
flakes flying off.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.400
So let's just be
careful about it.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.250
So Antony and Nada are going
to start making stone tools.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.560
And they do it by
bashing rocks together.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.660
It's actually quite
complicated, isn't it?

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.057
I've had a go at doing it
and it is difficult to do it.

00:32:46.057 --> 00:32:47.140
There's quite a lot to it.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:47.220
Yeah--

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.012
Go on then, Antony.

00:32:48.012 --> 00:32:51.850
Bash a couple of flakes
off and see what happens.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:54.260
And he's using a cobble
to break these flakes off.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.260
That's quite a good one.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.190
Oh, that's amazing.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.070
Look at that.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.740
As soon as you do this-- as soon
as you start breaking flakes

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.250
off--

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.260
you end up with things that
have got very sharp edges.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.250
It's a cutting edge.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.960
I mean, this is a stone knife.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.130
Absolutely brilliant.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:13.150
So you can actually see how
thin that flake is just there,

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.460
especially if I shine
a light through it,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.520
you should be able to see
quite nicely that it's

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.530
incredibly thin at the edges.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.330
That's a really, really
sharp cutting edge.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.990
So you'd be able to cut up your
Christmas turkey with that very

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.350
easily indeed.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.920
Thank you.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.380
So Antony is making
fairly basic flake tools.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.920
And over here, Nada is
making something a little bit

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.540
more sophisticated,
the kind of tool

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.832
that Nariokotome Boy
might have made, actually.

00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:41.290
Nada, would you
mind holding it up?

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.560
Not at all.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.200
So this is a hand ax.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.170
She's making flakes which
are useful as knives,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.940
but this is useful,
too, isn't it?

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.720
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.220
Yeah.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.410
It's a multi-purpose tool.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.910
Yeah.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.190
So you could use it
for chopping, maybe;

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.223
smashing bones to
get marrow out of.

00:33:56.223 --> 00:33:56.890
Absolutely, yes.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:57.390
Yeah.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.413
All sorts of things.

00:33:58.413 --> 00:33:59.830
The other really
interesting thing

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.680
about this particular
shape is it's

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.390
a shape that gets copied and
copied and copied, and passed

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.490
on down through the generations.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.639
And that, I think, this tells
us something really important

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.460
about the minds of
these tool makers.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.050
Because it's not just simply a
question of bashing away at it,

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.550
is it.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.290
You've got a shape in your mind.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.920
No, you have to visualise what
you want to get out of a rock,

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.570
and work towards that shape.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.179
Absolutely.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:23.560
So you are like a sculptor.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.060
You're making the shape.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.100
So that means our
ancestors, even as long ago

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.639
as Nariokotome Boy, were capable
of abstract thought like this.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.100
They could hold the idea
of a shape in their heads.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.110
It's quite a special
thing to be able to do.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.340
And not only that.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.280
They could make it real,
which is even more special.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.830
Thank you ever so
much Nada and Anthony.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.976
That was brilliant.

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:43.950
Thank you.

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:48.333
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.500
Now stone tools
tend to stick around

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.280
in the archaeological record.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.210
They're the kinds of things
that archaeologists can easily

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.950
find and dig up.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.270
They're, after all, stone.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.010
It doesn't really rot away.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.860
Things we don't find
so often in archaeology

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.290
are made of organic materials.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:15.520
So anything made out of
leaves or grass or wood

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.890
is usually going to rot away.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:21.160
And so it's very difficult to
know exactly what our ancestors

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.980
were using in terms of wooden
tools at this point in time.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.370
But we do know that
lots of hunter gatherers

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.640
use very simple wooden
tools like this.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.760
And you can imagine making
this, just taking a stick,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.650
and then using one
of those stone flakes

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.028
to sharpen the end of it
until you get a point.

00:35:38.028 --> 00:35:39.570
And then perhaps
what you're thinking

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.070
is I'm going to use
that as a spear.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.250
Well, I could.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.130
But actually, you can use it
for something else as well--

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.788
something very important.

00:35:46.788 --> 00:35:48.580
And lots of modern-day
hunter gatherers use

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.780
sticks like this to dig
food out of the ground.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.670
And there's a really
important clue

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.370
as to what that
underground food might

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.210
be when we delve into genetics.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.250
That sounds like my part.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.190
Yeah, so we can actually learn
something very interesting

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.810
about our adaptations
by looking at our genes.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.620
So in your mouth you
have spit, of course.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.580
And in your saliva there
is an enzyme called amylase

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.730
that helps you digest
starch in your mouth-- start

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.160
breaking down the
starch in your mouth.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.920
And the amount of amylase
you have in your saliva

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.755
depends on your genes.

00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:28.630
So all of you will have
noticed that you have

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.040
a little packet of crackers.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.310
So you can get your
packet of crackers out.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.255
Yeah, so you're not to
start eating them yet,

00:36:34.255 --> 00:36:36.130
because I need to tell
you what to do, first.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.790
But you can just quickly
take them out of the wrapper.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:39.290
OK.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.720
What I want you to
do is I want you

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.387
to start chewing the
cracker, but you're

00:36:42.387 --> 00:36:43.810
not to swallow it, OK?

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.540
You have to keep it in your
mouth, and keep chewing.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.170
Not yet.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:47.680
Not yet.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.290
It's going to get
all mushy, and it's

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.010
going to get all
gooey and whatever.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.760
But that's fine.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.385
Just keep it in your mouth, and
keep chewing, chewing, chewing.

00:36:54.385 --> 00:36:57.040
And at some point the
flavour is going to change.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.520
So when the flavour changes
I want you to stand up, OK?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.140
So is everybody ready?

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:02.770
Steady.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.550
Go.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.810
Just chew, chew, chew.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.290
Don't swallow it.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.985
And then let me know
when the flavour changes.

00:37:09.985 --> 00:37:11.320
Oh, we've got one already.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.270
Very good, now.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.280
Yeah.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.240
More.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.500
And this is totally normal.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.038
It's actually expected that
different people stand up

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:21.830
at different times.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:22.622
So this is amazing.

00:37:22.622 --> 00:37:24.310
Everybody's starting
to stand up.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.770
So-- ba-ba--

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.020
I'm running around the stairs.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.270
What was the flavour
change for you?

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.900
Boring.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.870
Boring.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:33.370
OK.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:33.870
[LAUGHING]

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.200
It changed to boring.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.700
Did it start out interesting?

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.520
What did you think?

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.080
Sweet?

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.058
It can change to sweet.

00:37:39.058 --> 00:37:39.850
What did you think?

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.390
Sweet.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.140
Interesting.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.730
This is very good.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.080
What did you think?

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.010
Did it change for you?

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.617
It got sweeter.

00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:48.700
It's interesting that we
have people saying sweet,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.140
because that's what I expected.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.220
So the amylase enzyme in
your saliva, what it does

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.070
is it breaks the starch
down into simple sugars.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.600
So it's what we
expect is that it

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.980
starts to feel sweet for you.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.450
And the reason different people
stood up at different times

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.580
is because actually
we know that humans

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.040
have different numbers of
copies of this gene that

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.890
makes the amylase.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.770
So some people have two copies.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.998
But some people have as many
as 18 copies of this gene.

00:38:14.998 --> 00:38:16.540
So if you've more
copies of the gene,

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.320
we expect that the flavour
would change to sweet sooner.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.820
And in parts of the world where
there is a traditional diet

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.380
that's very starch-rich--

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.590
so things like rice
and potatoes and yams--

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.960
we see that people who come
from that part of the world

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.430
tend to have more copies
of the amylase gene.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:40.290
So it's an adaptation to diet
that's written in our genes.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.060
Yes, but our ancient
ancestors also

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.544
had another way of unlocking
the energy from their food.

00:38:45.544 --> 00:38:46.044
[POOF]

00:38:46.044 --> 00:38:48.970
Woo!

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:54.700
By a million years ago, our
ancestors had controlled fire.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.790
And with fire, they could
do all sorts of things.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.120
They could, obviously,
keep themselves warm.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.547
They could ward off predators.

00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:05.380
And they could do
something really important

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.700
when it came to food.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.260
They could cook it.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.830
So things start to taste
a bit nicer, perhaps.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:16.030
But even more importantly,
if you can cook food,

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.820
then it means you're
doing some of the work

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.310
in unlocking the
energy from that food

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.650
before you get it
anywhere near your mouth.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.660
So you're effectively getting
more energy from your food.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.800
And we think that
this is reflected

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.090
in a change in our
ancestors' anatomy.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:38.580
So over time, what happened
is that our ancestors--

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.820
thank you very much--

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.600
who started off with
teeth as big as this--

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.690
huge gnashers-- over time,
those teeth diminished in size,

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:52.720
and got a lot more like
the teeth in your mouth.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.750
So modern human teeth
are tiny in comparison

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.270
to this Australopithecine
jaw, with its teeth.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.210
So if you can make
your food softer,

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:02.520
you can do that by pounding it.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.120
You could do it by cooking it.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.550
It means there's no longer
any advantage in having

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.500
great big teeth like this.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.280
And your teeth can grow smaller.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.490
And then something
else that happens

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.890
is that brains are
getting larger.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.390
And if I compare
these two skulls

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.670
by showing you the
skulls like that,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.720
you can see that this modern
human skull is much bigger

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.710
compared to this one.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.860
The brain cavity-- especially at
the front just above the eyes--

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.960
is much, much bigger.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.870
Now the brain is a
really important organ.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.660
And making a change
to a brain is

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.600
something that's
quite difficult to do,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.090
as we can see from genetics.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.510
Yes, we do.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.110
And so there's something
really, really amazing

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:47.260
that we can do with DNA
sequence analysis, which

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.070
allows us to actually figure out
which are the important genes.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:55.120
And so to explain this to you,
I am going to tell you a story.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.350
And it's a true story.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.960
And it takes place
in World War II.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.840
So the Air Force wanted
to reinforce their planes.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.640
So they had this
idea that they would

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.740
reinforce the parts
of the planes that

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.270
get lots of bullet holes.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.228
So they brought in a
statistician to help them.

00:41:09.228 --> 00:41:10.937
They wanted him to
count the bullet holes

00:41:10.937 --> 00:41:12.290
and figure out where they are.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.900
But in order to picture
this, and to figure

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.480
what kind of challenge this was,
we're going to do something.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.930
So you all have paper
airplanes under your seat.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.680
So just take them.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.840
Don't do anything with them yet.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.940
OK.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.690
So if you just take a
quick look at those,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.730
you'll see that they have
holes punched in them.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.770
So that's like a bullet hole.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.130
And so what I want you to do,
when I give you the word--

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.450
don't anybody go early--

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.182
I want you to throw
those airplanes.

00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:37.390
And I want you to aim for me.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:38.050
Not yet.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:38.902
Not yet, please!

00:41:38.902 --> 00:41:40.860
I want you to aim for
me, because basically I'm

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.100
on home base, OK?

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.720
Are you ready?

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.130
Steady?

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:45.997
Go.

00:41:45.997 --> 00:41:47.945
[SHRIEK]

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:49.893
[LAUGHS]

00:41:49.893 --> 00:41:51.341
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:51.341 --> 00:41:51.841
OK!

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.530
Well, that worked.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.030
OK.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.100
So the job the
statistician had then,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.800
these are all the planes that
made it back to home base.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.420
And he wanted to look at these.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.382
So I need to mark--

00:42:04.382 --> 00:42:06.090
I need to keep track
of what's happening.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.450
OK.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.500
I'll mark them on this.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.333
Alice, you could give
me a little hand here.

00:42:09.333 --> 00:42:11.318
So this one has a
bullet hole there.

00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:12.610
So you could take that from me.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.110
Yeah.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.450
And what I'm going to
do is I'm going to make

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.255
little marks on this plane.

00:42:17.255 --> 00:42:18.130
So there's one there.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.380
Yeah, there's one on the wing.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.097
One on that little
bit of the wing.

00:42:22.097 --> 00:42:23.430
There's one on that bit of wing.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.880
I'll do it.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.210
OK.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.510
This is going to take forever.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.240
We need a bigger plane.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.790
Thank you.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.640
OK.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.920
So this plane we've already
collected all these data.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.120
So this is what the
statistician had to do.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.840
He had to collect
the information

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.850
from all the different
planes that came back,

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.750
and he mapped them onto
a picture of the plane.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.220
And the legend is that the
Air Force's first instinct

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.935
was, well, we're
going to patch up

00:42:48.935 --> 00:42:50.310
those bits of the
plane that have

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.180
loads of bullet holes in them.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.940
But the statistician said to
them, no, you've got it wrong,

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.440
really.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.450
Because actually we
notice these parts

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.240
of the plane that have
no bullet holes in them.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.710
So what's happening there?

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.350
Well, they're the planes
that didn't come home.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.750
They're the ones that
had really bad damage

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.920
they couldn't fly with.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.410
These are the bullet holes
that allowed the plane

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.740
to fly despite the damage.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.460
So these parts of the plane
are things like the engine,

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.610
or the cockpit, or
the steering gear.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.870
So by looking at the
pattern of bullet holes,

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:27.310
you can see the important parts
and the less important parts.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:30.610
And it turns out we can do
this same kind of analysis

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:31.760
with gene sequences.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.680
So if you imagine for a
moment that this is a genome,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.070
then we have some genes in the
genome where lots of mutations

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.000
happen.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.030
So the DNA changes, but
it doesn't really matter.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.730
So there's a change, but it's
not a significant change.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.520
And then there are other parts
of the genome-- other genes--

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.960
that they really matter.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.090
And when you get
a change in them,

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.830
it really affects
the individual.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.660
So they can't survive
and thrive as well.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.660
And if we look across
mammals, and we say, well,

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.880
which are the genes in these
really important areas,

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.510
we find that there's especially,
in these parts of the genome,

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:08.230
it's especially genes that
are involved in your brain.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.660
So genes that work
in your brain.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.620
But something really
changed in human evolution.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.970
Woo!

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:20.260
So in early human
evolution, these brain genes

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.940
started changing quicker.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.920
They started evolving faster.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.710
So this is a really
unusual pattern.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:30.250
And this tells us that something
was driving that change.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:34.370
Something really
important had happened.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.340
So in order for these
mutations to start

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.740
appearing, and then
building up and creating

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.050
this big difference in
brains, and getting brains

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:47.030
to grow larger, there must have
been a significant advantage

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.130
in growing a bigger brain.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.140
And anthropologists have
wrapped their brains

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.480
about what that
could possibly be

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.460
that was driving this
increase in brain

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.660
size in human evolution.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.380
They said, well, our ancestors
must have been working together

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.530
in teams on the African
plains as hunters.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:05.120
So maybe it's
co-operative hunting.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120
Maybe that's what's driving
this increase in brain size.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.370
But then hunting
dogs and lions are

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.070
great at cooperating in hunting.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.050
And their brains
aren't very big at all.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.180
So then anthropologists
said, well, maybe there's

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.805
something else.

00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:19.340
Maybe it's stone tools.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.560
Maybe you need a really
big brain in order

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.540
to be able to make stone tools.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.660
But actually, that turns
out not to be likely either,

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.530
because our ancestors started
making stone tools more

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.030
than three million years ago,
when, again, their brains were

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.860
pretty small.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.930
There's another group
of anthropologists

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.020
who think they've got a
hypothesis which stacks up

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.480
when it comes to brain size.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.650
And I need a
volunteer now to help

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.837
me explore that hypothesis.

00:45:44.837 --> 00:45:46.670
I'm particularly drawn
by Christmas jumpers.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.370
So I'm going to pick you with
a fantastic reindeer Christmas

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.225
jumper.

00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:52.708
Come on down.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:53.208
Jasmine.

00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.182
Right.

00:45:54.182 --> 00:45:56.048
OK, I've got a
bit of a challenge

00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:57.104
here for you, Jasmine.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.420
What we've got
here is some cubes.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.700
And the cubes
represent brain size.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.280
In fact, they represent a
very special bit of the brain.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.460
They represent the grey matter
on the outside that we call

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.960
the neocortex.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.220
And we've scaled
it to body size.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.885
So this must be an animal with a
very small amount of neocortex.

00:46:17.885 --> 00:46:20.010
And then this must be an
animal with a large amount

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.590
of neocortex.

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:25.400
Underneath these cubes that
represent different brain size,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.960
we've got a clue
as to what it is

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.000
that's driving brain
size increases,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.443
or explaining brain
size increases.

00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:33.860
So what I'd like you to do is
lift up each of these cubes,

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:38.360
and will reveal a
score for each species.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.260
Here we go, then.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.970
What's the score for this one?

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:42.670
Ah.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:44.500
The score is 1.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.235
And this species
is a slow loris.

00:46:49.235 --> 00:46:52.110
A very cute type of primate.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:52.610
OK.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.970
What about this species here?

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.390
Let's review the
score for this one.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.740
Oh, that's a lot.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.620
That's 17-- I can
count very quickly--

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.240
small cubes.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.100
And this species
is a spider monkey.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.160
What about this one?

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.650
What's the score for that one?

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:12.250
Oh, 54 small cubes.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.420
This one is a chimpanzee.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.110
And then finally, would you
like to lift that big cube?

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.210
There's a pile of
people underneath it.

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:21.915
This is a human.

00:47:25.822 --> 00:47:26.780
And what these scores--

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.430
--what these scores
represent, Jasmine,

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:36.610
is the size of social group that
these animals normally live in.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.520
So the slow loris is a
very solitary creature.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.100
It doesn't have any friends.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.600
It just lives on its own.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.450
Spider monkeys are a
little bit more gregarious.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.840
They live in a social
group which averages 17.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.370
Chimpanzees even more--
average group size of 54.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.860
Humans, on average
we have 150 friends.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.320
And that's not
just acquaintances.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.230
That's people we
know pretty well.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.800
Jasmine, thank you for revealing
the secret of big human brains.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.736
Thank you very much.

00:48:06.736 --> 00:48:12.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.640
So it turns out, then, that it's
most likely that our big brains

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.440
are all about making friends--

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.330
making friends and
keeping friends,

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.340
making those connections.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.370
After all, we are
all quite puny apes.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.610
And we've done ever so well
for ourselves as a species.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:32.840
And we've managed to expand
across the whole world.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.190
And what we're going to do now
is map out those expansions.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.980
And I need two
volunteers to come

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.120
and help me colonise the world.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.080
There's somebody
in a blue t-shirt

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.230
on second row to the back.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.175
Yes, you.

00:48:45.175 --> 00:48:46.560
So come down.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.520
Aoife, have you got a
volunteer on your side?

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.218
Yes.

00:48:50.218 --> 00:48:51.130
Hello.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.600
I've got Tessa here.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.530
Come on down.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.659
Come on down.

00:48:54.659 --> 00:48:57.533
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:57.533 --> 00:48:58.345
Wonderful.

00:48:58.345 --> 00:48:58.970
Just come here.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:59.930
Turn around.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.320
So what's your name?

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.000
Shereen.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.550
Shereen.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:03.490
Lovely to meet you.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.600
So--

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.550
OK, so Tessa and--

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.270
Shereen.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.200
Shereen.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.510
What we're going to ask you
to do is start in Africa,

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.177
because that's where
our species starts.

00:49:12.177 --> 00:49:14.020
So can you find
Africa on the map?

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.530
Go on.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:15.790
Plant your feet on it.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:17.170
Occupy it.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.030
That's where our species starts.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.500
And our species originated in
Africa about 300,000 years ago.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.240
So you can each put a pair
of feet firmly on Africa.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.530
Now we might need to
reload these as we go.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:31.180
We might.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:31.850
OK.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.353
So, you start in Africa.

00:49:33.353 --> 00:49:34.270
Plant them on the map.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.770
You can walk around
in Africa a bit.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.330
You're all over Africa.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.270
So our species was
just an African species

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.010
for a few hundred
thousand years.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.085
Then about 100,000 years ago,
Tessa, if I move you backwards,

00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:45.710
you can start--

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:46.670
--Africa.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:48.740
Make a little trail
of footprints.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.180
And you can come all the
way along here into Asia.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.000
Do you need a bit more paint?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.700
And you can come along
here through South Asia.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.090
Do you want to come all the
way down into Australia?

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:06.880
By 65,000 years ago, modern
humans had reached Australia.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.550
Yay!

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.730
Fantastic!

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.672
I'll meet you back over here.

00:50:12.672 --> 00:50:16.150
And now, Shereen, are you
nicely loaded up with paint?

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.520
You can start making your
way into Europe, if you like.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.005
So from about 50,000 years ago.

00:50:20.005 --> 00:50:21.880
And you can walk all
the way over to Britain.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.590
Can you see Britain on the map?

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:27.690
By 40,000 years ago, modern
humans, Homo sapiens like us,

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:29.110
had reached Britain.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:29.740
Lovely.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.320
Yes.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.353
Very nice job.

00:50:31.353 --> 00:50:34.993
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:34.993 --> 00:50:36.910
Tessa, I've got a bit
more work for you today.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:39.480
Start from here in South Asia.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.610
And then you can walk all
the way up to the north,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.640
up to the coast of the Arctic
Ocean by 30,000 years ago.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.690
Come over here.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.860
You can walk across here.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.660
Actually there's a
land bridge here,

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.080
because the sea level's low, and
you can pop across into Alaska.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.650
And now the ice is
melting in Alaska,

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.950
and you can walk all the
way down to South America.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:57.240
We've colonised North America.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.120
That's the Clovis
hunters of North America.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.850
And we've got people
going all the way down

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.200
into South America.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.820
We have colonised the world.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.641
Yay!

00:51:06.641 --> 00:51:07.563
Fantastic!

00:51:07.563 --> 00:51:10.790
Well done, Shereen.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.170
Brilliant handiwork, I think
there, Shereen and Tessa--

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.070
or I should say footwork.

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.230
We've colonised the globe.

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.747
Good work.

00:51:17.747 --> 00:51:18.580
Thank you very much!

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.156
Well done!

00:51:19.156 --> 00:51:19.656
Well done.

00:51:19.656 --> 00:51:20.612
Thank you.

00:51:24.436 --> 00:51:26.700
It took a while to get
into Europe, didn't it?

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.200
It did.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.908
There was a little
bit of hanging around.

00:51:28.908 --> 00:51:33.530
I think they might have met
some friends around here.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.150
Indigenous European people?

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.140
Well, these earlier
humans who were already

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.780
there before the modern
humans got there--

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.100
Neanderthals.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.740
So the Neanderthals were
the inhabitants of Europe

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.640
before our lot got there.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.620
And we used to think they
were entirely separate.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.650
Looking at their bones, we
thought that there was never

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.020
any kind of real interaction
between modern humans

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:57.980
and Neanderthals.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.450
But genetics has
changed all that.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:00.020
Yes.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.470
So what we can do now, we
can actually get DNA out

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.670
of these really old bones.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.970
So we've been able to get
DNA out of Neanderthal bones.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.850
And this revealed some
really interesting surprises,

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:13.040
because when we looked
at the Neanderthal DNA,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.320
you could see that it
didn't look actually totally

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.330
different from human DNA.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.555
So, as you know, you got half
your DNA from your mum and half

00:52:20.555 --> 00:52:21.430
from your dad, right?

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.220
So 50-50.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.070
And then you've got
about 25% of your DNA

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.720
from each of your grandparents.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.780
And then different amounts
from other ancestors.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.820
And when we look
at people today,

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.950
we find we have
chunks of DNA that are

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.930
from a Neanderthal ancestor.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.220
I've got a bit in my DNA.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:37.790
Yeah, me too.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:38.540
Yeah, we all have.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.310
There's only one way
to get a chunk of DNA

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.180
from somebody else.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:41.680
Yeah.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.340
Shenanigans.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.010
Shenanigans.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.420
Something went on.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.010
There was some
serious interaction

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.710
between modern humans
and Neanderthals.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:48.877
You're shocking the parents.

00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:50.590
[GASP]

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:51.930
And it's not just Neanderthals.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.430
No.

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:56.120
There's these other species who
were around over here in Asia.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.160
And we met up with them as well.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.330
Well, they may be a species.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.420
They may just be a slightly
different set of people there.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.800
I call them Denisovans.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.010
My view is that they're
the same species,

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.980
and we're all the same species,
because of all this mixing.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.540
Do you think?

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.040
Yeah.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.440
That's something we disagree on.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.520
That is something
we disagree on.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.060
I'd say from the
bones, Neanderthals

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.530
are different species,
but genetically

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:16.890
you're saying they're the same.

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.890
See, scientists
don't always agree.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:19.760
No.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.460
But with the Denisovans, there's
so little you can say, anyway.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.640
There's so little
in terms of bones--

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.230
a finger bone and
three teeth, I think.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.120
But when we can get
really good DNA,

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.490
actually, even though
it was just a tiny bone,

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.790
the DNA inside it was really,
really well preserved.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.027
And so it's really
good DNA sequence.

00:53:36.027 --> 00:53:38.360
And if we look at people--
especially people from around

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.540
this part of the world--

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.860
we see that they have chunks
of DNA from Denisovans.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.360
But we've got quite a lot of
Neanderthal DNA hanging around,

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:45.860
don't we?

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.370
So we all have chunks
of Neanderthal DNA.

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:51.000
But we have different
chunks of DNA.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.450
So if I was to take all
the different chunks

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.660
and tile them together,
we get about 70%

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.260
of the Neanderthal genome is
in people walking around today.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.170
I could do better
than that, Aoife.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.260
I can show you a
whole Neanderthal.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.210
[LAUGHS]

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.535
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.780
So with the help of some
quite amazing prosthetics,

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.780
we have transformed
a modern human

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.150
into an ancient Neanderthal.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.360
And we can see that there are
differences in the face shape.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.070
She's got a very big brow ridge
compared with us modern humans.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.710
And actually, she has a lump
at the back of her skull

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.230
as well, which you can't
see under all this hair.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.450
But the skull shape's
also a different shape

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.710
to ours, too, a bit long and low
compared with our more globular

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.720
face shapes, or head shapes.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.450
She's got a very chunky jaw.

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:51.507
But actually, she looks
similar enough to us

00:54:51.507 --> 00:54:54.090
that I don't think you'd really
notice if she was walking down

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.590
the street, would you?

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:57.480
And we keep on
finding more clues

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.130
that Neanderthals were more like
modern humans than we thought.

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.380
And one of these clues is in
what she's holding in her hand.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.360
So this is a shell.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.860
And it's a replica
based on one that

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.140
was dug out of a cave in Spain.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.510
And it's a scallop shell
that's been pierced.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.030
So perhaps used as a pendant.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.940
And also painted with red ocher.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.660
So it seems that Neanderthals
were interested in decoration

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.170
and art in the way that we know
our own modern human ancestors

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.540
were as well.

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:29.910
So perhaps a lot similar to us
than we previously expected.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.410
Anthropologists for
a long time have

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:35.450
wondered whether Neanderthals
had language like we do.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.200
And that's something
we may not ever know.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.700
I mean, can you speak?

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.476
Of course I can speak!

00:55:40.476 --> 00:55:41.330
[LAUGHS]

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:43.472
We've solved the riddle.

00:55:43.472 --> 00:55:44.414
Thank you.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.170
Although Neanderthals have
left a little bit of themselves

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:54.530
behind, and still alive in the
form of fragments of their DNA

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:57.350
in our genomes, as
a group of people,

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:00.110
they had died out
by 20,000 years ago.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.350
We don't find their
fossils any more.

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:06.170
But modern humans
survived through the peak

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.120
of the last ice age,
when the ice sheets

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:12.240
descended over Northern
Europe, and over North America.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.120
And it's at this
particular time that we see

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.750
an amazing explosion in art.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:21.080
We see our ancestors making
fantastic sculptures out

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.870
of bone and ivory.

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.960
And they also painted the
caves that they lived in.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.980
And here's a wonderful
painting of an ancient human

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.650
in a cave painting
some of the animals

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.620
that are in her environment.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.753
And there's a child
holding a lamp there,

00:56:37.753 --> 00:56:39.170
which has probably
got some animal

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:44.300
fat in it burning away so that
she can see what she's doing.

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.670
And you might think that
this seems really frivolous,

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.760
that these are people surviving
through the depths of the ice

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.660
age.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.180
And shouldn't they be
out hunting and gathering

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.070
and keeping their
families alive?

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:59.270
What are they doing painting
caves and making art?

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:00.890
But it's not frivolous.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:03.230
Art is a really
important part of the way

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.330
that we communicate
with each other.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:10.100
And this really underpins
our success as a species.

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.480
We carry on expanding.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.420
We carry on making culture.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.940
And what we see
from the genetics

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.800
is that throughout
our history we've

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.340
been moving and mixing
with archaic humans,

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.110
and with modern humans.

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.450
And we see this
continuing today.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.970
The ethnic groups and the
populations that we recognise

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:32.330
today are just a mix of
lots and lots of people.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.310
In the third
lecture, we're going

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.790
to look at human
diversity today.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.480
And we're going to find out
how those ancient migrations

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.270
contributed to the patterns
that we see around us today.

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:49.460
And we're going to look at how
our DNA influences who we are.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.700
But for now, we're going
to close this lecture

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:57.620
with a celebration of all of
our ancient hominid ancestors,

00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.370
everything that
they've given us--

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:03.680
our love of art, our language,
all of those secrets and gifts

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.415
tucked away in our DNA.

00:58:06.415 --> 00:58:07.790
And we're going
to celebrate them

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:12.245
all with a little
musical number.

00:58:12.245 --> 00:58:15.215

You can help me here, Alice.

00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:17.700
Really?

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:18.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.890
I'll just leave you
in charge of one.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:20.180
OK.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:20.930
Everybody ready?

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.599
