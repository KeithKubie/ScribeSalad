00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Hi, Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.440
Great to have you
with us tonight.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.750
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.050
Welcome to the kickoff of La voz
latina, which is a series long

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.060
in the making, I guess
it was about a year ago,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.000
Alicia and Giorda, we were
talking with the Kennedy Center

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.210
and managed this
wonderful collaboration

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.610
between the Library of
Congress and the Kennedy Center.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.520
There Will be two more
programs tomorrow night.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.740
I Will -- Sorry,
Saturday, all day long,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.670
and I encourage you to go.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.720
The first program at
eleven o'clock will be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.600
with Natasha Trethewey,
the U.S. poet laureate,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.680
and Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas,
who is a wonderful playwright,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.830
Cuban playwright, and they
will present a program,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.290
a really wonderful program on
the relationship and friendship

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.010
between two great poets,
Nicolás Guillén, of Cuba,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.770
and Langston Hughes,
of the United States,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.960
who were great friends
and wonderful poets,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.090
and translated one another.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.660
The other program
is at two o'clock,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.300
and that would be a cavalcade
of great Latin American

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.320
and Latino American writers,
and you can see in your program

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.870
who they are, is a
magnificent lineup [inaudible]

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.590
which I encourage you to come
on Saturday, eleven o'clock

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.960
and two o'clock, and between
those programs, Rolando Estévez,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.550
who you see here
tonight, the great,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.010
wonderful master bookmaker
that we are very lucky to have

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.710
in the Library of Congress
tonight will be presenting more

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.230
of his books that are on their
way, right now, from Habana,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.170
large scale material that
he has brought as well.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.620
So, the display, if you've seen
it, is absolutely marvelous,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.580
breathtaking work that he
has produced over the years,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.280
and the display at the
Kennedy Center will be an

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.650
additional bonus.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.620
So, I would encourage
you to go to that.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.230
We are very, very indebted
to the extraordinary director

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.160
of the international programing
at the Kennedy Center,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.850
Alicia Adams, and ger fantastic
dynamo colleague Giorda Almada.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.000
We are very proud of
this collaboration

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.190
between the Library
and the Kennedy Center.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.660
I think it may be
the - unprecedented,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.870
a first collaboration of this
sort of scholarly material,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.040
we think so, and so we hope
that it will be the first

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.910
of many other collaborations
in the future.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.960
So, I want to bring on Alicia
to say a few words to you.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.620
Alicia Adams, as I
say, is the director

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.070
of the International Program
in the Kennedy Center.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.270
It is through her

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.420
that Washington audiences
have been treated to authors

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.050
from really all around
the world,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.450
from China to Scandinavia,
to Africa, to all the Spanish

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.160
and Portuguese-speaking
nations, the Middle East,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.250
India and many other fascinating
places whose art we might not

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.790
know but for her efforts
and those of her colleagues,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.770
like Giorda, and the very
efficient Ginger Rogers,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.510
thank you, Ginger.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.500
If you were to keep track
of Alicia's productions,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.690
you could virtually tour
the world and see artists

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.170
and art forms that you
hadn't imagined existed,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.030
from the comfort of your
seat at the Kennedy Center.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.530
So I'd like to ask
Alicia to come up

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.970
and say a few words,
if you would.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.070
Alicia Adams.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.610
[ Aplausos ]

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.910
&gt;&gt; Alicia Adams: Thank
you so much, Marie,

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.310
that's quite an introduction.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.790
I don't know if I can live up
to that right now, but [risa].

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.630
I'd like to thank you
all for coming tonight

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.550
to tonight's literary
collaboration

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.960
between the Kennedy
Center and the Library

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.430
of Congress, La voz latina.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.810
I do carry the international
festivals

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.200
with the Kennedy Center and we
just finished a major festival

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.290
on Cuba called Artes de Cuba:
From the Island to the World.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.600
Literature has always
been important to me,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.040
for all of the festivals,
and I'm so pleased

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.300
that tonight we begin an
addition to the Cuba festival

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.090
with writers from Cuba, but also

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.790
that we will have
other latino voices.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.610
So From the Island to
the World comes alive

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.120
for me and for us tonight.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.580
I'm thrilled that we are looking
at another aspect of the book,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.950
the art of the book, with
the work of Rolando Estévez.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.630
These handmade books
are so beautiful

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.800
and if you haven't had a
look at the books that are

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.520
in the other room,
please, do so.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.690
The only time I've ever seen
such beautiful handmade books is

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.650
at the Booker Prize in London
that I go to every year,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.910
every other year, and they
always present to the five --

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.650
the five finalists a
handmade book by an artist.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.230
So, they are always
so beautiful.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.240
I'd just never seen so many
beautiful books together.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.030
There are only five there.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.710
But I think that these
books, these book covers,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.520
the books themselves, give us
another entry into the story

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.510
that will be told inside.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.080
It invites us in a
very different way

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.630
than a book that's
printed by the printer.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.090
And that's something that
I find very exciting.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.390
It's another aspect of the art

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.770
that I think we should
pay attention to.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.060
I'm so pleased that Ruth
Behar and Marie Arana thought

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.690
to have this as part
of this collaboration

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.160
and this literary event tonight.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.880
I have to say that
this is the first time

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.500
that we've collaborated with
the Library of Congress,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.160
the Kennedy Center, but this
is probably the fiftieth time

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.380
that I've collaborated
with Marie.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.730
I have followed her wherever
she went, I met her probably

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.990
over 20 years ago, and she
is a writer extraordinaire

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.230
when she was the book
editor of The Post,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.090
she did a fantastic job, and
here at the Library of Congress,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.130
with the National Book
Fair it's extraordinary

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.200
that we see thousands and
thousands of people there.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.850
No matter what the title of the
festival is, if I can find a way

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.900
to involve Marie in it, I
will, if only for advice,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.420
but many of them have
included Latino artists

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.140
or African artists or
I've involved her sister,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:32.090
I believe so, it's been a great
partnership and I love her,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.820
she is a dear friend, I'm
so glad that she's been able

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.820
to put together this series
over the next few days.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.510
So thank you, thank
you again for coming.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:51.510
[ Aplausos ]

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.810
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Oh, my goodness,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.510
I am glowing, thank
you very much.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.070
Such a special friend,
absolutely.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.020
Well, we have a very
exciting program for you

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.320
in store this evening.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.220
The participants, as you can
see, have come from far and near

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.570
to tell you about a singular,
really truly singular art form

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.080
that fuses a love of
books with a love for art.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.110
We are very, very
honored, deeply honored,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:25.340
profoundly honored to present
Rolando Estévez, a poet, writer,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.060
producer, and master bookmaker
whose handy work the Library

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.780
of Congress has been collecting

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.850
in its Rare Book Division
for many, many years.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.100
Here to tell you
about that collection,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.290
the Vigia Collection is my
colleague, Catalina Gómez,

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.890
who is sitting on
the extreme far end,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.470
without whom this program
and the two other programs

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.770
that will take place

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.030
at the Kennedy Center would
not have been possible.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.010
Thank you, Catalina.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.760
Ruth will tell you more
about Rolando and Catalina,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.490
but let me tell you a
little bit about Ruth.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.090
Ruth, our moderator sitting

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.110
in the middle this evening is
a Cuban-American anthropologist

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.580
and writer, a professor
of cultural anthropology

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.190
at the University of Michigan,
her work straddles the worlds

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.120
of the academy and popular
books, she's written poetry,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.510
memoirs, literary fiction,
books for children, she was born

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.190
in Habana and came to
live in the United States

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.130
when she was five years old.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.250
Her family roots through
her grandparents, however,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.070
go back to Turkey,
Poland, and Russia.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.270
She learned very
early on in her life

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.490
that the world was
a very large place.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.990
She credits her bookishness to
the fact that when she was nine,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:50.120
going on ten, she spent an
entire year in a body cast,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.880
at which point, Ruth,
I guess you learned how

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.500
to bring a large world
into a very small place.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.240
In love with books, never
without one in her hand,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.100
she studied Spanish
Literature at Wesleyan,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.460
she learned her Doctor in
Anthropology from Princeton.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.010
Her first book was based
on her dissertation

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.970
about a northern
village in Spain.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.350
Her second book Translated
Woman was based on ten years

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.540
of field work in a
rural town in Mexico.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.330
Her third The Vulnerable
Observer: Anthropology

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.430
that Breaks your
Heart, [ininteligible]

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.530
with a great title, exams
the role of the personal

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.630
in her scholarly discipline,
Cultural Anthropology.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.540
Jewish Cuba is the topic of her
fourth An Island Called Home,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.220
as well as her fifth
Traveling Heavy:

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.690
A Memoir in Between Journeys.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.400
Most recently she's
published a prize-winning book

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.320
for young adults called Lucky
Broken Girl, and I guess that's

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.890
about the body cast,
I would guess,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.800
and in fact it is, I've seen it.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.100
It's lovely.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.650
Congratulations.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:04.130
Just this week she was named one
of America's great immigrants

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.160
by the Carnegie Foundation.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.270
According to the Carnegie
citation she is "one

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.770
of America's naturalized
citizens who enriched the fabric

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.420
of our culture and
strengthened our democracy

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.790
through their lives, their
work, and their example."

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.310
We couldn't agree more.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ruth Behar.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.510
[ Aplausos ]

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.250
[ Ininteligible conversation ]

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.150
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So I can
talk from right here.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.450
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: You
have your microphone.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.750
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: 'Cause
I have my microphone.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.180
Okay. Well, thank you so much.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.260
I was not expecting that
introduction at all.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.560
Thank you so much.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.920
That was so beautiful,
and I am so honored.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.550
Well, it's such a huge honor
to be here today at the Library

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.920
of Congress and also to
have this collaboration

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.770
with the Kennedy Center
and to be un conversation

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.600
with Catalina Gómez, from
the Library of Congress,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.980
and my dear friend
Rolando Estévez.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.000
So, it's really, really an
honor to be here today to talk

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.030
about a Cuban Love Affair,
the Art of the Book.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.610
So, before I begin, I'm going
to just say a little bit more

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.910
about Rolando Estévez.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.900
We've already covered
some of his bio,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.810
but just to add a little
bit more that's important.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:24.530
So, Rolando Estévez, and we --
in Cuba we call him Estévez.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.270
Right? We don't call
him Rolando.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.330
His sister calls him Rolly.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.770
But in Cuba he's just known as
Estévez, people, a lot of artist

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.070
in Cuba go by their last name.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.150
So, if you hear me
calling him Estévez,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.590
I'm not being disrespectful.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.870
That's the name that he uses.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.860
So Estévez was born in Matanzas
in Cuba, and he is a poet,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.840
he is a visual artist, he
works in multiple mediums,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.380
including drawing, painting,
installation, performance,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.740
and what's very important
to know is

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.010
that he also does set
design for the theater,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.400
and that really informs
the way he constructs books

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.150
in a very theatrical
and dramatic way.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:15.120
He teaches free style design and
theater design in Matanzas and,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.600
in Matanzas, he is a leading
promoter and organizer

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.980
of artistic events, of
competitions, of exhibitions

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.970
and other alternative
cultural activities.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.320
He really is a force
in Matanzas.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.640
And in 1985, he and the poet
Alfredo Zaldívar founded

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.620
Ediciones Vigía, and all of you
I think had a chance to see some

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.150
of the Ediciones Vigía books
here, and it's very interesting

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.910
to understand how they
started out in 1985.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.350
Initially, their aim was
to create a welcoming space

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.480
for young poets from
Matanzas, for local poets,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.120
and what they did at
the very beginning was

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.190
to create beautiful
invitations to poetry readings.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.890
That was basically
how they started,

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.030
and these readings
were always accompanied

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.550
by a musical recital.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.130
So that was kind of the
origin of this project.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.540
They didn't have paper.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.840
This was the 80s.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.230
They didn't have paper
to make the invitations.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.540
So, they went to the local
butcher shops in Matanzas

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.870
and they asked for the brown
paper from the butcher shops.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.780
And that was how they
started making these beautiful

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.330
invitations on very
simple brown paper,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.910
and as you can see the brown
craft paper is still used

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.970
in Estévez's new books, which
I'll talk about in a moment.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.140
So, Ediciones Vigía, important
to know that it was born

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.580
in the city of Matanzas, which
is 50 miles away from Habana,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.300
and it's a city known
as "The Athens of Cuba",

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.720
because there's always been
a lot of reverence for poetry

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.320
and music in Matanzas, and it's
where the beautiful dance form

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.070
of the danzón was born
in the city of Matanzas.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:10.420
And Matanzas has this historic
plaza, la Plaza de la Vigía,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.830
and it was from that plaza,
which it translates roughly into

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.790
"the watchtower plaza".

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.250
It was from that plaza that they
could see the ships entering the

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.860
bay of Matanzas and they
could take action quickly

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.140
if pirates were trying to
come and take over the city.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.150
So, this notion of
being a vigía,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.290
of watching over
things was a definition

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.200
that was very important
to the co-founders

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.400
of this amazing book project.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.520
And over time, Vigía
evolved, it grew bigger,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.900
it grew into a publishing house
that involved writers, designers

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.950
and volunteers who
worked collaboratively

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.870
to create these beautiful
handmade books.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.800
And the way it worked,
when Estévez was

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.640
with Ediciones Vigía is he
would make a complete book,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.680
he would create, fabricar a
complete book, he would bring it

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.120
to Vigía, and then they
would make two hundred copies

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.540
of the book, and that was the
way they produced the books.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.000
And what's interesting is they
gave attention to Cuban writers

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.900
on the island, and you saw some
of the books in the display,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.530
like Dulce María Loynaz, Nancy
Morejón, Fina García Marruz,

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.360
Miguel Barnet, all very
important Cuban writers,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.880
and always honoring José Martí,
the great independence leader

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.270
and poet of Cuba, but there was
also a commitment to give space

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.570
to international authors, such
as Borges or García Lorca,

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:51.060
as you saw in the exhibit,
Borís Pasternak as well,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.320
while celebrating the work
of great American writers,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.350
such as Emily Dickinson.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.850
Y voy a hablar un
poquito del Dickinson.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.500
So, I think all of you've got

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.050
to see the Emily Dickinson
book here in the display,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:12.990
and it's just a totally
exquisite book from 1998,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.600
and I think this is one of the
most spectacular handmade books

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.180
that I have seen,
and Estévez read

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.200
up on Emily Dickinson,
her biography.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.700
He knew that she was
very agoraphobic,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.510
and so he built a house for
her, for this reclusive poet,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.520
and put the poems
inside that house.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.290
At the time, Estévez had not
yet visited Dickenson's house

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.330
in Amherst, which
is now a museum,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.750
but eventually he did get
to go there and he learned

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.150
that the house that
he had imagined

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.300
in his dreams had turned
out to be very much

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.110
like the one she had
inhabited in real life.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.530
And so, the books
that he designed

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.060
for Ediciones Vigía are now
collected all over the world.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.040
We have this wonderful
collection here in the Library

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.370
of Congress, there are also
books in MoMA, there are books

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.040
in the British Library and
I want to brag for a moment

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.040
and say there are books in
many university libraries,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.880
including the University
of Michigan,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.910
and we have a very large
collection of his books

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.460
in our Special Collections
Division, because the University

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.680
of Michigan was the
first American university

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.690
that Estévez visited,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.050
when I invited him
back in the late 90s.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:41.710
And, so, we began to celebrate
and to conserve these books.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:47.270
So, between 1985 and 2013,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:52.290
Estévez was the artistic
director of Ediciones Vigía,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.100
and during that time he produced

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.060
over 500 gorgeous
handmade books.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.120
And it's a major contribution
to Cuban art and letters.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.470
We had an interdisciplinary
conference back in 2012,

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.610
called Cultural Bricolage,

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.060
organized by professor
Juanamaría Cordones-Cook,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.620
and there was so much
interest in this conference

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.790
that we decided to produce an
anthology about Estévez's work

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.260
for Vigía and his
work as a book artist,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.960
and I'm one of the coeditors of
this book which will be coming

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.220
out next year and
it will be called

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.310
or tentatively called Beautiful
Books in the Age of Technology:

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:42.110
Rolando Estévez and the
Making of Vigía in Cuba.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.130
Today, Estévez will be
sharing his new work,

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.810
and this is taking him in
very, very exciting directions.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:57.410
In 2013, he made the decision
to leave Ediciones Vigía

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.240
and form his own imprint,
and we saw there's a few

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.070
of the new books here.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.720
His new imprint is
called El Fortín.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.010
El Fortín means "the little
fort", and his plan was

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.110
to be able to produce
limited edition books as well

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.170
as one-of-a-kind arts books
and just to have more freedom

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.460
to do his work as a book artist.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.430
An they've already gained
very, very wide recognition,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.570
and with so - Me perdonas
si estoy hablando mucho.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.870
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
No, no, para nada.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.170
Por favor, no.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.470
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And
what's so amazing is

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:40.060
that Estévez is now the first
licensed independent bookmaker

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.360
in Cuba.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.660
All right?

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.960
So, he's able to
produce these books

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.100
as an independent bookmaker

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:52.480
and he will be spearheading the
first ever artist-book pavilion

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.940
at the coming bienal, art bienal

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.720
that will take place
in April of 2018.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.670
And a new generation of Cuban
book artists is now being born

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.210
and they are all looking
to him for inspiration.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.000
So, as you'll see today,
his creative development

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.770
as a bookmaker has really
inspired him to keep pushing

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.290
at the limits of how to make a
book that can be called a work

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.420
of art and also be a
book at the same time.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.430
And as his bookmaking has
developed, he's found new ways

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.700
for words and images to speak

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.840
to each other ever more
exuberantly, becoming, I think,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.160
a modern version

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.130
of the illuminated
medieval manuscripts.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.220
And I think in our
era of virtual books,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.740
Estévez's work gives us all
the possibility of experiencing

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.610
that tactile sensuality of
interacting with books in ways

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.020
that restore to us the
wonder of the text.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.240
So, to end these remarks, I
just want to say something

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.830
about my friendship
with Estévez.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.960
We met back in 1994, que
nos conocimos en el '94,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.950
so 24 years ago, we met
at the Habana book fair,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.770
and Estévez had stepped
outside to smoke a cigarette

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.400
and to take a break from working
at the Ediciones Vigía stand

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.700
at the Habana book fair.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.080
He was selling these postales

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.270
that were essentially these
beautiful hand-painted drawings

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.500
that incorporated lines of
poetry from Dulce María Loynaz.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.070
At the time, I didn't know
who Dulce María Loynaz was.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:45.210
She then became a huge influence
on my life, and he said to me,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.180
"Don't tell me you've
never heard of Dulce María.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.710
She's one of Cuba's
most important poets."

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.940
And I said that I
hadn't heard of her.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.370
And I realized how
much I had yet to learn

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:02.320
from Rolando Estévez about Cuban
literature, culture and history.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.260
And we struck up a
conversation back then in 1994.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.690
He was watching me intently
and I ended up telling him

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:15.020
that I was this cubana who was
returning to the island looking

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.260
for my roots, I was
speaking to him of my need

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.110
to return even though my parents
didn't want me to travel to Cuba

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.500
and in fact they've
never been back,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.310
and he nodded very
sympathetically and then he said

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.690
that I reminded him
of his younger sister.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.230
She was an eight-year-old
girl when she left Cuba

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.320
with their parents in 1969.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.800
He had not seen her
in all that time.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.170
He'd not been able to leave
because he was 15 and considered

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.310
of military age by Cuban law.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.300
So, he knew in his own flesh how
immigration could cut both ways,

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.480
producing grief for
those leaving as well

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.080
as for those waving goodbye.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.790
And after our conversation,
Estévez said

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.540
that I should go
inside and have a look

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.610
at the Ediciones Vigía books,
and I said to him, "But,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.910
how will I find them?"

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.530
And he said, "Oh,
you'll find them.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.830
You won't be able to miss them."

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.150
And he lit up another
cigarette and I went inside,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.290
and I walk through this
dark hall, seeing just a lot

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.930
of gloomy-looking books printed
by the government presses,

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.560
and I said, "Where do I
find Ediciones Vigía?"

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.340
And then I saw this tall
palm tree and it was made

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.030
of the brown butcher
paper, very tall palm tree,

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.960
the tree of course had been
designed and built by Estévez.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.460
And he was right,
it was impossible

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.690
to miss these beautiful books.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.050
They were all fashioned
from simple brown paper,

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.680
were handmade, hand-colored,
hand-printed, hand-bound,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.390
and I didn't know what to
make of these creations,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.600
but I fell in love
with them immediately.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.210
And so began my Cuban love
affair with the artist

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.110
of the book and especially with
the art of Estévez's books.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.900
So honored and so thrilled
to be here, and with that,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.200
I don't know if I'll move

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.250
to Catalina Gómez o move
toward our conversation

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.550
with Rolando Estévez.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.980
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: I think
it should be Rolando Estévez.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.280
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Thank
you so much.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.080
[risa]

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.040
[ Aplausos ]

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.340
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: I
think you should --

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.640
I should be at the end.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.980
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: You
should be at the end.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.280
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: I think, yes.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.580
&gt;&gt; Ruth Gómez: Okay.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.880
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez:
[ininteligible] the stars.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.180
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, we'll
start with -- we're going --

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.480
we have several books
that we want to show you,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.770
and discuss with you, and
I will be both interacting

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.070
and translating as
well from Spanish.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.370
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
¿Quieres comentar alguno -- ?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.840
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Eh,
no, vamos a empezar.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.110
Yo creo que yay o he
hablado demasiado.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.410
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ya.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.710
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí, sí.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.010
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Voy a empezar.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.180
Bueno, quiero empezar mostrando,
darle las gracias a Ruth por --

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.660
y a la Biblioteca del
Congreso, sobre todo,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.970
por esta oportunidad y por
cuánto me emociona ver esos

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.680
libros de Vigía y El Fortín
ahí, en esta exposición.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.490
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he wants to
say thank you so much to all

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.200
of us for being here,
the two of us,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.490
and how incredibly moved
he is to see the books here

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.720
at the Library of Congress,
and so beautifully conserved.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.480
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Quiero decir
primero que El Fortín es mi

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.810
continuación como artista
en el mundo del libro.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.720
Empecé, fundé Vigía junto a
Alfredo Zaldívar en el '85.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.880
Estuve 28 años y
más en ese lugar.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.500
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, El Fortín
is a continuation of the work

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.190
that he began at
Ediciones Vigía.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.070
He worked with Zaldívar,
the cofounder, for 28 years

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.460
and now is continuing
the work with El Fortín.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.160
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El
Fortín es mi propio Proyecto.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.920
Ya en Cuba puede haber un
proyecto privado de libros.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.590
Fui el primero, ya lo dijiste.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.890
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.190
So, El Fortín, again,

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.780
is the first independent
bookmaking project.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.080
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.980
Y este Fortín me da la
posibilidad de continuar mi

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.370
trabajo como diseñador
de libros,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.930
añandiendo ahora el
trabajo de los libros arte,

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.470
los ejemplares únicos.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.360
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, El Fortín
allows him to keep doing books

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.010
in small series while at
the same time being able

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.810
to make one-of-a-kind
unique artists' books.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.110
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:17.360
Quiero empezar mostrándoles este
libro que es un poster de Alejo

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.270
Galván, un poeta de la ciudad.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.300
Vamos a zafarlo aquí.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.620
Estos libros llevan
una interacción.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.920
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: His books require
quite a lot of interaction.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:34.160
This is a book of poems,
three poems by Alejo Galván,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.490
a poet from Matanzas, and it's
called La Tarde, The Afternoon.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.960
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Se me hizo
un nudito aquí, momentico.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.260
Ya.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.560
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ya está.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.330
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este poster
contiene tres poemas de Alejo

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.800
Galván, poemas dedicados a
la ciudad de los puentes y

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.100
los ríos.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.480
Aquí están las imágenes
de la ciudad.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.550
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, these
are three poems that are all

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.030
about the city of Matanzas,
and Matanzas is a city

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.360
of three rivers, and the
ocean, and many bridges,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.590
and so he captures
that in the artwork.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.350
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: En la cabeza
de esta mujer que es como la

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.650
ciudad, el lighthouse.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.340
Me encanta la palabra en inglés.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.550
El faro, que es el símbolo
de Ediciones El Fortín.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.910
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, the
lighthouse is the symbol

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.700
of El Fortín, of his
imprint El Fortín.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.890
And he mentioned that
there's a lighthouse coming

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.980
out of the head of the woman,

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.940
and he loves that
word in English.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.440
So, he tends to say
"lighthouse" rather than "faro",

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.880
which is the word in Spanish.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.180
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Por la parte de atrás,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.560
las informaciones sobre
la cantidad de ejemplares,

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.300
sobre el poeta, en fin.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he includes
information about the poet,

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.200
the number of copies
that were made.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.270
So, all of that information is
always included in each book.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.570
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Pequeñas notas,

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:59.520
pequeñas sorpresas que
siempre tienen estos libros.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.340
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Notes and
surprises, as he said,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.030
the books always
contain surprises.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.330
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
En este caso,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.960
una nota sobre el
poeta, sobre el autor.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.950
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, there's a
note there about the author.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.060
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.390
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Entonces,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.990
ese es un libro que es un
libro como poster, tú decías.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.290
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Como poster, sí.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.590
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Como poster.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:24.890
So, it's like a book-poster.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.690
Y la idea de poder también,
o sea, tenerlo en la pared,

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.990
como arte, como obre de arte.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.600
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Sí, están
hechos exactamente para eso,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.240
para poder leerlos, interactuar
con ellos o tenerlos en una

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.910
pared, como se pone un
cuadro, como se pone un cartel.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ahá.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.070
So, the idea of being able to
interact with the book, read it,

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.410
but you can also hang
it up and enjoy it

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.500
as a work of art as well.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.800
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: ¿Seguimos?

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.100
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Seguimos, eh --

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.400
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Eliseo.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.700
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Eliseo.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.730
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este es un
poeta que no vive en la ciudad

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.320
de Matanzas.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.040
Eh, este es un poeta que vive en
una pequeña ciudad del sur de la

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.770
provincial que se
llama Jovellanos,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.400
un pueblo donde hay mucha
cultura negra, afrocubana,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.770
un asentamiento muy grande de
esclavos hubo en ese lugar.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.070
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Déjame traducir.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.370
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Sí.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this poet,
Eliseo Abreu Hernández is

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.470
from the province of Matanzas,
from the town of Jovellanos,

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.660
where there was and
continues to be a very,

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.150
very important Afro-Cuban
presence, culture and religious

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.110
and spiritual presence, and
that's where this poet is from.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.810
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este hombre
ganó el concurso Digdora Alonso,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.480
que es un concurso de poesía
que tiene Ediciones El Fortín.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.790
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
he has a competition,

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:42.810
a poetry competition each year
at El Fortín and this poet won,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.020
and therefore his book was
published in El Fortín.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es un
libro también bilingüe.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.180
Casi todos los libros del
Fortín son o bilingües o

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.730
trilingües, porque es una
manera en que más personas

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.120
pueden llegar a leer el libro.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.450
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this book
is bilingual, and he tries

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.740
to have his El Fortín
books bilingual

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.350
and sometimes even trilingual,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.070
so that more people can
have access to these texts.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.630
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: La bolsa es
como una pequeña mochila que se

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.220
pudiera llevar aquí al hombre.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.270
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: [Risa] Probably
doesn't need translation,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.670
but the idea that it's
almost a little knapsack

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.290
and you can carry it with you.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.590
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Este es un poeta fuerte,

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.150
enérgico, con poemas muy --

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.710
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This is a
very, very strong poet.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.230
Y este poeta está enfermo, ¿no?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.320
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Está
enfermo, enfermo de cáncer.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.620
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He's
suffering from --

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.750
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y toda
su poesía está llena de esa

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.890
imploración que hace a la vida
por que le siga dando salud y es

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.020
una poesía que también
habla del dolor físico y del

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.320
dolor espiritual.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.850
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he is a poet
who is suffering from cancer.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.210
So, his poems have a lot to
do with physical suffering,

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:46.160
searching for healing, those
are themes in his work.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.460
Seguimos.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.380
La zafra.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.680
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: La Zafra.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.980
Este es un libro que
me gusta especialmente.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.600
Es un libro, La Zafra
de Agustín Acosta.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.670
Agustín Acosta fue poeta
nacional en Cuba antes que

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.460
Nicolás Guillén.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.280
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this is
a book by Agustín Acosta.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.700
This is a poet who lived
outside of Cuba, in Miami,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.230
but before he left
Cuba, he was Cuba --

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:16.400
he was declared Cuba's National
Poet, before Nicolás Guillén.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.300
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Pero hay
algo que es bien interesante.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.620
Se fue de Cuba y perdió su
condición de poeta nacional y se

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.160
nombró a otro poeta nacional
en Cuba, estando vivo Agustín,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.460
que fue Nicolás Guillén.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.760
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Right.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.560
So, he was Cuba's Nactional
Poet, but after he left Cuba,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.110
he was no longer Cuba's
National Poet, and that was

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.310
when Nicolás Guillén was named.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.610
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.210
En los oscuros tiempos de los
'70 y las parametraciones,

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.970
este fue un poeta
prohibido en Cuba,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.450
un poeta que había
abandonado el país.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.010
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is a poet that in the 70s,

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.680
which is a very dark period in
Cuban history, it was impossible

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.560
to read this poet's work.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.970
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Escribió en
la década del 30 su gran libro,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.130
La Zafra, y esta es
tapa la que contiene.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.120
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This is one
of his great books, La Zafra.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.480
Is the sugar cane harvest.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.600
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Algunos
de los poemas de ese libro

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.900
La Zafra.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.800
Está realizada la cubierta
en caña de azúcar, prensada.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:15.440
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So the cover
has pressed sugar cane.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.740
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Fibras naturales.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.040
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Natural fibers.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.770
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Para dar
toda la atmósfera del campo.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And this
is a selection of poems

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.000
from this book La Zafra,
The Sugar Cane Harvest.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.780
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y aquí
están los dibujos de la portada,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.380
de la portadilla, está
muy lleno de dibujos.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, it has a lot
of images, a lot of drawings.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.350
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Cada poema
está precedido de un dibujo,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.520
especialmente hecho para él.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, each poem is
accompanied by an illustration.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.820
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Hasta
llegar así al final del libro.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.110
Y otra cosa interesante
es que la bolsa,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:34:02.210
esta bolsa está hecha con los
sacos que se usan en Cuba para

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.400
exportar, para comercializar
el azúcar.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.090
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he used

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.240
for this book an actual
bag that's used --

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.460
these are the actual bags or
sacks that are used in Cuba

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.250
to transport sugar, so --

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.850
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es una cosa
que he tenido siempre presente

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.780
en estos libros y
también en los únicos,

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.480
es que el material se tiene
que convertir en un contenido

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.780
del libro.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.160
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this has
always been very much the case

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.220
in his books, that the
container of the book has

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.330
to be part of the book as well.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.630
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Mm-hm.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.930
¿Seguimos?

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:39.230
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Seguimos.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.680
Una flor debajo de la bota.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.080
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este
es un pequeño libro mío,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.010
una pequeña plaquette, un libro
con un poema llamado Una flor

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.800
debajo de la bota.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.760
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this is
a plaquette, a small book

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.370
with a poem that
Estévez himself wrote,

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.880
A Flower Beneath the Boot.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.940
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es un
poema en contra de la Guerra,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.240
por supuesto.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.540
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: It's
an antiwar poem.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.410
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Que habla de
las botas militares que aplastan

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.710
los campos.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.670
&gt;&gt; Ruth Estévez: That
talks about military boots

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.610
that squash the fields
and flower fields.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.840
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Una sillita
que es como la espera de cuándo

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.830
van a pasar estos
tiempos de guerra.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.000
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This is a
chair indicating waiting

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.640
when these times of war
are going to pass and end.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.370
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí
hay una nota sobre el poeta.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.890
Aquí está.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.500
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: A little
note about the author

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.350
of the poem, there's the poem.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.010
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Un poema en español.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.550
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The
poem in Spanish.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.850
Y está en inglés.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.150
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Y está en inglés.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.450
Y está por detrás --

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.900
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And then
behind it is the English --

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.200
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
El poema en inglés.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.500
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The
English translation.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.820
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Estas son
impresiones directas de una bota

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.630
military sobre el
papel floreado.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.320
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he
used an actual footprint

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.620
or imprint of a boot here.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.920
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.220
Hecho directamente con
la bota de un hombre,

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.520
una impression directa.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.820
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Made
directly with a man's boot.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.120
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y
por detrás hay retazos de

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.420
uniformes militares.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.720
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And it's
got bits and pieces

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.020
of military uniforms here.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.550
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Okay.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.680
Este es el símbolo de
ediciones El Fortín,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.290
es un cuño que tengo para estos
libros y siempre está en esta

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:24.250
página el cuño, el número
del ejemplar y la firma.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.990
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this is
a special stamp that it has,

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.120
again, symbolizing
the lighthouse,

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.600
is the symbol of El Fortín.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.900
¿Seguimos?

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.200
Bolero [initeligible].

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.500
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ah, Bueno.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.960
Este es un libro muy especial
para mí, es de un gran amigo.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.460
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This is a
special book, this is of --

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.850
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Gran
músico, Lázaro Horta.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.780
&gt;&gt; Ruth Baher: A friend of his,
Lázaro Horta, who is a musician.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.520
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Vive en
Miami hace más de 20 años.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.340
&gt;&gt; Ruth Baher: He's been living
in Miami for more than 20 years.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.640
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.760
Ha ido constantemente a Matanzas
a cantar y pasó una cosa

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.060
muy curiosa.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.310
Este año, al principio, fue y,

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.720
como no llevaba una
visa cultural,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.810
no lo permitieron
cantar en Matanzas.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.350
&gt;&gt; Ruth Baher: Ahá, wow.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.390
So, he goes back, he's from
Matanzas as well, Lázaro Horta,

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.510
his friend, and he goes back
all the time to, you know,

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.030
to visit, to be there.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.640
But this past year,
he went to Matanzas

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.450
and he didn't have
a cultural visa

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.490
and they didn't let him
sing in his hometown.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.310
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este
libro tiene cinco canciones de

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.610
Lázaro Horta.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.010
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
book has five songs.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.950
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: La herradura
viene por el último poema,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.650
la última canción que se llama
"¿Dónde están los caballos?"

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.370
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And this
symbol here is for a poem,

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.790
one of the last poems, which
is about where are the horses.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.800
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El
dibujo que se desplaza,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.660
completamente todo
iluminado a mano.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.570
Ahí no hay color
impreso en ninguno.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Baher: So that
lovely illustration.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.710
Enséñalo otra vez.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:50.360
That lovely illustration is
all hand-done and hand-painted.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.030
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Esta piedra
es recogida en el barrio de

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:57.440
Pueblo Nuevo, el barrio donde
nació y creció Lázaro Horta.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.780
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
there's a stone there

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.510
from the neighborhood
of Pueblo Nuevo,

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.540
which is where Lázaro
Horta is from.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y todos
estos detalles se aclaran.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.700
Siempre, en cada libro de El
Fortín, en el machón o colofón.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.050
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, all of
these details about the book

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:14.350
and how it was [ininteligible].

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.650
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.950
Ahí se aclara todos esos
detalles de la Piedra,

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.250
la cantidad de ejemplares,

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.030
que la iluminación es
completamente manual, en fin.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.630
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: All the
information, things like the use

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.890
of the stone, the way that
things were colored in,

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.900
all of that information is
at the end of the books.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.590
So, the story of the book
is included with the book.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.890
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Distintos papeles,

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.610
distintos tipos de
letra, el piano presente,

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.220
que es el instrument que
lo acompaña en la música.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.520
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Different kinds
of paper, different kinds

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.180
of print, images, and then the
piano is there as a symbol,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.320
since that is Lázaro's
instrument.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.180
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Muchos
dibujos, la nota introductoria,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.930
un bolero sin fin,
una ilustración,

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.030
un dibujo para cada
una de las canciones.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.110
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, an
illustration for each song,

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.120
and "Bolero sin fin"
means "endless bolero",

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.420
a bolero that doesn't end.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.930
Boleros are the beautiful love
songs that come [ininteligible].

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.750
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Cada una de
las canciones tiene también la

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:14.610
música manuscrita por el
músico, por Lázaro Horta,

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.710
y que después yo reproduje,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.240
pero están manuscritas y
firmadas por el músico.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.080
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He also
included these manuscript copies

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.920
of the actual musical
notations of Lázaro.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.220
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Así,

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.880
cada cancion tiene un dibujo que
está lleno de la atmósfera de

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.340
cada cancion, igual su música.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.210
Y así, las cinco canciones.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.640
Este es el marcador,
marca el libro.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, the
five -- ¿Te ayudo?

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.500
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Sí, ábrelo.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.100
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The
five songs and then --

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.420
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Este piano con alas.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.840
Este piano con alas
que está aquí.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.140
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ahá.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.040
The piano with wings.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
¿Dónde están los caballos?

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.320
La cancion que cierra
el libro, con su dibujo.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.090
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The closing
song is Where are the Horses?

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.760
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y también
la música y después, bueno,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.540
las informaciones que dan el
machón, el índice y todo esos --

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.170
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And all the
information at the end, again,

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.970
about the book and how is made
and the elements that were used.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Okay.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.200
Seguimos.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.500
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Seguimos.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.580
Okay. Los cinco poemas del mar.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.930
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Cinco
poemas del mar y de la soledad.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.490
A ver cómo pongo
esto para que --

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.790
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: ¿Te ayudo?

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.680
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ya.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.330
Cinco poemas del mar y de
la Soledad es otro de los

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.970
acercamientos que ha hecho
Ediciones El Fortín --

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.480
A la obra de Ruth Behar y a la
Amistad que nos une en el arte,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.060
sobre todo, es una amistad que
tiene mucha entraña artística,

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.660
mucha entraña literaria
y plástica.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.960
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ay, gracias.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.500
So, this book is a
collaboration between us, again,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:14.150
part of our long friendship and
interconnection of our lives

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.110
and artistic work as well.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.410
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
También tiene una bosa.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.560
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: It also
comes with a special bag.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.260
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El libro
se llama Poemas del mar y de

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.560
la Soledad.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.230
Tiene esta imagen de
la Virgen de Regla.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.920
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
it's called Five Poems

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.420
About the Sea and Solitude.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.660
It has an image of
the Virgin of Regla.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.960
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.670
Que sincretiza nuestras
religiones con Yemayá,

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:40.010
que es la dueña del
mar, la orisha del mar.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.220
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Which, the Virgin
of Regla syncretize with Yemayá,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.050
who is de deity of the
ocean, of the sea, very,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.040
very important in Cuba.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.600
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Tiene siete conchas.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.720
El siete es el número de Yemayá.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.020
El siete.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.320
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And she
has seven seashells,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.800
because this is her number.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.890
This is Yemaya's number.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.430
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Cualquier
papel hermoso sirve para

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:05.050
trabajar en esta editorial.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:08.310
Esto es unas servilletas
que encontré en una parte,

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:13.310
en un lugar del mundo y
me parecieron perfectas.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.470
Se las pedí a la dueña, fui a
comer a una casa, y le dije:

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:17.910
"¿Tienes más servilletas
de esas?"

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.460
Me dijo: "Tengo una caja llena."

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.690
"Si me las da, me las llevo".

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.990
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, all paper
is beautiful for him to use

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.480
in his books and this particular
one, this paper that he loves

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.650
so much, he ate at
somebody's house and she,

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.750
this woman had these
beautiful napkins.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.050
He said, "Do you have any more?"

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.250
And she said, "Yes,
I have a whole box."

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.820
[risa] And they ended
up in this book.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.120
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.590
Hay un lenguaje del papel
en estos libros, ¿no?

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:44.160
El papel es el elemento por
antonomasia distintivo de

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.460
un libro.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.230
Pero hay en estos libros
un elogio del papel,

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:57.190
una manera de hablar a través
de los papeles distintos,

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:05.430
de los distintos papeles,
las distintas texturas.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:14.940
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, his
books have so much to do

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.650
with the language
of paper, with paper

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.760
and all its different textures

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.630
and in many ways the books are a
kind of praise for paper, right?

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.200
By definition, books
are made of paper.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.760
Here, there's a kind
of reflection

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.210
and practice of the paper, so --

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.510
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Papeles distintos,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.810
aquí hay tres papeles distintos.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.180
Están conversando
entre los tres.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.850
Un papel albal, un papel
crepé, un papel blanco.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.470
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Different
papers kind of interacting

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.620
with each other, crepe
paper and other kinds

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.920
of paper coming together.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.220
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Como siempre,

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.200
los dibujos están muy también
aportando elementos de contenido

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.500
a estos libros.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.800
Esta espada que tiene
el nombre de Behar.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.100
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Also, of course,
the images are very important

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.400
in interacting with the text,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.700
and this is a sword,
it has my name on it.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.000
He also added my second
last name, which you know

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.300
in Latin America
we use the patronym

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.600
and the matronym so much here.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.900
So, in Cuba, I acquired
my other last name.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.200
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.500
[Ininteligible] Este es un
libro bilingüe también,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.800
están los cinco poemas en su
edición inglesa y en su versión

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.100
en castellano.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.400
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, the five
poems, in English and Spanish.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.700
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Índice, machón.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.770
Y aquí, entonces, el
número del ejemplar,

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.340
algo que es también muy bonito.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.080
Estos libros no pasan
de los 50 ejemplares.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.270
Están entre los 35, los 40,

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.560
los 50 ejemplares,
según sea el caso.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.920
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
each book is numbered.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.650
This happened to be number 12.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.960
And he makes these
small editions,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.620
sometimes, 35, 50 at most.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.290
So, these are small
edition books.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.600
Eh, ahora este.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Ah, los judíos.

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Los judíos.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.610
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ya.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:54.750
Esta es una pequeña antología de
poesía judía, eh, que realizó,

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.870
es decir, al trabajo de
antologación lo hizo Ruth Behar.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.060
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is a collection of poets,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:05.190
by Jewish-Cuban poets, something
that had never been done before,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.350
that I put together and
it's called, in English,

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.060
it's I'm Loving you
from my Roots,

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.500
is the name of the collection.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.470
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Después de
leerme la antología y un poco a

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:21.860
partir del conocimiento que
había tenido de la poesía

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:28.490
escrita por judíos en el mundo,
pues, entonces aquí salió --

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.540
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, after
reading these poems

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.880
and reading other
poems by Jewish poets,

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.200
Estévez himself wrote
a poem called --

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.220
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Un poema
que escribí a los poetas judíos.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.400
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sort of his
response to these poems

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.700
that he wrote, called --

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.040
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Estos libros
también me están sirviendo ahora

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.550
en El Fortín para implicarme
más como escritor y como poeta

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.700
dentro de la dinámica
de los libros.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.320
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this is
helping him to really be --

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.670
to involve himself in
the dynamic of bookmaking

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.260
and of writing as well.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.640
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Vamos
a abrir el libro ahora.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.940
Zafando allí la rafia.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.480
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
has some rafia fiber

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.920
to open and close the book.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.790
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
El yute, la rafia,

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.610
el papel de corcho, aserrín.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.150
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Different
kinds of paper,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.060
cork and other forms of paper.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.960
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Cualquier
material es bueno para lograr

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.250
una imagen interesante en estos
libros, una textura interesante.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.640
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, any
kind of papers is good

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.420
to create exciting
texture in these books.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.370
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Aquí está esta menora.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.240
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Here there's
an image of the menorah.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.920
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.640
Con distintos argumentos
conceptuales,

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.700
que tienen que ver
con el mundo judío.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: With different
concepts of Jewish thinking.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:54.030
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El tipo de
letra es otra cosa que en estos

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.960
libros también tiene -- yo creo
que cada libro requiere de su

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.710
propia letra, su
propia tipografía.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.170
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, each book
requires its own unique form

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.230
of lettering, of font,
and so he also works

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.440
on that very carefully.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.910
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Aquí está el prólogo.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The prologue.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.470
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y un
poco pensando en los judíos

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:17.790
fundamentalistas, se me ocurrió
la idea que el fondo del los

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.400
textos fuera negro.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.700
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
he also decided

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:27.360
to use a black foundation for
this book, thinking of kind of,

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.570
you know, orthodox people.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.200
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ahí
están los cuatro poetas.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.500
Son cuatro, ¿verdad?

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.800
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Son cuatro.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.100
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Cuatro poetas.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.400
Están en español,
están en inglés.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.800
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
four poets in Spanish

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.480
and English are included
in this book.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.360
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí está
el dibujo que divide la parte

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.960
española de la parte -- la
parte en español de la parte

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.260
en inglés.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.560
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: That
illustration divides the book

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.860
between English and Spanish.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.160
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Aquí, el otro.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.090
Ahí termina, aquí empieza.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:02.300
Y al final, bueno, el índice
y todas las informaciones que

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.600
llevan estos libros.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.030
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The index and all
the information about the book

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.100
and how is made and
the materials

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.390
that were used to make the book.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.690
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Después ordenamos.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:12.990
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí,
sí, sí, sí, sí.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.290
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Vamos, así.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.770
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Vamos
a seguir con Frida.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:20.070
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Frida.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.750
Aquí está mi poema
a Frida Kahlo.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.300
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is a poem that he wrote

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.020
and dedicated to Frida Kahlo.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.300
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Se llama
"Con duro polvo de óleo".

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And it's
called "With Tough Oil Paint"

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.770
or Duro polvo de óleo.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.070
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: Golden dust?

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:38.370
No?

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.670
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Is
it golden dust?

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.970
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez:
¿Polvo de oro?

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:42.270
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Polvo de óleo.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.570
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Óleo, óleo.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:44.870
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez:
Óleo, sorry.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.170
That's right.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.470
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Yeh, yeah.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.770
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: Oil.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:50.070
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Oil.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.370
So, Tough Oil Paint or
something like that.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.670
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Sobre el dibujo,

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.970
toda la iluminación de esa
cabeza fue hecha a mano,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.270
los 50 ejemplares, uno a uno.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.570
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, with
this book, all 50 copies,

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.870
these were all hand-illustrated.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.170
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.500
La realización del
arete en forma de luna.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.880
Un pincel, dos pinceles o tres
pinceles, según sea el caso.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.180
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: We were
discussing this before

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.540
with cataloging, that at the
book fairy sometimes there's one

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.060
paintbrush, sometimes
two, and sometimes three.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.600
So they're all a little
different from each other.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Título.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The title.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.500
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Autor.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.070
El texto.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.270
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The text,
which is a beautiful poem

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:35.870
that he wrote and
dedicated to Frida Kahlo.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.170
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Está largo.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.830
Aquí el machón, con su sorpresa.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:46.340
Estos libros siempre están
convocándonos a la sorpresa.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.330
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And then,
there's a surprise.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:51.970
It's like the machon, the
information about the book.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:59.390
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y creo que
es una de las cosas que hace que

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:03.240
interactuemos con el libro,
es que lo podamos tocar,

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.360
podamos desplegar los
papeles que tiene,

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.720
podamos abrir este tipo
de informaciones también.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, one of
the things that allows us

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.530
to interact with the book is the
way they are, these folded parts

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.910
of the book, and we can interact
with it and surprise ourselves

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:22.000
as we open and look
through the book.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.300
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y detrás,

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:28.020
el símbolo de El Fortín sobre
los ojos de Frida Kahlo.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.630
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The symbol
of El Fortín at the back

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.010
over Frida Kahlo's eyes.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.310
Eh, Edith.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.610
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Edith.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:42.920
Esta es una -- la tercera
edición ya de este poema.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.830
Es la primera vez que tiene
una edición de un libro

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.650
completamente hecho a mano.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.360
La figura de Edith Piaf
está aquí, en la foto,

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.670
pegada sobre una concha marina
transparente, muy clarita.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.750
Es una concha, es bueno tocarla.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.290
Estos libros, yo sé que
no los dejan tocar mucho,

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.420
pero son muy buenos para tocar,
porque hay distintas texturas,

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:06.290
y aquí está el yute, aquí, la
concha marina, aquí, el algodón.

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:08.550
Se me olvida que tú
tienes que traducir.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:09.850
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: No, no, sí.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:11.320
So, this is a book
dedicated to Edith Piaf.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.650
Again, it's a poem that Estévez
wrote and it's the third time

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:20.060
or third edition of this poem,
and it has a seashell there

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.850
on the cover with
her image over it,

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.990
and he says that
it's really nice

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.080
to touch it even though he
knows that we are not encouraged

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.390
to touch the books that much
at the Library of Congress,

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:32.520
but it feels very nice
to touch this cover.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.820
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí está.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.080
Es como una carpeta.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.100
Solo está agarrado
por este cordel.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.710
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is kind of like, like a --

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.550
almost like a portfolio
just held together with a -

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:53.030
with this bit of wool
or string in the center.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.610
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este es
un libro español-francés,

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.910
bilingüe.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This one is
Spanish-French bilingual.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.500
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.940
Para homenajear a Edith
Piaf también con su idioma.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.460
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: To
honor Edith Piaf --

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.760
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Con su lengua madre.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.090
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: With
her mother tongue.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:12.970
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y
entonces, aquí, está el poema.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.490
En español.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:19.220
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Here's
the poem in Spanish.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.520
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Y también en francés.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.040
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And in French.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.220
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: So, wow.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.520
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ahora sí,

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.480
tenemos que doblarlo
para poder plegarlo.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.020
Para poder seguir
hay que doblarlo.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.130
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: [Risa] This book
has some complicated engineering

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:37.970
too, as you see, getting
them to fold properly.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.160
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Yo creo que
es una manera distinta de mirar

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.720
al libro y vengo haciendo
esto hace más de 30 años ya.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.780
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: It's another way
to look at the book or think

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.290
about books and he's been
doing this for over 30 years.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.240
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Me da gusto
poder cada vez experimentar con

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.140
algo distinto, darle a
cada libro su carácter,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.160
darle a cada libro su discurso.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.130
Eso me da un reto, es un reto
para mí como artista tratar de

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.970
encontrar qué llevará
este libro, qué material,

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:10.910
qué dibujo, qué letra.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.770
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he really
takes joy in being able

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.850
to make these books and it's
a wonderful artistic challenge

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.550
each book, to figure out what
is this book going to need,

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.320
what kind of paper,
design, lettering

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.460
and to reconstruct
new books every time,

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.790
construct new books every time.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.760
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Entonces, aquí al final,

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.840
donde uno parece que
no va a ver nada más --

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.780
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And here, when
you think there's nothing more

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.860
to discover, then you
come and now look at this.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.430
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí están
estos ángeles para Edith Piaf.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.720
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: These are
angels for Edith Piaf.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.220
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Delante de la Torre Eiffel.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.800
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And in
front of the Eiffel Tower.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.630
Yeah, ahá.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.470
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y al fondo,

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.610
el faro de El Fortín
convertido en la Torre Eiffel,

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:05.250
la Torre Eiffel convertida
en el faro de El Fortín.

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.320
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And the
back cover, the lighthouse

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.460
of El Fortín transformed
into the Eiffel Tower.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.620
Las damas cubanas.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.920
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Yeah.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.220
Un momentico.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.520
Un traguito de agua.

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:24.610
Las damas cubanas es la primer
aantología que hizo Ediciones

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:25.930
El Fortín.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.030
En este caso, hay
33 poetas cubanas.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.750
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is the first anthology

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:35.550
that El Fortín produced
of 33 Cuban women poets.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.650
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Comenzamos
con Gertrudis Gómez de

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:47.710
Avellaneda y terminamos con una
mujer que ahora tiene 50 años,

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.580
que es Damaris Calderón.

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:56.750
No quisimos meternos en el mundo
de las nuevas y las novísimas,

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:58.580
sino llegar a ese
rango nada más.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.620
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
it's a book that begins

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.310
with Gertrudis Gómez
de Avellaneda, a very,

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:08.660
very important poet of
the colonial period,

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:16.890
and ends with a poet who's now
50 years old, Damaris Calderón.

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.990
Que ella vive en Chile, ¿no?

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.680
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: En
Chile vive, en Chile.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.980
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.280
In Chile, lives in Chile.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.110
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El juego
con la máscara es a partir de un

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:35.330
eslógan que tiene la antología
que dice que la poesía es una

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:43.620
máscara que el corazón se
pone para convertir el dolor

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.920
en belleza.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.220
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, the use

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.460
of the mask is a very
important symbol in this book.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.220
It comes from a line
that he quotes

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.600
at the very, very
end of the book.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.010
¿Podría ver la frase otra vez?

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.310
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Sí.

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:01.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The poetry --

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:02.910
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Está al final.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:04.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Poetry
is a mask --

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:05.510
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Espera.

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:06.810
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ahí está.

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:08.110
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí.

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ahá.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:10.710
The poetry is a mask that
the heart wears in order

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.010
to transform pain into beauty.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:13.310
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: ¿Ya?

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Mm-hm.

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.910
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Entonces,

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.210
están estas mascaras
en cerámica,

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:18.510
completamente hechas
especialmente para este

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:19.810
libro también.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.110
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
these ceramic masks

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.410
that were made specifically
for this book.

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.710
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Estos fondos
son retazos de unas sobrecamas

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:25.010
que me encontré en venta
muy baratas en Matanzas,

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:26.310
y las compramos y las
recortamos, todas las limpiamos.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, the cover was
made from some old bed covers

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.910
that he found in Matanzas
and cut up and transformed

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.210
into this cover, this kind

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:31.510
of plush-looking
cover for the book.

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:32.810
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Esta
es la humedad que lo pega,

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.110
la humedad de Cuba.

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: That's
Cuban humidity [risa].

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.710
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Están
major aquí en las cajas,

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:38.010
que aquí las inventaron,

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:39.310
horizontales, aquí
están perfecto.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.610
Yo, de verdad, realmente respeto
mucho estas colecciones de

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.910
Michigan, de Misuri, de
la Universidad de Miami,

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:43.210
la de la Biblioteca del
Congreso, que es fabulosa.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:49.930
La conocí desde el
evento en Misuri,

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:57.510
que ella expuso el sistema
que encontraron para almacenar

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:58.810
estos libros.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:02.160
Son libros frágiles, son
libros enemigos de la humedad.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.560
Disculpa. I'm sorry,

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.860
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:11.620
he's discussing how these
books are fragile and enemies

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:16.380
of humidity, and [fonética]
Gina Truise, at the conference

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:21.670
that we were at a few years ago,
discussed all the challenges

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.090
of conserving the books.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:27.640
And he's so glad that the books
are being conserved in places

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.770
like the Library of Congress
and various universities,

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:35.690
and that they are, you know,
being maintained so beautifully,

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:38.040
'cause they are very, very
difficult to maintain.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.090
They are produced in Cuba, but
difficult to maintain in Cuba

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:43.420
with all the humidity.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.650
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
South California,

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:48.460
South California también
tiene una buena colección,

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.640
[initeligible] una que se
[ininteligible] en Miami,

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.660
pero ella dio una lección en
Misuri sobre cómo se almacenan

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.960
estos libros, que me
parece aquí perfecto.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.460
Y uno siente una seguridad
muy grande de saber que hay

00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.900
instituciones que los
tienen, porque son frágiles,

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.370
son delicados, tan hechos
con materiales reciclados.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.670
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he is so glad

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:02.970
that books are conserved
so wonderfully here.

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:04.270
He knows these are very
fragile books, they are made --

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:05.570
they are delicate books,
they are made with a lot

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:06.870
of recycled materials.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.170
They are very, very
hard to conserve.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.470
And so, he's so grateful
and so glad she did --

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:10.770
that you shared that
information,

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:12.070
and hopefully we'll
have time afterwards

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.370
to say a little bit
more about that too.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.670
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí
ya empieza la Avellaneda.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
that's the first poem.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.270
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Pasamos
por todas las poetas, las 33.

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.910
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The 33 poets.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.210
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Nancy Morejón.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.960
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Nancy
Morejón is here.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.260
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Sofía Estévez.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.560
Toda una gran cantidad.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.860
Lourdes González.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.160
Muchas poetisas.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.170
Este es su marcalibro, que es
una ramita solamente, como un --

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.470
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So
that's a bookmark,

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.500
just a little twig for this one.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.520
And --

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.820
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí
está entonces el índice.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.420
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: There's
the index.

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.970
Table of contents,
I guess we call it.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Las 33.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.180
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: The 33 poets,
and a lot of research.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.410
When he did this I saw
him, when he was --

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.100
I saw him in Matanzas when
he was working on this book

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.610
and did a lot of
research into the history

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.970
of women's poetic
writing in Cuba.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.130
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Y el final del libro.

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:04.530
¿Ya no nos quedan?

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:05.830
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ya.

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:07.130
Ya estamos.

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:08.430
Ya.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:09.730
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Estamos para los únicos.

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.030
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Estamos
para los únicos.

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:12.330
Sí.

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:13.630
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
¿Cuál empezamos?

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:14.930
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Eh.

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.230
Aquí vamos.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.260
Ponemos a Canción difícil
y ya los dos únicos.

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.170
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ah,
falta Canción difícil.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.470
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.770
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
¿Dónde está?

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.070
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Aquí.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:25.370
[risa]

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:26.670
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este es un
libro de una gran compositora

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:29.790
cubana, Marta Valdés,
una mujer del feelin.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:33.060
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this is a
very important book of the work

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.840
of Marta Valdés, whose is
an amazing singer, composer,

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.290
a very important person
in what was called

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:41.620
"the feelin" movement.

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.100
"Feelin", without
the "g" in Spanish.

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.240
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es una mujer
muy afiliada a la ciudad de

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.490
Matanzas, aunque nació
y vive en la Habana.

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.960
Es muy afiliada a la ciudad de
Matanzas, le ha cantado mucho.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.430
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, she's
a woman from Habana,

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:56.860
but she has spent a
lot of time in Matanzas

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.340
and has performed
frequently in Matanzas,

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.120
so she's very close to the city.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Por eso,

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.960
esta bolsita tiene un poco
de arena del río San Juan.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.440
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This little
bag has a little bit of sand

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.690
from the San Juan river,
which runs through Matanzas.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.440
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y estas
cosas se convierten como en

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.690
resguardos para el
propio libro, ¿no?

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.070
De alguna manera, es eso.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:17.370
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: These things kind

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:18.790
of become talismans
for the book.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.510
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Exacto, talismán, talismán.

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:22.810
Eso es.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.350
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Hay una
coincidencia en la fecha.

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:32.800
Marta Valdés nació el mismo día
que Frida Kahlo, el 6 de julio.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.100
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
it's interesting.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.140
Marta Valdés was
born on the same day

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.510
as Frida Kahlo, July, 6th.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.560
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Pero también
la poeta cubana Carilda Oliver y

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.050
Marta Valdés también nacieron
el mismo día, el 6 de julio.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:47.900
Aquí está con Carilda,
y aquí está con Frida.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.270
Nuestra Marta Valdés.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.750
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Also, the poet
Carilda Oliver Labra was born

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.350
on July, 6th.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:56.040
Same day, so she's there
with each of the two poets.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.600
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Me
gusta indagar también,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.460
me gusta indagar en el autor.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.460
No solamente en su
obra, sino en su vida.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.870
Por eso es que llevo
estos detalles,

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:07.850
porque me gusta indagar
en la vida del autor.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:11.490
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He likes to
explore the life of the author,

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.100
not just the work of the author.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.960
So he tries to bring
those things together.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:23.050
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Todas
las informaciones de portada,

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.350
portadilla.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:28.380
Una nota que le escribe
a las canciones de Marta.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:32.260
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: A note that he
wrote to Marta about her songs.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.560
They are so beautiful.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.150
If you haven't heard her, look
up the songs of Marta Valdés.

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:38.690
They are really just
-- very beautiful.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.310
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este
es un libro trilingüe,

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:41.800
español-francés-inglés.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: It's trilingual,
Spanish, French and English.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.150
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Primero
están las cinco canciones

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.450
en español.

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.160
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: There's
five songs in the book.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Después vienen en inglés.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:00.250
Tiene -- cada sección tiene
este separador amarillo.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:04.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, each section
has this image painted yellow.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.720
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Y, al final, entonces,

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.380
las canciones en francés, las
mismas canciones en francés.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:12.960
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: At the
end, the songs in French.

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:16.350
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Un dibujo largo.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:20.950
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: And now a
beautiful illustration.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y
llegamos aquí al final.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.250
Otra vez, manchón,
guardas y todo lo demás.

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.550
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Bello.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.850
Entonces ya [ininteligible]

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:41.670
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Paralelo
a este trabajo de los libros

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:47.000
seriados, es decir, a estos
libros que son originales

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.750
multiples, paralelo
a este trabajo.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.690
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, parallel
to this work that he does,

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:56.460
which he considers to
be multiple originals,

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.160
so that's what we've been
looking at now, now he's going

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.240
to share these one-of-a-kind
books,

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.020
these unique artist's books.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.730
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: También
desde la década de los '80,

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.910
desde finales de los '80, vengo
realizando ejemplares únicos.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.670
Un libro completamente
artístico,

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:15.920
con una sola copia, sin más.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.560
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
since the 80s,

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.020
he started producing these
again one-of-a-kind books

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.550
that have no further copies.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.850
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:27.760
Venía preparado para
mostrarles tres voluminosos,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.040
grandes libros únicos, pero nos
jugó una mala pasada la aduana

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.370
en Cuba y van a llegar
esta noche.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:38.900
Así que van a llegar
después de la presentación.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
he shipped along

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.750
with his bags three big boxes
with spectacular new books

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.090
that he produced
specifically for this event,

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:49.130
but unfortunately, they were
held back at customs in Habana

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:50.480
and didn't make it
on his flight,

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.780
but they are arriving tonight,

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.790
and we hope to show
them on Saturday.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.130
Very beautiful, ambitious,
gorgeous books.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:01.660
So, we only have two of
these one-of-a-kind books

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.960
to show you today.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.610
But these are quite spectacular
as well, and if you can come

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:08.120
on Saturday, you'll
see the brand-new ones

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.230
that he has just made, that
are really, really fantastic.

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Sobre
una caja de pinturas, ¿no?

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.790
Una caja de materiales
de trabajo.

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:20.170
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this book
is made from a paint box.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:25.380
¿Le cuento que yo
te la había regalado?

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.680
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Sí, sí, claro.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.980
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
the story, briefly.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:32.620
So, many, many years ago,
I gave him this wooden box

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:36.330
that was filled with paints and
brushes as a gift, and then,

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.410
years later, he gave it back
to me as this work of art.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.670
[risa] And that's --
and it's called --

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.300
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
He devuelto el regalo.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.600
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He
returned it to me.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.550
Pensando en mi amiga Ruth Behar.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:50.060
Thinking about my
friend, Ruth Behar.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.580
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es un
poema del libro "La vena rota".

01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:02.150
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, it's a poem
from a book, a beautiful book

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:04.750
that he wrote, called
"La vena rota."

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.050
"The Broken Vein".

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.710
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Entonces,
todos estos materiales,

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:13.880
que están ilustrando un
poco el poema que, a su vez,

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.000
se basa en un poema de Dulce
María que habla de cuando el

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.520
hombre se levanta el
abrigo, en el muelle frío.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.820
Te acuerdas, ¿verdad?

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.120
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí, me encanta.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.520
So, this is a poem that
Estévez wrote for me,

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.670
but it references a poem
by Dulce María Loynaz

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:33.140
about the traveler, who's
lifting up his collar, you know,

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.440
to be met by somebody
at the port.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.740
So, it references that --
the lines from that poem.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.040
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: A
veces, uno se pregunta,

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.340
¿dónde está el texto?

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.640
Porque si es un libro,
tiene que tener un texto.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.940
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sometimes,

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.240
you ask yourself,
"Where's the text?"

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.540
If this is a book, it's got
to have the text somewhere.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.840
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Aquí, en esta cajita.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.140
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
in this little box.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Esta [initeligible]

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.640
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Ups.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.940
[risa]

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.240
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: De acordeón.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.360
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This
is like an accordion.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.660
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El texto.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.960
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: There's the text.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.800
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y creo que
hay algo más, pero en el fondo.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.580
Si mal no recuerdo, ¿o no?

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.880
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí, sí, sí.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.210
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí hay
una foto de Dulce María Loynaz

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:18.710
porque, de alguna manera, es
la que nos unió en este poema,

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:22.720
donde estamos ella y estoy yo,

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.670
pero un poco a través de la
obra de Dulce María también.

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:30.110
Y por detrás, entonces,
dice -- habla de esta --

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:34.850
es una foto original que hizo
un fotógrafo de Matanzas a Dulce

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:38.890
María, y me la regaló, y
yo la añadí a este libro.

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.030
La quiero tanto que me
desprendí de la foto y se la di.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.040
[ Risas ]

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
is an original photo

01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:47.840
of Dulce María Loynaz,
de great Cuban poet

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.990
who won the Cervantes prize,
and it was a real photo

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:54.670
that he had gotten or that
a Matanzas' photographer has

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.480
taken, and he likes me so much

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.370
that he gave me this
photo that he had.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:00.670
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ya
no me acordaba de eso.

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:01.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: No.

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:04.310
He had forgotten about this.

01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:06.400
And in a way, Dulce
María Loynaz,

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.430
like I said in my
introductory remark was kind

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.680
of like the bridge between
us, she was the first poet

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.690
that I learned about, Cuban poet
that I learned about from him,

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:18.450
and she really -- was
really important to me

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:23.040
and very important to Estévez,
and became kind of the bridge,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.940
one of the bridges between us.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.950
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Bueno,
entonces, para terminar,

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.250
vamos a hablar un poquito.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.410
Con este iba a empezar yo la
presentación que iba a hacer,

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.120
pero la vida le hace
esas cosas a uno,

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.470
y es con el que voy a cerrar.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:38.770
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, déjame decir.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.770
So, he was going to begin, if
the other books had arrived

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.570
with his bags, he was going
to begin with this book,

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:45.950
and then end with the others,

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.020
but instead we're going
to end with this one.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.320
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Bueno,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.300
he hecho una larga colección de
ejemplares únicos de libros-arte

01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:00.210
basados en los Versos
sencillos de José Martí,

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.150
que es un libro espléndido.

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:04.280
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he's made
many unique one-of-a-kind

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.200
artist's books based on the work
of José Martí, particularly,

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.940
the "Simple Verses",
the "Versos sencillos".

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:16.710
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y está
por todas partes Ediciones

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:18.310
El Fortín.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.660
Bellamar es Matanzas, para
mí, Bellamar es Matanzas.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.930
Yo le he cambiado el nombre
a esa ciudad porque tiene un

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:26.850
nombre horrendo y sanguinario.

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:30.170
Entonces, he empezado una
campana que a lo mejor florece

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:31.500
alguna vez.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.040
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he has
begun a campaign in the city

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.020
of Matanzas, because he doesn't
like the name of his city.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.840
"Matanzas" literally means
"slaughter" or "killings",

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.410
so it's a very bloody name.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.260
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Di lo
que quiere decir en inglés

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.560
"matanzas".

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.870
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí,
sí, ya lo dije.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:49.230
So, it's a name that he doesn't
like, a very violent name,

01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:53.070
and so he's actually begun this
campaign to change the name

01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:56.600
of the city to Bellamar,
which means "beautiful ocean."

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.060
So, he writes, as you
saw, he writes Bellamar,

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:06.430
that the books are made in
Bellamar rather than Matanzas.

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.690
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Es
un nombre más suave.

01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:10.570
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: It's
a nicer, softer name.

01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:11.870
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Ya.

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:16.970
Entonces, aquí adentro
está esta caja de yute.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.590
Forrada de girasoles, que
son los girasoles de Ochun.

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:28.650
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, here's this
beautiful line with burlap,

01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:31.400
and then at the top,
it has the sunflowers,

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.900
and the sunflowers are
the flowers for Ochun,

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.370
another important deity.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.080
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Estos son
los restos de pintura que van

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.160
quedando en los platos, y
yo los aprovecho también,

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.930
que parecen como unas gotas.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.580
Son restos de pintura,
de pigmento.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.440
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he has
leftover pigment and paint

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.010
that he uses also for the box.

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:56.340
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Este es
el poema uno de los versos

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.950
sencillos, una selección
del poema uno de los

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.250
versos sencillos.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:05.200
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: This is poem
number one of the simple verses,

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.220
some fragments from it.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.520
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Aquí, entonces,

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.880
empiezo con un poco
de información.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.400
Aquí hay papeles artesanales.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.940
Aquí hay unos papeles que le
compré a una artista de papeles

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.240
en Michigan.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.820
Es decir, el papel para mí
es una obsesión siempre.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.340
Me gusta mucho experimentar
y combinarlos.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:33.080
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he says he's
very, very obsessed with paper.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.150
This includes some paper
that he acquired while he

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.920
at Michigan, some
handmade papers.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.900
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Vamos a
guardar esto para poder seguir.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.770
Aquí está el texto del
poema, español-inglés,

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:55.040
gracias a un traductor
maravilloso cubano que vive en

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.520
Miami, que se llama Manuel
Tellechea y que tiene unas

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.890
traducciones espléndidas.

01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:02.270
Todo el mundo habla muy
bien, yo no sé inglés,

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:06.450
pero todo el que lo sabe habla
muy bien de las traducciones de

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:07.750
Martí de Tellechea.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.600
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, this
includes the poem in Spanish

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.650
and then translations
by Manuel Tellechea,

01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:16.890
who is a Cuban-American poet
living in Miami, and he's able

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:20.490
to translate Martí
into rhymed English,

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.570
which is extremely
difficult to do.

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:27.190
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Aquí hay
cinco cuartetas del poema uno.

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:30.780
Cinco en español y las
mismas cinco en inglés.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.960
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, five
stanzas from the poem

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.840
in Spanish, and then in English.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.140
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Otra parte,

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:40.610
la ilustración de este hombre
ideal del que habla Martí en el

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:44.560
primer poema, que se
asombra ante la naturaleza.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.310
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So,
he made a drawing

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:51.520
that represents the unique
man that Martí refers

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.530
to in the opening
verses of the poem.

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:56.770
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y
entonces, aquí, al fondo,

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.650
este pequeño Martí, José Martí.

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.000
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Here's
a small Martí.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.470
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: El poeta.

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:11.090
Otra información sobre los
lugares donde estamos en

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:15.270
Matanzas, donde se nos puede
encontrar, está ahí también.

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Some information
about where the book was made

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:23.080
in Matanzas or in
Bellamar, let's say.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.910
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y voy a
decir algo que he dicho muchas

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:26.370
veces, pero bueno,
aquí nunca lo he dicho,

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:32.010
es que hago muchas cosas
en esta vida artística.

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:33.310
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, he's
going to say something

01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:36.670
that he has said many times,
but he has never said it here

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:38.650
about his artistic life.

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.950
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:42.430
Me he dedicado por muchos
años a la enseñanza del arte.

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:45.020
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He spent
many years teaching art.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.880
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Me dediqué
por más de 35 años al mundo del

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.760
diseño de escenografía y
vestuario y luces en el teatro.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.010
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: For more than
35 years, he was involved

01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:55.500
in theater set design,

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.780
and costume design,
and lighting design.

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.770
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Pinto,
dibujo, escribe poesía.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.640
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: He paints,
he draws, he writes poems.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.820
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Pero de
todas las cosas que hago,

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.510
lo que yo quiero hacer hasta
el día que me muera son

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:11.810
estos libros.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.280
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: But of all
the things that he does,

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.670
what he wants to do until
the day he dies is this.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.970
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
Estos libros.

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:18.270
Gracias.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.570
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: These books.

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:20.870
Thank you.

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:22.170
[ Aplausos ]

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:30.430
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gómez: Okay, well.

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:38.330
[risa] It's very hard to follow
something so amazing like this.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:42.690
I'll be brief because I
think we want to leave time

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:45.680
for some questions from
the audience, but anyway,

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.580
I'm just so humbled and thrilled
to be in the presence of Estévez

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.910
and Ruth, and such a pleasure.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.770
Being a librarian and a
curator in the Hispanic Division

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.810
of the Library of Congress,
the division is in charge

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.350
of collecting materials from
Latin America, the Caribbean,

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.650
and Spain, and Portugal.

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:06.550
We're just so thrilled,
because we're just huge fans

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:10.920
of the Vigía, Ediciones
Vigía, and actually came

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.030
to know the collection
through Gina Truise who --

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.490
she works in preservation, and
they already mentioned her.

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:21.590
She has been involved with this
collection, did several trips

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.920
to Cuba before having her
job here at the library

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.340
and was extremely involved
with bringing, you know,

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:35.580
books to United States and also,
I think, she spent time there

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.870
and even worked with them.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.970
But she did a great
presentation of the books,

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:47.040
and I remember how I was just
like, you know, in cloud nine.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.720
It was just like a such
an amazing discovery,

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.150
and they just [ininteligible]
to everyone who's sees them,

01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:57.250
because there's nothing
like them.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:00.660
But they're just exquisite.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.490
All I want to say is that
what also was beautiful

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:09.200
about these collections is just
to see sort of what can happen

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.190
in the library to make
these collections available

01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:16.320
to the public, and again I am
here as a messanger because most

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.210
of this work was done by
other people in the library,

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:23.840
like Gina in preservation
building this amazinga boxes to,

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.820
you know, to try to preserve
this as long as we can.

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.550
They are made with all these
kinds of materials like,

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:40.470
you know, fluid materials,
tree bark and things

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:44.930
that [ininteigible] are
not the best for, you know,

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.870
posterity, I would say.

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:49.620
So, it's just amazing the
work that preservation does.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.210
And in the display I think
you saw some of the boxes

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:56.430
that are made for --
to sort the Vigía books

01:15:56.430 --> 01:16:01.120
and it's really amazing because
the actually build the boxes

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.140
depending on the shape of
the book, and it's amazing,

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.090
because they -- just, there's
so much time and love punt

01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:15.100
into protecting them, and it's
just been wonderful to see that,

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.160
and -- So they are
acid-free boxes

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:22.580
that actually Gina would explain
to me that they actually buffer

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.340
and they actually
absorb all the acid

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.680
from the materials
so it lasts longer.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.840
So that's -- it's
really neat to --

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.320
this is like a big operation
here at the Library of Congress,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.590
and then Barbara Dash who is a
cataloger of this collection,

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.860
which has also been fascinating

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.820
to learn how someone spends
all this time describing

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.800
the material.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.610
When people search for
these items in our catalog,

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.850
each book has a catalog worker,

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:59.150
and each book has a
very unique description.

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:05.370
And Barbara is -- does such an
amazing job, because it's to --

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:09.120
she describes all the details
that are in each edition,

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.670
and that is, you know, really,
you know, time-consuming work,

01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:19.670
and -- So, we just love this
collection here at the library.

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:23.640
We wish we had more
opportunities like this one

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.000
to show it, because
[ininteligible]

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.120
that these books, you
know, are heading.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.360
But, at daylight today it's
just great to have them here

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.880
and I just want to say that
we have close to 200 editions

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:44.420
at the library and it's
really, as Estévez said,

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.670
it's a beautiful collection and
I just wish we had more moments

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:53.140
like this where we can bring
them out, because it's just

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.750
such a -- it's such a beauty.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:18:00.290
And this is one of many other
collections that the Library

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:03.830
of Congress has, you
know, artist's books.

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:07.880
So, there're many artit's books,
these are books that are again

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.290
like these works of art,
so they're like more,

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:14.780
they are more works of art
than, you know, than books,

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:21.990
but they are just these
incredible creations,

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.390
and these are all housed,

01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:26.570
and the custodial division
is the rare book division,

01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.320
so there're many sorts of
[ininteligible] involved

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.680
in sort of the operation.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.190
And -- yeah, so many have
come through, you know,

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.940
people like Ge bringing them,
and now we have Luis Reta,

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:45.300
who is our vendor, who
buys material from Cuba

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:49.390
for the Library of Congress.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:54.500
And, so, we hope we can continue
to amass this collection,

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.970
and now collecting El Fortín,
which is your new endeavor

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:04.060
and it's just so exciting to
be able to promote your work

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.680
and be able to ahow
it to the world.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.700
So, with that I close
and I think if any

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:15.370
of you have any questions for
the artists, you know, we are --

01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:19.920
I think we have a
microphone circulating.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:24.460
&gt;&gt; Hi, and thak you,
Estévez, gracias.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.740
Incredible, it's beautiful.

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.930
I've arounf three questions.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:33.540
The glue, you know, is
there a special glue

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.820
that will stand for
20, 30 years?

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.720
And then one for
Gina, the archivist

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.400
or the preservation
person, would she have

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.970
to take photos of
every single page?

01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:50.970
Because heaven forbid if
that glue comes loose.

01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:54.690
And then my third or forth
question, and I think I sort

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:59.010
of know the answer
is, he answered it

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:03.290
in his closing comment,
like, this is his love,

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:07.820
and this is going to sound like
a jealous question, but, wow,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:14.930
I would love to -- How do, you
know, does he interact like this

01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:18.400
with the people he loves?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.130
You know, a letter to
a friend, is that going

01:20:21.130 --> 01:20:24.600
to have this loving, artistic --

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.390
like, when my mother writes
to me, she does similar things

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:32.920
to this, but -- so, those
are the three questions.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.900
&gt;&gt; So, the glue or the
adhesive, there's a --

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:46.550
The adhesive is of a variety
and by keeping materials

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.490
in the closed boxes,
number one, in the dark,

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:51.850
and also in a controlled
environment,

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:54.430
we control the humidity
and the temperature,

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:59.760
the cooler the temperature, the
slower the chemical reaction,

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.890
and so the adhesive,
in fact, will work.

01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:06.190
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:11.560
So, the adhesive will be
preserved for a period of time.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:17.760
One of the other things is when
various people go down to Cuba,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.260
myself included, we take
good adhesive down assured.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:26.680
So, I did that when I
went down in the 90s

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:32.370
and in the early 2000s, to take
adhesive down to enable them

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:36.530
to be able to make
more of the books.

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:40.190
So, I think that answers
both of the questions.

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:41.490
The first two.

01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:43.030
&gt;&gt; [Ininteligible]
does he write?

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:44.330
&gt;&gt; But that's, that I leave.

01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:46.040
[ Risas ]

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.710
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Hizo una pregunta
con respecto más sobre el

01:21:50.710 --> 01:21:54.380
pegamento y con el
modo de conservación.

01:21:54.380 --> 01:22:06.100
Pero después hizo una pregunta
sobre el amor que tú tienes por

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:13.150
los libros y cómo tú muestras
este amor con tu familia o como

01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:14.540
[ininteligible] una
pregunta más espiritual.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.070
O sea, si quieres
decir algo más.

01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:19.370
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
¿Exactamente?

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:23.890
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, you
want to know, we're trying

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:26.550
to truly unpack the question.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:29.130
So, you wanted to connect the
love that he has for bookmaking

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.430
with other kinds of love.

01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:33.990
&gt;&gt; Does he interact with
his family, friends,

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.720
in the same way he does his art?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.860
It's apparent, when he -- when
you gave him the paint set,

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.590
many years he gave
it back as art.

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.150
I guess by -- it's kind
of a figurative question.

01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:49.350
You know, does he interact a
hundred percent as the artist

01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:52.560
with everyone he interacts with?

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.820
Like, he would have hundreds of
people wanting to be his friend.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.180
They would be like,
"Write me a letter.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.480
I love you.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.780
This is art.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.080
You know, just to touch
or be near is art."

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.580
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Que si tú traes
todas estas formas con todos tus

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.080
amigos y seres queridos, porque
has hecho unos libros bellos,

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.380
por ejemplo, conmigo,

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.070
porque todo el mundo va
a querer ser tu amigo.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.460
[ Risa ]

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:17.160
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez:
La cosa está en --

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.600
la expresión de un artista es --

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.240
o sea, tiene que
salir del interior.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.540
Ahí nada más está todo.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.460
Y cuando tú combinas lo que está
aquí en tu energía con lo que

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:31.400
está en tu cerebro y convocas
al acto intelectual y al acto

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.740
emocional, ahí ya todo se
hace -- se condensa, ¿no?

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.040
¿Entiendes?

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.340
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: Sí.

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.630
So, the energy has to come from
inside and that's always kind

01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:46.850
of a combination of feelings,
and intellectual concepts,

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:49.140
and all of that kind
of gets condensed

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.950
into artistic expression.

01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:55.560
&gt;&gt; Rolando Estévez: Y esto que
decía de la comunicación con los

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.160
autores, a veces, tiene que
ser hasta un poco espiritista,

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.340
porque hasta con los Muertos,

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.800
tú logras crear a través
de lo que han escrito,

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.620
lo que te han dicho,
saber de ellos,

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.220
yo me he preguntado
muchas veces:

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.450
"¿Le gustaría este
libro a Frida Kahlo?

01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:13.750
¿Le gustaría?

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:15.050
¿Le hubiera gustado?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.350
¿Le gustará?"

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:17.650
Si está en alguna parte.

01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:20.750
&gt;&gt; Ruth Behar: So, it's a deep
communication with the person

01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:23.820
that you are writing
about, the author of a text,

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.470
and it might be Frida Kahlo,
who is no longer alive

01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:30.080
and he asks himself, "Would
Frida like this book?"

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.660
So, this kind of this very
deep communication that goes

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:37.830
on between himself as a
maker of artist's books

01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:42.120
and then the author of the
work that he's writing about

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.990
and finding that kind of
deep level of communication.

01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:47.180
Yeah.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.820
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: I want
to thank all of you

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.210
for this wonderful presentation,
but what a great review

01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:58.190
to the artist's inspiration,
the love between friends,

01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:02.450
the extraordinary
imagination that takes

01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:05.010
to make these works of art.

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.330
We're very, very lucky to
have you, Rolando Estévez,

01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:12.150

marvelous interlocutory you are.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.590
Thank you very much.

01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:17.480
Catalina, we're so grateful
for keeping these books for us

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.470
and for future generations,
for posterity.

Thank you so much for coming.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.250
And take another peek at
the books in the back.

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.550
Thank you very much again.
