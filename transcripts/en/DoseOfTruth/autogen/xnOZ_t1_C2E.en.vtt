part and you know I also think about

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
part and you know I also think about
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869
part and you know I also think about
that psychologically because I do think

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
that psychologically because I do think
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880
that psychologically because I do think
that that's the right way to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
that that's the right way to
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830
that that's the right way to
conceptualize human beings is that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
conceptualize human beings is that
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139
conceptualize human beings is that
there's an aspect of us that's mortal

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
there's an aspect of us that's mortal
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790
there's an aspect of us that's mortal
and human and limited but there's an

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
and human and limited but there's an
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560
and human and limited but there's an
aspect of us that's transcendent and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
aspect of us that's transcendent and
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.020
aspect of us that's transcendent and
divine as well and it's latent in some

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
divine as well and it's latent in some
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820
divine as well and it's latent in some
sense but there are times when it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
sense but there are times when it
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.760
sense but there are times when it
manifests itself and this is not

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770
manifests itself and this is not
 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
manifests itself and this is not
speculation right this is like the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
speculation right this is like the
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440
speculation right this is like the
oldest experience of human beings now

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
oldest experience of human beings now
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749
oldest experience of human beings now
it's not necessarily an easy experience

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
it's not necessarily an easy experience
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390
it's not necessarily an easy experience
to have but it's reported everywhere and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
to have but it's reported everywhere and
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490
to have but it's reported everywhere and
it can be reliably induced as we've

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
it can be reliably induced as we've
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440
it can be reliably induced as we've
discussed before by chemical means which

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
discussed before by chemical means which
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510
discussed before by chemical means which
and I don't know what that means exactly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
and I don't know what that means exactly
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.740
and I don't know what that means exactly
we've talked a little bit about

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
we've talked a little bit about
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109
we've talked a little bit about
psilocybin mushrooms for example and you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
psilocybin mushrooms for example and you
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090
psilocybin mushrooms for example and you
could say that the mystical experiences

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
could say that the mystical experiences
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530
could say that the mystical experiences
that have been invoked in the newest

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
that have been invoked in the newest
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.760
that have been invoked in the newest
experiments down at Johns Hopkins are

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770
experiments down at Johns Hopkins are
 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.920
experiments down at Johns Hopkins are
arrangements or forms of psychosis you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
arrangements or forms of psychosis you
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020
arrangements or forms of psychosis you
know because they have some similarity

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
know because they have some similarity
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.920
know because they have some similarity
to psycho psychotic experiences although

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930
to psycho psychotic experiences although
 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.330
to psycho psychotic experiences although
psychotic people were given LSD in the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
psychotic people were given LSD in the
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550
psychotic people were given LSD in the
60s and they always said that that was

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
60s and they always said that that was
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.870
60s and they always said that that was
something different than what they were

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
something different than what they were
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179
something different than what they were
having and if you give psychotic people

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
having and if you give psychotic people
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.649
having and if you give psychotic people
and fetta means you could make them

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
and fetta means you could make them
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.690
and fetta means you could make them
worse so they're biochemically separate

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
worse so they're biochemically separate
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060
worse so they're biochemically separate
and and we know that and but also the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
and and we know that and but also the
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.410
and and we know that and but also the
thing that's so interesting about the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
thing that's so interesting about the
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840
thing that's so interesting about the
psilocybin experience is is that they

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
psilocybin experience is is that they
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880
psilocybin experience is is that they
reliably produce mystical experiences

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
reliably produce mystical experiences
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560
reliably produce mystical experiences
that the people rate as among the most

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
that the people rate as among the most
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.710
that the people rate as among the most
important experiences of their life and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720
important experiences of their life and
 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.600
important experiences of their life and
among those who have the psychedelic

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
among those who have the psychedelic
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.070
among those who have the psychedelic
experience

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
experience
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.230
experience
positive things happen to them and so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
positive things happen to them and so
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.580
positive things happen to them and so
that kind of messes with the whole

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
that kind of messes with the whole
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.560
that kind of messes with the whole
psychosis theory right because what are

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
psychosis theory right because what are
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.850
psychosis theory right because what are
you gonna do you get a claim that you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
you gonna do you get a claim that you
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.530
you gonna do you get a claim that you
give someone a pill and they have a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
give someone a pill and they have a
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.640
give someone a pill and they have a
psychotic break and then they're

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
psychotic break and then they're
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.950
psychotic break and then they're
healthier it's like no that isn't how

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960
healthier it's like no that isn't how
 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.170
healthier it's like no that isn't how
psychotic breaks work you're not healthy

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
psychotic breaks work you're not healthy
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.660
psychotic breaks work you're not healthy
or after having one you're like you're a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
or after having one you're like you're a
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.400
or after having one you're like you're a
broken egg and it's not easy to put you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
broken egg and it's not easy to put you
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.910
broken egg and it's not easy to put you
back together so and we know that people

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
back together so and we know that people
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620
back together so and we know that people
all over the world have discovered every

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
all over the world have discovered every
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.780
all over the world have discovered every
manner of psychedelic substance that you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
manner of psychedelic substance that you
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760
manner of psychedelic substance that you
could possibly while you imagine there's

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
could possibly while you imagine there's
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.170
could possibly while you imagine there's
lots of hungry people wandering the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
lots of hungry people wandering the
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.730
lots of hungry people wandering the
earth for a long time and they ate every

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
earth for a long time and they ate every
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.200
earth for a long time and they ate every
damn thing they could get their hands on

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210
damn thing they could get their hands on
 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.600
damn thing they could get their hands on
and now and then something very peculiar

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
and now and then something very peculiar
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.199
and now and then something very peculiar
happened as a consequence so so I'm

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
happened as a consequence so so I'm
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.370
happened as a consequence so so I'm
gonna tell you a little bit about the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
gonna tell you a little bit about the
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.370
gonna tell you a little bit about the
shamanic tradition because it's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
shamanic tradition because it's
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.850
shamanic tradition because it's
associated with Jacob's Ladder so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860
associated with Jacob's Ladder so
 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.480
associated with Jacob's Ladder so
according to Elliot

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490
according to Elliot
 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.130
according to Elliot
Mircea Eliade it was a great historian

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
Mircea Eliade it was a great historian
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.920
Mircea Eliade it was a great historian
of religion a comparative Jung's and and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
of religion a comparative Jung's and and
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.780
of religion a comparative Jung's and and
and they influenced each other quite

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
and they influenced each other quite
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.699
and they influenced each other quite
substantially Eliana believed that

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709
substantially Eliana believed that
 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.370
substantially Eliana believed that
shamanism that used psychedelics was a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380
shamanism that used psychedelics was a
 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.460
shamanism that used psychedelics was a
degeneration from the original more pure

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
degeneration from the original more pure
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.800
degeneration from the original more pure
shamanism but I think later scholarship

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
shamanism but I think later scholarship
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.420
shamanism but I think later scholarship
has demonstrated that that's incorrect

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
has demonstrated that that's incorrect
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.390
has demonstrated that that's incorrect

in my house and one of them is quite
 

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.660
in my house and one of them is quite
interesting well the to make a panel and

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:23.670
interesting well the to make a panel and
 

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.370
interesting well the to make a panel and
they're an underwater seat and under the

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:26.380
they're an underwater seat and under the
 

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.020

water there's a bunch of you know

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.030
water there's a bunch of you know
 

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.030

mythical monsters some of them are
 

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.590
mythical monsters some of them are
killer whales and I think there's an

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600
killer whales and I think there's an
 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.450
killer whales and I think there's an
octopus down there and carved in this

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:33.460
octopus down there and carved in this
 

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.790
octopus down there and carved in this
particular style and he said that the

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800
particular style and he said that the
 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.900
particular style and he said that the
other thing that happens to him when he

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:36.910
other thing that happens to him when he
 

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.550
other thing that happens to him when he
dreams is he goes down to the bottom of

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560
dreams is he goes down to the bottom of
 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.680
dreams is he goes down to the bottom of
the water where these mythical creatures

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.690
the water where these mythical creatures
 

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.510
the water where these mythical creatures
are and he gets inspiration from them

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:42.520
are and he gets inspiration from them
 

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.790

and so I thought that was extremely

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800
and so I thought that was extremely
 

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.250
and so I thought that was extremely
interesting too you know we we don't

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.260
interesting too you know we we don't
 

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.650
interesting too you know we we don't
know what a mind that isn't hyper

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:49.660
know what a mind that isn't hyper
 

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.280
know what a mind that isn't hyper
civilized let's say hyper literate like

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.290
civilized let's say hyper literate like
 

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.780
civilized let's say hyper literate like
like our minds are because we're so

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:54.790
like our minds are because we're so
 

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.330
like our minds are because we're so
bombarded by external stimuli we have no

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.340
bombarded by external stimuli we have no
 

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.520
bombarded by external stimuli we have no
idea what the natural mind is like

00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.530
idea what the natural mind is like
 

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.800
idea what the natural mind is like
really and so it was quite interesting

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:01.810
really and so it was quite interesting
 

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.610
really and so it was quite interesting
to to to listen to that and also to see

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:05.620
to to to listen to that and also to see
 

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.050
to to to listen to that and also to see
the consequences cuz he's quite a great
