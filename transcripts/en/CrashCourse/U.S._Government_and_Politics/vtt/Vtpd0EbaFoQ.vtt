Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're gonna finish

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.630
up our discussion of the First Amendment, finally,
by talking about everybody's favorite: the press.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.839
The First Amendment is pretty clear that Congress
can't make any laws abridging the freedom

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.210
of the press, and since you understand the
basics of free speech because you were paying

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
attention, the reasons for this should make
a lot of sense. But as with any discussion

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.769
of the First Amendment, things aren't as straight
forward as we might think, and the freedom

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.929
of the press, just like the freedom of speech,
is not absolute.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:36.740
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.180
The main thing to know about the First Amendment
and the press is that it prevents the government

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.769
from censoring the press. For the most part,
this means preventing the press from publishing

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.890
some information in the first place, although
it can also mean punishing a news agency after

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.310
they published something. Let's deal with
pre-publication freedom of the press first.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.520
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.309
Censorship of the press before a story is
published in print, broadcast on television,

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.070
radio or the internet, is called prior restraint,
and the supreme court ruled that it was not

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.510
allowed in a case called Near v. Minnesota.
In that case, a newspaper called The Saturday

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.220
Press was gonna publish a story that the city
of Minneapolis was under the secret control

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.520
of a cadre of Jewish gangsters, in particular
the mayor and chief of police. City officials

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.050
obtained an injunction to stop the publication
of this story, and they gave The Saturday

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.560
Press editors the opportunity to go before
a judge to prove that the story was true.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.370
I'll get to this question of truth in a minute.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.550
The judge ordered the injunction and said
that if the newspaper violated it, they would

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.150
be punished for contempt of court. Instead,
the newspaper counter-sued, claiming that

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.810
Minneapolis and Minnesota were violating their
freedom of the press. The supreme court agreed

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.680
that no government was allowed to censor the
press because a free press is essential for

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.840
the political system to work. They based their
decision on a lot of history, including Blackstone

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.270
- the British legal authority which explained
"The liberty of the press is indeed essential

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
to the nature of a free state; but this consists
in laying no previous restraints upon publications

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.650
and not in freedom from censure from criminal
matter when published."

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.620
And they also relied on an important American
authority on the constitution: James Madison

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.920
- heard of him? - who derived a lot of his
constitutional expertise from the fact that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.320
he wrote the thing. He said, "This security
of the freedom of the press requires that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.240
it should be exempt not only from previous
restraint by the executive as in Great Britain,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.659
but from legislative restraint also."

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.950
Citizens need a free press to be able to criticize
the government and to expose government wrongdoing

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.860
because otherwise the government can get away
with all sorts of things that we don't want

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.480
it to, like say spying on us, and reading
our email, and reading our spy's email! Of

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
course, even with a free press, the government
can do this, and what constitutes a press

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.170
in the age of the internet is a debatable
question. WikiLeaks, anyone? But the basic

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.760
proposition that the press must be able to
protect us against an over-reaching government

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000
still stands. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.420
There's another reason why the Court put the
kibosh on prior restraint, and that's because

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.900
if a newspaper prints something that is untrue
about the government, or more practically,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.330
about a government official, there's a remedy
for this. The person or agency about whom

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.590
the untrue thing was said or written and published
can sue the publisher for libel, and if he

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.709
proves his case, can get monetary damages.
This is supposed to prevent newspapers from

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.500
flat out lying about public officials, but
libel suits can cause another problem, in

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.069
that they can basically end up being after
the fact censorship. If a newspaper is so

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.640
afraid of a libel suit that it decides not to
publish a story, then it effectively censors itself.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.489
Sometimes courts call this a "chilling effect"
and it applies to speech that people are afraid

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.790
to make because of potential lawsuit or other
punishment, as well as articles and news stories

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.590
that go unpublished out of fear of potential
punishment. Tell you what, I ain't afraid

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.530
of punishment for that. I can do what I want!
Freedom of speech!

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.430
Luckily for us, the Court dealt with the libel
issue in another landmark case, New York Times

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.700
v. Sullivan from 1964. This case involved
an advertisement in the Times that included

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.430
some inaccurate statements about the way Alabama
law enforcement was treating Civil Rights

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.239
protesters including Martin Luther King Jr.
The Montgomery Public Safety Commissioner,

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.190
L.B. Sullivan thought these mis-statements
amounted to libel and sued the Times. He lost

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.260
at the Supreme Court, and they ruled that
the standard for libel of a public figure

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.470
was actual malice, which was my nickname in
high school.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.790
This means that in order to win a libel case,
you must prove that the publisher of the libelous

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.700
statement knew that the statement was false
and acted with reckless disregard, my friend's

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.860
nickname in high school, for the truth. This
is an almost impossible standard to prove,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.530
and what it means is that public figures almost
never win libel cases. This goes a long way

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.129
toward explaining some of outlandish things
you read about politicians and celebrities

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.140
in print, and I'm not even gonna begin to
talk about some of what you can find on the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.520
Internet, like a bearded dude talking about
government and punching eagles.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.340
Some argue that we shouldn't feel too bad
about celebrities, and we should remember

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.870
that they are celebrities and are usually
doing alright for themselves. Unflattering

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.879
publicity might simply be considered the price
of fame. I'd point out that celebrities are

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.650
human, too, except for Lil Bub, the only non-human
celebrity, and probably don't like being libeled.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.570
I guess Jar-Jar Binks is another non-human
celebrity, and he gets a lot of bad press,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.240
but he truly is terrible, so it's not libel.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.939
So it sounds like the First Amendment protection
of a free press is pretty much absolute, but

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:39.279
there are always exceptions that make things
complicated. One of these exceptions is the

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.559
question of national security. There are some
security issues that are so important that

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.779
the government is allowed to censor the press
before they can print stories about them.

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.139
The best example of this is that the government
can prevent the press from printing detailed

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.699
descriptions of troop movements during a war,
because this would help the enemy and put

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.800
soldiers' lives at risk. It's kinda like in
the spy movies when the bad guys learn all

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.559
the names and aliases of the secret agents,
except it's real. Knowing this, most newspapers

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.520
wouldn't print this sort of thing, at least
while it's happening.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.379
But what about after the fact? Well, it gets
complicated, but another Supreme Court case

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.229
gives us some guidance about what to expect.
In New York Times v. US -- why is it always

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.189
the New York Times? -- the issue was whether
or not the Times could publish the Pentagon

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.839
Papers. These were secret documents, stolen
from the government by Daniel Ellsberg, who

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.990
had worked at the Defense Department. They
showed that much of the government's reasoning

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.930
behind the Vietnam War was untrue or at least
highly questionable, hmm, I'm gonna go with

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.960
untrue. The government tried to stop the Times
and the Washington Post, too, from publishing

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.249
these papers, because it would make the government
look bad and perhaps turn public opinion against

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.259
the war. Now, this was 1971, and a good deal
of public opinion was kind of already against

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.979
the war, so much so that Lyndon Johnson had
decided not to run for re-election just a

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.349
few years before in 1968. But the government
said that publication of this classified report

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.830
would cause irreparable harm to America's
ability to defend itself, and they tried to

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.219
stop the publication. The Court ruled against
this prior restraint, further strengthening

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.029
the First Amendment protection of the free
press. It also slapped down the executive

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.949
branch, which was trying to claim its privilege
to keep state secrets. But we already mentioned

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.159
this when talking about Nixon and his attempts
to hold on to the Watergate tapes.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.110
Anyway, as you can see, the First Amendment
offers a lot of protections to citizens in

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.379
the press, especially when they're criticizing
the government or its policies, or even when

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.139
they're making fun of celebrities. This is
really, really important, because American

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.839
democracy relies on its citizens having enough
information to make good decisions and hold

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.990
elected officials accountable. We rely on
the press to tell us what the government is

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.259
doing so that we can decide whether or not
we want to let them keep doing it. If the

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.689
government can keep us from getting important
or even not so important information by censoring

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.199
the press or by preventing us from speaking
out against what we see as wrong, it will

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.909
be able to keep doing this that might be bad,
and this is the kind of tyranny that the Framers

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.979
of the Bill of Rights were most worried about.
So the more you're concerned about tyranny,

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.139
the freer you want speech and the press to
be. This is something to think about when

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.999
you engage in arguments about Edward Snowden and
his NSA disclosures, or Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:46.539
