00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.380
 this capsule we will define more 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 formally what are the problems 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.630
 of satisfaction of constraints so a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.240
 point of satisfaction constraints are going 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.850
 be defined by firstly a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 set of variables the whole ends 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.539
 so as a set of variables life 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.140
 which will contain the variable they have 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.760
 extract one up to x men where n is going to be the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 number of variables in our problems 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 and to each variable etc if we go 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.350
 associate a domain and value xi 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 possible that can take the variable 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 then it has more than the other set of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.500
 variables and domains for each 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.570
 variables we will roll together 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 constraints we're here it's a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.649
 up to cm 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.620
 so m will match the number of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 constraints and each of the constraints in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.699
 actually restore the values ​​that can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.010
 take a subset of variables 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.690
 have examples sometimes for 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.619
 illustrates a little more concretely what 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.799
 that we mean by a constraint 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.600
 then we note that in a problem we 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.340
 go in a satisfaction bonus 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.909
 constraint one make me more explicit 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.860
 structure in variable to structure 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.740
 in variable assigned to values ​​of 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.509
 our problem so a problem state 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.420
 which will correspond to one hour in 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.500
 our research group are going 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 correspond to a value assignment 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.420
 from certain variables to certain 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.819
 values 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.009
 so we will note that as a whole where 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:40.030
 for example the variable etc what will be 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.610
 signed a given value will live there 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.110
 I will be signed a value of the gis 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.539
 institute is so we will also say 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 that an assignment that steals that violates 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.280
 none of the constraints are going to be 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.049
 competitive or legal it's the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.209
 definition of equal compatible this is a 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.580
 association that violates any of the 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.130
 constraints also of that we will define 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.830
 as a complete assignment a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.479
 assignment which involves all 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.280
 variables so that would be a subpoena 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.620
 who would give who has thing he is a 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.470
 value to all of all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.170
 variables of our problem is so a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.230
 solution a satisfaction problem 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.870
 against a calf correspond to a 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.190
 assignment which is complete so who 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.319
 assigns a value to all 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.660
 variables and which in addition is compatible 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.989
 or legal so that respects all 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.989
 constraints 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 a first example on the example jouels 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.200
 for well good simple port and of 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.120
 to concretize a little all the concerts 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 let's imagine we are a set of barry 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.060
 had that would correspond to three 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 variables that we note x1 x2 and x3 next 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.500
 suppose that for simplicity we have that 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.909
 the domain the first variable the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.159
 second variable and the third 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.459
 variable be exactly the same at 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.620
 know all of the Caribbean 1 2 and 3 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.569
 and suppose we have one 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.420
 constraint that would correspond to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.989
 constraints that x do more x must be 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.620
 equal to aix 3 then for this problem of 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.690
 satisfaction against 1 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.239
 we will have three solutions 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.980
 possible be we assign x 1 to 1 x 2 to 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.720
 1 then x 3 to 1 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.980
 actually we only have one plus one more 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.510
 a babies equal to 2 where we could 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.049
 assign x 1 x 2 2 x 3 to 3 we would not see 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.030
 although 1 + 2 equals three and one 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.909
 could be changed the assignment 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.150
 dexter and ii x2 which would make that dre x 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.170
 hours that would be equal to two experts 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.480
 who feast on 1 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.239
 and that's really the situation of 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:59.150
 extras required and 363 these are three 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.390
 assignment that are complete and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.390
 competitive 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.400
 another example would be the riddle 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.040
 next so let's imagine we give you 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.069
 a map of australia and we will 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.849
 request with only three colors of 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.630
 color the map so that two 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.789
 border states does not wear the same 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.120
 color is not identified at the same 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.520
 color 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 so in that if we have the states of 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.070
 australia 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.289
 we have one two three four four five sets 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.750
 some share borders so 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.150
 for example registers to share a 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.950
 border with western australia and the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.510
 what we are asking is that the fathers of the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.789
 rates that share a border is 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.580
 not the same color and that we succeed in 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:55.250
 color all the red evening states 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.669
 in green or blue so a way of 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.080
 represent this problem there in the frame 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.360
 a fan of constraint satisfaction 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.180
 it would be to identify as variable 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.220
 all the states of australia whose 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.930
 notes with acronyms w at 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.240
 western australia and poor for an order 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.860
 territory and so on 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.840
 this is the domain of each variable that 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.350
 would be the three possible colors to 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.080
 hergé and b or 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:27.570
 green or blue and we administer to 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.860
 also in fact we will use in the 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.500
 next classes capture for 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.330
 illustrate the set of variables d 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.920
 state and possible values ​​of 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.450
 each of the variables was not understood 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.640
 this part is correct in a 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.690
 next capsule we will see how 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.030
 we can use this visualization 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.180
 the water just to illustrate the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.060
 problem is well understood and finally 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.940
 the constraints it's worth such that all 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.680
 border state pairs must 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.740
 have different colors so the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.780
 variable w at the hotel different sa 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.450
 other value different from the value 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.550
 mt actively western australia must 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.650
 have a different color than northern 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.730
 territory because these are states 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.250
 who share a border 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.830
 we would also have that mt should be 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.120
 different from ass so no of a 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.330
 territory must have a color 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.860
 different from queensland is instituted and 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.090
 for this problem there we do we see a 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.830
 solution here where w register or junta is 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:37.590
 strict 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:40.710
 q will be red nsw very green vis à vis 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.690
 will also be his reds is to this dream 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.010
 blue and des would be vain so we see 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.430
 visually that indeed no 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:53.840
 pair of state territory sharing 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.840
 a border have the handrail 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.100
 there is an illustration a way of 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.990
 draw or illustrate the constraints 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.660
 of a problem that will sometimes be 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.700
 practice if we have problems that have 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.810
 pinaire constraints so against 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.520
 in binary we will say constraints 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.640
 which involves only two variables 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.610
 finally we can visualize all 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.160
 constraints using a graph two 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.160
 against one and in this case this tale this 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.560
 what we would do is we would decide 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.610
 graph where each would correspond to a 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.040
 variable ok so double life to recent 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.990
 are our interests are naked and we 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.310
 would draw an arc between the variables that 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.980
 share one against a gift that are 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.500
 in the same country for example w run 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.640
 constraint with mtw one must not be 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.970
 equal amt and institutes so that's it 

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.580
 what we are going to call is what we are going 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.230
 call a constraint graph 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.940
 associated or even 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:03.570
 satisfactions coloring constraints 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.570
 graffiti for the map of Australia 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.910
 a third problem that could be 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.270
 solved using an algorithm of 

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:16.620
 satisfaction against is the one d and rain 

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:18.790
 we have an example here with 8 reindeer 

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.110
 it's a problem we've seen in 

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.040
 capsules the previous 

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:27.370
 so I would not describe it again 

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.880
 what I want illustrated by cons is 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:34.930
 the number of possible configurations of 

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.180
 our graph so forgiveness of in our 

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:40.140
 search space a number of 

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:44.020
 reindeer grid configurations 

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.630
 possible depending on the number of reindeer 

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.310
 and therefore the size of the grid and is 

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.480
 what we notice is that this figure 

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:55.240
 increases very quickly point that for 

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.640
 an equal 16 we have a number really very 

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.030
 high which would make it impossible 

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.780
 in fact 

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:05.410
 list all the grids with 

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.390
 positions brent up to find one that 

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.470
 satisfies the constraints and faces two 

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.720
 manners 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.430
 cass of where really so that's a 

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.850
 example of problems Wales 16 or 

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.380
 a satisfaction bonus constraint is 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:25.480
 particularly useful and necessary 

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:28.030
 to solve solve a problem so 

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.920
 to model this problem the dm reindeers 

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.520
 in the form of breads of satisfaction 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.620
 of constraints 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.400
 we could have as variable the 

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:38.200
 different columns one up n the 

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.000
 domains of each of the variables it's 

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.250
 do an entire two hours until end 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.720
 who did what a clue to tidy up 

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.570
 cultural indicates ronan she 

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:52.150
 ranged one would place the queen in 

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:54.460
 this column and so the column i / o the 

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:59.230
 value as if the queen for the column 

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:01.300
 is there in the row what so 

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.360
 and finally for what it is 

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.700
 constraint one would have the whole one is 

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.320
 a constraint by row and by 

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.630
 diagonal possible the constraint this 

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.540
 would there be only who have 

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.760
 no reindeer on the same rage and so 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.170
 that would mean that would imply as 

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.030
 we want it in the bonus d is true 

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.820
 that there are no reindeer that attack 

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.770
 directly or indirectly and noticed 

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.690
 that we might have expected and what 

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.900
 which is also constraints on 

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.520
 the columns but actually because of 

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.280
 our definition of the problem to know 

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.660
 we have one variable per column and 

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.220
 we can take as values 

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.570
 only at risk and so 

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.400
 implicitly that means we can 

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.870
 place a single queen only by 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.140
 column and so we do not need to 

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:47.440
 constraint finally to make sure that 

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.470
 there are not two reigns on each column and 

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.330
 here we have a solution to the problem of 

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.760
 showcases and you notice that 

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.810
 actually if we look at each of 

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.940
 rows and each of the diagonals 

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:03.910
 liautaud days only a queen at 

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.600
 plus a queen on each row 

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.600
