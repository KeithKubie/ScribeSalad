HAOHSIANG LIAO:
Our pedagogy here

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.430
is we would like to train
our students to become

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.560
successful participants
in Chinese culture

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.640
by using Mandarin as
their primary language.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.120
So this means we expect
students to behave in a way

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.430
that whenever they
have an opportunity

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.140
to interact with Chinese
people, they will find

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.380
it comfortable from both sides.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.000
So that's the general idea
about our pedagogy here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.897
In order to do this, besides
language proficiency,

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:39.230
we're talking about the grammar.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.070
We're talking about
the language forms.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
We also extend our attention
to their behavioral culture.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.790
And we feel that this is
an essential component

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.100
for a successful communication
in a second culture.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.750
The time in class, we'll usually
use it, for the most part,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.190
to provide students the
opportunity to perform.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.400
And by performance, we
mean that performance

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.600
in the second culture
based on what we

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.480
call the situational knowledge.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.250
So we feel as an
instructor, our role

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.700
is to provide a state for
students to practice in class.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.080
I think the example could
be as simple as, how

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.000
do you create your teacher
versus your friends

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
in Chinese culture?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.690
When students ask
me, so what am I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.050
going to learn for
Chinese 101, I always

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.910
tell them that
after Chinese 101,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.250
if you have friends who don't
know any Chinese ask you,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.840
so how do you speak
"hi" in Chinese,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.030
your answer can be more
sophisticated than saying

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.500
"nihao," which is a general
greeting in Chinese.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.820
So for example, the way we
greet our teachers on campus

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.410
is really different from the
way that we greet our friends.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.150
So we're trying to get students'
attention to the environments

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.660
or the situation
they're in, for example,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.290
the people they
are speaking with,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.600
their role in the
conversation, or the place.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.530
So speaking with a teacher
takes different strategies

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.960
compared to speaking with your
friends in Chinese culture,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.350
for example.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.590
We learn to do things
in foreign languages

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.340
so that's a very fundamental
concept here that we're always

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.150
trying to convey
to our students.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.490
We try to encourage them
that what you're doing here

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.130
is to accomplish things
by using Mandarin

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.590
as your primary language.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.570
I think for us, we
consider culture

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.220
as common daily practices
and social norms

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.980
that define an individual
to function successfully

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740
in a society.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.140
So for us, we feel one of
the priorities as a language

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.400
instructor, our
responsibility is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.630
to help students prioritize
those daily practices

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.650
and then show them the
patterns or the rules involved.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.950
And once students
have the opportunity

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.200
to be exposed to those
rules and then in class,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.390
they have their opportunities to
practice them, to perform them

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.970
and as an instructor,
you're providing feedback,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.580
then they go through this
what we call a "cycle."

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.480
So out of each class,
they can get out

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.820
of each 50-minute
class with a story.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.480
Today's story might be,
how do you decline an offer

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.390
from your employer?

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.970
Tomorrow's story might be, how
do you deal with conflicts?

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.290
So this is what we
call the stories here

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.790
and our experience shows
us that a cross-cultural

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.320
miscommunication,
for the most part,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.000
they don't lie in
language proficiency.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.760
They lie in cultural competence.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.000
And that's why we would like to
bring the cultural competence

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.550
into the core components
of our curriculum here.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.360
We're not saying that language
proficiency is not important.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.090
We're just trying to point
out that the way you behave

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.000
in a second culture is
as important as your use

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.769
of the language.
