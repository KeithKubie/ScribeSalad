00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.240
Hey, what's up guys we are here at the park today. We're here with Devin Graham

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys long time no see and Shawn Duras. [oh], hey long time no see

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.559
Happy birthday bud high five so we are back here with the sky Blaster slingshots

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.839
And we have some of these little novelty balloons

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.330
You may have seen these floating around the stores these are like bunch of balloons or battle balloons or balloon blasters they go by like

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.569
A million different names, but do they actually work, I don't know but that's what we're gonna figure out

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
So here's the deal last year when I made these things I actually tried filling these up

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.369
And I didn't really have much luck or success the idea is you attach these things to your hose you can just turn them on

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.700
The balloons will fill themselves up, and when they're big enough. They'll just drop off automatically kind of like fruit dropping from a tree

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.979
Yeah, sounds good, and then they're good to throw right, but what I found in my experimenting was when you throw them

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.879
They don't really pop

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.369
They're like super hard balloons and so if you throw them or shoot them at somebody they'll leave welts all over your body

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.320
This is gonna be fun because we have lots of friends coming over

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.000
We have What's Inside, Devin Supertramp a whole bunch of friends are coming over, so we're gonna have a water balloon fight

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
[Grant]:We're gonna shoot them at Devin cuz he's...[Shawn]: I like that. I think Devin's the new Target.[Devin]: I am the guinea pig for today.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.089
[Shawn]:Yeah, I like that one should be easy.[Grant]: You see after that Marshmallow blasting session...[Devin]: I still have welts all over my body.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.189
Yeah, test number one pink balloons. Hopefully this works there is no app for pink first Grant

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.420
Well Cause Devin handed it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.920
Oh its a pretty color.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.310
Okay

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.439
What I think we should do is actually fill this bucket up with water

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.099
So when the balloons drop they have a soft..[Shawn]: Oh. got it got it got it [Grant]: this is really hot right now

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.360
And I'm not sure how they will affect the performance.[Shawn]: It's okay though. You're hot too ..water cannon

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.199
Where's Devin? Oh shoot sorry. I didn't know you were all sorry..[Devin]: except that it is your camera ...[Shawn]:that Camera's seen much worse

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.679
So these are the balloons that I used last year. I got him out of  Walmart

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.839
They are like Red blue and green different balloons

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
And I didn't have much luck with these let's let's try them this year and see if they've made [any] improvements

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.310
the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.810
experience

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
I had before is some of them wouldn't blow up at all the other ones that did blow up and get big they would like

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.280
Leak out [alright]

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.860
Sweet these already look different than they did last year because they used to be these like really cheap pieces of plastic

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.189
This is awesome. No, I got about to go play Pokemon

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.239
Go, you should just let them drop off or do you think we should like let them drop?

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.939
Like hold them up here. Yeah

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.229
Like my little babies

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.500
So it's Pokemon go look at all these three pokemons

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.190
I just got yeah honestly this is a much better experience than it was last time

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.999
Hey, they actually all look pretty even surprisingly yeah, yeah, they're filled to a pretty good size. I'm actually really impressed

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.750
I wasn't expecting that to happen. I was expecting like little baby dinky ones. [Shawn]:Whats up Lincoln?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500
That's where we're going right there these are gonna hurt

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.319
"They will"?Yeah, whoo all right that actually worked, ten paces. Let's do. This are you serious? Yeah, okay? So eight nine five

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.039
as if it just bounces right off yeah

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.529
Back shot ten points so all of mine bounced off of you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.039
I don't know if you know I mean that's cuz you just got thrown with a heart now. I don't know if you noticed oh

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
That was a long one

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.390
That one I get down. That was a cheap shot. I'm not even kidding

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
You high-five totally like a bow hold like a bow and arrow like this is okay. "yeah"

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.549
I meant to hit Sean

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.518
It's been a couple of minutes and some of these are actually losing, mass

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.190
so I think they do have a shelf life like if you squeeze it hard enough that thing will probably even pop up look at

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.950
thats how you do it.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.310
You can make little squirt guns out of them what?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.780
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.570
Pick on someone your own size.[Grant]: what happened to you, did you just get dunked? Yep

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.850
Definitely, definitely if you fill up your water balloons in the water it relieves enough pressure

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.699
And they can get a lot bigger, and it seems to break a lot easier as well

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.298
So I don't know if the [name-brand] makes a difference, but we'll find out here

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.459
You are going down for that!  look at that. He just completely assaulted me. This is actually the kind of cap

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.459
I was expecting cuz that's what we had last year. Oh

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.109
Shawn Duras is about to feel the wrath. This is how it works [see] little launch pouch made out of duct tape

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.009
Balloon fits right in there like so lock it. Oh

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.909
Direct hit, how do I feel how about feel that was that was pain by with my arm?

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.589
And it still hurt these resistance bands are actually quite quite strong in fact this guy blaster, slingshot

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.769
I made here this prototype was actually my wife's workout band if I [workout]

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.639
I went down to [her] exercise room and chopped that up into a prototype. So thank you for letting me do that

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.369
I made a couple slight modifications from my video. You can see I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.699
Middle pieces to three inches which makes a little more compact, and I [used] some 45 degrees here on the back

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.440
What that does it just gives you a little bit cooler look as that rests against your forearm there

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.739
And this one is painted with red Spray paint, but you can use duct tape as well

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.960
I got some of this carbon [fiber] duct tape and you [can] see actually does just as nice of jobs wait

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.120
What are we doing another round? Yeah, but we have to use

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.870
How about no shooting in the face?

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.820
Lincoln, check this out when the balloons are about the size that you want all you have to do is give them a quick tug

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.320
Upward whoop, they're all come off. How big do they actually get before they fall off from the runway?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.379
It looks like white fruit growing on a tree doesn't it?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.189
Can feel them get ready to drop there you go? Yeah!

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.729
Game on let's do this. Oh my turn

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.400
Hello

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.930
The smaller the balloons are the better

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.900
They're gonna work with the slingshots cuz they're a little more resilient these bigger ones kind of a little bit Trickier. Let's get Lincoln. Oh

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.959
Pink packs a little more punch ain't bad the trail

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.609
Okay, so our experience actually hasn't been too bad. It seems like probably nine out of ten balloons will fill up

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.419
They do hurt like crazy though. I got hit on the shoulder blade by Lincoln.Where did he go that little stinker

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.719
So the bigger the balloons are the easier they pop which is a good thing if you're having water fight

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.040
But if you want to shoot them out of the slingshot smaller is probably better. Let's see how high we can go with this oh

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.259
You just got water we go. Oh

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.340
that freaking rocks

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.229
So these things have gone insanely viral. It seems like anybody who makes a video about them racks up millions of views

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.289
And they're really expensive and I want you to know what you're getting for your money

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.420
Are they worth 10 bucks 10, 10 bucks for I'd pay good 750 for those 750

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.170
I paid 750 right there you go guys 750 we've confined for 750

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.360
That's about what they're worth, but cleanups a bit of a pain

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.429
I'm not sure if these things are biodegradable or not

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.570
But we are over here and clean them up just in case and now there's a party happening over here

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.619
Shonduras is 29th birthday guys and of course I get the  of random to come to my birthday party

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.099
Slip and slide every base is a pool check this out if you want to see the [waterslide] Kick ball

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.249
I'm totally getting in on this. We're gonna go over to the Shawn duras, okay?

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.220
Yeah, come on over we have fun and Graham's gonna play off
