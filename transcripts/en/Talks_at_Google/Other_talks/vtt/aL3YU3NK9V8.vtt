00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.275
SPEAKER: Hi!

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:16.810
Leah and Diana are here to talk
about Clowns Without Borders.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.580
I'm sure you'll
find this discussion

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.500
of this wonderful
organization fascinating.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:34.944
But first-- Yeah, I know.

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:35.694
How does he do it?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.390
You're on.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.581
Oh yeah take them off.

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:43.122
ALEX: Grazie!

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.555
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:20.055
Yay!

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:33.061
How do you say--
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.570
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:54.420
[MUSIC - "ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR
 BOAT"]

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:28.082
See?

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:29.426
Yeah?

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:30.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:05:12.206
ALEX: [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What?

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:17.405
Oh.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:26.738
All right, our problem
[SPEAKING ITALIAN] Yeah!

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:26.148
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.640
Grazie!

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.140
Merci!

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.940
Donde, how you say-- if you
learn some English, yeah.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.725
Yo like Alex the
jester on Facebook.

00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:58.570
No, I don't speak English.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.430
I'm here for Clowns
Without Borders.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.780
What you saw, well we
just like to communicate

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.863
in that special clown way.

00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:09.503
I don't mean birthday party
with balloons and big shoes.

00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:11.720
Red noses are cool, though.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:19.880
And I love to go out on a limb,
and just put the bar this high,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.162
and make this client.

00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:24.770
At another time, when
we have more time,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.150
I will show you the secrets
of nonverbal communication.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.260
Two horrible words.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.434
I call it primal talk.

00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:35.280
Primal talk is what
Clowns Without Borders

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.919
does what they go, as
I do, to countries all

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.356
of the world where this
is the way we have.

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:42.730
I think you can
see the feelings,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.310
the emotions, the communication.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.600
And the last little
thing I'm going to say,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.240
as far as putting
the bar up here,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:59.080
I claim that clowns can show
you physical communication that

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.690
can help you that
connect with people.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.650
Well you guys all have
elite social skills,

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.107
but you might know
a colleague-- you

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:10.442
might know a colleague who
could use a little help.

00:09:10.442 --> 00:09:15.090
Connecting faster, and
with Primal Talk all

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.618
I want to see if I can show
you is to connect quicker

00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:20.850
with people, be more
empathetic, a better friend,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.695
find love, and save the world.

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:24.693
That's about it.

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:26.616
I think on saving
the world, listen

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:28.574
to what Leah and Diana
have to say about Clowns

00:09:28.574 --> 00:09:31.059
Without Borders.

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.550
DIANA Thank you.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.830
Hi everyone.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.430
I'm Diana.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.080
I'm the vice president of
the board of Clowns Without

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.530
Borders, and the
former director.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.560
We're a basically
volunteer run organization.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.240
So we pay very little to
an administrative team

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.250
to keep us going, but
in the US here, we

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.330
are basically volunteer run.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.620
And Leah is one of our
volunteers and performers.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.460
And we want to explain what
Clowns Without Borders is,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.074
and just raise awareness
about what clown is.

00:10:01.074 --> 00:10:02.990
Because it's not, I don't
think, what you guys

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.320
are expecting from some
conversations we had earlier.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.960
But we wanted to
bring Alex in just

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.820
because he would be fine little
bit of entertainment piece

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.350
that would be appropriate
for you guys at Google.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.460
So we thought he was
going to be a little

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.880
nice piece of entertainment.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.440
So Leah, take it away.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:18.940
LEAH: Yeah.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.480
So thank you, Alex.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.820
So we're just going
to run through what

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.480
Clowns Without Borders does.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.730
I'm comfortable
especially since it's not

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.242
the most biggest crowd
I've ever worked with.

00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:30.950
If you guys have
questions in the middle,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.366
you can feel free
to interrupt me.

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:35.370
I'm cool with that, or we can
ask afterwards, or whatever.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.260
So we're Clowns Without
Borders, basically

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.260
no child without a
smile, that's our aim.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.020
This is a picture
of what we're not.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.810
So that's not us,
that's not Alex.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.780
Maybe my grandfather's in there.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.495
But no, he's not.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.650
But to give you a better
idea of who we are is this.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.700
And so we do wear make up
sometimes, and clown noses,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.200
although not necessarily.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.067
Or more kind of a
pedestrian sort of clown.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.650
We find that sort
of more approachable

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.480
in the places that we go and
the people that we work with.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.970
So this is another example more
the kind of clown that we are.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.020
So here's just another picture.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.095
This is basically a
better description

00:11:23.095 --> 00:11:23.970
of what we look like.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.000
So you can see we
still look funny,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.800
but not like creepy funny.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.740
Well.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.555
I don't think any
of them are creepy.

00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:32.430
Maybe like bordering.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.180
It depends I guess what time
of day, or where they show up.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.210
And here's just another
example of who we are.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.910
So we work all over the world.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.240
And this is the South Africa
Clowns Without Borders,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.790
and Diana will interrupt
me if I get this wrong,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.130
but we worked a lot as an
organization in South Africa

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.985
and then in South Africa,
they started their own Clowns

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:58.680
Without Borders.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.170
And so this is them, I
think performing probably

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.630
at a school.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.430
And basically what Clowns
Without Borders does

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.390
is we use simplicity,
surprise, and sanctuary.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.650
So where was this taken?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.191
DIANA: Sudan.

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:16.970
LEAH: This is in Sudan.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.590
And now Diana is going
to talk a little bit just

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.580
about the history of
Clowns Without Borders,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.390
and that kind of thing.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.530
DIANA: So you've seen a
few photos which give you

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.113
a little bit of an
idea of what we do.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.867
We mainly perform for children
living in crisis situations,

00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:32.200
and then also their communities.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.850
So it could be their families,
their caregivers, schools,

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.660
refugee camps.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.630
We'll go into that a little
bit more in a minute.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.420
It was actually
founded in Spain.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.110
Now we're comprised
of nine, and counting,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.030
organizations around the world.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.420
So Spain is where
it started in 1993.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.290
It was founded by a man by
the name of Tortell Poltrona.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:58.590
And he ran the first non-animal
oriented circus in Spain.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.890
And the first trip was to
a Croatian refugee camp,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.290
and it literally started
with a caravan of vans.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.700
They were invited in to come
into the refugee camp in 1993.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.620
And they took a caravan
of vans from Barcelona,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.160
and set up shop and performed
for thousands of people

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.220
at a time.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.580
So the first performances
were actually like this one,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.330
which you can see.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.440
This is actually in Bhutan
but with thousands of kids,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.480
like oceans of children.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.530
And in 1996, Clowns
Without Borders

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.540
was founded by a man
named Moshe Cohen.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.949
He lives out in San Francisco,
where clowns I think

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:36.240
are a little bit more accepted.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.300
Maybe even here
on the east coast.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.330
And now you can see
the list of countries.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.330
And the list is growing.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.570
We're starting up organizations
in Finland, Columbia,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:51.200
Australia, Brazil,
the list goes on.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.820
So our mission is twofold.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.450
We first seek to improve
the psychological conditions

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.880
in crisis situations
bringing humor and laughter

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.820
through volunteers performances
as well as workshops

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.680
with children and educators.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.720
And then we also strive
to raise awareness.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.470
And so that's what
we're doing here today.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.649
So we ask all of our volunteers
when they're not in the field,

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:16.190
because they might only be in
the field for one week or three

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.230
weeks of time
during the year, we

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.860
ask them to promote awareness
back in their home cities,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.360
wherever it may be
around the world.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.579
So my most recent trip
was actually to India.

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:31.370
And I thought it would
put this picture in.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.090
We were actually working
on the construction sites

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.650
where all of the
tech buildings are

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.250
being built outside of Delhi.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.550
Possibly a Google
office, I'm not sure.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.390
But a lot of car
companies, cell phone

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.180
companies, and those
kinds of things.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.420
And we did performances for
the construction workers

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.070
the migrant
construction workers,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.940
and their families
who live there.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.560
So there's these makeshift
schools that are set up,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.570
and day cares that are set up
in and among the construction.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.674
So you have a huge giant
building, 20 stories high,

00:15:02.674 --> 00:15:04.840
and then a little tiny room
where these children are

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.740
educated while they
are living there.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.948
So we would go in and we
would do performances there.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.310
LEAH: So I think the
sort of main thing

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.320
if you want to just
some it up, what

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.120
we do is we promote
laughter, and we

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.270
try to bring levity and laughter
to places around the world

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.490
that we've been invited to.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.560
So we usually go to
a place like we maybe

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.740
have a partnership with
a sister organization

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.360
or something like that, or we
see a need and we go and say

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.010
OK.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.390
There's like maybe
a refugee camp,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.797
or we've been to Haiti
after the earthquake,

00:15:35.797 --> 00:15:37.880
and before the earthquake,
and that kind of thing.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.630
And just try to bring
laughter and levity.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.250
And I guess I personally think
that's really important just

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.260
because it's like
a way to connect.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.545
And I know when
I'm feeling down,

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:47.920
if I could just
have a good laugh

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.972
it's sort of like a little
shock to the system,

00:15:49.972 --> 00:15:51.680
and kind of turns
things around, and then

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.860
I just feel a lot better.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.630
So that's in sum what we do.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.657
And then this is a picture of--
that's Tim Cunningham, right?

00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:01.240
DIANA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.240
LEAH: Yeah it is, on the bottom.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.550
I don't know the
name of who's on top.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.430
But this was just a
little girl, and what

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.990
we were doing Too Highs, is what
we call when you put someone

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.840
on your shoulders.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.600
And I think kind of just
the expression and her body

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.850
language kind of shows at all.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.020
But I think it
probably made her day.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.270
And so now I'm going to show
just a series of pictures

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.890
of sort of a typical life.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.852
What happens when we arrive at a
place to go give a performance.

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:29.060
So sometimes the kids have
been warned ahead of time,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.700
like you're going to have
some performance or something,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.292
sometimes not.

00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:32.750
Sometimes we've
been there the year

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.544
before so they know it kind
of all depends depending

00:16:35.544 --> 00:16:37.710
on the situation, if we've
been there before or not.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.206
DIANA: Can I interrupt you?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.200
LEAH: Yeah.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.100
DIANA: Clowns exist
in every culture.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.340
There's some kind
of jester or joker.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.960
But we are definitely
a foreign idea

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.350
to these kids what we show up.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.260
So when you enter, it helps to
partner with an organization

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.802
like Leah said, but also
the reaction we can get

00:16:56.802 --> 00:17:00.000
can be anything from just
blank stares to what Leah's

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.750
about to show you.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.050
So you never know
what you're going

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.710
to get when you show
up to a location.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.995
LEAH: Sometimes grumpy, but
usually we turn that around.

00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:09.109
That's happened.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:13.069
OK, so here's an example of
more typical of what happens.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.867
So these are kids in school.

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:17.450
They know something's
about to happen.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.903
And then here they come.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.650
And then they've arrived.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.950
So more often than
not, actually,

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.130
what we're doing
is going like push

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.800
back we need space for a show.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.970
But we're usually well
received when we go to places.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.860
And I think well
recognized that like this

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.660
is kind of a time
for relaxation.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.290
Especially in
places where people

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.700
are experiencing an
enormous amount of stress.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.830
And this is a chance
to just let go and not

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.470
have to be in
charge, and not have

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.740
to like think about
whatever the stresses are.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.390
What meal is coming next,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.630
DIANA: Sometimes people set
up ropes for this children

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.940
to stay behind.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.620
And we're always
like no them come in.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.180
But the teachers will set up
ropes and that kind of thing.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.310
Sometimes they are corralled
but it doesn't always work.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.630
LEAH: I've set up a rope
before, I'm not going to lie.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.570
Whoa, it's too many kids.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.380
Keep them back.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.940
But it's such a joy
to be able to just--

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:30.450
this is kind of experiences for
me, been absolutely amazing.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.990
But we have no limits.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.420
We also Clown for UN workers.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.450
So there's a picture
of some UN workers

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.870
that have put on
some clown noses.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.560
And I've been to Haiti
a number of times,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.380
and there's often
UN workers there.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.430
So I wasn't there for
this exact moment,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.620
but had a very similar
experience multiple times over.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.010
So we try to leap over
different boundaries

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.567
sort of regardless
of what they are.

00:18:56.567 --> 00:18:58.400
Basically we're like
we'll clown for anyone,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.441
it doesn't really matter.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.720
DIANA: So because we have
so many organizations

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.610
around the world, we're able
to get into, or be invited

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.890
to so many different places.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.690
And we really try to choose
which country make sense

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.860
to be invited wear.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.669
So Leah's going to
talk about a trip

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:19.710
that she did, but there
was a lot of conversation

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.000
about do we send US
clowns into certain areas?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.870
Is it the safer to
send maybe Spanish

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.130
in certain areas because
of some political issues.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.150
We try to go only
where we're invited.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.680
So usually were working
with a partner organization.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.650
This is an updated
list as of 2012.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.610
We haven't updated it for 2013.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.450
We're working on that right now.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.570
But we've added to this list,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.870
LEAH: A few places.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.200
DIANA: Palestine.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.710
Oh, no, it is on there.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.390
So we've added to this list
a little bit this year,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.550
and it continues to grow.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.550
Unfortunately we're
always going to places

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.151
where there are crises,
and crises keep popping up.

00:19:57.151 --> 00:19:59.150
Unfortunately it probably
will continue to grow,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.950
but hopefully it will
shrink more and more.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.770
LEAH: So, I guess
actually-- I want

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.620
to-- I don't know how to go
back to the previous slide.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.750
Just touching on what Diana
said, and where we go.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.490
We often partner with sister
or other organizations.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.500
But sometimes we go on
trips that we don't.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:26.320
And so we're allowed to go into
areas that the UN says, don't

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.940
go in there, it's too
dangerous and too scary.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.950
And I don't know I guess because
our organizations basically

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.620
run by Clowns, except
for Diana, thank God.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.514
That's why we keep her around,
to keep us on our toes.

00:20:38.514 --> 00:20:40.950
And we're like, oh no one
else is allowed to go there?

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.994
Well, we'll go!

00:20:41.994 --> 00:20:44.160
So I'll show some pictures
of that later and kind of

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.070
go into more depth.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.610
But for me that's been sort
of really an awesome part

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.610
about working with
the organization,

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.364
to have truly no
limits set on that.

00:20:53.364 --> 00:20:54.780
So sometimes there
are limits when

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.260
we're working with a
sister organization,

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.510
like we're kind of
under their umbrella.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.340
So like, no.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.330
No go there.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.980
But often we're sort of just
allowed to go wherever we want,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.590
we do that and
we're well received.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.235
So this is just an example of
like we work with all ages.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.380
But mostly we end up working
with the young and the curious.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.994
And this is Yan.

00:21:16.994 --> 00:21:18.910
And he and I used to do
service work together,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.035
and we've not been on a
Clowns Without Borders trip

00:21:21.035 --> 00:21:22.360
together yet.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.690
But where is this?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.940
DIANA: Indonesia.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.481
LEAH: That's what
I was going to say.

00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:27.920
This is in Indonesia.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.170
This is like sort
of what I imagine,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.190
or this has been my
similar experience.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.000
After a show, kind of hanging
around afterwards and playing

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.500
with the kids one on
one, that kind of thing.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.210
And this picture is
just to demonstrate

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.220
that we work with people
living in all different kinds

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.850
of conditions.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.600
So sort of going off of what I
said earlier that whether it's

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.200
in a refugee camp or whether
it's just an area that's just

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.630
experience of an environmental
disaster or something like that

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.320
regardless of what it
is and where it is we

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.800
try to go there and bring
some levity to the situation.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.230
So just to give
an idea, I'm going

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.563
to show you a bunch of pictures.

00:22:06.563 --> 00:22:09.020
But the kind of places
that we perform,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.850
hospitals, refugee camps, homes,
camps, hospitals, and prisons.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.970
So here is a hospital
that, I think

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.190
this is probably in Haiti.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.500
And we go into community
centers and churches,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.700
and that kind of place.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.860
This is a school setting.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.380
I was on a trip to
Palestine earlier this year,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.750
and we went to school that was
700 girls in a refugee camp.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.700
And so kind of like just
a lot of kids, you know?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.910
We got trampled afterwards.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:43.840
But in a good way.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.980
In a happy way.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.957
Happy trampling.

00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:48.290
If you can imagine such a thing.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.020
There's such a thing
out there as getting

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.680
trampled in happiness.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.990
And then this is an
example of a refugee camp.

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:00.730
And this is another
school performance.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.980
And so something
else that we do is

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.460
we do workshops for kids and
also for their caregivers.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.420
So I've done that work
in Haiti a few times.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.770
So the last trip
I was on in Haiti,

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.370
we were working with
people with Haitians who

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.320
were working in their
community centers,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.930
and so it was kind
of like a trade.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.940
But we were also just
sort of like helping them

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.361
with games and
that kind of thing

00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:33.360
that they could bring to
their community center.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.510
And then they kind of used
us as like advertising.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.140
So we would go to
their community center,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.490
because they were having
trouble bringing in the kids who

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.490
are a little bit older
into the community center

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.500
because it wasn't cool.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.530
But it turns out that
we're kind of cool.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.370
So we went into the
community centers

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.010
and we would put
on this great show,

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.510
and then that would kind of
draw in some of the older kids.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.580
Because in the music
centers they are safer,

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.330
and there is more
opportunity for reading,

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.340
and that kind of thing.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.160
And whatever kind of work
that they kind of saw fit.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.110
And so that was really great.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.360
DIANA: In Haiti we're doing
a lot of work, especially.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.510
We've been working
in Haiti since 2006,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.760
so long before the earthquake.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.040
But since the
earthquake, we've been

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.720
working with folks
who were displaced

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.510
from their original
professions and are now really,

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.010
what we're left with is
rebuilding their communities.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.260
And so that's the
type of community work

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.880
that we're doing,
is teaching folks

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.690
who might have not ever
worked with children before

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.840
except for their own kids,
or whatever it may be.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.290
And teaching and
giving them tools

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.650
to create community
and work with kids

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.820
in an educational setting.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.210
LEAH: So this is those people.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.760
So this, I think, this is
the trip before I went on.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.480
But I know a bunch
of those folks,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.770
so working with the same
people year after year

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.780
sometimes, as well.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.850
So that's building
relationships,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.530
and that's really
fun and rewarding.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.956
So this is-- now these are
just a bunch of my pictures,

00:24:53.956 --> 00:24:55.580
so just going to give
you a little bit.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.495
And again, you can
interrupt me, it's OK.

00:24:59.495 --> 00:25:00.460
I'm Jewish.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.780
That's what we do in my house.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.280
No?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:03.720
OK.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.220
Well.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.160
I thought I read a book once
that said that how it goes.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.920
OK, so this is Saida.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.140
Saida, myself in the
middle, and David.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.632
And this was somewhere
in Palestine.

00:25:18.632 --> 00:25:20.590
I'm not exactly sure
where the photo was taken.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:25.050
But that's why we're
here today, by the way.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.122
Because I teach Stephen
trapeze, and silks,

00:25:28.122 --> 00:25:29.080
and that kind of thing.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.750
Or I try to.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.225
I try my best to
try to teach him

00:25:33.225 --> 00:25:34.860
how to hang from
things by his feet,

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.100
and elbows, and
that kind of thing.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.410
And so I'd talk a lot of
class, or like whatever,

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.530
and so he thought, oh Yeah
let's bring them here.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:55.510
So this is at a school, in
Palestine, the West Bank.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.906
And this is like a kind of I
don't know, sort of-- there's

00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:01.780
a few acts that we do,
I guess you could say,

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.470
that we do on a lot
of different trips.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.090
And going back to what Alex
was saying in the beginning,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:12.540
to this primal talk that
our shows are non verbal.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.440
And so that's why
we're able to perform

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.960
in different parts of the world.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.630
And so we call this copycat.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.400
And basically like I'll bring
up the kid from the audience,

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.510
the other kid just kind of
snuck up because it looked fun.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.230
We let him stay.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.940
But the kid with
the clown nose on,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.300
and I'll put a
clown nose on them.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.050
And I'll just sort of
make some gestures,

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.630
and then the kid will follow.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.241
And then I will do things
like I'll like kick him

00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:37.740
in the butt, or
something like that,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.573
and then when he kicks
me in the butt, which

00:26:39.573 --> 00:26:41.570
is like no, because I'm
an adult, that's funny.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.350
I don't know if you knew
that, but that's funny.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:49.310
And so this is just them
sort of having a great time,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.740
and their peers
love it, and it's

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.610
going to give them a
chance to be center stage,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.568
and that kind of thing.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:03.500
And this is probably one of
the most intense performances

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.400
that I've had.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.040
This is in Martissant
in Haiti, and Diana

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.020
was on a trip that went
to the same location.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:20.090
So to get to this location,
it was like a 30- 40

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:28.080
minute walk uphill with
places where people live.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.330
DIANA: Through people's homes.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.640
LEAH: Yeah, like kind of
through people's homes, and--

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.790
DIANA: Literally ducking
in doorways and windows.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.560
LEAH: Yeah, kind
of going in and out

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.790
to get to this space
that had been created

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.200
probably like by some
other NGO long ago.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.020
And we sort of got
like a little bit

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.830
of the sensation of
being the Pied Piper.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.220
Because as we are walking
up, at first there

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.790
was like two or three kids,
and then there was more,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.450
and then there was
many, many, many.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.980
And people just kind of
stopped what they were doing,

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.580
and they were walking by.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.990
You can see there's some women
in the back, who are probably

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.330
going from one place to another.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.510
I remember this
performance there

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.176
was a guy who had
like just been bathing

00:28:03.176 --> 00:28:06.240
and he was just like in his
towel, watching the show.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.910
This is a rope situation.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.030
We put that rope there.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:15.170
And so I guess this is
just another example of how

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.754
we'll sort of like go anywhere.

00:28:16.754 --> 00:28:18.670
So it took us a really
long time to get there.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.450
We were carrying-- on
this one we did stiltings.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.950
So we were like carrying all
this equipment on our backs,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.946
and just trying to kind
of get to the location

00:28:25.946 --> 00:28:27.820
where there was enough
open space to perform.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.420
And then we just had a
couple hundred people,

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.670
you kind of see, they're
kind of gathered all around

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.550
to come watch the show.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.900
So, you think I
should add to that?

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.550
So this was a kind of
average size performance

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:46.780
and then this was in
Palestine, a much smaller scale

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.580
performance, but still
larger than you guys.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.740
But so this is just
the kids in that town.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.510
And sometimes I guess being
perfectly honest, like oh boy,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.180
like we have to do
this entire show

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.690
but there's like 15
kids or something.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.230
But they end up loving it,
and having such a good time,

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.080
and laughing.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.620
And I'll show pictures
of that in a second.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.170
And this skit is
another sort of go

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.870
to-- not to say that--
but sometimes this

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.880
skit that I guess I've done on
a number of different trips,

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.610
and we call it dead or alive.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:31.150
So in this skit my clown
character ends up dead.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.140
And Saida is like
worried because she

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.640
thinks she killed
me, kind of thing.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.237
And sometimes these
kind of issues

00:29:38.237 --> 00:29:40.570
can be sort of really touchy
because a lot of these kids

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.260
have experienced a lot of
death, and the other issues

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.890
that we might bring up in our
clowning, but they love it.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.409
And sometimes we question,
is that something

00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:52.700
that we should try to bring up?

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.158
But I think it's something that
kind of needs that release.

00:29:55.158 --> 00:29:58.040
Like they need to be able
to laugh at it in some way.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.500
And so I don't know,
I was hesitant.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.460
I'll say the first
time we did this,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.030
are you sure this
is a great idea?

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.710
But it was, and I think it
kind of continues to be.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.400
So--

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.020
DIANA: Yeah, we use it
a lot in South Africa

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.686
where we're dealing with HIV and
AIDS, and where there's so much

00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:13.760
lost in the community
all the time.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.190
And it just allows kids
who maybe haven't expressed

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.599
their feelings about death
to give some expression

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:20.390
because then they'll
start doing this skit.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.120
A lot of times when
we leave the place we

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.434
hear back from the
educators that the kids copy

00:30:24.434 --> 00:30:26.850
exactly what we do and then
they're doing it over and over

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.160
and making their friends laugh.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.170
So it's a well thought out skit,
even though it's about death.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.480
LEAH: Oops, so I
pressed the letter

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.350
b instead of the space bar.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.520
Oh no.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.710
There you go.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.548
OK.

00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:46.964
OK now who's that
smart pants one?

00:30:46.964 --> 00:30:48.751
This guy.

00:30:48.751 --> 00:30:49.250
OK.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.708
So these are just some of those
kids from the slide before,

00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:54.760
and again I guess from the
performers perspective,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.230
you're like oh, there's only 5.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.150
But then you see all
the kids laughing

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.900
and it immediately
becomes totally worth it.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.490
And this is in Haiti,
this is like about a month

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.037
after the earthquake.

00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:08.870
This is David again.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.100
I've been on a few trips with
David, because I like David.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.630
And the kids are
just super happy,

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.880
and just bringing smiles to
their faces is wonderful.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.890
And we were also
really surprised

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.120
at how quickly we
were asked to come

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.609
to Haiti after the
earthquake, because there's

00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:28.400
kind of the first
responders, and obviously

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.858
that takes priority,
and that's why

00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:31.490
we wait until we're
asked to come.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.592
But then there were
we had the experience

00:31:35.592 --> 00:31:36.800
over and over and over again.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.870
We were going to these kind
of makeshift hospital areas,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.320
and a lot of the
doctors and nurses

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.110
who were there,
who had been there

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.290
since the earthquake or a few
days after, we saying this

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.430
is the first time
we've seen anyone smile

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.740
in a month and a half
or whatever it was.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.540
And so I think that is why we're
asked often too come places.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.240
So that's sort of
an acute situation.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.560
But the example is just
that sometimes there

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.344
is that need to sort
of shake things up.

00:32:05.344 --> 00:32:07.260
And I think that laughter
can be very healing,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.230
and that's part of the healing
process and part of connecting.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.160
And so going after
the earthquake

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.420
was definitely in an
intense experience,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.150
but we were so well received.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:25.970
And there was a
little girl who--

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.570
I guess she was found next
to her mom, who have passed.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.180
And had sort of become
mute from the situation.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.389
And we played with her, and
sort of got her to laugh,

00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:36.763
and the nurses
like reported back

00:32:36.763 --> 00:32:38.020
that then she started talking.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.559
So OK, that's like
a beautiful story.

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.100
Doesn't always happen
that way, but I

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.210
think that it kind
of illustrates

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.530
that that's the kind of
thing that we can do just

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.820
through play.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.740
And we have the time.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.000
We go and sort of make time
for that sort of thing.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.780
And so this is also soon
after that same trip.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.720
And just working closely
with the doctors and nurses,

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.560
and we went often like from tent
to tent, or from sort of site

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.610
to site, and put on shows for
just like a handful of people

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.590
and sometimes for people
who had been waiting

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.550
for medical care
for a few weeks,

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.360
and just sort of camped out
waiting for medical care.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.770
And those were bigger shows.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.016
We had a show.

00:33:28.016 --> 00:33:29.890
This is sort of an
awkward experience we had.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.450
They were like oh there
is all this space.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:32.158
That's fantastic.

00:33:32.158 --> 00:33:33.710
Because sometimes
that's an issue,

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.043
especially after the earthquake.

00:33:35.043 --> 00:33:37.176
There wasn't always space.

00:33:37.176 --> 00:33:38.300
And so we found this space.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.020
We're like, oh great, it's
some sort of hospital setting.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.679
Fantastic.

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:42.720
So we like set up the
show, we're doing the show,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.420
everything's going great,
and in the middle of the show

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.619
we hear like Doctor Chang
come here immediately!

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:48.910
And we're like what's going on?

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.560
And like someone's like rolled
through the middle of our show.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.880
And we're like, Oh, we're in
front of the operating room.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.660
That's why the space is clear.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.210
But everyone was
like ha, ha, ha.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.440
We were clearly back then
like oh no, we didn't know.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.330
But it worked out.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:14.909
OK, so this is from the most
recent trip to Palestine.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.699
And for me, this is just about
how situations can be complex,

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.730
to say the least.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:28.040
And this is in a refugee camp,
and these are not real guns,

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.230
these are toy guns.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.310
But many of them have a
laser pointer on them.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:39.480
And sometimes during the shows,
we'd be like, funny skit,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.310
and they'd look down and be
like oh, a laser's on me.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.040
That's uncomfortable.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.960
So they just had
little like pellets.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.030
You know?

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.290
So they're not entitled to kill.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.210
So I tried to like collect
them before the show,

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.590
because I thought like I'll
just feel better about this,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.770
and maybe I'll be funnier
if I'm not thinking

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.384
about this in the
back of my mind.

00:35:00.384 --> 00:35:02.300
And I took this picture
just because I kind of

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.770
thought like this sort of
exemplifies what's happening.

00:35:06.834 --> 00:35:08.500
But I mean it was
useless, because there

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.480
was like way more of them.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.320
It was like the most fruitless
thing I've ever tried to do.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.730
It was like give
me your gun, and we

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.480
don't speak the same
language, that thing.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.760
Instead they'd be like,
BING, and I'd get shot.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.670
But these are the kids
that those little play

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.860
guys belong to.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.450
So they were having
a great time,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.670
and then we gave them
their toys afterwards.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.910
So I suppose we could go
into like what that means,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.580
but I'll leave that for now.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.630
And just say that what
was really important

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.740
is like having sort of the
connection and the laughter.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.150
And just allowing
kids to be kids,

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.230
and allowing the space
for that to happen.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:54.901
This is a picture of child
soldiers, right, in Sudan.

00:35:54.901 --> 00:36:01.170
And so, this is just kids
being kids, having a good time.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.940
And this is back in Palestine.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.840
Some kids stole my
nose, I mean I let them.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.050
And they were playing
with it, collecting water.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.000
And then this is in Haiti.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.520
And this is before
the earthquake.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.440
And this was a kid who had
like a limp for something.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:26.370
It's like an area
set up for boys only.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:31.950
It's basically like
a big cement room.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.450
But it was a place for
kids to go, for these boys

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.660
to go during the day.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.320
And he was being made fun
of a little bit, I think,

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:44.271
just because he had
some physical ailments.

00:36:44.271 --> 00:36:45.770
So we sort of pulled
him in and made

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.637
him the star of the show
for this little bit.

00:36:48.637 --> 00:36:50.970
And afterwards, everyone was
like giving him high fives,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.310
like Yeah!

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.790
So that was sort of
really nice experience.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:01.230
David spins a ball in his finger
and gives it over to the kid.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.782
And we went and so this
place is a really nice place,

00:37:03.782 --> 00:37:05.240
that you didn't
have very-- I mean,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.250
it was really just a
room in the outdoors.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:13.635
But sort of enclosed from the
rest of the outside world,

00:37:13.635 --> 00:37:14.510
I guess a little bit.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.140
That's a nice safe space.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.380
But unfortunately this place
was destroyed just right

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.830
after the earthquake which was
sad and hard to go back and see

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.600
that.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.747
And that's all.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.830
We're just here to tell
you that we need your help

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:35.150
kind of spreading awareness
about the organization.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.020
And this is who we are!

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.285
Clowns Without Borders.

00:37:41.285 --> 00:37:42.410
Do you guys have questions?

00:37:51.164 --> 00:37:52.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.860
Is it just you see that more?

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.840
LEAH: I think it's like sort of
from just experiencing clowning

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.670
and performing, like you kind
of learn like who to go to.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.110
And I mean, mistakes are
made, like that's the truth.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.955
But I think that
sort of the more

00:38:45.955 --> 00:38:47.580
that you do it, you
kind of figure out,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.830
OK this is like a good choice.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.520
I can see from their
facial expression,

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.270
and sort of from the
way they're reacting.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.275
I mean, on our trips,
more often than not,

00:38:55.275 --> 00:38:56.650
we have like
everyone wanting you

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.149
know, like kind of
the first things.

00:38:58.149 --> 00:38:59.880
I want to be up there, too.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.710
Like choose me, choose me.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.470
But I think that's more
of our problem, which

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.740
I think is a good thing.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.970
It's like we can't bring all the
kids up, but cest la vie, life

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.640
isn't fair.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.710
But we do sometimes
a dance I've done,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.210
that like it's kind
of a dance skit.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.405
And we get like a
man and woman up.

00:39:20.405 --> 00:39:22.880
So sort of like, we usually
get like the caretakers

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.560
of the kids.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.134
And sometimes they're
a little resistant,

00:39:26.134 --> 00:39:28.300
like they don't want to get
up in front of everyone.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.341
But we like pull them up.

00:39:29.341 --> 00:39:31.489
But then they always end
up having a good time.

00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:33.530
I mean if someone I guess
if someone's resistant,

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.840
we just back off and
go to the next person.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.480
DIANA: We often sometimes
will find out from a teacher.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.520
A teacher will tell us, please
have that child to come up.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.382
Or don't ask that
child to come up.

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.840
So especially in
places where we're

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.630
going back to where we
worked with them before.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.830
LEAH: Yes!

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.790
More questions.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.517
I like questions.

00:39:53.517 --> 00:39:54.225
More interactive.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:28.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] some
situations just performing out

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:43.640
there to make sure you're
going to stay safe.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.052
and whoever is
governing the area.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:55.840
LEAH: Yeah!

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.735
Could I answer the first part.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.820
One thing I'll say, like I
said like at the beginning,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.430
I was like sometimes
people are a bit grumpy.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.290
So I definitely
been in places where

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.090
there's like some of
the-- it seems to me

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:14.740
like some of the guys in
charge like, hey what's this,

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.250
you know?

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.960
But I'll say that like once
we get people laughing,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.060
the mass majority just
seems to just like it

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.950
right in like those
various I mean usually it's

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.030
more received we were like, YAY.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.690
But in those occasions,
when something like that

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.760
happens, once we kind
of get them laughing,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.800
and we just connect
with them, I think

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.930
that those sort
of, I don't know,

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.230
limitations or those
tensions, just fall away.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.090
They seem to just kind of go.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.550
And everyone kind
of like relaxes.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.070
And I think there's just
this general understanding,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.170
we're just here to
have a good time,

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.190
and connect, and
make people laugh.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:56.820
And then I think it doesn't
feel imposing so much,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.214
as just sort of joining them
and an excuse for a good time.

00:42:01.214 --> 00:42:02.880
DIANA: So to answer
the safety question.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.400
We do put a lot of care
into the safety of things,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.502
and some of the folks
who work with us

00:42:08.502 --> 00:42:10.210
and who maybe aren't
the performer types,

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.810
have worked for like
Doctors Without Borders,

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.915
or we have a war
photographer who

00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:18.340
does a lot of the photography
for some of the shows,

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.010
so we understand the precautions
that we have to take.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:29.090
When we're going into a really
fragile area or a new area like

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.860
say Haiti right
after the earthquake.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.830
So we worked in Haiti
through very kind

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.010
of informal connections
before the earthquake,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.400
and then after the
earthquake, we now only

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.480
go there with a
strong connection

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.031
to an organization
that invites us.

00:42:43.031 --> 00:42:45.030
And we get a safety
briefing before we go there.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.560
We have curfews, we really
don't have much freedom

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.900
when we're traveling around.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.540
It's not like we're going
to eat in a fine dining

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.070
hotel, or something like that.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.420
But we're actually
usually home and really

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.950
exhausted and going to sleep
by 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:04.120
So we're usually not out after
dark and things like that.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.750
If it's appropriate, were
escorted to a location.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.500
The parading through
houses, that actually

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.930
was in Martissant,
and that happens often

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:16.410
and that's because that's what
we were told was going to work.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.850
So we're asking local
people or people who

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.980
have been living in the
communities for a long time,

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.630
how do we promote
everyone to come to this?

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:32.030
Or where is the most
appropriate space to perform,

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.800
is another big one.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.230
Sometimes, I've been
on a couple trips

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.080
where it's actually not safe
for our performers to perform.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.570
So that's something
we always try

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.340
to have what we
call a logistician,

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.010
or somebody like me who doesn't
need to be up there performing

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.260
but is looking over the
clowns, making sure that their

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.320
hydrated, making sure
that they're wearing close

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.528
toed shoes, because a lot
of the places we perform in

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:54.270
have glass all over the
ground, and things like that.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.760
So we take stock of
both the audience

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.495
and being aware
of how much we're

00:44:00.495 --> 00:44:01.870
intruding on their
personal life,

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.161
but we also have to make sure
that the clowns are safe,

00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:05.962
because they can't do
their work otherwise.

00:44:05.962 --> 00:44:08.462
ALEX: I just wanted to add, I
think that's a great question.

00:44:08.462 --> 00:44:12.392
And you do something willingly,
that you've done so many times

00:44:12.392 --> 00:44:13.642
that you forgot to explain it.

00:44:13.642 --> 00:44:17.720
And you break it down into all
these slices that you can use.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.685
So what clowns do, and
what anyone can do,

00:44:23.685 --> 00:44:27.030
is you go in there with
this joyful spirit,

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.550
and present a little tiny thing.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.900
It could be just a little
gesture about a smile.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.426
But you put yourself out there.

00:44:36.426 --> 00:44:39.300
I even did it out there.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.130
This was a little bit of Haiti.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.352
I wouldn't call it a
crisis issues or anything.

00:44:43.352 --> 00:44:45.560
But you're all trying to
make me go out at 12 o'clock

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.310
on a business day.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.270
You all got us
working, you're right.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.610
It's not easy.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.621
But I didn't give up.

00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:52.870
You just put a little bit out.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.600
And the part that
Leah does, and I do,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.225
and anyone that's
been doing it awhile,

00:44:56.225 --> 00:44:59.290
is you pause after the
first three seconds.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.060
Give a little
something, and then wait

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.820
to get the invitation.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.120
And that's breaking it down.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.670
That's news you can use.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.033
That's what you can all do a
little more starting today.

00:45:10.033 --> 00:45:12.650
Is you just put yourself
out there and then wait.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.756
And respond to what happens,
instead of agenda, A, B, C,

00:45:15.756 --> 00:45:19.890
D, I'm pretty sure when
you go into those places.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah we take note
of what the atmosphere is.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.480
So sometimes we show up
somewhere, there's a few folks

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.870
to tell a story
better than I do,

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.910
but sometimes we'll
show up to a hospital

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.562
and a child has
just passed away.

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:34.020
Or we'll finish the performance
and why we were performing,

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.769
a child has passed
away in the other room.

00:45:35.769 --> 00:45:39.477
So we do rely on people
to give us the cues.

00:45:39.477 --> 00:45:41.685
And we do a soft clowning,
we do about loud clowning.

00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:44.101
So there are times when it's
appropriate to come out there

00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:46.861
with stilts and
drums and trombones

00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:48.110
and all these types of things.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.651
And then there's
also times when it's

00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:52.570
appropriate to do just very
quiet clowning and pulling

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.240
a handkerchief out
of somebody's ear.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.340
You know, not even
making any sounds at all.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.406
And that's more like the
hospital type setting.

00:45:59.406 --> 00:46:01.780
And then the loud clowning is
more like the refugee camp,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.780
where you have to make these
giant movements in order to get

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.400
to the 1,000th kid
a hundred rows back.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.110
LEAH: I think sort
of like regardless

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:13.210
of what safety
precautions we do take.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.470
Yes there's sort of
this inherent risk.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:17.570
But I guess I've
always felt very--

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.610
I arrive feeling like
a little cautious,

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.870
but then I think like
one it once I get going,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.760
you just kind of like just feel
what's going on in the room

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.447
or in the space, and
I always feel safe.

00:46:27.447 --> 00:46:29.530
I have to say, I always
feel like Oh I don't know,

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:30.910
everyone's smiling at me!

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:31.750
What could go wrong?

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:35.900
So I mean

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.770
DIANA: It's a good
question, though.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.770
LEAH: Yeah, I think it
is an important question.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.610
And it definitely comes up, and
I think as we go into spaces,

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.220
were like especially
if unfamiliar to us,

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.230
we're like what's this?

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.950
And you just kind of have
to go with it, I think.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.980
But I think also what Diana was
saying is really understanding

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.780
what's like appropriate
for the situation.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.099
And that's a huge,
huge part of it.

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:01.640
And it's the same
thing, like knowing

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.100
who do you pull, or not
pull, or that kind of thing.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:10.295
And I think that just
comes with the people that

00:47:10.295 --> 00:47:12.420
are on the trip, and hoping
that you connect really

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.810
well with your
fellow performers,

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.267
and connecting all of the
people you're working with.

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:17.600
Steven, did you have a question?

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.791
Oh, behind Steven.

00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:20.040
Steven, we're waiting for you.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.364
Like a low priority.

00:47:22.364 --> 00:47:24.447
AUDIENCE: So you imagine
every [INAUDIBLE] there's

00:47:24.447 --> 00:47:26.560
a clown or gesture type of role?

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.872
Do you ever seek them
out or work with them

00:47:28.872 --> 00:47:31.280
or do they come
and see your shows?

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.840
DIANA: Yeah, I think that
we try to do training

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.220
with adults who were interested.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.390
So depending on what
our connections are

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:41.440
to that community, I think
one thing we try to find out

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.160
are like what what's funny.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.990
What triggers funny
in that culture.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:49.250
So it might be that gender
roles is a really funny thing

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.102
to play with because it's
such a regimented order

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.060
or something like that.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.684
So we'll find somebody
in the community

00:47:54.684 --> 00:47:56.650
to help us walk through that.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.430
Like Leah said, we have
a lot of different pieces

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.630
that we do on a lot
of different trips.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.040
So kind of our standard bits.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.330
But every time a
group of performers

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.030
arrive in country,
the performance

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.720
gets tweaked with over
and over and over again.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.210
And it's never the same.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.520
LEAH: So like when the
last trip I went on

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.510
to Haiti, with the folks
that we are working with,

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:24.630
we put some of those people that
you saw one of those photos,

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.330
we put a show on
together with them.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.205
And sort of the hope
was that they could then

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.890
put on their own
show after we left.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:34.480
And so we would sort of improv,
and we created a show together.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.880
And some of the scenes
that they came up with,

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.330
they were just like hysterical.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.860
We wouldn't have thought of it.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.240
Or we did stuff
around like sanitation

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.110
once in Haiti, and
just different things

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.050
in a kind of depending
on sort of what comes up.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:47.902
So, yeah.

00:48:47.902 --> 00:48:49.610
DIANA: The goal of
Clowns Without Borders

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.180
is definitely not to exist.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.200
And for performers in
their own countries

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.640
to be able to be reaching
large amounts of children.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.010
And for their to be no crisis.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.140
Of course, so we wouldn't
need to be performing.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.572
SPEAKER: We have time
for one more question.

00:49:04.572 --> 00:49:05.416
LEAH: Stephen!

00:49:05.416 --> 00:49:06.790
STEPHEN: I don't
have a question.

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.040
DIANA: He was saying
it was a time.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.790
LEAH: OK, is there
any final last

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.260
like really short question?

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.000
AUDIENCE: Where do you teach
him to hang from his elbows?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.180
LEAH: OK, so yes so maybe
I'll spend a minute.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:23.410
So, I teach a aircraft
which is in Somerville.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:28.070
So my day job is it trapeze
coach and aerials whatever

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:33.300
aerials, and also I'm about to
get my Master's in social work.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.850
I'm going to start working
at Children's Hospital

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.520
in the clown care unit, so kind
of more the micro clowning.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.540
Yeah you know, kids need
happiness here, too.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.450
But a different
program, but also cool.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:50.800
And so all the people
that we have on the trips

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.100
are all professional
performers in some capacity.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.912
Some are performers
and something else.

00:49:54.912 --> 00:49:56.620
But everyone is a
professional performer,

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.036
and they all
volunteer their time,

00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:00.850
and we fund raise for
a lot of our own trips.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.450
That's how they're
basically privately funded.

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:06.380
But I teach Stephen at aircraft.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.980
He can hang by his elbow.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.641
DIANA: She's a real clown.

00:50:09.641 --> 00:50:10.140
LEAH: Yeah.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.320
The real deal right here,
and a real aerialist.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.050
Tonight I'll be
performing at the,

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.340
I don't remember
where it is, the arts.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.130
And I don't know.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:19.554
I'm going to do silks
for-- what is that called?

00:50:19.554 --> 00:50:20.720
DIANA: Artists for Humanity?

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.420
LEAH: Yeah, that's the thing.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.250
I'll be there tonight.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.790
I was considering wearing
the weird gold costume

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.700
because it's James Bond themed.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.790
It's a fundraiser for
the Boys And Girls Club,

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.090
and I was like maybe
I should just wear it.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.260
And be like, I got to
go to gig afterwards.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.120
But I didn't go there.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.232
Kind of uncomfortable.

00:50:39.232 --> 00:50:40.440
DIANA: Well, thanks everyone.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.390
I mean we really hope
that you can spread

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.414
the word about
the type of clowns

00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:46.580
that we are, and then type
of work that we're doing.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.038
We think it's
important, that's why

00:50:48.038 --> 00:50:49.590
we volunteer for
the organization.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.090
Thank you.

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:51.390
LEAH: Thank you, Stephen.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.840
DIANA: Thank you,
Stephen and Alex.
