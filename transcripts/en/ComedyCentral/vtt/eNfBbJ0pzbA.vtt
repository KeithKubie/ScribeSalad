I have to just tell you,
I'm, like, a little nervous,

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.033 size:78% position:39%
because I have always had

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.434 align:start size:31% position:69%
(laughing)

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:09.969 align:end position:100%

Uh, Darflyn,

(makes steaming noises)

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.923 align:start position:0%
No, I-- I feel so
awkward in it,

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.959 align:start position:0%
I don't even know
how to sit, like, look.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know--
I sat down,

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.429 size:75% position:38%
I was like, I don't even
know how to sit in it.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:37.697 align:start position:0%
I don't know.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.031
(burlesque music playing)

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:40.900 align:end size:41% position:41%
I don't know
how to sit.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.535 align:start position:0%
How do I sit?

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:45.004 align:start size:34% position:66%
Whoa, whoa,

Ha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.175 align:start position:0% line:83%
But no, I am like

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.175 align:start size:28% position:72%
Oh, yeah?

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.777 align:start position:0%
I usually just wear, like,
sweatpants if I'm home,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.379 align:start position:0%
or my favorite
team's jersey.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.081 align:start size:22% position:78% line:85%
Mm-hmm?

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.081 size:75% position:38%
Or I'm naked, I'm just--

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:58.184 align:start size:47% position:53%

(laughter)

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.055 align:end position:100%

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.297 align:start position:0%

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start size:22% position:78% line:85%

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start size:31% position:69% line:85%
Uh-huh?

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start position:0%

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.206 align:start size:13% position:88%
Wow!

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.807 align:start size:44% position:56%

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.409 align:start position:0%
Ohh! Really?

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:24.744 align:end position:100%
Should I give

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.815
(speaking gibberish)
Should I give her my jacket?

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.150
Should I give her
my jacket?

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start position:0% line:83%
You are such
the best gentleman!

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start size:75% position:25%
I'll give you my jacket.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.654 align:start size:38% position:63%
There we go,
there we go.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.056 align:start position:0%
It's so big on me.

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.126 align:start position:0%
Just like...
(peeping)

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.260 align:start size:47% position:53%
Where'd she go?

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.262 align:start position:0%
"Chivalby" is alive

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:46.365 align:start size:66% position:34%

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:53.506
(glass breaking)

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.141 align:start size:63% position:38%
So, I understand you
just had a birthday.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
Is that, uh...?

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start position:0%
Oh, yes,

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.377 align:start position:0%
that is so true.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.447 align:start position:0%
Okay, this is such a funny

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.318 align:start size:13% position:88% line:85%
Mmm.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.318 align:start position:0%
In Fiji.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.119 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
It's an island!

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
Everybody has to go.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.721 align:start size:56% position:44%
You can afford it!

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:11.791 align:start position:0%
So, they have these
underprivileged dolphins.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.125 align:start size:22% position:78% line:78%
Oh, no.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.125 align:start position:0%
Yeah, this one
dolphin, Windy,

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.994 align:start position:0%
one day we just,
like, locked eyes

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:17.096 align:start position:0%
and he just, like,
went down on me.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.998 align:start size:72% position:28%
Now, did that, uh, make
your boyfriend jealous?

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
My boyfriend--
yeah, right.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.867 align:start position:0%
The only man in my life

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.036 align:start position:0%
is my labradoodle
Eva Braun.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.171 align:start size:50% position:50%
Aw, pretty name.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
I'm told my idea of
a perfect evening at home

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:30.743 align:start position:0%
is just, like, staying
at home and just, like,

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.246 align:start position:0%
baking for my best
girlfriends,

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.616 align:start position:0%
and just, like,
reading comic books.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.451 align:end size:47% position:47%
That's why I'm
so excited...

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.586 align:start size:16% position:84% line:85%
Yeah.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.586 size:84% position:42%
about Baz's "Blade Runner,"

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.089 align:start position:0%
because I've always been
a huge sci-fi freak.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.658 align:start position:0%
I am, like, so embarrassed
to tell you guys this,

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.260 align:start position:0%
but my favorite
movie ever,

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.228 align:start position:0%
like, my favorite movie
of all time--

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.364 align:start position:0%
this is so embarrassing,
is "Star Wars."

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.235
(cheers and applause)

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.570 align:start size:41% position:59%
You know what
that means!

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.572 align:start size:81% position:19%
