00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To me, the answer is 0 for the first one, 2-2=0.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So the first expression is 0 and the second one is going to be 0 as well.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The next one is 1, 1-2=-1. For the second expression, 2-3=-1. -1&lt;i&gt;-1 gives us a 1.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The last one would be 9, -1-2 is -3 for the first expression. 0-3 is also -3 so we get a -3&lt;i&gt;-3=9.&lt;/i&gt;
