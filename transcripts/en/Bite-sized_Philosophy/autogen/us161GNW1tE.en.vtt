surprising because life can be so
terrible that the question of whether or

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
terrible that the question of whether or
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.599
terrible that the question of whether or
not it should exist at all can be a real

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609
not it should exist at all can be a real
 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.599
not it should exist at all can be a real
question but the answer to that is is

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609
question but the answer to that is is
 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.589
question but the answer to that is is
life so terrible that it shouldn't exist

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599
life so terrible that it shouldn't exist
 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.140
life so terrible that it shouldn't exist
well the answer is it depends on how you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
well the answer is it depends on how you
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.140
well the answer is it depends on how you
live it and if your life is so terrible

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
live it and if your life is so terrible
 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.909
live it and if your life is so terrible
that you can't bear it then it raises

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919
that you can't bear it then it raises
 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.470
that you can't bear it then it raises
the question of whether or not you're

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
the question of whether or not you're
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.959
the question of whether or not you're
living it properly and that's not to say

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969
living it properly and that's not to say
 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.899
living it properly and that's not to say
that people don't suffer under burdens

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909
that people don't suffer under burdens
 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.970
that people don't suffer under burdens
that are too great for them to bear they

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
that are too great for them to bear they
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.819
that are too great for them to bear they
