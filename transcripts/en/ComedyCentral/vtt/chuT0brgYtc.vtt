00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.142
Let's talk about outer space.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.810
Hello, I'm Jenny Slate,

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.713
and today
we're going to talk

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:16.249
about Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.419
and their beautiful
cosmic discovery.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.454
This is my dog's...

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:22.688
uh, penis,

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.525
and then I've also
had his balls removed.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.727
- Aw, shame, shame.
- Reggie.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.629
"Give me back my balls."
You can't have 'em.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.098
I took them away!

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.100
But I have a full vagina.
[laughs]

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.101
[clicks tongue]

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.070 line:0%
In 1960,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:42.241 line:0%
Bell Labs made this, like,
giant listening device for NASA.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.077
But then, by the time
they were ready to use it,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.645
a better thing had been built.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.679
So then it was just, like,
by itself,

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.314
all by itself in New Jersey.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.350
A lonely horn.
[sighs]

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.386 line:0%
But two scientists,

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.455 line:0%
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.223 line:0%
they were like, oh, whoa, whoa!

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.658
Hold on, hold on!

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.661
If no one's using that,
could we use it?

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:04.263
They were like,
come on down to the horn.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.232
So they get to the horn.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.502
They're like, we are beautiful
scientists with lovely minds,

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.305
and we want to listen
to the sounds between the stars.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.340
Boink.
They're like, let's go, babe!

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.175
Let's listen up!
[laughs]

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.711
Oh, God, I love thinking of them
calling each other "babe."

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:22.115
So they listen,
and the sound

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.816
is a hundred times louder

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.619
than any sound
they expected to hear.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:31.190
It's like
[imitates static].

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.626
The universe is like...
[imitates static]

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.161
Find out about me!
[imitates static]

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.362
So they were like,

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.532
what is this darn sound?

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:40.867
[laughs]

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.703
It's coming from everywhere
in the sky at once.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.271
Everywhere, everywhere,
everywhere.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:46.272
[imitates static]

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.773
And then they were like, no.

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:49.809
There's no way a sound could
come from everywhere at once,

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.744
so we have to eliminate
all the other sounds

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.479
that might be,
like, interfering.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:56.683
So first they thought maybe--

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:00.753
Someone doesn't care
about science.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.689
They were like, it must be
coming from, you know, New York.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.525
Urban interference, you know.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.260
New York is a city
with buildings and lights

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.228
and people and subway
and blah, blah, blah.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.897
So they were like,
point it there.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.565
[hums]

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.301
Pointed the horn
at New York City.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:16.903
No, that's not
what we were hearing.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.604
Forget about you, New York.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.841
Maybe it's coming
from a military base nearby.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:24.443
And then they just, like,
point it at the military bases,

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.379
but they didn't hear that noise
coming from there.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.182
No, it isn't it.
[laughs]

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.383
So then they were like,
okay, next.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.651
Maybe it's from the sun.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.319
They point it at the sun,
and the sun was like,

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.621
I'm just the sun.
I don't give a [bleep].

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.223
They were like,
it's not the sun.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.725
What the funk is this, man?

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.794
And then they were like,
we should check our device.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:43.596
What if there's something
inside of this thing,

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.866
like, you know,
mold or a skeleton...

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.402
of a hobo that crawled in there
to get shelter?

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.638
[laughing]
Or whatever.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.841
They look inside the horn.
Guess what.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:58.878
This [bleep] thing
is filled with pigeons.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:03.749
Houston, we do have a problem,
and it's pigeons.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.885
[both laugh]

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:09.355
Arno is like,
you do it, Robert.

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:10.690
You [bleep] kill them.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.359
Robert's like,
I don't want to do it.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:14.627
You do it.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.462
[laughs]

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.830
Guess what they did.

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.599
They shot them with a gun.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:20.833
A shotgun.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.268
Then they were like,
well, that'll do it.

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.569
[chuckles]

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:24.604
After they've wiped
the bird blood

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.838
off of their hands,

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.307
they're both like,
R.I.P. these pigeons.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.408
Let's do this.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.311
Boink.
They start to listen.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:33.479
They're like, oh, [bleep].

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:34.880
[imitates static]

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.382
They hear it again.

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:39.418
What the hunk is this
right now?

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:40.953
[both laugh]

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.623
They don't have the answer.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.991
They don't know what to do.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.827
They listen through the horn
for years.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.828
They're going
through their papers,

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.463
their papers, their papers.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.765
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,
I can't get it.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.634
Ugh, ugh,
there's nothing here.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.435
Ugh.
This one's boring.

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.504
Ugh, this is
in another language.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.973
Just being like, we're never
gonna figure this out.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:04.677
Finally, they find a study
done by a scientist

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.878
whose name is Dicke.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:06.912
[chuckles]

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:10.049
He had this crackpot theory
that the universe,

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.786
instead of being infinite,
actually started at some point.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.823
Dicke's like,
13.8 billion years ago,

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.759
aka old as [bleep].

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:20.760
[laughs]

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:21.894
Check your watch.

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:23.529
I think the universe started

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:27.433
with, like, a crazy explosion,
aka the Big Bang.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:28.934
But they had no way to prove it.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:31.404
Then these two guys
from New Jersey

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.472
who have been listening to this
[bleep] pigeon [bleep] horn...

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.474
[laughs]

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:37.710
Call him up, they're like,
we hear this thing.

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:39.045
It's like
[imitates static].

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.579
Have you ever heard of that
before?

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:42.081
He's like, oh, my God.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.316
That's it.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.583
This is
what we've been studying.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:47.620
Cosmic microwave.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:50.923
[sighs]
What is that word?

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.024
What is the word?

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.559
We know it.
What is it?

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:57.463
Cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.898
[triumphant music]
- Okay?

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.601
It's the sound of microwaves

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:03.402
from the Big Bang.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:04.937
[imitates static]

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.005
And they were like,
yeah, that's it!

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.807
This is it!
We got it! We got it!

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.809
This is basically the sound
of the Big Bang.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.944
They wanted to try
to find anything,

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:15.514
but what they found
was the sound of everything.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:17.950
Boing!
[babbles]

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:18.984
I had to unfollow NASA
on Instagram

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:21.921
'cause it made me too crazay!

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.622
It would just be like,

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:26.459
this is a picture
of a [bleep] black hole!

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.060
And I was like, aah!

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.595
[laughs]

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:30.896
Okay, let me tell you this.

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.432
Penzias and Wilson
get the Nobel Prize for physics.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.134
Everyone [bleep] flips out,
and they were like,

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.503
yes, the Big Bang is real.

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.105
It happened.
It's real.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.106
You guys did it.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.475
Penzias and, um...
and, uh...

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.610
Oh, [bleep].
The other guy.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:47.046
I just keep thinking
of Winslow...

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.948
[laughing] But I know
that's from<i> Family Matters.</i>

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.949
(Derek)
Carl.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.684
[laughing]

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:56.555
Carl Winslow
discovered the Big Bang.

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:58.724
Derek, what this is right here,

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:02.561
this is the sound of the echo

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:06.399 align:start size:47% position:53%
of the universe
being created.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.634 align:start size:53% position:47%
[imitates static]

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.170 align:start size:41% position:59%
Suck on that
for a second.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:12.171 align:start size:63% position:38%
See how you like it.

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.774 align:start size:56% position:44%
Just for a second.

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:18.077 align:end position:100%
The universe is like,
just suck on it for a second.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.180
[both laugh]

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:22.415
(Jenny)
I'm the [bleep] universe.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:25.050
Suck on it for a second.

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.519 line:0%
<i> The year is 1963.</i>

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.655 line:0%

<i> I'm not that official.</i>

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:47.940
Right? And so, all these
space missions go off

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:48.874
without a hitch,
and NASA's like,

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.077
We've done really well.
Congrats, NASA.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.580
<i> And they're patting themselves
 on the back.</i>

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:56.715
<i> And Gordo's like,

00:06:56.748 --> 00:06:59.485
<i> Like, that's really cool,
 like, pats on the back.</i>

00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:04.056
<i> But if you want
 to send a man to the moon,</i>

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.092

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:13.632

 Ugh, yeah I guess, Gus.</i>

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.534
<i> Yeah, sure, Gus.</i>

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.136

 - Oh, [bleep], sorry.</i>

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.504
I'm an idiot.
<i> - That's okay.</i>

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:19.972
<i> - All right, all right.
 - You're fine.</i>

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.508
<i> - So, Gordo goes on
 the launch pad.</i>

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:24.910
<i> NASA'd be like,
 Hey, just like, really quick...</i>

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:26.212
<i> Like, don't touch anything.</i>

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.614
<i> NASA would completely control
 everything.</i>

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:30.883
It was so bad that
the astronauts felt like, um,

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:33.118
spam in a can.
- [chuckles]

00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:35.521
- Is what they referred
to themselves as.

00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:37.890
<i> So, anyway, he launches
 into space and it's like,</i>

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:41.994

Okay, good.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:54.607
<i> He gets up into space
 and everything's cool.</i>

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.710
<i> He's like,

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:00.045
<i> Oh, I'm sorry, I wa--
 - You can swear.</i>

00:08:00.078 --> 00:08:01.547
<i> - No, my mom--

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.015
<i> I'm not--
 I'm gonna try not to swear.</i>

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.583
So, he's in space.

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:08.687
<i> He sends back the first TV

<i> He's just having a ball.</i>

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:18.764
So, he takes a nap.

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:22.001
<i> The first guy to ever sleep
 in space.</i>

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.637
<i> He wakes up and he's like,
 It's good to be Gordo.</i>

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.907
<i> And then, he's like,
 Oh, [bleep], no, it's not.</i>

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.676
<i> Because...beep, beep.</i>

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:33.979
<i> Oh...[bleep].</i>

00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:36.082

<i> This doesn't look good.</i>

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.324
<i> And Gus Grissom is like,
 Bro, I love you.</i>

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:47.092
<i> I'm gonna tell your wife
 you're a hero.</i>

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:49.562
<i> Gordo's like,
 No, stop it.</i>

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.965
<i> I'm gonna take control
 over the spaceship.</i>

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:55.568
<i> Gus is like, You're

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.969
<i> no one has ever done before.</i>

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:59.204
And Gordo's like,
Yeah, no, I know.

00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:00.873
<i> So, just shut
 the [bleep] up, Gus.</i>

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.242
<i> I've got control.</i>

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:07.947
<i> He starts to take over
 manual control.</i>

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.016
<i> But, at that moment, he loses
 radio signal with Gus Grissom.</i>

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:13.252
<i> And so, he gets a radio signal</i>

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:15.688
<i> over to his friend John Glenn,</i>

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.724
<i> who's on the recovery boat
 over in Japan.</i>

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:20.192
<i> Then he's like,
 John Glenn, hey.</i>

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.894
<i> It's me, Gordo.</i>

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:25.097
<i> Um, I have absolutely no power
 in my spacecraft.</i>

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.066
<i> And I just wanna get back home</i>

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:29.668
<i> because I'm a really chill guy.
 It's me, Gordo.</i>

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:31.370
<i> And he's like, Okay,
 here's what we're gonna do.</i>

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:33.305
<i> And so, together they go
 through this checklist.</i>

00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:36.675
<i> Uh, put this thing up.</i>

00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:38.310
<i> Like, press this button.</i>

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:40.346
<i> There's all these things
 he needs to do.</i>

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.047
<i> But then Gordo's like,
 Oh, [bleep].</i>

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.151
Beep. And his carbon dioxide
meter's going off.

00:09:46.184 --> 00:09:48.988
And it's like,
Beep, beep, you're [bleep].

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.789
<i> And he's like,
 Oh, my God, you're right.</i>

00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:52.024
<i> I'm totally [bleep] [bleep].</i>

00:09:52.057 --> 00:09:54.893
<i> But I--no, but he's chiller
 than that.</i>

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:56.996
No, hold on.
He's way calmer than that.

00:09:59.097 --> 00:10:02.401
<i> John Glenn, look,
 my carbon dioxide meter's</i>

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:04.970
<i> going off and, uh...</i>

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:06.939
<i> It's like 100 degrees
 in my cabin.</i>

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:09.308
Which means
he's [bleep] dying.

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.977
But he's not being
a Debbie Downer about it.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.913
<i> And he's like,
 I need to get to Earth.</i>

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:18.817
<i> But, like, manual reentry
 had never been done before.</i>

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.386
So, if he enters the
Earth's atmosphere too steep,

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.354
he's gonna blow up.

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:24.123
<i> So, he says, Okay.</i>

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.425
<i> There's the Big Dipper.
 There's the Little Dipper.</i>

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:27.926
<i> Gemini...</i>

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:31.096
He draws an axis
on the window

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:35.034
and uses the constellations
as his constant.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:38.270
<i> And he says,
 This is going to be my angle</i>

00:10:38.303 --> 00:10:39.972
<i> at which I can enter
 Earth's atmosphere.</i>

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.775
<i> Which I think is...
 pretty incredible.</i>

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.743
<i> So, John Glenn is like,
 Okay.</i>

00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:47.246
<i> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six--</i>

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.882
<i> Gordo's like, Let's just,
 like, do it, I'm ready.</i>

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.418
So, he fires, uh...
