one of the big challenges of my life has
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.090
one of the big challenges of my life has
been to kind of break down this barrier

as scientists being somehow the other
 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.850
as scientists being somehow the other
you know being a scientist isn't really

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860
you know being a scientist isn't really
 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.680
you know being a scientist isn't really
a normal way to be a human being and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
a normal way to be a human being and
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.360
a normal way to be a human being and
somehow there are all these judgments

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370
somehow there are all these judgments
 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.010
somehow there are all these judgments
about that you must be very logical or

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020
about that you must be very logical or
 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.600
about that you must be very logical or
you must be very smart whatever that

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610
you must be very smart whatever that
 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.070
you must be very smart whatever that
means and no one ever seems to really

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
means and no one ever seems to really

atoms in your body came from you know

when you learn the stories that you're
 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.099
when you learn the stories that you're
involved in there has to be some

I've learned being an astrophysicist you
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.739
I've learned being an astrophysicist you
know if I ever give people the

know if I ever give people the
 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.119

with me that's entirely wrong there are
 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.460
with me that's entirely wrong there are
days when you know I understand that I

you know we're little collections of
 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.890
you know we're little collections of
atoms that come together and scatter and

sometimes that's incredibly inspiring

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
sometimes that's incredibly inspiring
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410
sometimes that's incredibly inspiring
and sometimes you think about the story

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
and sometimes you think about the story
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380
and sometimes you think about the story
that you're a part of you know the the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
that you're a part of you know the the
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.210

you know it sometimes I hide under the
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.990
you know it sometimes I hide under the
bed and it's given me anxiety attacks

just kind of work out this energy that
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.950
just kind of work out this energy that

ISM and inspiration and I have to say

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
ISM and inspiration and I have to say
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.820
ISM and inspiration and I have to say
that while that balance is sometimes

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
that while that balance is sometimes
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710
that while that balance is sometimes
painful because you're a human being and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
painful because you're a human being and

balance between being part of everything

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
balance between being part of everything
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280
balance between being part of everything
and being so brief for almost nothing

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
and being so brief for almost nothing
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.680
and being so brief for almost nothing
and you have to hold those two things in

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
and you have to hold those two things in
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.890
and you have to hold those two things in
your hands at the same time and

there's no great comfort but the
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.500
there's no great comfort but the
inspiring part is you're part of a story

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510
inspiring part is you're part of a story
 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.750
inspiring part is you're part of a story
that is mind-blowing ly dramatic and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760
that is mind-blowing ly dramatic and
 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760
that is mind-blowing ly dramatic and
beautiful even if you're a brief part

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770
beautiful even if you're a brief part
 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.270
beautiful even if you're a brief part
and so to me the balance tips towards

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
and so to me the balance tips towards
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.890
and so to me the balance tips towards
inspiration some days it's more towards

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
inspiration some days it's more towards
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.140
inspiration some days it's more towards
the knee ilysm but you you take that

the knee ilysm but you you take that
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.550
the knee ilysm but you you take that
little bit of truth and you wrap it up

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
little bit of truth and you wrap it up
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.870
little bit of truth and you wrap it up
and you carry it with you and it never

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880
and you carry it with you and it never
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.440
and you carry it with you and it never
really leaves

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
 
 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.690
