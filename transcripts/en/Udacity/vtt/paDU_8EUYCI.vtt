00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You wake up on a strange heavenly body. You don't know where you are.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Luckily, you have on hand the following information:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You also have a knowledge of physics and plenty of rocks.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Your task is to find out where you are. Are you on earth, Mars, Pluto, Jupiter, or the moon?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, we see that you've plenty of rocks and the reason why this useful is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because you happen to know the fact about yourself.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You happen to know that on earth, the farthest you can throw a rock is 40 m. Not bad.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So you device a scheme, you decide to compare your abilities on earth

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to your abilities on this new unknown location.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You find in this new unknown location, you can throw 250 m. This is the only thing I'll tell you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
From here you're on your own. Can you tell me which planet you're on?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And yes I know, the moon isn't really a planet and some people

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
will try to tell you Pluto wasn't either but don't listen to them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If you're having trouble with this one, because I know this is a very

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
tricky problem, you can go into the forums and look for some help.
