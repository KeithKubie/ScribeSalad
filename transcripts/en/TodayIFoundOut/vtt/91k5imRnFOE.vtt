00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:13.549
The Country Where Its Tradition to Have Kentucky
Fried Chicken for Christmas

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.900
Kentucky Fried Chicken is hardly considered
a suitable place to get one’s food for a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.449
traditional Christmas meal in most parts of
the world.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509
There is one exception, though.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.130
In Japan, it is a Christmas tradition to order
KFC.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.500
So how exactly did Christmas, the celebration
of the birth of Jesus Christ, become synonymous

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.649
with a bucket of fried chicken in the land
of the rising sun?

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.090
Well for one, Christmas wasn’t really celebrated
at all historically in Japan and has only

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.620
relatively recently been adopted.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.880
The Japanese predominantly followed the Buddhism
and Shinto religions, so Christmas was essentially

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.559
adopted from the West and holds little religious
significance to many Japanese, even today.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.359
In fact, Christianity was actually banned
throughout Japan in the 1600s and continued

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.120
to be so until the mid 1800s.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.240
However, during this period, a small enclave
group of Japanese Christians, known as ‘Kakure

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.299
Kirishitan’ (“hidden Christians”) continued
the missionary work of Saint Francis Xavier

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.409
who arrived in Japan in 1549.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.210
The religion, along with Christmas, reemerged
somewhere between 1868 and 1912.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.030
It wasn’t long after that many Japanese
started to mirror Western Christmas traditions

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.310
like exchanging gifts, decorating trees, putting
up lights, etc, even though it was not a national

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.600
holiday in Japan.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.320
So where did KFC come in?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.620
According to KFC, this particular unusual
Christmas tradition is said to date back to

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.970
the 1970s when supposedly a customer at the
chain’s Aoyama store observed that, in a

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.050
land bereft of the customary turkey for a
celebratory dinner, fried chicken was the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.050
next best thing.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.570
christmas-japanThis idea eventually percolated
up to the corporate offices of KFC and prompted

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.060
the company to start a huge advertising campaign
in Japan called “Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!”

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.250
(Kentucky for Christmas!) in 1974, which became
ludicrously popular thanks to this campaign

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.160
and the popularity of American culture in
Japan at the time.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.360
KFC has milked this Christmas tradition in
the country ever since, and even portrays

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.820
their founder and well known icon, Colonel
Sanders, as Father Christmas, dressing statues

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.420
of him outside every KFC in Santa suits….

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.180
Yes, Colonel Santa!

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.650
The custom of eating KFC for Christmas is
so popular in Japan that you’ll not only

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.310
see lines of people snaked outside every branch
in the country at this time, but people even

00:02:44.310 --> 00:03:02.760
reserve their buckets of chicken well in advance
to make sure they don’t miss out.
