00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.020
The phenomenon known as the Renaissance

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.440
is one of the standard stops on any tour through the history of Western culture.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.100
It encompasses a roughly 300 year period in Europe,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.720
where architects, poets and philosophers reconnected with the style and ambitions of ancient Greek and Roman civilization.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.740
The reasons for studying
the Renaissance nowadays are often left a bit unclear.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.040
To the high-minded and
respectful the rationale may seem utterly obvious,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.460
or to the more impatient or technologically focused

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.060
the exercise can equally will appear a complete waste of time.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.340
We believe that the main reason to study history

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.900
is to rescue certain good, provocative and inspiring ideas

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.040
that have been lost in the past,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.940
in order to put them to use in relation to the dilemmas and problems of our own times.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.560
Our tour of the Renaissance while
seemingly about some old long dead guys

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.220
will hence really be about us.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320
Florence, Italy, 1469

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.340
A 20 year-old nobleman from one of the grandest families of Florence, Lorenzo de' Medici

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920
takes over the family business:

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
The Medici Bank,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.380
that's been going since 1397

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.360
and is the most respected financial institution in Europe

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.960
with flourishing
branches in Florence, Venice, Rome and Geneva.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.780
Lorenzo like his uncles and his father
before him has a great gift for business.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.120
During his lifetime, the bank will open new outposts in Basel, Bruges, Avignon, Pisa,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.760
and lend significant sums of money to royal courts, aristocrats and entrepreneurs.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.500
Lorenzo and his family are typical of
the Florentine upper classes of his age

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.820
in honoring the business of making money

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.580
without any of the traditional suspicion of trade found in most Christian societies.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.820
But not only are Medicies interested in making money

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.800
they are also extremely ambitious about
how to spend money.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.079
They believe that the express purpose of what we would now call philanthropy is

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.860
to promote beauty, truth and wisdom in
the world.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.480
Lorenzo de Medici's grandfather had
started the collection of books

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.920
that became known as The Medici Library

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.360
and Lorenzo now expanded it decisively

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
with his researchers scouring Europe's
monasteries, courts and libraries for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.140
lost or overlooked text from antiquity.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.420
Lorenzo was a patron of many
philosophers

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.660
including Marsilio Ficino, Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.580
Under his guidance, these philosophers undertook pioneering researches into Greek philosophy.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.920
They absorb the ideas of Epicurus, Cicero and Aristotle

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.840
and try to harmonize Plato's theories with Christianity.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.800
Lorenzo is perhaps best known as a patron of art.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.700
His court artists included
Verrocchio, Leonardo, Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Michelangelo.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.960
The patronage was extremely intimate and involved.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.260
Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for five years,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.700
dining at his table and participating in
discussions led by Marsilio Ficino.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.920
Although the Medici were quite rich by
modern standards,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.500
their fortune was a relatively moderate one.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.660
Across four crucial decades, from the 1430s to the 1470s,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.500
it's estimated that the Medici family
spent the equivalent of around half a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.280
billion US dollars on intellectual
patronage, architecture and art works,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.620
which is a huge sum by comparison with average incomes but it's not very

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.940
substantial by comparison with the
wealth of the richest people today.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.080
The Medici family resources would be roughly those of Rosa Cafferata whose wealth

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.400
from a fishery business in Peru is
around 1.5 billion US dollars.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
She is at present 1200th richest person in the world.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.560
Lorenzo would seem economically
unimpressive next to Giorgio Armani, 8.5 billion,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.940
and a nonentity next Bill Gates,
79 billion.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.360
Money was important to what Lorenzo and his family achieved no doubt.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.740
So in that respect the world is
amazingly well placed to continue in his footsteps.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.960
There's no shortage of money to do the
sorts of things he did.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.480
But what's holding us back today is a shortage of vision.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.340
For the price of this yacht, Lorenzo fueled the Renaissance for 30 years.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.800
The secret to the Medici's impact was that they didn't see themselves as there

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.000
simply to hand over the cash to allow
artists, architects and scholars to do whatever they wanted.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.160
The Medicies had a
vision, a mission for the arts and for philosophy,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.860
and we're extremely direct
and didactic and putting it forward usefully so.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.240
Guided by his philosopher
friend Ficino, Lorenzo thought of art the kind of education.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.060
Under his patronage, artists were therefore asked to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.360
illustrate key philosophical truths
about say the importance of kindness and compassion.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.040
They promoted serenity and
glorified the best qualities of the state and of good leadership.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.960
The Renaissance would never be remembered if its leading members that simply made piles of cash.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.440
No one cares about that for any length
of time.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.400
The real source of its glory was the imagination and intelligence

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.040
with which its great bankers and finances set about spending their money.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.720
Monastery of Fulda, Germany, January 1417

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.840
An Italian scholar and humanist, Poggio Bracciolini is on a tour of Germany and Switzerland,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.520
looking for lost Greek and Roman manuscripts.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.720
He is spending a few weeks in a
Benedictine Monastery,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.340
hunting around the dusty shelves of its great library,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.560
when in a forgotten nook, he makes one of the great discoveries of the whole Renaissance.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.640
He comes across what still remains the only surviving manuscripts
Lucretius, de Rerum Natura,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.060
On The Nature of Things which gives us the most complete account we possess of the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.120
philosophy and worldview of the Greek
philosopher Epicurus.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.080
Bracciolini and his circle are astonished.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.320
Epicurus has hugely valuable ideas about the human passions, happiness,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.600
religion, communal life and science.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.800
This is only the highlight of a career
spent rescuing lost manuscripts.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.240
In time, Bracciolini is to go on to discover key text by Cicero, Quintillion  and Vitruvius.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.560
When he couldn't by text, he wasn't averse to a little skulduggery to get what he wanted.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.420
He famously bribed a monk to abstract a copy of Livy, the Roman historian

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.060
from the library of Hersfeld Abbey in Germany.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.719
Bracciolini was hugely
interested in classical texts but he was

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.400
not a scholar as we would understand the term,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.800
that is someone who wants to investigate the past for its own sake

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.980
and respects the inherent nobilty of old books.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.940
The Renaissance attitude to history and philosophy was very different.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.040
Its intellectual leaders took a relentlessly practical view of things.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.080
They wanted first and foremost to run their societies successfully,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.700
to make their people wise and to build magnificent cities.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.300
The Epicurean philosophy Bracciolini dog up with its emphasis on

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.420
friendship, simplicity and the acceptance of limitations

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.580
wasn't exciting to him because it was
old, but because its wisdom was still needed.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.620
He wasn't looking for ancient idea so he could fill in missing details about how the past used to be

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.440
perhaps in order to gain a professorship in a university,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.160
Bracciolini was urgently searching for help in creating better ways of thinking for the present.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.220
Central Florence, 1484

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.760
Michelozzo di Bartolomeo one of Cosimo de Medici favorite architects completes the family home:

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.460
The Palazzo Medici, just near the city's
new cathedral.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.180
Michelozzo has studied Roman antiquities closely

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.280
and the building's tripartite elevation beautifully expresses

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.940
the characteristic Renaissance spirit of rationality, order and harmony.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.240
This is a golden age of construction in
Florence.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.120
Leon Battista Alberti has done the
facade of the Church of Santa Maria Novella,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.420
Brunelleschi has put up the Spedale degli Innocenti

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.240
and the city's new cathedral dome

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.200
and many less well-known
names of completing squares, fountains and thoroughfares.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.620
The same is true for the other great
Renaissance cities of Siena, Venice, Urbino, Mantua and Rome.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.880
City fathers across
the Italian peninsula have fallen in love with a remarkable new idea:

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.660
that their cities should be the focus of an unparalleled attention to beauty.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.410
It's slightly embarrassing to contrast
these efforts with our own mess.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.040
A sentimental view says that the
Renaissance city fathers made nice places because they were lucky:

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.060
They didn't need
to plan for cars,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.300
they didn't have the zoning laws and happen to have access to
good quality building materials

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.860
like lovely stone you can get from quarries outside Florence.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.160
However, successful urbanism is never an accident.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.660
For the Renaissance, it was a
philosophical mission.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.960
The Renaissance built such great cities because of an idea:

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.800
that we are to a large extent shaped by the character of the buildings around us.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.640
Making sure that the public realm conveys dignity and calm is more than a luxury.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.300
It can help to ensure the sanity, vigor and happiness of a whole population.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.720
What's more, the urbanists and architects believed in rules.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.580
They didn't think it was chance that a city looks good.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.660
They wrote volumes codifying what works and what must be avoided,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.720
in their efforts to systematize and in their careful thinking about what makes a good street corner, pavement or bench.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.480
They put our own efforts and urbanism to shame.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.040
They believed in ideal dimensions
for squares,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.780
that a square should be small enough

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.760
that a mother can call from an upper window to her child playing at the other side.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.900
They thought that all good squares
should have large elaborate fountains in the middle,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.960
but that the surrounding buildings
should mostly be fairly plain.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.020
They knew that building should be around five storeys in height

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.540
and there should be graceful covered arcades,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.720
so that citizens could amble in all
kinds of weather.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.920
Renaissance leaders like the Medici were marked by the views of the ancient Roman historian Sallust

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.620
who had been deeply hostile to a situation that are developed in the decadent periods of Rome,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.140
where they had been in his words "Publice egestas privatim opulentia",

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.320
public squalor and private
opulence.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.160
Sallust believed and the Renaissance leaders hugely embraced his idea that in a healthy society the

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.660
public sphere itself should be opulent
that is beautiful refined and appealing.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.770
That way the richer people in society
will never be tempted to withdraw and

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.060
concentrate exclusively on their own
private estates and comforts

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.420
and all citizens will be uplifted by pleasing
vision of communal life.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.680
It's a tribute to these efforts that
there are still very few cities on earth

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.720
nicer than those created over a few
hundred years on the Italian peninsula.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.540
But it's also testimony to our desperate
lack of ambition and vision

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.200
that we can count on one hand the number of cities
constructed since the Renaissance

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.940
that are prettier than say Florence or
Venice.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.810
Ideally, we wouldn't have to be so
impressed by Renaissance cities.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:18.780
We'd be inspired to arrival and equal
their achievements in the architectural idiom of our own times.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.840
Frari Church, Venice, 1488

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.860
A 58 year old Venetian painter, Giovanni Bellini

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.600
completes a triptych, featuring in the
central panel baby Jesus and his mother.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.720
Christian artists have been painting
this scene for many centuries

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.300
but things have only become this powerful in convincing in the last hundred or so years.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.660
Hitherto, Mary and her little boy have
looked stiff often gone and wooden,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.660
but with Bellini, Jesus is just like a real
little boy.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.060
A kind we might see looking at seagulls on the Lido,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.120
down to his stocky legs slightly swollen tummy and searching eyes.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.600
Marry feels equally alive, vibrant and
deeply attractive and interesting.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.430
we can imagine her melancholy thoughts,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.840
and Intuit her kind sympathetic and
dignified nature.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.000
If there was some childcare available,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.780
you might be lovely to invite her out to
the gelateria Grom  just a few steps away from the Frari Church.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.640
It's often been remarked how odd and
wondrous it is that so many geniuses of

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.900
art came to the fore in such a short
period in one place.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.320
Renaissance Italy gave world civilization

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.720
Donatello, Frangelico,
Whichello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Leonardo,  Michelangelo, Raphael, Titan and so on.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.140
How did it happen? how do you get so much talent in one go?

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.740
It's arguable that every age has roughly
similar amounts of latent talent among its artists.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.800
What makes certain ages extraordinary,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.880
one thinks of the Golden Age of Athens, Holland, 19th century France or 1960s America

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.660
is that they know what to do with the talent.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.380
They give artist a mission.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.740
They have a clear sense of what art is
for,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.820
and they therefore reward and invest in artist properly.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.540
What distinguishes the Renaissance is
not therefor a freakish preponderance of artistic skill.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.000
It's an intensely clear vision of what
art should be.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.620
The Renaissance could be described as a heroic age of advertising.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.200
Yet the focus was not on selling consumer goods.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.820
It was on selling beauty, truth and
wisdom.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.760
The energy we still feel behind their art arose from a coherent ideological program.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.040
The Renaissance wanted to put painting in the service of ideas

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.680
and to make these ideas palpable, effective and life changing.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.400
One thing the Renaissance was constantly advertising is philosophy.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.260
Philosophers were in the minds of many, then as now rather abstract and remote figures.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.240
So the Renaissance got one of its most talented artists, Rafael

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.900
to lend them a bit of life on the walls of the Vatican,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.960
to shows Aristotle and Plato and others as belonging to a group of glamorous, fascinating individuals.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.560
For his part, Titian was employed to convey a central philosophical message  about the brevity of life.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.160
In his Three Ages of Man, existence is depicted as desperately fleeting.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.060
The child is soon an adult and the adult soon ages

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.160
and in retrospect, it all seems to have occurred incredibly fast,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.740
which makes it essential that we
use our time properly,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.920
that we forgive one another for our frailties,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.160
and focus on our potential while there is still time.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.600
Titian and his patrons knew that
most people don't care to think about how brief life is.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.660
That's where art comes
in and has a huge advantage over philosophy.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.120
Titian starts with things
that everyone in the Renaissance already liked:

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.030
sexy couples and cute baby angels.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.420
The picture is designed to take you
without you even noticing it's happening into an interest in hilosophy

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.600
so that you naturally start to engage with matters of life and death.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.120
The move is a bit like that made by the
best adverts of today

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.560
that hope to get you subliminally interested in buying a
chocolate bar or an SUV

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.940
while charming you with a beautiful couple or sublime
landscape.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.420
Only in the Renaissance the philosophical end goal of art was
worth the effort.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.400
The Renaissance concept of art as
advertising for the great truths was

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.760
underpinned by an ideology worked out by the philosopher Marsilio Ficino.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.040
The figure who taught by Renzo de Medici and spoke to Michelangelo at dinner every day for many years.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.020
Ficino argued that we are all
creatures who love

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.240
and love is attracted first to beauty,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.850
so whatever we wish people to love we
must first make beautiful and beauty is

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.430
first encountered as sexiness.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.860
So the path to the highest possible
human ideals tends to go down a complex root:

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.900
first to sex, then

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.500
to beauty

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.920
and then to love.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.020
With such a theory to hand and its impact on the art of the Renaissance

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.660
cannot be
overestimated.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.820
Ficino was able to use what we might
term sexiness, lust, glamour and celebrity

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.300
to serve the most noble and high-minded intellectual ambitions

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.440
rather than being relegated as they
often are in our own times

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.860
to selling handbags or mobile phones.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:57.000
Never before or since have so many big ideas been so beautifully and often sexually treated by great artists.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.620
Ficino and lorenzo de medici was fascinated by

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.100
the idea of getting Botticelli to engage
our sexuality in order to excite us

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.400
about ideas that they thought were most useful to humanity.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.280
That's why there are an awful lot of
very cute people in Botticelli's work.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.880
The hugely alluring figures in his
Primavera are for example

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.680
thoughtful, kind and serious and sometimes rather sad.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.100
They're filled with tenderness
towards human sorrows and failings and

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.440
a keen to remind us of the need to
appreciate the cycle of life.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.220
They're also highly seductive.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.900
You don't have to believe in the virtues to want to be like them.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.260
But because you
instinctively want to be like them,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.820
you will therefore aspire to be virtuous.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.220
This genius move shared by philosophers like Ficino
rich political leaders like Lorenzo

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.580
and artists like Botticelli was to line up
our basic desire on the side of the good.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.600
So that we become a kinder and sweeter and more intellectually ambitious not

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.920
because we've rejected all the charms of
the world which hardly anyone ever can

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.060
but with the help of all the charms of
the world.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.340
Instead of abandoning beauty and sexiness to vanity and silliness,

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.340
the leaders of the Renaissance, deeply

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.960
scholarly and earnest people, cease these and use them to their own ends.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.140
It's this move above all that helps to
give the art of the Renaissance its mission-driven coherence

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.180
and means the artist still so charming to us today.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.580
In our society the Renaissance has a lot of prestige.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.560
We think we're being true to it by going around its main cities, memorizing dates and taking off key works

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.320
but this isn't really what paying tribute to the renaissance should mean.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.200
It's not about looking at their world through our eyes

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.940
it's about using their eyes to look at
our world.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.680
We should be trying to generate a Renaissance in our own societies with the help of these geniuses.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.640
Learning lessons from them
about how to spend big money

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.060
perhaps earned in finance wisely,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.380
how to use the humanities to improve our lives rather than to impress a scholarly community,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.140
how to devote proper energy to creating livable beautiful cities

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.460
and how to harness the power of art so is to make the good things in the world attractive and desirable.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.940
If rather than being just dutifull tourist we learn to

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.200
absorb the ambitions of our nation's
leaders we might come away from a study of the Renaissance ready

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.100
as all the great Renaissance figures would have wanted us to be

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.400
to do the thing that really matters,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.280
try to change our world for the better.
