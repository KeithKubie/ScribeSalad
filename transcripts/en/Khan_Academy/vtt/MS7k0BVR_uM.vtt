00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.150
We're asked to compute 4,800,
or four thousand eight

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.720
hundred, divided by 80, and then
they want us to check our

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.780
answer, or they say
check your answer.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.480
So I'll first do it just the
traditional long division way,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.500
and then we'll think about if
there's maybe a faster way to

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.920
do this or if we can even
do it in our heads.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.380
So let's just do it the
traditional way first. So we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.460
have 80 and we want to
divide it into 4,800.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.980
Four thousand eight hundred.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.100
Or if we want to know the
terminology, 80 is the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.480
divisor, 4,800 is the dividend,
and in the number

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.230
that we get, the number of times
80 goes into 4,800, we

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.990
could call that the quotient.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.230
I always get confused when I
start using words like that,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.430
so we just think of it as 80 is
being divided into 4,800.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.840
Now, the first thing we say:
Well, does 80 go into 4?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.500
No.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.320
Does 80 go into 48?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.710
No, it's bigger than 48.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.040
Does 80 going into 480?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.260
Well, that looks interesting.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.310
Let's see, 6 times 8 is 48,
so 6 times 80 is 480.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.315
We could do that right here.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.180
80 times 6.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.000
6 times 0 is 0.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.150
6 times 8 is 48.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.800
Or another way you could have
thought about it is 6 times 8

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.470
is 48, and we have this
extra 0 here, so you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.910
add the 0 right there.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.020
So 80 goes into 480 six times,
because we're only

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.820
considering the 480.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.980
We put the 6 right in 480's one
spot, which is really the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.750
tens place, but if you just
think about the 480, it's

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.360
right above the zero.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.520
Now 6 times 80 is-- we already
saw-- 480, and then we can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.830
subtract, and we get the
zero, and we bring

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.090
down another zero.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.710
80 goes into 0 how many times?

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530
Well, it goes into
it zero times.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.140
0 times 80 is 0.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.960
You subtract.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.710
You get zeroes, and there's
nothing left to bring down, so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.630
we're done.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.100
4,800 divided by 80 is 60.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.930
When the dividend is 4,800,
the divisor-- let me write

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.660
these words down.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.090
This is divisor.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.270
This is dividend.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.200
Then our quotient is 60.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.690
Now they want us to check our
answer, so we just have to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.520
confirm that 60 times 80 is
4,800 so let's do that.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.960
60 times 80-- now there's
two ways you can do it.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.190
You could just literally say 6
times 8 is 48, and then it'll

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.320
have two zeroes here,
one, two.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.900
That's 4,800.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.120
Or we could do it by hand.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.090
0 times 0 is 0.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.320
0 times 6 is 0.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.220
Then we'll put a zero
here because we're

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340
now in the tens spot.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.320
Put the zero here.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.820
8 times 0 is 0.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.130
8 times 6 is 48.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.200
Add all of this up.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.570
You get 4,800, so it works.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.170
A faster way would just have
been to say 8 times 6 is 48,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.640
and you have one, two zeroes
here, so one, two

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.430
zeroes right there.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.720
Now, a quick way to think about
4,800 divided by 80 is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.050
to divide both of these numbers
by 10 first. And just

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.090
to think about it this way, what
we're doing, this could

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.230
be written as 4,800/80.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.220
Or this could be written as--
let me write it down here.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:52.130
4,800/80 could be written as 480
times 10 over 8 times 10.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.500
4,800 is just 480 times 10,
and 80 is just 8 times 10.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.890
Now what happens here?

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:13.940
We could view this as being
equal to 480/8 times this 10

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.769
up here divided by this 10.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.200
Now, what's 10 divided by 10?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.829
What's any non-zero number
divided by itself?

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.420
Well, this is just
going to be 1.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.900
10 goes into 10 one time,
so we're just left

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.670
with 480 over 8.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.940
So essentially, you can
just knock off.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.570
You can knock off the same
number of zeroes off of the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.620
divisor as the dividend.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.310
So we knock off one zero here,
one zero there, it becomes 480

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.960
divided by 8, and that's
an easier problem.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.000
8 goes into 480, and you say 8
goes into-- it doesn't go into

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.440
4, so it goes into
48 six times.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.590
6 times 8 is 48.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.920
You have no remainder.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.260
Bring down this zero.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.770
8 goes into 0 zero times.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.190
0 times 8 is 0.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.710
No remainder.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.230
And we get 60 again, so either
way would have worked.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.950
This way is a little
bit faster.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.960
You might be able to do it in
your head, but no matter which

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.690
way you do it, you get 60 as our
answer, and we confirmed

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.390
that it really works.
