00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.860
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.972
When you’re using the patterns of probability
to predict events in your life, it can be

00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:13.940
nice to have some mathematical shortcuts.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.860
That way, when you’re reading People Magazine,
you won’t have to spend so much time sidetracked,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.500
calculating how likely it is that Harry and
Meghan will have 3 boys and 2 girls if they

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.100
have 5 kids.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.720
And you won’t have to pause Willy Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory, right as Grandpa

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.050
Joe starts singing, to figure out how likely
it is that you could have found one Golden

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.560
Ticket by opening 4 chocolate bars.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.140
Today, we’ll introduce you to some of these
shortcuts so you can get back to the movie.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.780
Before we start today, heads up -- these shortcuts
are equations.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.940
And we try in this series not to spend too
much time plugging numbers into equations,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.150
but today we felt like we kinda needed to.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.760
Because understanding these things is important.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.700
So to sweeten the deal, we added some zombies.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.280
INTRO

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
You’re in your kitchen, making a piece of
toast with your old toaster--which has seen

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
better days.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.170
You’ve figured out that each time you make
a piece of toast you have a 20% chance of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.979
being shocked--not lethally, but painfully.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.700
Alright so maybe it’s time to get another
toaster.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.200
But you haven’t had a chance.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
Anyway you eat toast every weekday morning
(you eat pancakes on the weekends), and you’re

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.399
wondering how many shocks you’ll get this
week.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.610
It’s a stressful week and you’ve decided
that toast is only worth the risk

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.020
if you’ll probably get shocked only once.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.140
You know the multiplication rule of probability,
so you can calculate this.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.799
There are five different ways you can receive
only one shock this week: you either get shocked

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.270
once on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
or Friday and then remain shock free on the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.210
4 other days of the week.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.579
If we represent a shock with an X and a non-shock
day with an O, the possibilities for your

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.020
week look something like this.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.429
Now we need to calculate the probability of
getting one shock and four non-shocks using

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.740
the multiplication rule.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.889
Let’s look at the probability of only getting
shocked on Monday.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.221
The probability of getting shocked is 20%,
so the probability of not getting shocked

00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:16.280
on Tuesday is 80% and similarly on Wednesday
through Friday there’s an 80% chance each

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.110
day of not getting shocked.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.480
So the probability of getting shocked on Monday
and not on Tuesday-Friday is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.080
0.2 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = ~0.082.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.140
That’s about an 8.2% chance that you’ll
get shocked on Monday and not for the rest

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.570
of the week, so now we've got to calculate
the rest of the one-shock options.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.890
The probability of getting shocked only on
Tuesday is the same, about 8.2%, since order

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.090
doesn’t matter in multiplication.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.240
The probability of the Monday-only option
or the Tuesday-only option or any of the remaining

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.200
3 options can be calculated using the addition rule.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:07.500
You have 8.2% + 8.2%+ 8.2%+ 8.2%+ 8.2% also known as 5 x 8.2% chance of just one shock.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.260
That’s a 41% chance of getting shocked only once this work week, so you decide to risk it.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.720
That was a lot of work just to figure out
whether it’s a good idea to have toast,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.460
and thankfully there’s a more compact formula.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.360
The formula, called the Binomial Distribution formula, takes the math we just did and simplifies it.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.100
In our toast example, we first figured out
the probability of only getting shocked once.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.020
To do this we multiplied each day’s probability
together.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.460
Let’s use exponents to make this formula
a little bit shorter.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.020
We can combine all the 0.2s and all the 0.8s to give us this.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.600
That’s about 8 percent..

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.840
Notice that the two exponents add up to 5--the
total number of days.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
This formula works for finding out the chance
of getting shocked only once, but we can also

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.820
use it to find out the chance of getting shocked
another number of times.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.230
In general the formula looks like this:

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.040
For example, the probability of getting shocked
only on Tuesday and Wednesday would be this.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040
= ~0.02 or 2%

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.170
We also need to account for the number of
ways that getting shocked once or twice in

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.580
a week can happen.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.960
To do this, we’ll use a very useful formula--the
Binomial Coefficient Formula--from a field

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.400
of math called Combinatorics.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.009
The Binomial Coefficient formula makes it
easy for us to find out how many ways a certain

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:28.020
ratio of successes--not getting shocked--to
failures--getting shocked, can occur.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.740
In a general form, it looks like this: (n-Choose-k)
but you also can read it as “we have n things,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.319
count the number of different ways we can
choose k of them”.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.639
For our toast example (5-Choose-1 is 5).

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.300
That is there are 5 different ways we can
only receive one shock from our toaster this week.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.360
The math behind this snazzy formula uses a
lot of factorials which are the product of

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.960
an integer and all the integers less than
it, and looks like this:

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.969
You remember factorials because they’re
the ones that look like they’re always shouting.

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.330
See those exclamation marks?!

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.770
We won’t dig into this formula here, but
for more information, we’ll link some resources

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.770
in the description.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.600
Now we have all the pieces of our binomial
distribution formula, let’s put them together.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.960
First the Binomial Coefficient which tells
us how many ways we can have one shock and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.250
four non-shocks, and then our shorthand multiplication
of probabilities.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.020
We put it together and we have a full blown
formula for calculating the probability of

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.569
getting shocked on one out of five days this
week, about 40%.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.229
It took us a while to get here, but we now
have a general formula for calculating any

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.879
similar probability.

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.849
If p is the probability of our event happening
then here’s our formula:

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.250
For example, supposing that there is an equal
chance of having a boy or girl, if we want

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.720
to find out the probability of a couple having
3 girls out of 5 children, we can simply plug

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.819
our numbers into the equation.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.699
We do that and we see there’s about a 31%
chance of having 3 of their 5 children be

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.300
girls.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.500
And now we get to the zombies: it’s the
beginning of the zombie apocalypse and you, thankfully, still

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.759
have your brains.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.909
But there’s a bunch of people between you
and the nearest shelter, and you want to know

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.340
how likely it is that none of them have been
bitten and infected with the zombie virus.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.720
Since you can’t always tell if a person
is infected right away, you decide to use

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.880
your binomial probabilities to calculate your
chances.

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.219
It’s early stages, so right now there’s
only about a 5% infection rate in the population.

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.330
That means the probability of someone being
a zombie is about 5%, and the probability

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.860
of not being infected is still about 95%.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.060
Peeking out at the crowd that stands between
you and the shelter you count 20 people.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.000
Plugging these numbers into our formula, we
can see that there’s about a 36% chance

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.539
none of the people you’d encounter on your
run to safety will try to eat your brains.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.579
Those are pretty good odds, and you’re fast.

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:52.789
You know that you could probably safely reach
the shelter even if there were one or two

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.860
zombies, so let’s calculate those probabilities
as well.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.409
There’s about a 36% chance of meeting no
zombies, about a 37% chance of having only

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.650
one--easily dodgeable-- zombie, and about
an 18% chance of having to out maneuver only

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.249
two, that means that cumulatively, that’s
about a 91% chance that you’ll be able to

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.040
sprint your way to safety.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.460
We could calculate the probability for every
possible number of zombies from 0 to 20.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.509
If we did that, we would get the discrete
distribution for this specific type of problem

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.379
where there are 20 events, and the probability
of the event of interest--here, the zombie

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:31.530
infection rate--is 5 %.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.400
But in a more general sense, I also want to
know how many zombies I would expect to confront

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.310
on average - just so I could prepare.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.680
I could try to guess the mean by looking at
the graph of the binomial distribution for

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.689
all of the possible cases.

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:49.219
Just by eyeballing it, I’d say the mean
of this distribution is around 1, and it is!

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:54.839
The actual formula to find the mean of a binomial
distribution is n--the number of events we’re

00:07:54.839 --> 00:08:00.099
looking at--times p--the probability of what
we’re interested in, the probability of

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.129
being a zombie.

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:05.099
Since the probability of being a zombie is
5%, it makes sense that on average, about

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.059
5% of any population will be zombies.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:14.900
Since we have a group of 20, we expect about
5% of 20--or 1--zombie infection on average.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.180
While zombies are probably not on your day
to day list of concerns, this kind of calculation

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.180
might be.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.439
Important public health issues such as the
spread of pandemic-level viruses can been

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.619
modeled using a similar approach.

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:32.510
We could just as easily calculate the probability
that of the 40 people you shook hands with

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:37.820
at that Zombie Apocalypse meet-up, 2 or fewer
had the cold that has been going around.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.000
Or we could calculate the mean number of cold
infected people you could expect to shake

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.090
hands with at any given meeting.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:50.070
If the probability of having a cold at that
given moment in the population is 20%, the

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.899
probability of only 2 or fewer people having
a cold is only about 0.7%.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:01.220
From the binomial distribution with 40 people
and a 20% chance of having a cold we can see

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.290
that it’s MUCH more likely that more than
2 people will have the sniffles, in fact you’d

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:12.320
expect 20% of 40 --or 8 people--to have a
cold at any similar meeting with 40 people.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.550
A special case of the Binomial Distribution
with only one trial--or just one event, a

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.920
single coin flip, for example--is called the
Bernoulli Distribution.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.550
It represents the probability of of getting
either a success or a failure.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.800
Our outcome--x--can either be a 0 (failure)
or a 1 (success).

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.310
The general formula for the Bernoulli distribution
where p is the probability of success is this.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.240
And by plugging in 1 or 0, we can see that
the probability that our outcome is a success

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.949
is p, and the probability of a failure is
(1-p).

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:51.010
For example, if the probability of rolling
an odd prime number ( 3 or 5) on a single

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:57.720
dice roll is about 33.33%, then the bernoulli
distribution for rolling a prime number would

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:04.000
be the probability of rolling an odd prime
to the x power multiplied by the probability

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.319
of not rolling an odd prime to the one minus
x power.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:16.050
When x is 0--a failure-- then the probability
is 1 minus one third or around 66.66%, and

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.640
when x is 1--a success--the probability is
around 33.33%.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.020
Though relatively simple, the bernoulli formula
is a useful building block.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.640
For instance, you can think of the binomial
probabilities that we did as many bernoulli

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.270
trials one after another.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.220
And in reality, that’s what they are!

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.140
Alright let’s get back to the zombies.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.120
Things have gotten much much worse.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.160
Zombies are everywhere - you’re injured
really badly.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.680
You need a blood infusion and need so much
blood that you’ll need some from all 3 of

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.750
the people around you, luckily you’re type
AB positive so you can get blood from any

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.880
blood type, but you have something else to
worry about: the latent zombie virus.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.269
All three of your buddies seem okay, but you
heard on the radio the population now has

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:02.779
a 30% infection rate.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:07.579
So there’s a 30% chance they’re infected
with the zombie virus and are just asymptomatic.

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:12.930
Luckily, the human immune system can handle
the virus in very small doses, so you’ll

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.580
be okay if at least two thirds of the blood
is clean.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.610
What are the chances you're gonna survive
the infusion?

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.040
If someone has a latent zombie infection,then
the bernoulli trial would have one success

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.230
and zero failures, giving this formula for
the trial:

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.690
Which as we expect, means that there’s a
30% chance that this one random person has

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.790
a latent zombie infection.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:40.050
And every person who is not infected is considered
to be one failure and 0 successes, which has

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.930
a 70% chance, based on this bernoulli formula:

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.259
We can use different combinations of these
two bernoulli formulas and multiplication

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:52.180
to figure out the probability that you’ll
remain uninfected after your much needed blood

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.180
transfusion.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.830
You’ll be fine if no one has any latent
zombie virus, and we can calculate the probability

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.290
of that happening by combining three successful
bernoulli trials.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.610
And this looks a lot like the second part
of our binomial formula, because it is!

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:12.850
A 34.3% chance of survival is kinda low, but
don't forget you’ll also be okay if only

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.700
one person has a latent infection, in other
words two successes and one failure, which

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.250
we can combine like this.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.000
And there’s three ways this could happen
(any of your three friends could be infected)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.720
so theres a 3 times 14.7--or a 44.1% chance
that only one of your friends will be infected.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.880
Combining the 44.1% chance that only one friend
is infected, with the probability that all

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:44.029
their blood is zombie virus free, we can see
that there’s a 78.4% chance that this life-saving

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.579
transfusion will go your way.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.800
You’re not going to be a zombie… probably.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.440
These two formulas are shortcuts to help us
spend less time calculating, and more time

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:56.780
applying probabilities to our lives.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:02.540
These concepts also allow us to see how probabilities
of a single event can give surprising results

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.110
when we combine a bunch of them.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.690
For example let’s say the probability of
NOT having a flat tire each year is 95%, meaning

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.519
there’s a 5% chance that you’ll get a
flat tire.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:18.690
But over 15 years, that’s only a 46% chance
your tires are going to stay inflated, that

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.220
means there’s a 54% chance of getting a
flat tire at some point.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.680
We don’t see the world as just one event
at a time - many things are connected; So

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:33.120
having the tools to think of many probabilities
together is important.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.240
Thanks for watching.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.600
Stay zombie virus free, and I’ll see you
next time.
