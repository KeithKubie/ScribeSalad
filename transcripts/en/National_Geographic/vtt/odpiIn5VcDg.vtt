00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.000
There's drafting-- something
we know about in NASCAR

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.166
and other very fast races.

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.467
But there's also
drafting in cycling.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.000
It's crucial in cycling.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.166
In Tour de France--

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.300
So somebody in
front of you, you

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.633
can get an advantage from that.

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.000
You certainly can.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.900
The energy that you need to
expend reduces up by maybe 30%.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.133
So I asked Lance about that.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.533
Let's see what he
says about drafting.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.700
So let's talk about drafting.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.967
OK.

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.867
It's one of the most
important parts of the sport.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:31.300
So presumably there's
some speed below which

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.467
drafting is not useful.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.467
Right.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.734
That would be like
one mile an hour.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:36.533
No--

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.000
Anything more than--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.867
Anything more than stationary.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.667
Keep in mind that the speed
is important to talk about.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.367
But the wind is-- if you
say 10 miles an hour,

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.800
that's not very fast.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.967
But if the wind is 50
miles an hour in your face,

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.667
10 miles an hour is pretty fast.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.700
So your draft-- it's just--
it goes up exponentially.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.266
The more intense the wind is,
the direction of the wind,

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.400
right?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.667
Obviously, if it's
right in front of you,

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.867
you stay right behind the
rider that's in front of you.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.000
If the wind is
from the left, then

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.967
you inch over to the right.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:06.767
Oh, OK.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:07.567
OK.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.667
So you just find--

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:09.800
this is why I say NASCAR.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.467
You find that sweet spot
of where that draft is.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.967
And then, of course, that
just gets multiplied.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.633
If there's one rider in front
of you, you have a draft.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.734
If there are 100
riders in front of you,

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.633
you're not even pedaling.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.333
So Max, first,
this sounds like--

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.333
it sounds lazy, first of all.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.100
Oh, yeah.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.166
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.100
And diabolical,
because you're exploiting

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.767
the energy of the leader.

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.166
So then why does
anyone lead the race?

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.734
Because that's their job.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.266
Because their team leader
may be behind them.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.800
So they may be a domestique,
one of these servants,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.467
to go out the front, to
take the brunt of the wind

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.900
so the people behind,
their team leader,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.433
can save their energy
by slipstreaming.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.567
Now, what if the servant wins?

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.333
[laughter]

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.233
That's good.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:56.900
That doesn't happen, Scott.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.133
That doesn't happen.
- Come on.

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:58.934
No, no, no.

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.400
No one's ever gone rogue?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.300
People go rogue on one day.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.500
But the next day,
suddenly, they find they

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.767
don't get out of the caravan.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:06.900
[laughter]
