Vsause Kevin here it's comedy week here at Youtube and I was just wondering

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.480
Hey Kevin where do you want all this stuff (laughter)

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.160
Why do we laugh when someone falls

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.380
why would you laugh

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720
he's gonna tell us

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.240
Well according to William F Fry founder of Gelotology which is the science of the effects of laughter

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.200
the fall happens in a play frame

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.420
This is a real life event in a non-serious context

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.460
because if Tod fell off the empire state building the results would be mortally threatening quite serious and not very funny

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.480
but if he's just casualy walking trips and falls that creates the play frame

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.260
in which I know he's not going to be hurt and I can safely laugh at him

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.140
well why is laughing the response?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.920
laughing is thought to be a way of releasing cognitive energy

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.000
our brains are constantly analyzing calculating and trying to predict whats going to happen next

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.380
so if someone tosses you a baseball you can compute where to move your hand to catch it

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.280
so laughter might just be a release of the energy of our thoughts

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.800
okay but why is laughter such a common and universal response to someone falling

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.280
falling is an incongruity to a typical and boring event like walking

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.860
its a sudden outcome that we didn't expect and as long as the person is okay

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:37.260
then our energy as the observer gets burned off or released in the form of laughter instead of say panic or concern

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.060
and that reaction might not be societal or culturally influenced  at all

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.000
so someone in China or Georgia or Iceland would all laugh at their friend falling down

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.280
because it might just naturally be in our brains to react that way

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.580
inside our brains some Neurologists have observed mirror neurons

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.860
these are neurons that fire inside an observers brain that mirrors those of someone else performing an action

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.180
so in the case of somebody falling down

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.680
your mirror neurons would actually make it feel as if you were the one falling and flailing and feeling silly

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.220
instantaneously recreating the brain activity of the person who's actually falling

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.400
stimulating you physiologically

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.180
tickling your brain

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.840
now without a lot of research on mirror neurons that are some doubts regarding their roles or even their existence

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.000
but the fact remains: laughing is good for you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.420
and not just in obvious ways like reducing stress but in physical ways like benefiting vascular health

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.880
laughing is in our blood

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.200
so check out some funny videos during comedy week exercise those laugh muscles

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
and as always...

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.940
hmm a banana peel

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.740
thanks for watching

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.920
(laughter) where do you want these two bottles of water huge pile of napkins and plates
