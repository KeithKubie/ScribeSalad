00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.486
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:43.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:44.330
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Wow.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
That was fun, wasn't it?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.010
Good afternoon.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.510
Hello.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.800
Hello, everyone.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.840
All right.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.460
I am Purnima
Kochikar, and my team

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.010
has the privilege of
working with apps and games

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.710
developers globally.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.490
The animation you just saw is
inspired by the amazing content

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.360
you create which gives people
superpowers and helps us move

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.240
the mobile ecosystem forward.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.950
Thank you.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
Before we jump into
what's new on Google Play,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.630
let's take a moment to look
back at the amazing growth we

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.140
have seen since we
met at I/O a year ago.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.310
You heard at the keynote
that Android and Play are

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.710
being used by increasing number
of users around the world,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.490
and it is now active on two
billion devices monthly.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.820
And an astounding
82 billion apps

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.400
have been installed from Google
Play in the last 12 months.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.610
This is translating into more
developers finding success

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.230
on Google Play.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.390
In the last year
alone, the number

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.140
of developers with more than one
million installs grew by 35%.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.460
This is phenomenal and
makes me truly happy.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.784
Give yourselves a very big hand.

00:03:15.784 --> 00:03:19.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.320
We are also investing
to enable everyone

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.800
to pay for your apps and
games using forms of payment

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.126
that they prefer.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.970
For example, Americans
prefer credit cards,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.130
Japanese prefer DCB, and
Germans prefer PayPal,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.640
and Brazilians prefer some kind
of a prepaid method like gift

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.330
cards which gives them
control over their payments.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.800
The sheer scale of our payment
platform that you see behind me

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.080
continues to amaze me.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.190
As a result, we are seeing
that increased number

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.220
of people paying for your apps
and games than ever before.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.740
In the last year alone, the
number of new buyers on Play

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.950
grew by 30%.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.800
In particular, we are
seeing great traction

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.620
for the subscription
business model.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.530
The number of subscribers
grew by 2x plus

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.490
year, with 62% of the
subscribers telling us

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.210
that they use their app
at least once a day.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.750
Beyond payments, we're also
investing in capabilities

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.970
to help you reach more
users in more ways.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.360
The Play Store is now
available on Daydream VR

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.570
and on Chromebooks that
allows you to reach users

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.760
in interesting new ways.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.590
Last year at I/O, we previewed
Android Instant Apps.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.010
This allows your users to
get access to your apps

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.850
without the hurdle of
having to install the app.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.530
We are very grateful
to many of you--

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.480
I can see you in
the audience here--

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.430
who worked with us to make
that vision a reality.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.760
And today, we open up Android
Instant Apps to everyone.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.120
I hope you'll all
start working on them.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.100
And yesterday, we
previewed Android Go,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.600
which is our optimized version
of Android for emerging markets

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.740
devices.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.960
As you know, there
are billions of people

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.460
in emerging markets
who are coming

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.800
onto mobile for the first time.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.780
Please take the time
to look at the Building

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.930
for Billions guidelines to help
you build for these devices.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.120
Above all, we are taking
into account quality

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.010
in every decision we are
making on the Play Store.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.010
Through programs
like Early Access,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.980
we are bringing you dedicated
and highly-motivated

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.750
23 million-plus people who
are willing to test your apps

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.030
and give you feedback
while they're still

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.950
in development before you
put it up for production.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.080
We are engaging with
indies around the world

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.070
to find the best quality games,
and we're showcasing them

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.050
on the Indie Corner.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.940
And we are also taking
into account engagement

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.270
in all our algorithms
that shape our top charts.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.460
And today, this evening, we will
host the second annual Google

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.200
Play Awards.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.800
We will be celebrating
the best of the best,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.160
acknowledging great
quality in apps and games.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.990
I hope to see you there.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.040
Please come.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.390
Be inspired.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.000
And come to celebrate what
makes great apps and games.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.350
So, just as your apps are
giving people superpowers,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.460
our engineering
and product teams

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.780
are working on capabilities
to give you the superpowers

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.180
to succeed on Google Play.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.100
So are you ready to see
what they've been cooking?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.520
You can do better than that.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.200
All right.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.980
Put your hands together for
Matt Henderson, group product

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.960
manager.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.010
MATT HENDERSON: Thanks, Purnima.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.010
Hi, everybody.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.250
So in your organizations,
who else besides you

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.520
cares about the
success of your app?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.690
Who else contributes to
the success of your app?

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.010
A lot of people, right?

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.045
In a variety of roles?

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.790
Well, have a think about who
else in your organization

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.880
should be using
the Play Console.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.360
When we started the
Console five years ago,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.070
it was a means to get an app
from a to b, from developer

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.840
to the phone.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.980
But over the years, it's
become much more than that.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:16.610
With a variety of users
and a variety of features,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.000
the Play Console is
playing a much broader role

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.570
in the success of your app.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.930
With more features,
the user base

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.350
has broadened to different
roles and new organizations.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.640
Our users now are
product managers.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.179
They're marketing managers.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.710
They're test engineers.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.730
And of course, they're
Android developers.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.070
So think about who else
in your organization

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.310
should be using
the Play Console.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.920
Now with that growth in
the variety of features,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.740
UI design needs to
keep things organized.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.160
So in addition to talking
about features today,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.200
I wanted to touch on the UI
look and feel of the Console.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.180
You may have noticed
some changes.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.480
We've launched a new
cleaner and clearer material

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.630
design-based Play Console.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.050
And it has a new name.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.780
The Play Developer Console
is now just the Play Console.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.390
This reflects the fact
that, although all

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.825
of your organizations
develop apps, not all of you

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:23.120
are developers.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.580
The user base is getting
more and more diverse

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.160
as we're playing a
more diverse role

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.620
in the success of your app.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.800
And early feedback
about the UI suggests

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.320
we're on the right track, such
as this from the e-commerce app

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.180
Zalando.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.690
The redesigned Play
Console is more intuitive.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.270
It's more structured.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.980
It's more convenient.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.070
But of course, in
addition to a new design,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.800
we've been hard at work
with new functionality.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.150
So here are some highlights
of launches from the past 12

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.990
months.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.970
There's been features to help
app quality, like beta testing

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.220
and the pre-launch report.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.120
There's new tools to
manage the release process.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.020
There's also new reporting
and pricing features

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.990
to help you identify and take
advantage of opportunities

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.050
to grow your business.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.350
And now, at this
I/O, we're announcing

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.410
important new and
updated features

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.220
in all of these areas that go
even further at helping you

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.370
create high-quality
app experiences, that

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.400
go even further helping you
mitigate risk in the release

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.290
process, and they
go even further

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.410
in helping you to
achieve business success.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.990
Now I'm going to hand over
to some more of the team

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.140
to give you a snapshot of each
of these different features,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.080
starting with Fergus,
product manager from the Play

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.704
team in London.

00:10:52.704 --> 00:10:59.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.246
FERGUS HURLEY: Thanks, Matt.

00:11:01.246 --> 00:11:02.620
Who here wants to
know the secret

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.185
to get a five star
app on Google Play?

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:05.685
OK.

00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:08.170
Great, I came to the right talk.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.930
We did machine learning over
all the Google Play reviews,

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.870
and what we found is that 50%
of all the one star reviews

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.820
are talking about
stability issues.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.440
So if you want to
increase your star rating

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.840
and reduce the number one
star ratings for your app,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.670
the number one
thing you can do is

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.700
focus on stability
of your application.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.530
Then once you fix
those stability issues,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.779
what do you do to be able
to increase your star rating

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.390
to that golden five stars?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:40.930
Well, you focus on design,
usability, and speed.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.070
Yesterday in the keynote, you
might have seen Android vitals.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.260
This is our initiative
at Google to help

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.720
you to understand the
performance and stability

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.270
of your applications.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.940
We've had hundreds of
millions of users who've

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.060
opted in to share their
device diagnostics and usage

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.600
data with Google so that we
can be able to help partners

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.180
like you be able to
provide better experiences.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.190
We're now giving you that
data in an aggregate fashion

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.570
so you can be able to
understand your performance.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.030
We're starting with
three performance areas--

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.404
stability, battery,
and rendering.

00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:18.070
We're going to be
expanding to many more

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.600
over the course
of the next year,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.660
and so stay tuned for those.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.000
Now, as we expand more and
more performance areas,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.190
there's a lot of data to
be able to understand.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.750
How do we simplify it for you?

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.210
Well, we're introducing this
concept of bad behaviors.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.000
Bad behaviors are when your
app falls in the lowest

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.860
25% of apps for that metric.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.800
And if you are in
the lowest 25%,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.730
we'll flag you as
being in the lowest 25%

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.400
and you'll be able to understand
that you should prioritize

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.620
fixing your app in that area.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.050
So the first area is stability.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.200
This is all about providing a
robust and stable experience

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.710
to your users that is reliable.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.650
There are two performance
metrics within this area.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.610
The first is your ANR rate,
or Application Not Responding

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.110
rate.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.810
This is when your app freezes
for more than five seconds.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.240
Second area is crash rate.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.530
This is when your application
closes on the user.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.560
The second performance
area is battery.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.490
So this is where your app is
using the radios or the CPU

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.670
unnecessarily.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.460
And the two performance metrics
that we're focused on here

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.150
are stuck wake
clocks, so this is

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.150
where you hold a wake
lock for more than an hour

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.400
when the device is
supposed to be idle.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.981
And the second one is wake ups.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.480
This is where you're waking up
the device more than 10 times

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.900
per hour when the
device is idle.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.960
The third performance
area is rendering.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.230
So this is providing users with
that silky smooth experience

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.840
on their device so that
they feel like your app is

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.470
responsive and fluid.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.690
The two areas that we have in
this metric are slow rendering,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.390
so this is when
50% of your frames

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.080
take more than 16 milliseconds
to be rendered so you're not

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.320
achieving that 60
frames per second

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.680
that users expect
from their device.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.070
And the second one
is frozen frames.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.890
This is where 0.1%
of your frames

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.910
take more than 700
milliseconds to be rendered.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.285
This is where users can actually
really feel that there's

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.040
a lag in the application.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.370
Both of these are shown in
the Play Developer Console

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.920
alongside all the other bad
behaviors that I mentioned.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.220
So you can go to the
Play Developer Console

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.110
as of right now, and
you can be able to see

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.580
this data for your application.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.190
And then you can be able to
focus on improving those core

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.910
metrics.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.740
For each one we provide links
to developer.android.com,

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.330
which gives you
help articles of how

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.640
you can be able to fix
these issues yourself.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.150
Finally, if you don't care
about your star rating, which

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.070
I'm sure most of
you do, we also have

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.660
other reasons why you should
care about this performance

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.290
area.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.873
We're starting to
use this performance

00:14:57.873 --> 00:15:01.210
data in the promotability
in the Store itself.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.070
And other things
that we're going

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.390
to talk about later on today
at 5:30 in a talk on the top 10

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.890
things to improve the
stability of your application,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.770
you can be able to
learn more about how

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.770
we're improving the Play
Store to be able to use

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.360
this performance data.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.290
Now I've talked a lot about the
field data with Android vitals.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.390
Now I'm going to welcome
Riccardo on stage who's

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.030
going to talk about how you
can be able to understand

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.530
the performance of
your application

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.588
before you launch it.

00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:30.968
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:33.350
RICCARDO GOVONI: Thank you.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.080
Hi, everyone.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.670
It's great to be here today.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.760
Today, I want to talk
to you about the Play

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.630
pre-launch report.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.910
The pre-launch report
summarizes issues

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.790
that are found when testing
your app against a wide range

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.870
of devices.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.820
We launched it last year
in the Play Console,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.700
and you can find it there today.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.110
Pre-launch report
actively contributes

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.390
to the success of apps, and
already thousands of you

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.210
are already using it
to create better apps.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.650
And I want to mention a few
updates that we have about it.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.690
The key aspect of
pre-launch report

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.820
is app stability testing.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.175
We use a robot crawler to
automatically test every APK

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:13.830
that you upload to
alpha or beta channels

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.180
in the Play Console against
several physical Android

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.110
devices.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.500
The robot tells you if
it encounters any crash

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.890
during a five-minute crawl,
which means that you can then

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.070
fix the crash before it reaches
production and your users

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.970
will not leave a one star
review because of that.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.780
In the past the year, pre-launch
report has seen great momentum.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.860
Over 58% of Play top apps
have opted in into using it,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.460
and we have conducted over
6.5 million robot crawls

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.580
across hundreds of
thousands of APKs.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.990
But the number that I like best
is not this one, but this one.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.440
In 85% of the cases when
pre-launch report found

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.780
a crash, the app
was not later pushed

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.870
to production, which means
that millions of users

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.700
have not experienced
crashes that

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.239
would have otherwise affected
them, which is pretty nice.

00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:08.030
So we continually
improve pre-launch report

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.069
to make it even better.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.300
For example, to allow the robot
to explore more of the app

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.990
with data that you
control, you can now

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.030
provide test credentials
that the robot

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.920
will use to pass
through login screens

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.670
and explore more of the app.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.099
Pre-launch report
automatically scans your up

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.610
for vulnerabilities and privacy
leaks using the knowledge

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.130
of Google's own security teams.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.050
Over the last year
we added new scans,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.270
and now we detect over
30 different types

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.640
of vulnerabilities
and privacy issues--

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.080
from using obsolete
libraries that

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.540
have known issues to
linking identifiers.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.210
Pre-launch report also
capture screenshots and videos

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.680
during the crawl.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.567
We improved the way we captured
them and we collect them,

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.900
and we now take into account
the structure of your app--

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.483
such as the activities
that's composed

00:17:55.483 --> 00:17:57.290
of and the transitions--

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.290
to better cluster the
screenshots intelligently.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.500
And this gives you a
better view at a glance

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.750
of how your app looks like
across its various parts, which

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.500
is great for spotting visual
inconsistencies in your app

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.230
look and feel.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.520
But this is the one
that I like the most.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.170
We added new
devices to the farm,

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.190
including the Google Pixel
running on Android O Preview.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.390
So that means that
without any work,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.930
you can check how your
app performs on Android O

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.080
and be ready for when it
launches later this year.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.840
So you can go and upload an APK
right now to the Play Console

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.890
in alpha in beta, and
there's a good chance

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.630
that by the end of
this talk you get

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.340
a sense of how your app
performs on Android O.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.570
Or at worst, it
might take an hour.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.347
So this is all I
have for you today.

00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:44.930
I hope the pre-launch
report gives you

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.660
that sense of amazing
security that other developers

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.130
like Playdemic are
already finding on it.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.130
And I would like now to
introduce on stage James

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.450
Smith, project manager on Play.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.550
Thank you.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.940
JAMES SMITH: Thanks, Riccardo.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.910
Hi, everyone.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.060
As Android developers, one
of the most important things

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.690
you have to look after is your
app sign-in key because you're

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.200
app sign-in key ensures
the security and integrity

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.340
of your app.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.540
Lost the compromised keys
can be a very serious issue.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.700
Your private key is
required for signing

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.380
all versions of your app.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.140
If you lose or
misplace your key,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.590
you will not be able to
publish updates to your app.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.170
Your only option would
be to publish a new app

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.810
under a new package
name and ask all

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.580
of your users to move across.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.430
This would be obviously
a terrible experience.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.240
So that's why we're very
excited to be launching

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.740
Google Play app signing.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.370
If you join this
program, Google Play

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.560
will manage your
key on your behalf

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.400
and sign your app before
delivering it to users.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.600
It's really easy to get started.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.060
First, you securely upload your
app sign-in key to Google Play.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.990
That means it is now
safe on Google servers

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.280
and you don't need to
worry about balancing

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.360
security and convenience
of access to your key.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.700
You can even delete it.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.610
Now, to make sure that
updates to your app

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.760
come from you, the
authorized developer,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.990
any new APKs you upload will
be signed with an upload key

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.260
that Google uses to
verify your identity.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.740
The upload key can be reset,
which avoids the key loss

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.850
scenario I described earlier.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.800
We've had several
partners using Google

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.500
Play app signing for a
while, and the feedback

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.290
has been really positive.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.300
Here, Robin Hood speaks
to the layer of safety

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.630
that we've added, while at the
same time all but eliminating

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.190
the worry of having
lost or stolen keys.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.170
Now, once Google
Play signs your app,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.860
we can go one step further,
and we can provide optimization

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.890
services at your request.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.800
The first optimization
we've decided to focus on

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.240
is making apps smaller.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.380
We know that developers
care about app size

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.050
because users do.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.480
APK size is correlated
with download success

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.640
and with uninstall rate.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.560
Looking at APKs, we can
see that developers include

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.980
native libraries and different
architectures and drawables

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.590
for different screen
densities so the apps look

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.680
and run their best
on every device.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.160
But this means that a lot
of the contents of an APK

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.710
is unnecessary for every device.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.900
If I have a phone with a 32-bit
architecture and a HDPI screen,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.140
then I only need the
contents of the boxes

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.400
in blue in this diagram.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.710
And the rest in
green is completely

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.960
unnecessary for my device.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.650
With app optimizations,
Playable delivered

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.380
just the right content
for each device.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.250
You give us a universal APK,
and we will automatically

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.040
create optimized APKs
for different devices.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.070
We're just getting started
exploring this area,

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.030
and it's still early.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.550
But we've tried
this out with apps

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.190
that were in our
Early Access program,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.940
and we expect the average
signing to be about 15%.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.630
However, some apps have
seen better results.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.280
Deliveroo was 33% smaller
after optimizations.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.460
And the 7 Minute Workout app was
nearly a half smaller, at 48%.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.920
So when can you
get these benefits?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.730
Well, app signing
is available today.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.460
We are trialing app
optimization in beta

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.200
with a few partners
at the moment,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.710
and we hope to widen the
beta in the near future.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.570
If you are interested
in optimizations,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.120
please enroll in
app signing today.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.500
And if you'd like to find
out more about these topics,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.620
please come to our talk at
2:30 this afternoon on stage 1.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.430
Thanks.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.310
I'd now like to invite Mike, the
engineering manager on Google

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.620
Play, to talk about
device catalog, which

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.728
is also available today.

00:23:12.728 --> 00:23:22.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.880
MIKE DAVIS: Thanks, James.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.970
So as we saw at the
start of this talk,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.390
the Android ecosystem is
seeing significant growth,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.790
and this is in part
due to the diversity

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.660
of Android devices with a
range of different capabilities

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.880
and price points.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.370
We hear that you love the
reach that this brings.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.370
But understanding
this device space

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.640
and targeting the right
devices can sometimes

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.040
be a bit of a challenge.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.500
And so to help
with this, we have

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.990
launched a new device catalog
section in the Google Play

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.490
Console.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.440
Using everything that
we know about Android,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.230
we've gone from this
long list of device codes

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.470
to a rich, full-featured
device catalog.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.150
Looks pretty awesome, right?

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.460
So what can this do for you?

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.380
First of all, we provide
detailed device specs including

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.700
RAM, system on chip, GPUs,
screen size and OS version

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.030
for every one of the
thousands of Android devices

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.440
that are certified by Google.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.920
We also group these
devices into models

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.810
and allow you to drill
down to understand

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.230
the variations between them.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.020
To help navigate
this device space,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.350
we provide search and filter
options, allowing you to slice

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.900
and dice the catalog by
various device features.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.050
For example, you can
use this to quickly

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.540
find all SDK level 24 devices
with the Snapdragon 810 SoC.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.800
Or, as you see here, all
devices manufactured by Google

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.356
with more than 2 gig of RAM.

00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:03.730
And as you may
have noticed, this

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.830
is more than just device specs.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.760
With any filter we also
provide key metrics

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.700
for how your app performs
on these devices--

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.670
such as installs, average
ratings, and revenue.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.850
In addition to this, we've also
introduced another new feature

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.940
we call device exclusion rules.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.220
This allows you to
exclude your app

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.780
from a specific targeted set
of devices using key device

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.970
performance indicators.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.610
For example, if you're
developing a rich graphics

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.060
game, you could use this
to only target devices

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.880
with more than a gig of RAM.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.730
You could also create
a rule to exclude

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.390
all devices with a
particular system on chip.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.100
This can allow
you to temporarily

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.800
prevent deployment of
your app to a specific set

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.870
of problematic devices
until you can push a fix.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.870
Whenever you create
an exclusion rule,

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.840
we will always show you which
devices will be excluded along

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.030
with installs and
any metrics to help

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:12.510
you make this important
decision with confidence.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.950
As you can see,
Space Ape Games have

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.160
found a great way of
incorporating these new device

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.255
tools to reduce costs
and improve KPIs.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.260
To hear more about
this new device catalog

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.380
feature along with other
release management tools,

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.450
you can check out the
recording of this talk that

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.000
was presented yesterday.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.170
Also, please swing by the Play
Console Sandbox area in dome C,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.630
where myself and other
engineers from the Console

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.200
are available to give demos,
answer questions, and hear

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.350
your feedback on this or
anything else relating

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.440
to the Google Play Console.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.080
And with that, I'm going
to hand you over to Suzanne

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.660
to tell us about even more
new ways we have to help

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.382
you release with confidence.

00:26:56.382 --> 00:27:04.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.990
SUZANNE VAN TIENEN: Thanks,
Mike, and hello all.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.200
I will walk you through
the release dashboard

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.741
which we launched yesterday.

00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:13.490
You want to make sure
that your production

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.492
release is successful.

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:17.450
We've always been ahead
of the curve with tools

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.460
to prepare greater releases.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.950
Think about the
pre-launch reports

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.960
that Riccardo discussed
earlier and our alpha and beta

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.580
channels.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.590
But now, we also
give you the data

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.380
to monitor your
production rollout,

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.700
out of the box without
a need for an SDK.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.860
This data is offered
in low latency,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.360
and it can help
you make decisions

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.840
about your rollout sooner
and with more confidence.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.617
Let me show you
a few highlights.

00:27:45.617 --> 00:27:47.450
When you push the new
release, you obviously

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.340
care about crashes.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.650
We give you absolute
numbers as well as

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.030
crashes per 1,000 devices to
put those numbers in context.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.610
The default view
shown here offers

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.370
a comparison between
your current release

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.320
and the aggregate
of all app versions

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.720
that you have in production.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.430
If something does
look off, you can then

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.200
go straight to the
crash clusters page

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.000
to see if you introduced
any new crashes.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.080
Releases aren't all
about crashes, though.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.330
You also want to see
ratings and reviews that

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.660
are specific to
your latest version.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.730
When the rating for
your latest version

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.580
is significantly lower than
that of your overall rating,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.280
you may want to start looking
into your one and two star

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.280
reviews to see what's
going on, and possibly

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.240
even halt your release.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.020
But what if you can
also see install events?

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.340
Broken down by new
installs and updates,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.510
this can tell you whether
enough users update

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:50.220
to your new version to push your
rollout onto the next stage.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.880
And think about the power of
knowing how many uninstalls

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.390
came from updated devices.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.520
Are you losing
existing customers

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.790
because your latest version
isn't performing well?

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.040
Play has these numbers
for you out of the box.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.360
So I encourage you
to think about what

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.830
makes a healthy release.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.730
Your crash tool may warn you
if you have a huge spike.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.170
Your PM may panic if
your ratings tank.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.600
But what about subtle
but significant changes

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.367
across metrics?

00:29:24.367 --> 00:29:26.200
Would you ever notice
if you didn't see them

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.935
all in one place?

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.590
And to empower your decision
making even further,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.040
we also let you
compare your release

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.580
against a previous
release of your choice.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.740
This gives you
even more context.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.862
You don't only have
your crashes and ANRs.

00:29:44.862 --> 00:29:46.570
You don't only have
the impact that these

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.900
are having on your ratings
and then your uninstalls.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.180
But you can also see
how these metrics

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.680
compare to a previous release
that you considered successful.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.760
All in one place, all within
hours of your really starting,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.950
helping you minimize
the time a bad release

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.290
spent in production.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.560
So next time you roll
a new version out,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.980
monitor it with the
release dashboard.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.680
It just the new top most item
on the release management.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.230
And now over to Preston,
engineering manager,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.210
to talk you through the
new statistics pages.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.526
Thank you.

00:30:20.526 --> 00:30:26.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.530
PRESTON JACKSON:
Thanks, Suzanne.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.146
Hi, everyone.

00:30:30.146 --> 00:30:31.520
We've been hard
at work this year

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.737
addressing your top
requests in Play statistics.

00:30:33.737 --> 00:30:35.570
I think you'll be quite
pleased with what we

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.820
have to share with you today.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.700
I'd like to introduce the
new Play statistics page.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.204
From this snapshot,
you can start

00:30:44.204 --> 00:30:45.620
to feel the magnitude
of effort we

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.860
put behind the stats experience
since last I/O. Right now,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.760
I'll briefly touch on just a
few of my favorite features.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.670
First, let's drill down
into date selection.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.540
As you can see, we still
have the preset date ranges.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.270
But these presets are not
sufficient for our app

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.970
and business needs.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.320
So I'm happy to say that we've
added a custom date range

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.780
selector to let you choose
the period that you're

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.300
most interested in.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.700
Next, we know that
many of you manually

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.520
compare data in the Console
with data from previous time

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.480
periods.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.550
We've made that
process much simpler

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.260
by plotting a
comparison time period

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.290
right alongside your
selected date range.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.160
This allows you to easily
see period over period trends

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.260
that will highlight the
impact of releases, marketing

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.920
campaigns, and even
public holidays.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.180
But time periods aren't the
only thing we want to compare.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.700
Now in the Play statistics page,
you can select multiple metrics

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.530
to compare at the same time.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.320
When you can easily
compare related metrics,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.410
such as crashes and ratings
or installs and revenue,

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.840
you can start to uncover
relationships in your data

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.830
that are specific to your
app and to your market.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.370
The last thing I'd like
to mention is hourly data.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.710
We're introducing
new stats to help

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.960
you understand the behavior of
your app throughout the day.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.310
This knowledge will help you as
you plan time-sensitive events

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.990
such as releases.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.750
But to me, the most exciting
part about hourly data

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.700
is that you won't have
to wait until tomorrow

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.890
to start to see data for today.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.040
I think you'll agree
that we've made

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.000
Play statistics more useful to
help you build successful apps.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.540
I've only touched on a few of
the things that we've added.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.250
I'd invite you to come
and join us in the Sandbox

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.620
to talk about more.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.730
With that, I'll hand
it over to Tamzin,

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:38.540
our business development lead,
to talk about User Acquisition.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.939
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:42.939 --> 00:32:44.230
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Thanks, Preston.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.600
So once you're confident
that your app's health

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.030
and performance
is optimal, you'll

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.431
probably want to drive new
valuable uses to your app,

00:32:58.431 --> 00:32:58.930
right?

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.140
Well, in my job, I talk
to developers every day.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.630
And they tell me
how critical it is

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.520
to understand how effective
their marketing channels are

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.660
at acquiring and retaining
new and valuable users.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.710
They tell me they need more
data to make the right decision

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.960
about where to spend
their money and where

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.080
to spend their time and effort
in optimizing their growth

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.810
strategies.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.330
Since last I/O, we
launched two improvements

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.940
to the User Acquisition
report to make

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.050
this area of the Console
even more useful for you.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.600
Now just to remind you,
the User Acquisition report

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.830
shows you how many users go
to your Store listing page.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.470
Of those, how many
people install your app?

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.580
And of those, how many
people buy, and buy again?

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.670
So the first improvement
was that we added country

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.480
to the User Acquisition
traffic breakdown.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.650
And this is really
critical because we

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.700
want you to expand and succeed
and reach those two billion

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:08.109
monthly active Android
devices around the world.

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:10.150
Now this report is great
because it will show you

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.750
where the unrealized opportunity
is so that you can prioritize

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.810
your international expansion.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.840
The second improvement is
that we added peer benchmarks.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.040
Now this lets you see how
your app conversion compares

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.530
to similar apps in
the same category who

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:29.570
monetize in the same way.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.326
Now this is available both
in the Acquisition report

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:33.409
and in the country report.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.310
So it lets you see obvious
areas for improvement.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.739
It lets you see areas to further
invest through Acquisition

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.620
and lets you celebrate
your team's success.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.199
Now I'm pretty confident
that most of you

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.900
here care about building
long-term customer

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.909
relationships, right?

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.190
So today I'm really
excited to announce

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.770
version 2 of the
Funnel, especially

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.650
for businesses like yours who
have a strong focus on user

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.270
retention.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.550
It shows retention
periods, which

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.950
are a critical metric
for understanding

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.240
which channels are bringing
your most loyal users.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.090
And this is your
retained installer base.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.060
It shows you the opportunity
to increase retention

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:24.280
using notifications and email
or increasing your app quality.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.590
So from today, you'll be able
to identify which channels

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.600
are bringing you your
most valuable users, which

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.880
countries they're
coming from, and you'll

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.460
be able to identify the
opportunities you have

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.520
to increase your install
and [INAUDIBLE] conversion

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.850
and increase your
use of retention.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.320
Now all of these reports help
you optimize for your growth

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.070
strategies, not
just for installs

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.070
but for long-term
business success.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.140
So regardless of the
way you monetize,

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.180
we have an acquisition
report that can

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.340
help you grow your business.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.100
Now if you want to learn more
about this or the release

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.510
dashboard or the
new statistics page,

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.060
you should come to stage 1
at 1:30, right after this,

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.770
and watch "Making Data on
Google Play Work for You."

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.090
So come and see us.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.250
Now to tell you more
about improvements

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.410
we've made to reviews,
I'd like to welcome back

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.392
on stage Fergus.

00:36:19.392 --> 00:36:27.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:28.180
FERGUS HURLEY: Great.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.930
So I'm back again to
help those people who

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.513
had their hand up
earlier about trying

00:36:31.513 --> 00:36:32.910
to get a five star app on Play.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.540
We've made radical improvements
to the whole ratings

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.972
and reviews section on the Play
console over the past year.

00:36:38.972 --> 00:36:41.430
I'm going to tell you some of
those improvements we've made

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.471
and we've just announced.

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:45.170
So one thing we announced
at Google I/O last year

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.700
was reviews analysis.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.820
This enables you to be able to
see the topics that people are

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.910
talking about in your
reviews on Google Play

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.520
and prioritize which
topics are having

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.250
the largest negative
and positive impact

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.207
on your rating in the store.

00:37:00.207 --> 00:37:01.790
You've heard from
developers that they

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.998
are using this to be able
to prioritize their feature

00:37:03.998 --> 00:37:04.790
development.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.950
And we're now expanding
to other languages,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:11.720
so you can be able to understand
what people in geographies

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.460
that you have your
app available but you

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.500
don't speak the language are
saying about your application.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.420
So the second most popular
language on play is Spanish.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.870
And as of yesterday, we
now have Spanish topics

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.570
available in reviews analysis.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.790
And a major market for
developers on play in Japan.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.360
So we also now support
Japanese topics.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.610
This is where we are putting
Google's machine learning

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.010
to work for you to be able
to understand your users

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.010
and what they're saying.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.440
A limitation on the
Google Play reviews

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.750
for developers over the
past couple of years

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.150
has been that, when users
update their reviews,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.420
you were only able to see the
latest update of their review.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.880
Now we're enabling it to be
able to see the full review

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.330
history of the reviews that
that user has left for your app

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.180
unless they completely
delete their review.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.915
This enables you to be able
to have a fluid conversation

00:38:01.915 --> 00:38:03.790
with your users and
be able to communicate

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.340
with them effectively.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.600
So once you start
engaging with your users

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.350
and you start responding
to their reviews,

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.690
how do you understand if it's
actually working for you?

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.060
Well, we have updated
rating section.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.700
This is where we show you
what is the change in rating

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.100
for reviews that you've
responded to versus ones

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.330
you haven't responded to.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.490
And what we see
is that developers

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.500
are seeing major results
in improving the star

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.500
rating of their app by
engaging with their users

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.479
because users in general
update their rating

00:38:31.479 --> 00:38:33.770
to a positive rating as a
result of engaging with them.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.740
Finally, another
improvement we're

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.130
making to the reviews
area is the ability

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.140
to be able to flag
reviews that have passed

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.930
through our first
level of flagging

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.870
that we do internally
of reviews, where

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.720
if you think that one of
the reviews that is posted

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.360
on your app does not match
our posting guidelines

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.150
and has been filtered through,
then you can be able to flag it

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.730
and we'll do another
manual to review, check,

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.610
and evaluation of that review
to be able to determine if it

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.080
matches our posting guidelines.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.820
And if it doesn't,
we'll remove that.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.599
This has already been rolled
out to a percentage of Play

00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:10.140
developers, and it
will be rolled out

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.910
to the rest of all developers
over the next couple of months.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.680
If you learn more
about the secrets

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.070
to being able to get a
higher-rated app on Play

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.770
and increase your user
retention, come to the talk

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.650
we have later today at
5:30 we are to learn more

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.380
about the things I talked about
in Android vitals earlier,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.660
the things Ricardo mentioned
in the pre-launch report,

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.512
and these ratings topics
that I just talked about.

00:39:33.512 --> 00:39:35.970
I'd like to welcome Tom, who
is a product manager on Google

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.823
Play, to come on stage now
and talk about subscriptions.

00:39:38.823 --> 00:39:44.025
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:45.650
TOM GRINSTED: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.900
I'm super excited to be here.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.830
So let's just
imagine for a second

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.990
that you guys have used
all the great tools

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.110
that you've heard
about over this I/O.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.330
And you've worked
with your teams

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.180
and you've made awesome apps.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.712
How do you monetize them?

00:40:03.712 --> 00:40:05.170
Well, we think one
of the best ways

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:09.510
to do that is to use
subscriptions on Google Play.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.910
And one of the reasons we think
that is because subscriptions

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.370
are growing stratospherically.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.010
We heard from Purnima
earlier on that the number

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.700
of active subscribers on Play
has doubled in the last year

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.910
alone.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.110
That's great, but
it's only one data

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.800
point for a long-term trend.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.020
In fact, consumer spend
on subscriptions on Play

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:36.970
has gone up 10 times in
the last three years.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.490
That's an amazing
opportunity for developers

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:44.530
like you to make more money,
more regularly, and more

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.180
reliably.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.190
And I'm going to
go out on a limb

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.530
and say that that
probably sounds pretty

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.840
good to quite a lot of you.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.040
And quite a lot of us at Google
have been trying to help you,

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.810
have been really
working to power

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.030
your subscription businesses

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.490
So today I'm going
to share a few

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.470
of the slew of new
features of subs

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.960
that we're launching
at I/O this year.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.720
These are features
to help you guys.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.570
Now we know that to run
a successful subscription

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.380
business, you need
really good data.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.170
So I'm really happy to say
that earlier this week we

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.130
launched a brand new part of the
Play Console, the subscriptions

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.960
dashboard.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.240
The subs dashboard
pulls together

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.150
key metrics and information
about your subs business

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.640
and puts it all in one place.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.570
So at a glance, you can see your
total number of subscriptions,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.840
your new activations
and your cancellations,

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.900
your daily and your
30-day rolling revenue,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.330
and even your top
performing subs.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.810
This is a great area to get
an overview of how well you're

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:50.770
doing.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.680
It's brilliant if you want
to spot trends or identify

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.120
anomalies.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.180
And when you do
identify an anomaly,

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.400
you're going to
want to know more.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.590
You're going to want to
know even better data.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.920
And for that, over
the coming weeks,

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.700
we're launching three brand
new click-through reports each

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.240
tailored to keep part of
your subscription lifecycle--

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.150
the acquisition report,
the retention report,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.850
and the churn, the
cancellation report.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.490
So let's look at them
all very quickly.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.000
The acquisition report
builds on the wonder Funnels

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.100
that Tamzin showed earlier.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.590
But now it's a Funnel
that's tailored especially

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.094
for your business.

00:42:31.094 --> 00:42:33.010
So not only can you see
which of your channels

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.327
drive the largest
number of installs,

00:42:35.327 --> 00:42:36.910
but you'll see which
drive the largest

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.030
number of free trialists,
and which of your acquisition

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.100
channels eventually
drive the largest

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.720
number of high-value,
repeat-paying subscribers.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.290
If you care about putting
your money and your effort

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.750
into the channels that give
you the highest-value users

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.620
on subscriptions, this
is the report for you.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.460
Secondly, there's
the retention report.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.240
This powerful new
report allows you

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.410
to compare different cohorts
from different subscriptions.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.860
So if you've got a brand new sub
that you're experimenting with

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.440
and you want to see if
outperforms your others,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.420
you can quickly
and easily plot it

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.800
and make that
decision to make it

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.930
the primary one that you sell.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.810
Or if you try to use some
of our advanced features

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.180
like introductory
pricing, for instance,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.902
then you can see here the impact
it has on your [? burn down. ?]

00:43:26.902 --> 00:43:28.360
This is a really,
really good place

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.010
to inform your product decisions
to increase your retention.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.800
And lastly, there's
the churn report.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.250
So let's be honest, when someone
cancels your subscription,

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.870
it sucks.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.430
But this report rocks.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.140
And the reason I
love this report

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.140
is because for the first
time on the Play Console

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.990
you can see the exact
days that people choose

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.280
to cancel your subscriptions.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.580
This means that you
can start seeing

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.230
the impact of that
release that you

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.620
made to try to lower
your cancellation rate.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.410
Or, you can use is to start
building the business model

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.270
behind that feature
that you think

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.660
is going to keep people
around for longer.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.590
Taken together, these three
reports and the dashboard

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.295
give you a view
into your business

00:44:13.295 --> 00:44:15.670
that you have never been able
to have on the Play Console

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.080
before.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.330
But we know that the insights
you derive from these

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.580
are only the beginning
of the story.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.250
Because those insights
drive your decisions,

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.710
and those decisions drive
what tools you choose to use.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.980
So I'm also really happy
to say that this I/O we're

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.370
announcing a brand new
tool called account hold.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.560
This will allow you to know when
a user's payment has failed,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.890
which is one of the leading
causes of subscription

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.510
cancellations.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.370
At that point,
account hold will let

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.180
you withdraw the entitlement of
your great content in your app

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.250
and tell the user why.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.790
You can say, hey, there's been
a problem with your payments.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.380
Go into Play and fix it.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.320
And the user will have 30 days
to fix their payment failure.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.970
We've been working
with trusted testers

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.620
and trying this
feature out, and we've

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.510
seen a 25% increase
in retention rates.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.970
So account hold and the
new subscriptions dashboard

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.720
are just two of
the many features

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.910
that teams across
Google are creating

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.760
to help you guys build
successful businesses.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.650
Now hopefully that's
whetted your appetite.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.930
So if you want to
know more, I really

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.620
encourage you to come along
to stage 1 tomorrow at 10:30

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.840
to join me and a couple
of colleagues as we

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.810
really delve deeply into
how to make more money using

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.480
subscriptions on Google Play.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.340
So with that, I'd
like to invite back

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.190
to the stage Purnima and Matt
to round this session out.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.424
Thank you very much.

00:45:36.424 --> 00:45:40.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.630
MATT HENDERSON: Thanks, Tom.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:43.635
So much new stuff.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.520
So in addition to making
use of the sessions,

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.600
please do go online to
G.co/play/developers.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.220
You can read much more about
all of this new stuff there.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.810
And also think about who
else in your organization

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.580
can become a user
of the Play Console.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.700
And also, if you
haven't already,

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.130
I do encourage you to
download the Playbook app.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.400
We've released a new beta with
a whole lot of new content.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.770
It's a great way
to stay informed

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.060
of all of our announcements, our
blogs, and other great content

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.260
to understand the features.

00:46:25.504 --> 00:46:26.670
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: All right.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.010
So hopefully that has
whetted your appetite

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.260
to try to build
amazing apps and games.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.130
And I hope to see you this
evening at the Google Play

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.060
Awards at 6:30, where
we are celebrating

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.900
all the wonderful work that
has happened over the last year

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.360
I want to thank
you for challenging

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.280
goes to continuously innovate,
for adopting the features

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.360
that we invest in, and creating
things that actually provide

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.800
superpowers to your users.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.480
So thank you very
much for being here,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.954
and hope to see you
the Google Play Awards.

00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:08.308
[APPLAUSE]
