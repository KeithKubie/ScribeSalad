[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.140
-We wouldn't be where we are
at Google without you, the

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.390
developer community.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.430
Since 2005, we've made dozens
of APIs and tools

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.530
available to you.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.280
Then you went out and
built marvels.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.080
Now with so many creations, we
think there's a better way for

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.320
them to work together, because
there are a lot.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.820
So we did some spring cleaning,
then asked you how

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.190
we could do it better.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.500
We used your ideas to begin
building a single place for

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.300
all of the developer resources,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.170
tools, events, and community.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.610
And all that together
looks like this.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.630
Developers.google.com.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.380
But it's more than
just a logo.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.430
It's a symbol for all the
amazing work you do in the

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.800
world and how you
work together.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.460
Soon you can find tools, get
ideas, and connect with others

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.780
all in one place, then
get down to business.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.790
Collaboration and coding power
that creates magical solutions

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.020
with a universal language, so
you can take that mass of code

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.360
and blow minds.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.480
For reals.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.590
So kick off your shoes and
explore all the ways you can

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.980
connect, because it's not just
about code, it's about you.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.800
Then start building, because
together, there's no telling

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.290
what we'll create next.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.436
Developers.google.com.

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:09.720
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.550
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.610
And thank you for coming to
our Lightning Talks today.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.680
I just have a couple things
to say as we get started.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.300
We have this agenda for you.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.040
So we're going to start out with
Android, go through the

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.410
whole gamut, and
end up at Maps.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.140
And one thing I wanted to
mention before we got started

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.050
is that there is a whole
bunch of Google

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.240
stuff going on today.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.540
So we've got the Lightning Talks
today, but we have all

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.730
these other houses going with
Maps, and Developers, and

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.050
Android, and I really recommend
you check out all of

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.760
these things.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.640
And if you forget this map, a
lot of us are wearing these

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.120
sweatshirts.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.540
And it won't be creepy, just
go up and look at where you

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.340
need to go.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.280
There's also this URL that'll
give you the maps and all the

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.130
other talks that are going on
by Googlers or at the Google

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.910
Developer Houses.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.670
Thank you so much.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.510
And I'd like to welcome up
Trevor, who's going to begin

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.550
by talking about Android,
Android apps should look like,

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.800
and where you can go
to build them.

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:09.780
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.580
Hi, everyone.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.000
My name is Trevor Johns, and
I'm a Developer Programs

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.010
Engineer with the Android
Team at Google.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.370
And today, I'm going to be
talking about Android user

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.640
interface design, and
specifically what we've done

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.470
with the last few releases of
Android with the Holo UI.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.800
So we're going to start out,
give you a brief tour of where

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.810
we've gone in the past, how
Android's evolved, the changes

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.060
we've made, why we've made them,
and what they mean to

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.410
you as an Android
app developer.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.670
So let's go ahead and step in
our time machine here, and

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.030
we're going to roll all
the way back to

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.630
Android 1.5, Cupcake.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.490
So for those of you who are
keeping score, this was

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.120
released roughly in the era of
the G1, one of our first

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.390
releases, back in 2009.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.890
Technically it wasn't our
first release, that was

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.690
Android 1.0, but it looked
pretty much the same.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.710
And if you're using Android
today, it should be familiar,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.430
you have your App Launcher, you
have your Icon Drawer, and

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.270
we opened up a Settings App
here just as a demo.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.110
And you can see that there's
this little drawer you had to

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.280
pull up manually, we have this
big, bulky search widget on

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.950
the desktop.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.730
The Settings App, you sort of
get this sort of ugly wall of

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.900
text with these down chevrons
that go somewhere down, I'm

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.190
not sure where Down means.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.420
And that was Android.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.050
Sort of a rough start,
but we'll get there.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.580
So let's move forward
one version.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.900
This is Donut now, released just
a short time later, and

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.410
not much has actually changed.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.750
We've gone and cleaned up that
big, bulky search widget, it's

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.260
a little more streamlined now,
but not too many other changes

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.940
there that are really notable,
at least as far

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.770
as the UI is concerned.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.310
So then we're going to take
one more step forward to

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.270
Android 2.0, that's Eclair.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.630
And this release is notable
because this is the one that

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.970
came out with the
Motorola Droid.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.020
We did a lot of work to go and
clean up the UI here, so icons

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.470
are a little bit more
streamlined, the Settings App

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.180
is actually not a giant wall of
text, we've gotten rid of

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.210
those confusing chevrons.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.930
The App Launcher is still more
or less the same thing,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.660
though, you have the store you
pull up manually, some carbon

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.549
fiber texter there in the
background, and that was what

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:14.040
we released there
with the Droid.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.200
Take one more step forward
here, and get to Froyo,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.750
Version 2.2.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.430
And this one is probably where
you see the most changes.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.640
We've actually gone and removed
the drawer that you

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.170
actually had to go and swipe
up with an App Launcher

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.598
button, added a set of Quick
Actions there at the bottom to

00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:33.610
go and pull up the phone and the
browser, which are pretty

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.920
common actions on a smartphone,
and we added

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.130
System-wide Search, so you'll
notice that Search widget's

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.190
changed just a little
bit, too.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.520
Settings App still looks
more or less the same.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.460
You still have this gray bar at
the top with this App Name,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.340
navigation hasn't
changed much.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.285
And that was probably, to date,
the biggest change to

00:17:53.285 --> 00:17:56.000
the Android UI we've seen.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.420
And then one last step forward,
which was Android

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.760
2.3, Gingerbread.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.465
And you'll notice the biggest
change here is we sort of made

00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.630
the UI a little bit darker, this
little widget we added on

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.030
the desktop to sort of give
you a tutorial has changed

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.140
just slightly, made it a little
darker, the Quick

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.710
Actions at the bottom have
changed, the Notification Bar

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.440
has changed.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.760
Still the same Settings App,
still the same Launcher,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.060
pretty much.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.900
And so that was our previous
releases of Android.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.350
That's where we've come to
up until fairly recently.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.140
So when we were building
Honeycomb, we took a step back

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.120
and said, well, we've had the
same look since the beginning.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.470
What can we change?

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.910
There's a lot of wasted screen
real estate with buttons, a

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.370
lot of space taken up by these
big, bulky text fields, and it

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.420
sort of felt inspired
by a desktop OS.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.460
And you have this magical pane
of glass in front of you, and

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460
there's so much more
you can do.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.310
It can be this tactile
experience.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.820
You can go and get rid of all
these desktop metaphors and

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.780
sort of come up with a
brand new experience.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.570
And, like I said, we haven't
really changed that much.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.980
There was that change with 1.5,
but it was more of an

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.020
incremental change, it wasn't
really revolutionary.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.760
We also noticed that there's
a lot of inconsistency.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.690
Android, of course, allows
device manufacturers to go and

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.920
modify the OS, to go and
edit and to add some

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.370
distinctiveness to it.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.450
But the feedback we heard from
a lot of designers was if you

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.960
go and change the text color,
if you change the selection

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.900
color, if you change the way a
List View behaves, the way

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.670
Overscroller works, and you're
really going for that picture

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.490
perfect UI, when these things
change out from under you, it

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.810
makes it hard to go and make
your app look beautiful.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.350
So we took all this feedback,
and we put it together and we

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.500
got to what we call Holo,
our holographic UI.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.280
So going back to 2.3 here,
let's take one more step

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.910
forward, and this is the
face of Android today.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.630
Still the same metaphors you're
sort of familiar with

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.530
as far as having an App
Launcher, right?

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.210
I mean, there hasn't been that
much that's changed there.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.370
But the bigger changes are
a little more subtle.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.330
If you look at the Search
Widget, you'll notice it's a

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.110
lot more minimalist. We've added
these blue futuristic

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.240
highlights everywhere, organized
the Settings App

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.730
finally so it actually makes
a little bit more sense to

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.890
scroll through.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.910
And then there's also this space
at the top of the screen

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.460
that's reserved for what
we call the action bar.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.090
And we'll go into that in a bit
more detail, but that's

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.510
actually pretty important.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.840
So this is Holo.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.410
One release for all devices,
whether or not it's a tablet

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.910
or a phone.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.180
And we really have gone through
and we've taken a look

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.350
at everything in the phone,
whether or not it's how a

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.780
dialog appears, how a List View
behaves, how you scroll

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.080
through your media, and asked
ourselves what assumptions

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.520
we've been making
for this design.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.020
And this goes all the way down
to the Widget Toolkit.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.610
So this is the selection of most
of the controls that come

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.190
with the SDK, of course,
you can add more.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.090
The big one there is probably
the Text Input Fields, and you

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.150
can actually barely see
them on the screen.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.510
It's sort of up there in the
upper right, and it's actually

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.890
just a line.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.600
And I'll show you a screen shot
of that in a moment, but

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.156
actually, let's go right
there right now.

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:04.690
So on the left is the Email App
in Gingerbread, and on the

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.465
right is the Email
App in Honeycomb

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.970
and Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.470
And you'll notice, we've really
just reduced it to a

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.630
sheet of paper.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.180
Of course, you still need your
Text Fields to address the

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.930
email, give it a subject,
actually compose.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.910
But the UI sort of fades into
the background and brings your

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.810
content front and center so the
users can focus on their

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.450
creativity and not on what
their phone is trying to

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.230
impose as far as the
UI's concerned.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:33.150
So we basically have three
design principles that

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.360
underlie Holo.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.740
And we wanted a UI that felt
enchanting, that simplified

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.610
users' lives, and that made
them feel amazing and

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.520
empowered because of that.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.270
So let's talk about those in a
little bit more detail, give

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.060
you a quick tour through
the some of the

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.330
design highlights here.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.650
So we wanted to be delightful.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.840
There's lots of visual
flourishes sprinkled

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.070
throughout the OS.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.895
When you're scrolling left or
right on the Home Screen and

00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:02.830
you hit one end of the screen,
this pane of light will sort

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.030
of pop out from the screen
for just a second.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.700
It's a very subtle effect, but
it gives your phone a bit of

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.280
personality, makes it feel a bit
more fun, makes you feel

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.540
like it has a bit more
substance, that you're

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.040
actually working with this
physical interface

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.320
inside of the phone.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.350
Sort of extending from that idea
of a physical interface,

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.640
objects behave as actual objects
rather than buttons.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.750
If you have an icon and you
drop it on top of another

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.380
icon, what do you expect
should happen?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.330
They should stack.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.260
Well, that's exactly
what happens.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.770
And so little things like
that are found all

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.070
throughout the OS.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.040
Personalization has always
been an important part of

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040
Android, it still is.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.240
We want the user to feel like
their phone belongs to them,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.550
so of course, it starts with
things like setting your

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.440
background, being able to go
and adjust the behavior of

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.340
your phone, add widgets
everywhere,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.400
make the phone yours.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.490
On the other hand, the phone
will get to know you and

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.160
personalize itself
automatically.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.800
So as you're browsing around
the web, and say you go and

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.200
visit Wikipedia a lot.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.700
Your phone will, of course,
save that in its local

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.280
history, and then later on, when
you go and try and do a

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.260
system-wide search, it'll check
that history and start

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.510
adding auto-complete suggestions
for Wikipedia,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.760
even though you're not
in the browser.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.260
So the next topic there,
simplifying your life.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.550
Actually, let's move to
the next screen here.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.920
So first things first, we want
to go and keep the dialogues

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.820
nice and simple, wizards
nice and simple.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.780
When you first turn your
phone on, we have this

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.860
initial setup process.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.542
So as an example here, one of
the screens asks you to go and

00:23:36.542 --> 00:23:38.010
set up a Google account.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.580
And we keep the text there
brief, and when you actually

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.930
go to sign up for the account,
it's just a one-page

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.220
form you fill out.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.670
Just as an example there, but
throughout the system, we've

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.490
gone and reevaluated all of our
dialogs, trying to figure

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.340
out where we were being too
verbose, not saying enough,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.590
and kept it basically the bare
minimum we could while still

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.200
being informative.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.740
Pictures and these graphical
UIs are a big part of Holo.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.150
We sort of call this like a
Magazine UI, so big, high

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.025
resolution, vibrant pictures
right there in

00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:09.180
front of your screen.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.930
And so this is the Dialer App.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.990
When you launched Dialer App in
the past, it used to give

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.310
you this whole list view of
contacts, and you could scroll

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.800
through, and eventually,
you'd find who

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.730
you're looking through.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.790
You could star people, add
them to the Quick List.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.700
We found that it makes it a lot
quicker if you just have a

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.420
picture right there.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.116
If I want to call Mattias and I
open my phone, well there he

00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:27.592
is in the upper left hand
corner where I can

00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:27.725
just click on him.

00:24:27.725 --> 00:24:29.810
I don't actually have to go
through and read everything.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.760
And so pictures are a lot
faster than words.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.340
We try and use these high
resolution images throughout

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.530
the UI whenever we can.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.870
We also try and do the right
thing automatically.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.080
So we've added a feature in
Android Four, Ice Cream

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.090
Sandwich, called Android Beam.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.010
And when you take two phones and
you hold them next to each

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.470
other, if they have an NFT
antenna, they'll detect that

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:50.840
the other phone is
in proximity and

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.700
enter the Share Mode.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.010
You can then go and tap on
whatever content is on your

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.150
screen, and it'll send it
over to the other phone.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.620
So we're using this contact
sensitivity to go and just

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.380
automatically throw the user
into the Share Mode so that

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.770
the action they most likely want
to perform, since they've

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.000
put their phones next
to another phone, is

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.110
just one tap away.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.340
Of course, you still want to
leave that final act up to the

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.120
user and not do everything for
them, but just get them into

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.860
the right position so that
they're ready to do that.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.620
Navigation is, of course,
important.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.040
We've always had this concept
of a Back button on Android.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.520
We've got and extended that a
bit more with the Action Bar.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.480
I'll go into that in a bit more
detail in a moment here.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.820
Also, we've gone and taken the
most commonly used actions and

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.850
pulled them out of
the Menu Bar.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.620
In fact, the Menu Bar is
pretty much [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.290
at this point.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.610
If you target your app for
Android Three or above, so

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.040
anyone running Holo, we actually
remove the Menu

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.250
button from the screen and
place all of the old Menu

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.080
commands up in this
Action Bar.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.850
And as a developer, you could
pick whether or not something

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.090
should be displayed right there,
one click away, at the

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.360
top of the Action Bar, or we
still do have an Overflow Menu

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.820
where you can hide the less
commonly used actions.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.250
But the really important actions
should be right there,

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.930
one click away at all times, and
your phone should go and

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.660
adjust its UI to what
you're doing so

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.270
those are always there.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.890
And I'll give you some more
examples of that in a moment.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.120
Also going off of navigation,
consistency is important.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.470
The Action Bar that we've added
does a lot towards that.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.030
So we have examples here
from Maps, Inbox,

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.430
and the Gallery App.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.870
And you'll notice that even
though they are very different

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.580
apps, they look different.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.460
A Map View looks a lot different
than a Gallery View

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.620
looks a lot different
than your email.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.940
The navigation looks the same
in all of those, and that's

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.730
intentional.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.400
And we've provided the tools
to go and do that for app

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.210
developers anywhere
in the system.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.020
And if you're a long-time
Android user, notifications

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.220
are of course a very important
part of that experience, we've

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.080
had that since the beginning.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.280
But just to go and reiterate,
we want to go and make sure

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.410
that whenever there's an
important event that occurs,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.160
of course, since it's important,
you want to let the

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.390
user know, but make sure that
you only interrupt them if

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.490
it's important.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.190
And if it's not important, we
go and tuck it away so that

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.430
users can respond to that
notification later.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.030
So we bring things up, give them
a chance to respond, and

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.230
then let them deal with things
on their own time, so you

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.970
don't get any big, bulky dialogs
that come up and stop

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.620
the user from what they're
trying to do.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.750
So on this last part about
empowering the user and making

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:26.030
them feel amazing, we've added
lots of gestures throughout

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.290
the system that let
you go and--

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.510
basically, they're tricks that
let the user pull something

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.410
off with some gesture, some
action, and do it without

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.090
having to push a button.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.160
We're trying to remove as many
buttons from the UI as we can.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.390
And gestures are always a little
tricky because you can

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.060
put up a little tool tip and
tell them, but most of the

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.440
time, they're not pushing
something

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.570
that's labeled there.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.660
So once you go and perform some
gesture, we want to make

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.850
sure that it works throughout
the system.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.990
Once you've learned in Gmail
that you can swipe left and

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.290
right between your email
messages, you'll discover oh,

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.850
you can do the same thing in
Google Play, you can swipe

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.250
left to right between categories
in the App Store.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.020
You can also go into the Google
Plus App and do the

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.390
same thing and switch
between your own

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.540
circles and people nearby.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.260
Dialogs, we've gone and cleaned
those up again, made

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.730
sure that they're
actually useful.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.580
Rather than just saying that
there's an error that's

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.760
occurred and taking you onto the
Support Page, we try and

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.790
give you the text you need to
make sure you can respond to

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:26.160
it and actually resolve
the situation.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.100
There's little bits of visual
encouragement sprinkled

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.740
throughout the system.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.390
So as you're going and dragging
icons around, we

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:37.650
overlay this grid and put this
little shadow of the icon that

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.170
sort of jumps around as you
drag your icons around.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.470
So even if you've never used
an Android device before,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.110
you'll immediately know that
these devices are going to go

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.360
and snap to a grid.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.630
And finally, this is less of
a UI issue and more of a

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.260
functionality issue, but apps
should be smart, and they

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.820
should do the heavy lifting
for the user.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.340
If you have a smartphone in
your pocket, it should be

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.280
smart, right?

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.000
So it's little things.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.560
If you're in the Camera App,
you should automatically

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.750
adjust white balance,
you should

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.420
automatically set focal points.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.440
Sure, give the users a way to
go and set it if they want,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.060
but by default, you should
just go and do everything

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.430
automatically.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.110
Which also gets to the next
point here, which is you

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.050
should make the important things
fast. Again, if you're

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.270
in the Camera App, the
most important

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.640
thing is taking a picture.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.780
If you press that Shutter
button, you should take a

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.090
picture immediately.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.920
So we've even gone so far as
to go and add zero-second

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.840
shutter lags.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.940
From the moment you press that
button, the photo is

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.080
immediately saved to disk and
there's no delay while you're

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.070
waiting for the shutter to fire
and for it to find the

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.250
focal point.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.150
It's instant.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.150
So as an Android app developer,
what does all of

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.970
this mean to you?

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.450
So we've gone and put together
a collection of design

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.390
patterns that you can use.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.280
And the most important one, if
you haven't heard me mention

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.720
it a dozen times already,
is the Action bar.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.970
This is the roughly 50 pixels,
I can't remember the exact

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.480
number, of space at the top of
your screen that's reserved

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.280
for the most important
navigational elements.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.190
And it's broken up into
three sections.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.010
You have an App icon, which
tells you where you are.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.880
Typically, this is going to be
your own application's icon,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.890
but you can change it, if you're
in a document, make it

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.990
look like you're docked,
things like that.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.810
You have View Details, this is
things like navigational tabs.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.900
And then you have your Action
buttons, which tell the user

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.160
what they can do.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.110
And this can either be the
Overflow menu, where you put

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:26.400
the less commonly used actions,
like I said, you can

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.800
bring those actions front and
center, just place them there.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.510
You can even add custom views,
things like search widgets.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.900
Basically, anything the user
wants to do commonly should be

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.910
part of that Action Bar.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.580
It's also contextual.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.510
So as you start making
selections, we actually will

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.310
swap that Action bar out, flip
it around, and give you a

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.770
completely different
set of commands.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.420
If you're in email, normally the
first thing you'd want to

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.380
do is compose a new message.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.390
Once you start selecting
messages, it's not likely

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.900
that's what you want
to do anymore.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.710
Most likely what you want to
do is something related to

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.390
organization.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.950
You're going to want to archive
your messages, or

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.510
you're going to want to go and
maybe mass delete them if

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.510
they're all spam,
Heaven forbid.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.750
So as soon as you go and enter
this different mode, the phone

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.760
will go and adapt and place you
in the right context for

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.520
whatever it is that you're
most likely to

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.240
going to want to do.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.880
Navigation.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.450
I mentioned that there is this
Back button, and then we've

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.850
added an initial Back command
up to the Action bar.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.160
So the Back button, which
has been there since the

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.100
beginning, provides temporal
back navigation.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.860
So if I'm in my web browser and
I click a link that takes

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.500
me to the Google Play Store,
when I click Back, it's going

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.740
to take me back into the
browser, because that's the

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.370
last thing I did as far
as my sequence of

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.690
events on the phone.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.550
But what we discovered is
sometimes users actually want

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.330
to go and once they navigate
into that other app, they want

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.140
to go and explore more there.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.700
They want to get back to the
home page of that app.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.990
And so the other Back button is
a hierarchical Back button.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.680
It'll take you back up within
the navigational tree of the

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.110
current application.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.720
So we actually call it Up.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.590
So that's actually, if you think
of a tree, you're going

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.200
back up to the root
of that tree.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.660
So if I'm in Google Play and I'm
in an App Detail page and

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.810
I click Up, it'll start taking
me back to the Google Play

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.690
main screen.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.610
And so that's a really important
navigational pattern

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.040
that you'll find all throughout
Android now, and

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.890
it's really important to go and
make sure your apps are

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.420
updated to go [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.010
of that.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.570
Multiple pane layouts are
important, because again, we

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.930
have one release of Android
for tablets and phones.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.060
So this is sort of a pattern
people have been using in

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.090
mobile apps since
the beginning.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.470
You have, say, your
Contacts App.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.030
You have this table of contents
that lists all of

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.640
your contacts, you click on
somebody, and it'll take you

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.030
into a Detail View.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.800
So what we've done is we've
broken that up into what we

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.500
call fragments, so you can go
and lay them out side by side.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.230
So now, same views, you still
have that table of

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.040
contents on the left.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.020
You still have your details on
the right, but you can go and

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.370
stack them and rearrange them.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.940
And so this does two things.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.200
One, it's a really intuitive way
to go into the device as a

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.930
user, and as an app developer,
it allows you

00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.830
to reuse your code.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.070
It's actually the exact same
code laying out that table of

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.690
contents and displaying that
Detail View, we're just going

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.965
in and rendering both of
them simultaneously.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.160
And there's a lot of options
are to go in and rearrange

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.640
things, too.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.170
So you can go and of course,
place them side by side like I

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.520
did in that example, or you can
go and stack them on the

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.030
right, stack on the bottom, have
things slide in and out.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.370
We've added commands to
go and do animation.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.210
So there's lot of different ways
to go and compose your UI

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.350
and make something that looks
really beautiful.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.820
And as an app designer,
it's up to you to

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.910
figure out what works.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.070
We've given you the tools to
make sure that you can do it.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.050
I mentioned gestures already.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.190
Gestures are really important.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.830
We want to make sure that your
device feels like an actual

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.740
environment that users
are interacting with.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.860
So we've actually documented a
whole set of common gestures,

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.360
things that app developers will
want to go and integrate

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.960
into their app, things like
double tapping to go and zoom

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.550
in, being able to go and swipe
left and right to go and move

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.410
between pages.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.930
Actually, that's what my
next slide will talk a

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.390
little bit more, too.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.060
Drag and drop, we've added a
lot more APIs to go and let

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.290
you go and take care of drag and
drop and move data between

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.300
different fragments.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:08.989
Swipe Views.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.340
Like I said, you want to make
sure you can go and page

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.840
through the different
parts of your app.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.380
We've added a class to our API
called View Pager that makes

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.420
this really easy.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.389
And one last thing to talk about
here is, make sure your

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.270
app feels like a pure
Android App.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.650
So I've taken a collection
here of UI elements from

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.320
different mobile OS's.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.949
And functionally, they're
all the same.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.692
A button is a button, a check
box is a check box, a text

00:34:35.692 --> 00:34:37.340
field is a text field.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.429
But visually, they look
completely different.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.900
And if you're porting your app
over from one environment to

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.080
another and you use the visual
elements from that other

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.850
environment, not only is it
going to make your app just

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.820
look wrong, it's going to
confuse users too, because on

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.570
other environments, they
actually do have subtle

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.030
differences in behavior.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.020
And this is not just about
making sure your buttons look

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.900
the same, but the way things
behave and the way

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.430
things are laid out.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.520
So to give you a few examples
here, we have the Dialer App.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.660
And when you're in the Dialer
App on the Android, you'll

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.620
notice that there is, again,
that Action Bar at the top

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.780
that contains your navigation.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.970
On the right here, we have the
Dialer App from IOS, and that

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.730
Tab Bar is at the bottom.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.410
And you never have a Tab Bar
at the bottom on an Android

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.025
app, but yet, we see
app developers go

00:35:22.025 --> 00:35:23.782
and make that mistake.

00:35:23.782 --> 00:35:28.010
To give you a couple other
examples here, Back Commands

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.130
that are actually labeled you'll
never do, it's always

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.910
that Up Command.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.890
And when you're in a List View,
you should never have

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:36.950
right-facing chevrons.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.250
When you're in a List View,
it should be obvious

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.350
you're in a List View.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.670
Remember that screen shot I
showed of Android 1.5 where we

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.790
had all those really
confusing chevrons.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.010
Of course, those pointed down
and I have no clue where down

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.200
goes, but is that really any
different than right?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.820
When you click on something in
Android, it doesn't side of

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.280
the way, it just jumps into
that next screen.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.710
So a right-facing chevron
doesn't make any more sense.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:02.030
So we've taken all of these tips
and even more, and we've

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.700
put them on a site that we call
Android Design, and we

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.590
just launched it a
few weeks ago.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.730
And we've put together a lot
of resources for you as app

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.270
designers, weather it's UI
essentials for Photoshop, all

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.690
of the design philosophy and
design patterns that I've

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.050
mentioned, put them up there for
you as well, basically so

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.520
that you can figure out
everything that we were

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.710
thinking when we were developing
the OS, that you

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.340
can apply those to your app.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.510
So if there's one thing that
you take out of this talk

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:32.960
today, it's this URL here,
developer.android.com/design.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.300
Go there, read through it all,
internalize it, and do what we

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.310
did with Honeycomb and
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.580
Take a step back.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.280
Ask yourself, is there some
assumption I've been making as

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.690
an app developer as to how users
are using my app, and is

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.810
there some way I can simplify it
and make it feel more like

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.120
an Android app, make it feel
more at home, and in doing so,

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.410
make it a bit more beautiful?

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.700
All right.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.695
Thank you.

00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:59.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you, Trevor.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:05.200
So while Trevor's taking down
his laptop and we're getting

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.350
Jonathan Beri set up here, we do
have a moment or two for a

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.370
few questions.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.960
Does anybody have questions
for Trevor

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.210
about the Android universe?

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:16.820
Yes.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.007
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
taking questions

00:37:18.007 --> 00:37:19.990
not related to design?

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.300
TREVOR JOHNS: Sure.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.230
Maybe, yeah.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:22.720
Depends on your question.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.960
MALE SPEAKER: So is there a way
right now, there's these

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.490
apps called Mr. Phone, for
example, that intercept the

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.990
incoming call to check if the
phone number is from a

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.690
spammer, and that functionality
doesn't work on

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:42.790
my Sprint Android phone, mainly
because Sprint is by

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.260
far the worst of the telecom
services, maybe.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.840
But is that an Android feature
or a Sprint feature to turn

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.350
off that ability?

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.890
TREVOR JOHNS: So we have what
we call the Android

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.720
Compatibility Definition
Document and Compatibility

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.850
Test Suite.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:02.130
And this is the set of standards
that tell device

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.920
manufacturers what an Android
device should behave like.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.550
So this covers things
like API calls.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.300
So if there's some API call
that's supposed to tell you

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.040
what number is calling and
that's not working, that means

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.730
that most likely, the device
manufacturer made a change to

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.930
the phone that for some
reason was not

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.400
covered by our test suite.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.560
And I can tell you right now
that API call should be

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.030
mentioned in our CDD, our
compatibility definition.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.630
So I'd want to actually take
a look at that app and see

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.530
exactly what it's doing
and why our test

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.000
didn't catch that.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.855
So if you talk to me after the
talk, I can take a look at it

00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:37.190
and try and get some more
information and figure out

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.290
what exactly is going
on there.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.130
Android devices should always
behave the same no matter who

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.480
manufactured them.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.290
Even if they've gone and
modified the UI, the API calls

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.540
should always be identical.

00:38:51.178 --> 00:38:52.428
All right any other questions?

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: No more
Android questions?

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.418
All right, thank you
so much, Trevor.

00:38:58.418 --> 00:39:02.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I also want
to say to the Live Stream

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.120
viewers out there, if you have
questions, please feel free to

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.810
+Mention me on Google+, ask
your questions during the

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.130
talk, and I'll make sure that
we get them answered on the

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.690
live stream.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.680
I'm Timothy Jordan, by the way,
and you can find me, of

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.250
course, on Google+.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.120
And next up, we have Johnathan
Beri, who's going to be

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.200
talking about Hangout Apps, and
really the next generation

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.450
of social applications.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.392
JOHNATHAN BERI: Wait for
the screen to load.

00:39:44.788 --> 00:39:46.670
How's everybody doing today?

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.590
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.380
JOHNATHAN BERI: It's a
little drier, right?

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.780
We planned that on purpose.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.225
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do we have any
more Android questions while

00:39:59.225 --> 00:40:00.380
we're working this out?

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.760
Come on.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.200
Who here has an Android
device?

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.670
You are my people.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.660
Who here doesn't have
an Android device?

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.540
You invert probably,
most likely?

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.440
Except for the guy who is
actually texting on a

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.870
non-Android device.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.940
Hi.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.570
No, no worries.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.430
And have you all tried
out the new ICS?

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.610
Have you run Ice
Cream Sandwich?

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.650
No?

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.020
Where do you try it?

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.567
Trevor, where do they try it?

00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:29.010
TREVOR JOHNS: Next door,
at the Android House.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:29.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There you go.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.628
Are we ready?

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:32.540
JOHNATHAN BERI: All right,
we're good to go.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.020
So now, we're going to talk
about Hangout Apps, Hangout

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.580
Apps being the next generation
of social apps.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.730
My name is Johnathan Beri.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.760
I'm a Developer Advocate working
on Google+ and Google

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.860
+ Hangout Apps.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.820
I'll be joined shortly
by some of my

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.950
colleagues, Julia and Wolff.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.710
But before I begin,
I want to talk a

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.650
little bit about Hangouts.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.510
So in the audience, not
the live stream,

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.760
who's been in a Hangout?

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.910
Awesome.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:03.150
Who's had a Hangout
with their family?

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.430
Strangers?

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.156
Bosses?

00:41:08.156 --> 00:41:08.630
All right.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.990
Drinking?

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.540
No, OK.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.790
Sorry.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:16.405
Hangouts are a new medium
of communication.

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:19.830
They're bringing people
together in ways that

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.880
telecommunication hasn't done
in the past. It's a rich,

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.060
immersive experience,
multi-user, 10 people at a

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.770
time, conversing, coming,
going, meeting,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.740
shaking hands virtually.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.510
And it's actually a
transformative medium.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.850
It's making things happen that
was not possible before.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.970
I'll give you an example.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:43.590
Daria Musk was a small-time
performer in the forest of

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:46.920
Connecticut doing some random
gigs in New York

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.460
whenever she could.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.410
She first heard about Google+
and got on, saw a stream, and

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.530
started meeting people, and
then she saw Hangouts.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:58.412
And as a performer,
she thought,

00:41:58.412 --> 00:42:00.140
what if I did a concert?

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.420
I know there's not a lot of
people on here yet, it's new,

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.100
but let's just see
what happens.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.220
I'll open it up to public
and start singing.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.610
Within the first hour, she
actually overloaded our

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.370
systems and we had to go
behind the scenes and

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:17.460
reconfigure, because there's
such an interest in listening

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.770
to Daria Musk perform.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:20.020
She went on for six hours.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:25.080
And from this small town girl
performing in New York's bars

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.730
to a global success.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.030
Not only was she able to sing
and engage with the audience,

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.980
she could talk directly to the
people in the Hangout.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.780
It's a way you can connect that
you could never really

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.068
connect before on
a global stage.

00:42:38.068 --> 00:42:40.800
So it turns out, Hangouts
are really good at

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.430
bringing people together.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.460
And when people come together,
they want to laugh, they want

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.900
to joke, they want to cry, but
they also want to do stuff

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.360
together, they want to
collaborate, they want to

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.940
build, they want to think.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.340
And that's where Hangout
Apps come in.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.720
Hangout Apps allow third party
developers to create

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.470
applications that are inside
the Hangout experience that

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.340
extend the conversation.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.380
Now, what makes Hangout Apps
unique, just besides being

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.910
inside of this video system, is
the fact that they can be

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:19.850
real time, they're
people-centric, and they have

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.800
access to rich media that you
can integrate within your

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.020
application.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.980
Let me actually stop talking
about Hangout Apps and show up

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.230
Hangout Apps.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:43.775
So I'm in a standard Hangout,
and Wolff is the big screen.

00:43:43.775 --> 00:43:45.540
Say hi, Wolff.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.750
And Julia, who's actually
in the back.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.000
JULIA: Hi.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.590
JOHNATHAN BERI: Wolff, I
think you're on Mute.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.840
So let me load up an app.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:04.790
So what you see here is
a Hangout App running.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.700
Above the film strip and below
the Menu Bar is the real

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.180
estate for a Hangout App.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.100
Essentially, it's an i-frame.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.900
You can do whatever
you want with it.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.630
Of course, we have APIs that you
can integrate, which I'll

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.870
show in a second.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:18.640
Now here's the idea we had.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.620
We're having a lot of fun at
South by Southwest. We're

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.920
working hard.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.870
And we decided, what can we do
to stay longer at South By?

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.140
So the film event
is coming up.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.520
Let's submit a film into that.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.350
We're going to actually use the
Hangouts and Hangout Apps

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.150
to collaboratively build a film
together so we can get it

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.860
done in record time so we
can actually party more.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.900
I mean, work more.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.380
So this is actually a Google
Earth plug-in.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.400
If you haven't seen it, it's
a really cool plug-in, it's

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.560
using our 3D map data, I can
zoom around the world.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.710
But for this movie, we
need to first start

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:55.790
with filming locations.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.370
So guys, do you have any ideas
of where we should film?

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:01.860
JULIA: Well, let's see.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.930
Coming from San Francisco, I
say, let's check that out.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:14.430
WOLFF: I think we want to make
a documentary about bears, so

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.730
I'm going to look for
Yellowstone Park.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.420
JOHNATHAN BERI: Well since I'm
in Austin, I think I'm going

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.045
to go there.

00:45:21.045 --> 00:45:24.380
So as you can see, Julia has
already put some pins on, I

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.480
just put a pin on.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.120
And what we're demonstrating
is the social

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.210
piece to Hangout Apps.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.340
This is a shared experience,
and our applications take

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:34.830
advantage of that and
build that in too.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.250
You'll also see that I can
see what [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.000
they're doing.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.990
That's because we have
an API that makes

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.130
real-time apps possible.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.570
We call that the share state.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.360
The share state is pretty
flexible, too.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.260
It's not just putting pains
into Google Earth.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.770
We can do a lot more with it.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.940
To demonstrate, I'm
going to actually

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.390
start following Julia.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.510
And what I'm doing is moving in
sync with what she's seeing

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.170
on her laptop over there.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.885
So when she pans around, it
moves my globe around.

00:46:01.885 --> 00:46:04.410
And it's not a screen share,
this is the actual application

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.850
updating in response to
what she's doing.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.810
So to explain a little bit
further, I'm going to explain

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.430
how the API works.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.680
Let me get out of Full Screen.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.290
Finally.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.540
All right.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.390
So this is a representation of
the three different apps we

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.790
have running on our respective
machines, here's Julia, Wolff,

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.000
and I. In the bottom
there's a box.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.770
This represents the
shared state.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.180
It's kind of like a data store,
and it's where we store

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.830
the information that
we pass around.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.520
So there's application code that
calls the API on Julia's

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.730
machine that says, hey,
I'm at the US.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.790
This is the lat and
long positions.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.660
And the API passes that
to our shared state,

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.380
and it's stored there.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.890
Simple JavaScript call to send
that over, you don't have to

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.700
do crazy posts or deal with
cross-browser issues.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.630
The API handles that for you.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:10.150
Now almost instantly, the back
end sends that information to

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.330
all the app instances.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.150
So we have three here, if we had
10, all 10 people inside

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.200
the Hangout would have that
same information.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.240
Again, because it's our API, you
don't have to build this

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.260
real time back end, a pub-sub
system, dealing with set up

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.910
back end servers for
this piece, it

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.300
just happens naturally.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.095
Also, you'll notice that it
goes to Julia as well.

00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:30.960
It actually goes to everybody,
so you don't have to deal with

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.100
figuring out who sent what
message, it just gets

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.110
propagated.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:37.990
Now we just have a bit of
application code that says,

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.180
hey Google Earth, go to that
new location, and we're

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:40.710
synchronized.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.260
It's that simple.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.565
It's about five lines of code,
10 lines of code, all in

00:47:45.565 --> 00:47:47.710
JavaScript.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.240
So now back to our
movie, because we

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.867
really want to stay.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.060
I'm going to load up the second
app that we put in.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.680
So guys, I don't think we have
a good handle on where we're

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.050
going to shoot.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.740
What can we do next?

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.510
JULIA: We can maybe look for
some costumes to use during

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.280
this movie?

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.710
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.720
So we're in this Costume App,
and it's going to help us try

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.740
on different things.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.150
So the first thing you'll notice
is I can pick any one

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:26.080
of these guys and move
my head around.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.050
This is kind of silly, but what
it's doing is using our

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.850
media APIs.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:33.670
So we have an overlay API that
you can attach objects to and

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.950
track head movements.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.610
I think Wolff is demonstrating
that it pans with you.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:46.130
You can also resize, like Julia
has a jumbo mustache.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.890
And you could also reposition.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.860
Now, these are not
canned images.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.380
These are actually ones that
we've drawn and uploaded to

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.610
the system and overlaid
to the API.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.250
So you can do whatever your
creativity lets you do.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:04.760
So to prove that, we can
even draw an overlay.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.920
So forgive my artistic skills on
a track pad, but I'm going

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.820
to draw a crown, or a Bart
Simpson hat, however you want

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.620
to interpret it, and I'm
going to wear it.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.650
And we're just taking advantage
of some of the HTML5

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.240
features that will be
talked about later

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.780
today, and it's powerful.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.100
And this is fun, this is a toy,
but this actually has

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.350
real world applications.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.990
For example, if you're building
a Hangout App that's

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.400
a game, the high score might
have a number that floats up,

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.360
or a crown if they just
beat the level.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.212
But if you're doing a
productivity app and you want

00:49:46.212 --> 00:49:50.290
to identify who's the current
color on the project plan, you

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:53.004
can identify that with a little
ID at the bottom.

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.450
So I hate to be the bearer of
bad news with all this fun,

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:01.810
but I don't think we have budget
or time to fly or build

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:02.750
all these costumes.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:06.280
Is there any way we can stay
at South by Southwest?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:06.950
Wolff, we can't hear you.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.200
What was that?

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.170
JULIA: I think maybe we can
do an animated movie.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.505
What do you think, Jonathan?

00:50:14.505 --> 00:50:15.630
JOHNATHAN BERI: Ah, yeah.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.110
I'm pretty sure we built in
animated features, too.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.600
JULIA: Oh, that's great.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.695
That's a great idea.

00:50:19.695 --> 00:50:20.100
OK.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.050
JOHNATHAN BERI: There we are.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.755
Since I've been drinking a lot
of cheap beer, I don't know

00:50:25.755 --> 00:50:29.690
about you guys, but PBR has
been rolling deep for me.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.160
So I'm going to grab this PBR.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.500
Oh, wait a second.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.200
Ah, I got it.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.210
That's my animated character.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:35.650
I'm a hipster.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.080
JULIA: Aw, man.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.750
But you've totally already
sold out as a hipster.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.300
I mean, I got to do that before
they sold out, with my

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.150
blue pigtails and all.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.590
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:49.710
And Wolff is miming, but I think
he wanted to be a bear

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.470
from the beginning with
the bear documentary.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:56.990
So if you notice, the mouths
are moving, and that's

00:50:56.990 --> 00:51:00.360
actually using our
audio-video APIs.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.020
So our animated character
is responding to the

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.500
volume of my voice.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.670
There's a simple callback API
that triggers an event that

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:08.850
animates that mouth.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.910
And Wolff, say something as
if you're a mime again.

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:14.710
And he's growling.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:15.680
Growl.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.150
All right, cool.

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.650
I think we're going to have to
do this animated film, we just

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.840
don't have the time for it.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:25.130
Now, this has been a mix of
useful with productivity, as

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.420
in using Google Earth, as
well as playfulness.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.430
We can go in either direction.

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.740
You can build a full-fledged
game.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:35.010
So as part of the film, we
built this little game to

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.740
represent combining all
this stuff together.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.015
So let's go to the--

00:51:47.732 --> 00:51:49.750
I love this app.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.370
So here's the premise.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:53.540
We've been working really hard
on these demos, we were coding

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.870
late at the Googleplex, and
we lost track of time.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.820
The doors are locked.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.980
We can't get out.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.770
And we really need to get to
South by Southwest so I can

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.060
give this talk.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.250
So we're going to try to figure
out a way how we can

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.300
get out of the Google

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.800
headquarters and get to Austin.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.590
The whole purpose is to
get into one of our

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.830
self-driving cars.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:20.790
So I think I'll be the hipster,
going with the theme.

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:23.160
And here I am.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.050
JULIA: You know, I really
dig these blue pigtails.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:29.470
I'm going to go for
the girl here.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.750
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.470
JULIA: And we know Wolff's
love of bears.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.900
Oh, yep, there he is.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.120
JOHNATHAN BERI: So first thing
I'm demonstrating here is that

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.450
same shared state that we used
to synchronize the globe,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.220
we're actually synchronizing
our positions.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.730
So if you were sitting by Julia,
you'd probably see me

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.870
walking around, and she's
actually moving her character

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.190
around her virtual world.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:54.980
So to demonstrate that, we
have a little debugger.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.690
Why don't you guys
move around?

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.690
So this information is
what's being stored

00:52:58.690 --> 00:52:59.370
in the shared state.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.700
It's just [INAUDIBLE]
with positions

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.760
and some other metadata.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.640
And we've also carried over the
audio API effect, so our

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.220
mouths are still animated.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.170
And that, we have a little
debugger for that, too.

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.930
This represents the volume of
my mic and the others' mics,

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:17.450
and that's what our animate
character is responding to.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.525
Again, that's just a simple
hook into the API.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.420
Now hey guys, do you have
any ideas how we

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.080
can get out of here?

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.830
JULIA: Well, I've heard that
we can map our way out of

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.300
here, but we kind of need to
know where we are, right?

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.350
JOHNATHAN BERI: Oh, let me go
over to the kiosk, do a little

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.300
Google search.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.010
Boom.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.110
Whoa.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.320
Sensitive.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.630
I think we're in Mountain
View, so let me look for

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.810
Mountain View.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.055
JULIA: That sounds like
a good start.

00:53:52.055 --> 00:53:54.102
JOHNATHAN BERI: I'm
feeling lucky.

00:53:54.102 --> 00:53:57.811
All right, so let me double
click and zoom in, and--

00:53:57.811 --> 00:53:58.870
whoa!

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:01.876
Wolff, where did you go?

00:54:01.876 --> 00:54:02.294
Boom.

00:54:02.294 --> 00:54:04.375
All right, I guess we
found one way out.

00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:07.130
JULIA: Wolff has really
good aim.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.430
JOHNATHAN BERI: How are
you in the Hangout,

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:10.600
but also in the car?

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.140
I don't know, we'll figure
it out later.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:15.840
JULIA: You know Johnathan, I'm
really thirsty after that.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.520
That was really stressful.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.770
So I'm going to get a soda.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.505
JOHNATHAN BERI: Sure.

00:54:20.505 --> 00:54:22.740
I'll grab a Mentos
or something.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.240
JULIA: Yeah.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.063
Let's just take a break and
figure out the next steps.

00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:28.300
JOHNATHAN BERI: Hey,
wait a second.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:28.550
Mentos?

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.755
Diet Coke?

00:54:29.755 --> 00:54:32.740
Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.240
JULIA: I think I'm thinking
what you're thinking.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.560
I think I need to strap this
absurdly large bottle of Diet

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.366
Coke to my back like a rocket.

00:54:41.366 --> 00:54:42.220
Oh yeah.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.200
JOHNATHAN BERI: Betcha
there'll be a

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:43.900
lot of fuel in that.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:47.720
OK, so if I just splash
in some Mentos--

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.000
JULIA: Yep.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.232
JOHNATHAN BERI: Boom!

00:54:49.232 --> 00:54:52.440
Wait, are you there?

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.930
Did get in the car?

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.180
JULIA: Whoa.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.710
JOHNATHAN BERI: And
that was fun.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.380
All right, so I'm the
last man standing.

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.570
Um, I need to get out.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.470
How do I get out of here?

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.350
There's got to be, I don't know,
like a door or something

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:13.020
that we don't know about?

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:17.040
JULIA: I think that a door
probably should've been our

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.685
first guess, but I think
you should try it out.

00:55:19.685 --> 00:55:20.790
JOHNATHAN BERI: Oh yeah,
that's right.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:23.222
I'll use the search.

00:55:23.222 --> 00:55:27.950
Let's see, door.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.970
I think we have one of those.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.930
Oh, that's great.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.180
Open sesame.

00:55:39.198 --> 00:55:39.985
Did it work?

00:55:39.985 --> 00:55:42.900
I feel like I'm in the
Twilight Zone.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.050
Ah, there we go.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:47.090
No we're off to Austin.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.670
Dum, dum, dum.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.390
Well that was fun, right?

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.030
It was playful, and that shows
some of lighter sides of

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:54.720
Hangout Apps.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.930
But the Hangout Apps can kind go
across the entire spectrum.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.070
Since it's really an i-frame for
you to work and integrate

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:06.770
with into, as developers, you
can do everything from

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:11.410
productivity apps, to music
collaboration apps, to

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:12.980
research and discovery.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.030
But of course, games too.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.490
The Hangout Apps, because
they're social, because

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.400
they're real time, and because
they have access to this media

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.800
that brings people together,
it's a new generation of

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.670
social apps.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.290
This is also a new frontier.

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:30.420
We're in Developer Preview,
and we're working our way

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.360
towards out of that.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.020
So that you can be first on
board to bring your apps

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.650
inside of Hangouts.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:42.210
And I think that's it.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:43.210
One second, sorry.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.460
My final slide.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.330
I go into any code today, so
we have a code lab in the

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.740
afternoon that you'll
actually build.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.170
Sit down, in three hours by the
end, you should have our

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:59.400
canned app and anything that
you can come up with.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.000
We'll go through the nitty
gritty of code, answer

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.690
questions, go through demos.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:06.220
And you'll become Hangout
App ninjas.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.450
And then finally, our developer
site has the

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.680
documentation that you need to
research if you're on the live

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.750
stream, and that's
developers.google.com/+, as in

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.690
the plus symbol, hangouts.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.895
And those are our Google+
profile links, so

00:57:20.895 --> 00:57:22.665
you can circle us.

00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:23.810
Some more questions?

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:24.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:25.300
Thank you, Johnathan.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.580
JOHNATHAN BERI: You're
welcome.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we're going
to actually have YouTube

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:30.270
come up and start plugging in
their laptops while you bring

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.830
down yours and we answer
a few questions.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.460
And we have a question from the
internet first. A lot of

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.940
people out there on
the internet.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.740
And they would like to know,
Jonathan, if they'll be able

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.650
to change the whole layout
of the Hangout

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.260
Window with the API.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.910
JOHNATHAN BERI: Currently,
we don't allow ability to

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.350
customize the layout.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:50.420
We just have APIs that detect
things about the layout.

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.570
So for example, if the chat pane
is open, you have an API

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.870
to know about that.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:58.130
Whether a user's using the app,
so if they've switched

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:00.300
off the app and they're just in
the Hangout, you can detect

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.570
things like that.

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:02.870
That's a great feedback.

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.820
We've heard that from a few
people, and we're looking for

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.550
ways to sort of customize
the experience

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.820
a little bit further.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:13.560
Do we have any questions from
the audience, the live in

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.980
here, in person audience?

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.825
I can see you in front of me,
and I can start to pressure

00:58:17.825 --> 00:58:19.100
you for questions
if you'd like.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.350
Oh, question over here.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.250
MALE SPEAKER: We use
Live Stream a lot

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.820
on the YouTube side.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.230
So one of the benefits of using
Live Stream is being

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.080
able to put in pre-rolls
and mid-rolls.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.690
Is it possible to do the same
on the Hangout Side?

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:38.730
JOHNATHAN BERI: So pre-rolls
and post-rolls.

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:42.450
There are some APIs around
muting somebody's video feed,

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:43.670
so you can black.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:48.592
We also have APIs do avatars,
so static images.

00:58:48.592 --> 00:58:50.770
I don't know if we had it in
this demo, but you can

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.220
actually even animate the
overlays, so you can display a

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.010
roll on top of the video feed,
it gets propagated over for

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.780
that particular person's feed,
and as part of the API, you

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.860
can integrate with that.

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:04.010
In terms of injecting right into
the feed, the APIs are

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.420
not there yet, but the overlays
are certainly

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.360
something you could do.

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:09.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.900
We have time for maybe one
or two more questions if

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.530
anybody's curious about Hangout
applications or

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:18.450
Hangouts in general, or what
Johnathan's favorite

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.250
restaurant in Texas is.

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.250
No?

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.750
MALE SPEAKER: Which is?

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is your
favorite restaurant in Texas?

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.610
JOHNATHAN BERI: I've
only been to two.

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.710
IHOP and--

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:28.900
oh, three.

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.760
All right, the Moonshine one is
over around the corner, or

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.100
Moonshiners?

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:32.830
It's pretty good.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.540
All right, thanks everybody.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.391
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:56.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, and I'm
sorry, I didn't introduce you.

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:01.150
Which, that's absurd of me.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm
waiting for you.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
ridiculous.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.410
You're going to be talking about
YouTube APIs and video

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:08.490
creation and curation, and some
pretty cool new stuff.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:10.260
And you've got a lot of friends
with you, don't you?

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes, I do
have a lot of friends.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.000
Hi, everyone.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.280
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.890
I work for YouTube.

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.530
And we'll be talking about
mobile content

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.580
curation and creation.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.370
Quick question.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:26.130
Who in the audience develops
mobile apps or

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:28.920
has a mobile strategy?

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.310
And who doesn't?

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:31.640
OK.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.500
If you don't, then maybe you
should go get a drink.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.710
Otherwise, this might be quite
interesting for you.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:41.720
So here's the agenda
for today.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.790
We'll talk about the
opportunity, what's happening

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.815
in YouTube mobile, and then talk
about creation, curation.

01:00:46.815 --> 01:00:49.290
So I'll talk about the APIs
that we have to enable

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:52.950
applications, then give you
examples of these applications

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.130
directly from our partners, and
then we'll talk a little

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.700
bit about consumption.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.770
Now a warning.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:03.630
We have nine demos, 20 minutes,
six companies will be

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.900
presenting, so this is going
to be a lightning talk,

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.100
lightning demo session.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.390
Hopefully, we'll try to maximize
your time here.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.270
So forgive me if we are going
super fast, but a lot of us

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.900
will be hanging out
later on today.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.310
So you have any questions after
this, please feel free

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.700
to stop by.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.220
Before we start, I would like to
give a shout out to people

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.800
on iStream, YouTube iStream,
since I know we quite a few

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.440
people watching as well.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.280
All right.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.050
So let's talk about
the opportunities.

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:37.750
Here's some stats that you
might find interesting.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.980
We are having about four billion
views on YouTube

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:47.600
daily, out of which in 2010, we
had about 200 mobile views.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.930
Last year, you can think about
how many we had if you have

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:56.160
any guesses, but actually,
the number was 600.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.110
So the mobile traffic
has tripled.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:03.450
Similarly for uploads, we're
getting 60 hours of video

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:08.240
uploaded to YouTube every
minute, out of which three

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.020
hours are coming from mobile
devices, and that number is

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:17.820
also growing very fast, which
brings us to creation.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.050
We will actually have demos from
Avid, WeVideo, who are

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:25.290
here, and I'll show an
application from Vlix.

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:26.430
First, let's start
with the API.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:30.530
So if you are building mobile
applications and you would

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.140
like to incorporate video
uploads to YouTube in your

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.720
app, you need to think
about authentication.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.420
We prefer OAuth2.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.200
It's your friend.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.300
Client Login works, but it's
bad, it has a lot of issues.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.390
Connections will probably drop
while you're uploading.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:48.440
We do support resumable uploads,
so for those of you

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.960
that have used it, that should
be pretty straightforward.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.480
If you haven't used it, it'll
allow you to pick up

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.430
where you left off.

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:57.455
Metadata is important, so make
sure that your uploads

01:02:57.455 --> 01:02:59.530
actually have the metadata
associated with it because

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:02.320
that helps us with video
discovery and recommendation.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.260
You need a developer key from
YouTube because that'll help

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:09.220
you analyze your uploads and
get additional analytics on

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.820
the actual performance
of the application.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.040
And there's a little secret I
would like to share with you

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.620
that is pretty frequently
overlooked.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.050
If you need application-specific
metadata

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:23.850
included in your upload, you can
actually use our developer

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:27.800
tags feature to associate
metadata that is only visible

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.340
to your application.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.790
So next, we'll have a demo
from WeVideo, one of our

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:35.760
application YouTube
API partners.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.060
I would like to invite John to
come up here and give a quick

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.743
overview of the company,
as well as the demo.

01:03:40.743 --> 01:03:43.780
All right, go for it, and
you have two minutes.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.715
JOHN CANNING: Right,
two minutes.

01:03:44.715 --> 01:03:46.630
That's a lightning round
[INAUDIBLE].

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Maybe three.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:50.420
JOHN CANNING: Greetings,
everybody.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.390
I'm John Canney with WeVideo.

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:55.200
WeVideo is an online
collaborative video editing

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.290
platform, and I am about to put
all those words together

01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:59.350
in one sentence.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.910
The reason is because that's
exactly what we do.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:06.430
We are hosted in a browser, but
now also, running on our

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:08.570
mobile phones.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.810
We're collaborative, so your
friends can work together,

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.220
share video from any part of
the world, just like we saw

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.040
earlier with the Google+
example.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.970
We're doing it with
video editing.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:21.190
And then, having the real time
One Touch export out to some

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.310
of your favorite services.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.290
Ours happened to be YouTube.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:26.040
So let me show you a demo.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.730
That's a whole lot more
meaningful than

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:28.800
talking about it.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.710
So the first thing is, I've
got my mobile phone.

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.770
Now the nice thing is, what I'm
going to do, I'm going to

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:37.660
go ahead and capture a picture
here of you fine people in the

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.260
crowd, lovely.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:39.630
Thank you.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.700
Thank you all for sitting
still on your laptops.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.710
That's appreciated.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.170
And then I'm going to
go ahead and upload

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.060
my media right there.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.380
So what I'm doing is I'm now
uploading it into a project

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.920
that I created for everybody
to share at South by

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.110
Southwest. So that's
one side of it.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.910
This is released now in the App
Store, able to get it on

01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:01.810
your smartphones and start
contributing and collecting.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.560
That's one side of it.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.260
The next side of it
is let's edit it.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.920
So this is going to
be coming soon.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.690
It's the tablet form
of our editor.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:14.220
And so what you now have is
all the stuff I've been

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.270
uploading, all the stuff my
friend Yostein has been

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:18.620
uploading, but in
an Editor Form.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.340
So I can sit there, go ahead
and play with it.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.960
We can notice the unfortunately,
we don't have

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.590
that exciting weather here, as
she was commenting earlier,

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.370
freezing out there,
the poor thing.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:30.560
But this is the power
of the platform.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.180
So you're shooting it on one
platform, editing it on

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.170
another, and sharing
it with friends.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.880
And then when I'm done, going
ahead, one touch, pushing it

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.520
to YouTube.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.400
So thank you very much,
we're WeVideo.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.815
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:44.065
JOHN CANNING: Thank you, Art.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.390
Thank you, John.

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:54.756
Now we'll have a
demo from Avid.

01:05:54.756 --> 01:05:57.516
Who in the audience has
heard about Avid?

01:05:57.516 --> 01:05:58.770
You're doing video editing?

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:01.240
Yeah, a fair amount
of hands up.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.320
And I'd like to introduce
[INAUDIBLE] from Avid, who is

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.138
going to tell us about
the company and

01:06:06.138 --> 01:06:08.790
give us a quick demo.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:12.964 --> 01:06:16.450
about a month ago, and I'm
going to very, very

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:17.700
briefly show you--

01:06:32.884 --> 01:06:36.868
I'm going to very briefly show
you how you can do big screen

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.860
editing on your [INAUDIBLE]
using the

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.852
Avid Studio for iPad.

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:45.334
There we go.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:49.567
Avid Studio for iPad, it's very
intuitive, you just open

01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:50.812
up a new project.

01:06:50.812 --> 01:06:53.053
You don't even have to
name it right away if

01:06:53.053 --> 01:06:54.298
you don't want to.

01:06:54.298 --> 01:06:57.037
I'm going to pull some clips
from my video library down

01:06:57.037 --> 01:06:58.282
into the storyboard.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:03.760
I don't have to worry about the
order that I put them in,

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.499
because it's going to be easy
to rearrange [INAUDIBLE] in

01:07:06.499 --> 01:07:07.246
the storyboard.

01:07:07.246 --> 01:07:08.496
[INAUDIBLE].

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.696
I can also capture video and
pictures from within the app.

01:07:19.696 --> 01:07:21.170
I'm going to put a still picture
from the airplane

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.020
yesterday down into the
storyboard, and I can add a

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:31.957
bit of Ken Burns effect on it
by doing a pan and zoom.

01:07:31.957 --> 01:07:34.628
There we go.

01:07:34.628 --> 01:07:41.146
We have some transitions here,
A to B. Also, I like the

01:07:41.146 --> 01:07:43.900
little [INAUDIBLE] fade there,
so I'm going to put it in

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.173
between my picture and video
clips, just to create smooth

01:07:47.173 --> 01:07:48.159
transitions.

01:07:48.159 --> 01:07:52.103
I can also put some standard
title in here.

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:53.582
This is [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:08.372 --> 01:08:11.314
I can move that around, maybe
there [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:25.660
--one that I really like, so I'm
going to put that at the

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.976
end of our storyboard.

01:08:27.976 --> 01:08:31.350
Since we're talking about being
your own personal VJ,

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:36.750
I'm going to call it like
it is, Wahoo YouTube.

01:08:41.936 --> 01:08:43.609
There we go.

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:45.890
I can also make that bigger.

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:50.229
And wouldn't it be nice if that
just was overlaid on top

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:52.800
of that last clip, that
last video clip?

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.229
I'm going to go ahead
and do that.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:57.540
It wouldn't be complete
without music.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.939
My iTunes library is right here,
so I can pull any track

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.939
onto the timeline.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:09.340
You've got three channels there
for audio, so if you

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.972
wanted to do music and overdub,
and if you wanted to

01:09:12.972 --> 01:09:15.490
put some Foley in there, however
you want to do it.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:19.510
It's just as easy to edit
the music channels

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:22.399
as it is the video.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:25.120
I'm going to make a clean
edit there, get rid of

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.382
the excess, and bang.

01:09:28.382 --> 01:09:29.632
We have a video.

01:09:35.543 --> 01:09:37.470
There we go.

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.740
It gets smoother
as you render.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.160
We don't even have time for that
today but it is a very

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.100
fast render.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.902
And once you're done with that,
you're going to put it

01:09:45.902 --> 01:09:47.380
right onto YouTube.

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.630
Simple, simple [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:52.775 --> 01:09:54.200
There we go.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.182
And that is Avid Studio
for iPad.

01:09:57.182 --> 01:10:23.240
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And if we
can switch back to the

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:26.820
projection screen?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.680
OK, so demo in this
category, Vlix.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.810
It's a mobile app for
smartphones that allows you to

01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:40.590
do video anything and special
effects right

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:41.900
there on your device.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.540
Vlix is an API partner
of YouTube.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.480
They also have a web app
on YouTube.com/create.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.250
And let's switch to the iPad
that I have here to give you a

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.500
quick demo.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:59.260
So the way it works, you can
actually shoot a video right

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.140
from the device, as you would
expect so I'm just going to go

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.120
ahead and do it.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.870
Here, hello, there's the bar.

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:10.160
How's it going?

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.910
All right.

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:13.890
And then I like the video,
so I'm just going to go

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:15.990
ahead and use it.

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:19.120
We can add a couple of effects,
so let me just

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.440
improve the contrast on it,
maybe I'll make it black and

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.400
white right here.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.650
And then--

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:35.910
you can't see the demo?

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:38.980
It's coming back?

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:39.870
MALE SPEAKER: We have
you on here.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:40.226
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

01:11:40.226 --> 01:11:41.476
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you
check your cables?

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Maybe
cable problem?

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:47.830
Should we switch
to our backup?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:09.810
OK.

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:13.810
So you guys can see that.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:18.240
Once I apply the effect, I can
hit Next, and then share it to

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.740
my social network, my
YouTube account.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.990
So it's pretty straightforward.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.045
OK, let's switch back to the
presentation screen.

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.920
So we will now talk
about Curation.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.390
Curation is very important to
us, and we have been adding a

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:40.880
lot of API support
to improve it.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.130
So if you're building a curation
app, what's important

01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:47.340
is search capability, again,
exposed via the APIs.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.720
You can find out what content
is related to a given video

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.050
that your user is playing.

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.590
Watch_later, you can discover
what has been saved for

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.900
watching, you can discover
programmatically

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.500
what has been watched.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.560
Trends and there's more APIs
coming, so if you're

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.350
interested in this category,
I'll be around later and

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:05.780
tomorrow, talk to me.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.560
And now we're going to have a
couple of more demos, starting

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.810
with Squrl.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.890
So let's try this [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.540
MARK: Hi.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:31.146
So I'm Mark, this is Michael,
we're co-founders of Squrl.

01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:35.630
At Squrl, trying to be the best
place to discover and

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.210
watch video on your
mobile device.

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:44.130
Right now, we're available for
the iPhone and the iPad.

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:46.770
We've been featured in the New
and Noteworthy Section of the

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.440
App Store and achieved the
rank of Number Six in

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.740
Entertainment Apps.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:58.020
We have millions and millions
of videos in our system,

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.140
thousands of feeds, hundreds of
providers, YouTube by far

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:07.580
being the largest.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.140
Having said all that, at the
end of the day, what we're

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.240
trying to do for our users is
get them to videos that they

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.110
care about.

01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:14.030
So how do we do that?

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:17.860
At Squrl, the first thing that
you do when you come in to our

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.570
app is we allow you to
personalize your video

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:22.190
experience.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:25.310
So you have the ability to
select from all the providers

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:28.670
that we have. These providers
match up to certain given

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:31.061
interest categories
inside of Squrl.

01:14:34.909 --> 01:14:36.352
MALE SPEAKER: Can we switch
to the overhead?

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:49.350
MARK: So for example, we have
technology, and Michael can go

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:53.720
through and add in different
providers that map to those

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.090
interest categories, news--

01:14:56.090 --> 01:15:00.546
Wall Street Journal, CBS
News, New York Times--

01:15:00.546 --> 01:15:04.922
it's basically building a
personalized channel guide.

01:15:04.922 --> 01:15:08.610
And when he's done with that,
he can get into our Fresh

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:11.840
section, give you a little
tutorial on how to use the

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.670
app, but you come into our Fresh
section, which is the

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.090
latest and greatest videos from
all the providers you

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:21.650
just selected put into a dynamic
playlist in that

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.880
interest category.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.810
So you can simply, he'll select
from Comedy, you can

01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:28.990
start watching video across all
those different providers

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.030
in a very nice, laid-back way.

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:33.920
Inside of Squrl, you can share
videos across your different

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.880
social networks, you can like a
video on Squrl, you can add

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.130
to your queue to watch later.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:44.160
We also have a section
called What's Hot.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.990
What's Hot is essentially
trending video that's trending

01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:51.320
across all those different
providers that we're tracking

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.030
and all the different
social networks.

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:58.880
And finally, you're able to sign
in or authenticate with

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.310
your YouTube account, Netflix
account, Twitter, or Facebook.

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.680
And if you sign in with your
social networks, you're

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.550
actually able to share video
directly and message directly

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:12.230
with your friends as well as see
their activity inside of

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:15.630
Squrl and use them as a jump-off
point for video.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.310
So thank you for having
us to YouTube.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.660
We really enjoy working with
their team and their APIs.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:30.460
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:34.380
And I would like to invite
Hannah from LinkTV to talk

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.310
about LinkTV and give
us a demo as well.

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.300
Thanks, Hannah.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.550
HANNAH EAVES: Thanks.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:43.360
Hey, everyone.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.330
I'm from LinkTV. LinkTV
is a national--

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.430
I guess we're going to switch
right to the demo.

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nope,
go ahead.

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:53.900
HANNAH EAVES: OK, all right.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.480
LinkTV is a national satellite
TV station, about 33 million

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.040
US households.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.800
We've won a Peabody Award for
curating and translating

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.720
Middle Eastern online and for
broadcast. And so basically

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.220
what we've done is we've done
a bunch of digital projects,

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:12.570
including a news website that
takes this kind of curation

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:15.910
and translation global and
brings them all onto a website

01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:18.575
and into some mobile apps that
I'm going to demo here, that

01:17:18.575 --> 01:17:21.520
are still kind of in the
prototyping stage.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.020
So what we do basically is about
80% of the content we

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.520
curate is from YouTube and plays
through the YouTube API.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.530
About 20% we produce
ourselves.

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:32.180
So we have environmental
programming, we cover Asia,

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.280
Asian bloggers, video
bloggers.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.390
And then we perform natural
language processing on YouTube

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:39.990
videos to pull out automatically
peoples, places,

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:41.360
organizations.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.710
We use Zymanta as a partner
for that piece.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.820
And then we use that to do a
live search to create related

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.130
content on the fly.

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:53.100
So I'm going to switch
to the demo now.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:56.270
If you want to sign up for this
app when it comes out in

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:58.860
summer, you can go to
linktvapps.com, and there's an

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.710
invite list there.

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:04.380
So here we have basically, kind
of your Home Screen, a

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.690
curated list you can see, from
all sorts of different

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:10.036
sources, Al Jazeera
English, ITN.

01:18:10.036 --> 01:18:11.910
We've got our own programming
here through

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:13.695
Earth Focus, Link Asia.

01:18:13.695 --> 01:18:17.440
We're also using these tags so
that you can see when we offer

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.010
the local perspective,
which is kind of one

01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:20.390
of our unique offerings.

01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:23.760
So here you see the Iranian
election form PressTV, so

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.800
that's the Iranian state

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.490
broadcaster that we're offering.

01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:30.425
And then we have also, we're
looking at the best raw video

01:18:30.425 --> 01:18:33.380
that you can see every
day based on what's

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.150
happening in the news.

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:37.360
So I'm just going to jump
into a video here.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.210
So here's everyone knows about
the KONY video, this is like

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:42.740
the biggest thing right now.

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.340
But you can see here, we've
got related information.

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.370
You might not know
who Kony is.

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:48.770
So we do in an automated way.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.250
So we're enhancing kind of
YouTube's metadata by creating

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:52.790
our own set of metadata.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:56.700
So Kony, Uganda, International
Criminal Court, and then we

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.160
also kind of bring in related
content from other sources,

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.690
articles, tweets, social
media, and other videos

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:06.770
related to this video.

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.560
So this is kind of just
the beginning.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.960
We also are building
out Map features.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.880
And there we go.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.010
There's kind of a preview of
kind of what the Map feature

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:21.223
is going to look like, and you
can check it out in summer.

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.473
Thanks.

01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:30.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:31.480
Is that yours?

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:31.880
HANNAH EAVES:: Yeah.

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:36.900
Thanks, Hannah.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.750
Next up is business.me.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.873
It's a very interesting
spin of curation.

01:19:40.873 --> 01:19:42.123
OSCAR MORENO: Thank you.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.220
OK, so we are business.me.

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.770
We are a personalized business
video network.

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.280
We focus on videos about
business topics, and we do

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.360
three things.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.520
We do curation, we have an
editorial team that selects

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.930
the best business videos and
organizes the videos in

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.230
different sectors.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.010
We do personalization.

01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:08.250
We use LinkedIn to tailor make
your views, depending on your

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.810
professional interests and
depending on your professional

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.040
connections.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.510
And we promote the contribution
of business

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:19.550
videos by allowing users and
companies to upload video or

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:20.690
share video.

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:25.920
So let's go to the demo, the
mobile web app is a prototype.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.510
We have focused on the
consumption of video.

01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:29.940
So you have several
views here.

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:33.065
The first one is the Editorial
Picks, which is our curation

01:20:33.065 --> 01:20:36.920
effort where we select the best
videos from the web about

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.090
business topics.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:41.060
Then you can go into your view
and you can sign in with

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.120
LinkedIn, and that way, we can
read your professional

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.330
interest. Also, what you
connections are watching in

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:50.620
business.me or are sharing, and
we can recommend videos

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.960
according to that information.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:21:00.100
And you can also go to different
sectors and browse

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.520
and choose the sector you have
interest, for example,

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.580
development and design, and
choose a video here from

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.120
Google developers, and watch
video in the iPad.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.030
So that's business.me.

01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:15.190
It's a personalized
business channel.

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:18.030
And it's the best place to
share and discover videos

01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.930
about business topics.

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.180
Thank you.

01:21:24.272 --> 01:21:24.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:25.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great pitch.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.810
Short and sweet.

01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:31.040
Next up is ShortForm, and I have
to say that ShortForm has

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.460
inspired the title
of this talk, The

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.680
Video in Your Pocket.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.993
Jeremy and Alex.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:40.840
JEREME MONTEAU: Thanks, Jarek.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.850
Hey, everybody.

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:44.600
I'm Jereme, a co-founder and
lead developer at ShortForm.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.020
And this is Alex,
whose official

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.110
title is Tallest Engineer.

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:52.260
At ShortForm, we're all about
VJs, and turning viewers into

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:55.860
VJs, and helping them create
amazing channels.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:59.130
VJs curate channels on ShortForm
just by watching

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.570
videos and clicking a button.

01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:03.550
They can then share those
channels with their social

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:07.800
networks via email, and a
variety of different ways.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.840
They can also embed their
channels on their website with

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.630
our embeddable widget.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:16.900
Viewers can then watch channels
at ShortForm by

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.650
clicking on that the links
that they get.

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:21.376
The videos can come from
YouTube, Hulu, and a variety

01:22:21.376 --> 01:22:22.980
of other sources.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.030
They can watch on all screens,
including TV or on Google TV,

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:30.760
we're a spotlight app there, the
desktop obviously, and now

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.970
tablet and mobile, which we're
going to give you an early

01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.220
preview of today.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.970
The first step to bring
ShortForm to mobile is

01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:41.160
providing a first class
viewing experience.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.250
So now, when mobile users click
through ShortForm links,

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.760
they'll receive a mobile
optimized web application.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.870
This is a channel about one of
my favorite subjects, my son.

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:57.320
So videos will play in their
embedded players in the page.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.920
As users scroll down the page,
more videos will load, and

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.710
they can see the
whole channel.

01:23:03.710 --> 01:23:08.010
So the next step to bringing
ShortForm to mobile is going

01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:10.335
to be allowing curation directly
from the mobile app.

01:23:10.335 --> 01:23:12.950
This is an early preview
as well.

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:15.470
People are going to be able to
click on Add, choose a channel

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:17.280
to put the video in,
and they're done.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.300
They can then share those
channels with their audience

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.550
just by clicking on Share from
them mobile app as well, and

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.720
then viewers will get the
first class viewing

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.890
experience.

01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:30.670
So I encourage all of you
to go become VJs today.

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.870
We're excited to announce that
we've opened up a weekly VJ

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:34.880
competition, so if your channel
is one of the top

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.980
performing channels on the
sites, you're eligible for

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.820
cash prizes.

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.350
So be heard, be a VJ.

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.090
Thank you very much.

01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:49.230
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:49.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.950
And then last but not least, I
wanted to chat a little bit

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:56.580
about video consumption and what
we're doing in this area

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.190
to enable applications.

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:01.180
So all the apps that you have
seen use our player, our

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.460
player API.

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.320
And on mobile specifically, we
have an iPhone player, which

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.470
allows you to actually embed the
video playback in a native

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.760
mobile application, so on
Android, in the web view, on

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.160
IOS, in UI web view.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.170
The Object Embed is another
mechanism, it's a legacy

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:19.190
mechanism that still works,
specific to Safari, it's done

01:24:19.190 --> 01:24:22.180
through Safari plug-in,
mobile Safari.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.910
Obviously, you can launch the
YouTube application on the

01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:26.670
mobile device if you wish.

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:28.930
Typically, it comes
pre-installed with the OS.

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.090
And then there's more coming.

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:32.760
We have a Code Lab at 3:00 PM,
so some of you in the audience

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.860
have signed up for
that Code Lab.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.880
The Code Lab is full, but it'll
actually be dedicated to

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.250
improving the video playback
experience for mobile.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:43.440
So I have two quick demos from
two companies that couldn't be

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.180
here today that really do very
interesting stuff when it

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.360
comes to optimizing the
playback experience.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.630
ShowYou is one of them.

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:53.550
It was ranked Best
Social Networking

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:55.890
App in the App Store.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:59.380
And then the next company
is NowBox, which is a

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.320
personalized guide that really
allows you to discover

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.080
interesting content on YouTube
and present your own

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.260
subscriptions in a way that
is very easy to consume.

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:11.590
So let's switch to the demo.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.260
Starting with ShowYou.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.630
So as you see, what ShowYou does
is presents videos on the

01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.570
wall that actually can
be discovered by

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:32.520
simply browsing it.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.580
So it's very interesting.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.940
It's a different type
of user experience.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.340
They also have social features,
they have featured

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.970
links, you can discover what
your friends have been

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.320
watching through connections
to social networks.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.690
And then the NowBox user
interface is also quite

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:50.760
interesting.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.690
If any one of you has a cable
box, this might look a

01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:57.570
similar, because the programming
that you get from

01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:01.860
Now Box resembles kind of
the familiar layout.

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.210
And based on your interest, they
actually build a complete

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:08.640
programming guide for you, so
you can just sit back, relax,

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.780
and watch the content that you
are already subscribed to, or

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.030
content that they have
recommended.

01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:17.190
All right.

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:20.770
And now, we have run out of
time, but we've done it.

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:24.625
So thank you very much, that's
[INAUDIBLE] demos.

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:29.116
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:29.116 --> 01:26:30.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great,
thank you.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.890
And do we have one or two
questions about these YouTube

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:37.440
APIs, or even any questions for
any of the presenters that

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.280
have come up and demoed
with you?

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:41.660
Yes.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.460
One second while I
run out to you.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: What inspired
y'all to do all this, because

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.390
it's amazing.

01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:50.000
I mean, wow.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.100
Y'all should give yourselves a
round of applause as well.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well I mean,
thank you very much.

01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:00.320
I think the credit goes to the
companies that presented.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.430
I mean, we rarely provide the
tools, but they're the ones

01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:03.700
that are innovating with it.

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.570
So I would like to give a
round of applause to our

01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:07.280
presenters.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.620
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:12.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Any
other questions?

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:15.211
You got one more question.

01:27:15.211 --> 01:27:18.120
Hold on, I'm going to
get by you here.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.510
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, cool.

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:22.510
I love all the content
curation.

01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:26.030
I was wondering if they had a
quick second to talk about how

01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:28.780
their curation and their apps
maybe integrates with

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.850
YouTube's already content
creation with like

01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:33.990
subscriptions and
stuff like that?

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.670
So you can integrate
subscriptions

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:38.500
programmatically.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.990
So if you subscribe to a
channel in an app, that

01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:43.630
subscription actually is
reflected in your YouTube

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:44.960
subscriptions.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.770
As well as your actions, for
example liking a video, can

01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:50.380
also be integrated,
so it actually

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.090
represents a like on YouTube.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:54.770
So the API allows you that.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We actually
have time for one more

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.300
question if you have it.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.380
No?

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.090
OK.

01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:03.260
Well then, let's go
right into Cloud

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.950
Adventures, I like that title.

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:06.710
We have Iein and Michael here.

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:09.930
They're going to talk to you
about spending your time on

01:28:09.930 --> 01:28:14.370
building your app, not
the infrastructure.

01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:14.810
IEIN VALDEZ: Whoa.

01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:15.530
Hello.

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:16.310
Hi, everyone.

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:19.350
I'm Iein Valdez with our Cloud
Developer Relations Team and

01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:21.710
Michael, and we're here to talk
about cloud adventures.

01:28:21.710 --> 01:28:25.210
Does anyone here build
apps today?

01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:26.050
A few people build apps.

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.420
Does anyone use the
cloud for apps?

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:28.770
Couple people.

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:29.610
All right, well this is great.

01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:31.030
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the cloud,

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:32.890
why you should care about it.

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.600
So the overview of the talk is
we're going to give a little

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.740
bit of history about web
application development, some

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:39.480
of the challenges like 10 years
ago, and where we are

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.790
today with App Engine and some
of our other products, talk a

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:44.420
little bit about some of the new
markets that are starting

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.780
to take advantage
of the cloud.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:47.890
The web was sort of the primary
market, but now we're

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:51.940
seeing mobile, gaming, and
big data start to be real

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.600
industries that are taking
advantage of the cloud.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.480
And then Michael's going to
talk about big query, big

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.680
data, and some of the things
we're doing there.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.650
So this is a picture of my life
about 10 years ago, when

01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:03.050
I was building web
applications.

01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:06.360
I basically had this very
complicated process of putting

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.820
together this stack and figuring
out how to launch an

01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.110
application.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.960
It took really, really a lot
of time for me to manage

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:12.610
everything.

01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:15.435
And then once I sort of figured
out the stack and I

01:29:15.435 --> 01:29:17.980
actually started to write the
application and we had users,

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:19.770
we actually had to figure out
how to scale the application,

01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:21.900
make sure the application was
running, and people could

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:22.870
actually get to our app.

01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:25.700
I spent a lot of time managing
machines, figuring out how to

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.540
get a database working, backing
the database up,

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.210
running the database, load.

01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:32.180
And then of course, the users,
which we were in the business

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.950
of making our users happy, we
actually did not spend a lot

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:35.230
of time on our users.

01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:37.300
We spent most of our time
managing our stack, and that

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.460
was really sad.

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.290
And things are very
different today.

01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:42.890
So just sort of recap some of
the problems when you're

01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:44.470
building large scale web apps.

01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:46.950
One is it's very difficult to
get up and running quickly,

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.890
and it's very difficult to
iterate on your application

01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:50.390
and get it to the cloud.

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:53.640
It used take three months to
get a stack ready, up and

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.370
running, and pushing out builds
was like a weekly to

01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:57.370
monthly process.

01:29:57.370 --> 01:29:59.060
Today, you can do that
very quickly.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.720
The infrastructure costs
were very painful.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.210
So managing the hardware,
data centers, bandwidth,

01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:06.100
multi-homing to make sure that
we were available if we one of

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.590
our data centers caught
on fire, very painful.

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:12.270
Back-ups, security upgrades, all
of this stuff we had to do

01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:14.800
to just to make sure our
app was running.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.730
And then databases were
super expensive.

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:18.340
So there's kind of two parts
to app developers.

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.300
There's one serving the request,
the other part is

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.740
actually persisting the data,
making changes on your mutable

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.840
data, and that was actually
really difficult.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.430
So these were lots and lots of
different problems, and this

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:29.730
was sort of why App Engine
was created to

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:30.840
simplify this process.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.100
And App Engine's philosophy is
to make it easy to build

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.820
applications number one,
easy to get started.

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.940
Easy to run and manage these
applications, so once you've

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.530
got it built and pushed, you
want to make it really easy to

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:43.950
kind of control it.

01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:45.970
And easy to scale, and this was
really the key thing was

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:49.160
that all of that work on
infrastructure was just to

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.370
solve the scale problem,
and so we

01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:52.050
packaged all that together.

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:53.740
And the other philosophy we
have is it's free to get

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.170
started and you pay
for what you use.

01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:57.580
So it's really easy to get your
app up and running, and

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.070
it's not just for web serving
but also for data persistence.

01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:03.940
So today, App Engine runs on
three languages, we have

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.860
Python, Java, and Go,
so it's pretty easy

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.710
to get up and running.

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:09.400
And I'm going to give you a
quick demo to actually show

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.710
you what it's like, how fast
you can get an app

01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:12.730
running in the cloud.

01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:15.100
So I'm on Mac OS and I have
the App Engine launched.

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.960
You can go to
appengine.google.com, download

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.130
this in a few minutes.

01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:20.790
It runs on Mac OS,
Linux, Windows.

01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:22.290
And I'm using the
Python version.

01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:24.230
We're just going to create
a quick app here.

01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:26.200
We're going to call
this Iein Demo.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.150
And the nice thing about this
is it gives you a little

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.170
starter project.

01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:30.640
And this starter project
is basically your

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.860
typical Hello World.

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.680
There's a few files for
configuration, but the main

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.480
application here really
is this Hello World.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.350
So let's just say, Hello SXSW.

01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:44.390
And I'm able to then run my
application on my machine in a

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:46.540
disconnected state and
test and build it.

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.120
So here's my application.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.870
Pretty easy, it's running
locally on my machine, I can

01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:51.060
make changes and iterate.

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.450
But now, let's see what it takes
to get this application

01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:55.360
into the cloud up and running.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.920
So we go back to our App Engine
Launcher, and we can

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.400
click Deploy.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.400
And what this is basically
going to do is take my

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.010
application, package up the
files, and push it up to

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.700
Google's cloud.

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:09.020
So I've got my dashboard here,
and let's take a look here.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.990
IeinDemoAppSpot.com, and there's
my application up and

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.700
running in the cloud.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.420
So in literally a matter of
seconds, you can take your

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.540
application, your code on your
laptop, package it and have it

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.530
running in the cloud, and have
millions of users hitting your

01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:22.090
application.

01:32:22.090 --> 01:32:24.580
So that is super, super easy.

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.880
So that's a quick demo.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.690
Let's talk about some of the
core features of App Engine.

01:32:27.690 --> 01:32:30.340
So in terms of serving web
requests, we have sort of a

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.120
few core features.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.420
We have front ends for short
bursty requests, we have back

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.590
end for long, long-limbed
requests, or maybe you want to

01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.410
run code in the background
a lot.

01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:40.920
Task Queues, to be able to queue
up work, and we Cron for

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.760
scheduling.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.720
So there's some nice
features built in.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.320
From the storage layer, we
have a couple different

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:46.820
technologies.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:51.410
We have our Data Store, which
is really our key values

01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:52.930
store, basically in the
cloud, very scalable.

01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:56.000
We have CloudSQL, which is a
MySQL in the cloud, as well as

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.430
a high performance Memcache
layer to really aid

01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:00.070
performance.

01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:02.230
Services we have a number of
really powerful services.

01:33:02.230 --> 01:33:05.960
We have Users API, Mail API,
Image, URL Fetch, MapReduce, a

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.750
really cool one called
TrafficSplitting, which

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:10.300
actually lets you deploy
multiple versions of your

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:13.610
applications and do AB testing
really simply.

01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:17.300
So the key thing here is that
all of these services, from

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.340
the compute, storage, and users,
mail, et cetera, these

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:22.770
are all managed for you.

01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:24.470
These are building blocks that
just run as a service.

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:26.580
You don't have to configure and
install software to make

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.030
these things work.

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.190
So let's talk a little bit about
where we are today in

01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:30.650
the market.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:33.290
So App Engine today serves over
five billion daily hits.

01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:35.430
We have over a million
applications running on the

01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:38.590
platform, and 150,000 active
developers building.

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:40.430
And you can see when we started
out in 2008, the

01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:42.860
trajectory of this has just
been sort of going up over

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:43.890
time as we've added features.

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:47.320
So it's a platform that you can
launch your application

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.310
and know that it's going to
be there and running.

01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:53.260
So I wanted to give a quick
example of what it was like to

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.630
quickly launch and host and
run an app in the cloud.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:59.310
So hopefully everyone here
uses Google, and you know

01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:00.650
there's the turkey
doodle, right?

01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:03.010
And so this was actually an idea
of one of the engineers,

01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:05.390
he wanted to build this turkey
doodle and launch it very

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.140
quickly, and he didn't really
know what tools to use.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:11.430
So he decided to try out App
Engine and Go, and put this

01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:12.260
turkey doodle together.

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.320
And so he was able in 24 hours
to basically create this

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.040
doodle, test it, and launch
it on the Google homepage.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.440
So this is kind of a
cool little doodle.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.770
It's an interactive doodle, you
can kind of click here and

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.890
customize your turkey, and
there's a sort of a slot

01:34:23.890 --> 01:34:27.790
machine effect here so you
can get a random turkey.

01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:29.660
Doodle and then you can, of
course, link and share with

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:30.060
your friends.

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:33.520
So the point was, this engineer
was able to use the

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.380
tools that are available to you,
build this doodle, and

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:37.740
launch it to millions of users
in a day, and you have that

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:42.180
same technology at your
disposal, which is very cool.

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.495
So quickly, a couple
of other--

01:34:44.495 --> 01:34:46.810
and just as we talked about,
web was really a primary

01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:48.370
driver, a great use case,
but now we have

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:49.580
cloud-enabled mobile.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.660
So we have a massive number of
mobile devices coming online.

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.740
Everyone has a smartphone in
their pocket, they're becoming

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:55.390
internet-enabled, they're
generating

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:57.040
lots and lots of traffic.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.560
Apps now share state, they're
no longer self-contained.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.480
So they're making API
calls to back ends

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.410
and third party apps.

01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:04.680
They're social graph
enabled, right?

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.960
You're pulling your friend
network in and so forth.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.890
And of course now, there's video
upload and download.

01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:11.720
So there's lots of information
being generated, you need to

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.460
serve this traffic.

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.770
How do you actually do that if
you're a mobile developer and

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.580
you don't know anything about
serving infrastructure?

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.750
So that's where you can use
something like App Engine.

01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:22.620
I wanted to give a quick story
about a great case for this,

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.170
which is Outfit 7, they build
the Talking Tomcat apps, and a

01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:27.980
bunch of apps you're probably
familiar with.

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.550
It's interesting because they
have, I think, over 14

01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:32.510
applications launched.

01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:36.020
They now have over 350 million
downloads of their apps.

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:39.410
Every day, over a million new
users on mobile devices are

01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:41.010
installing this application.

01:35:41.010 --> 01:35:43.080
And they're available in 120
different countries.

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.940
So that is a massive
amount of scale.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.190
How do you actually
make your app run?

01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:49.940
And they use App Engine
as part of their

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.430
infrastructure back end.

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:53.080
Another great use case
is Pulse Mobile.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.140
So this is another example of a
mobile back end for Android,

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.270
IOS, Kindle.

01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:59.860
Pulse is a news reading
application.

01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:02.430
They use the Python runtime,
they're serving thousands of

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:05.410
queries per second, 100 million
daily requests coming

01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:08.580
out of the platform, and it's
very cost effective for them.

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:12.050
So another example of a great
mobile use case to power your

01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:14.240
application.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.710
Another really interesting
market that's starting to take

01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:19.390
advantage of cloud as
well is gaming.

01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:21.570
So I was just at the GCC
conference, Game Developers'

01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:23.360
Conference, and it was really
fascinating to see all the

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.530
developers out there, and cloud
was a really big topic.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.760
So there's this really
interesting shift of a new

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:28.610
distribution model.

01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:31.080
Sort of the old world was the
day when you had game

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.930
cartridges or DVDS or CDs, and
that's how you actually played

01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:36.390
games, you put these things in
your gaming console on your

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:37.480
desktop and you ran it.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.060
And we're now transitioning to a
new world of gaming, I think

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.180
partly to the desktop, which
is kind of fascinating.

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.860
So Chrome has this thing called
Native Client where you

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:48.540
can actually take your C, C++,
or any native code, run it

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.500
through the Chrome Sandbox,
and actually deliver those

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.640
games into the browser.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.740
Very, very fascinating.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:56.730
There's also HTML5 native games,
so you can run pretty

01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:58.570
powerful games in the
browser alone.

01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:00.760
And then there's sort of all in
the cloud, meaning gaming

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:01.880
is fully running in the cloud.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.970
A great company that's actually
doing this OnLive,

01:37:03.970 --> 01:37:05.830
and they're essentially running
the entire game on a

01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:08.540
server somewhere else, and
they're just shipping the bits

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.020
over the wires, so you can just
play from any console.

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:12.780
It's very, very, very cool.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:15.310
So how can App Engine help
you with gaming?

01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:16.240
Well, there's a couple
of things.

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.770
All of these games of lots and
lots of static assets, so big

01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:21.340
files that need to be served.

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.400
Data store for managing your
scores, games, leader boards,

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:24.960
and so forth.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.730
So you need to be able
to have a scalable

01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:29.030
database to handle that.

01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:32.170
As well as for HTML5 games,
being able to serve up your

01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:34.860
web apps, HTML, JavaScript,
and so forth.

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:37.260
So just a couple quick examples
of gamers that are

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.080
taking advantage of this.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.360
Rovio built Angry Birds in
collaboration with us, and

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.250
it's a fully native web game,
HTML5, it's using play and

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:47.120
frame, our Google Web Toolkit,
Google+ integration, and App

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.660
Engine actually serve and run
all of this in the cloud.

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.360
So it's a great game,
check it out.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.920
Chrome.angrybirds.com.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:55.040
Another really good game in
the Chrome Web Store is

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.650
FieldRunners, that's another
example of a game.

01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.200
So just to sum up, and I'm
going to hand it off to

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.790
Michael here in a second.

01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:04.390
Think of using App Engine as,
it's a platform that's going

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:06.640
to allow you to be nimble focus
on your application.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.780
It's perfect for web apps,
games, and mobiles.

01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.590
So a great use case is, if
you're building any of these

01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:13.310
things, really take a look at
the cloud and App Engine.

01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:15.460
Focus on your application and
not the infrastructure.

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:16.400
Don't worry about managing.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.710
You're not going to be an
expert, just let us do the

01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:20.090
heavy lifting for you.

01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:22.340
And so running the app is
easy, but how do you

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.280
fine tune it, right?

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.440
There's all this data
being generated.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.370
Are your users happy?

01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:26.420
How can you take advantage
of this?

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.360
How can you help make your
application better?

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.000
And I think that's where all of
this massive amount of data

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.080
that's being generated, you need
to sort of figure out how

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.250
you can derive insight from
this before it's too late.

01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.200
And that's where sort of these
big data technologies are

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.190
really starting to come into
play, and Michael's going to

01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:40.100
talk about big data.

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.142
So thanks, guys.

01:38:43.142 --> 01:38:44.486
[APPLAUSE]

01:38:44.486 --> 01:38:45.240
MICHAEL: Hey, everyone.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.350
Can you guys all hear me?

01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:47.550
Yeah?

01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:48.570
So yeah, thanks for
being here.

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:50.090
My name is Michael, I
work with Iein on

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.313
the Cloud Devel Team.

01:38:51.313 --> 01:38:54.420
OK, So if you've read a tech
blog in the last three months,

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:56.740
you've heard the term "big
data." it's a buzzword.

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.200
It means two things when
it's a buzzword.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.370
One, nobody knows what
it is, and two,

01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:01.380
there's a lot of hype.

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:04.240
But I think there's a lot of
validity in using big data

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.120
analytics for all kinds of
applications, and I'm very

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.260
passionate about this.

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.970
The other cool thing about this
sort of like hype around

01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:13.300
big data is that there's a lot
of cool tools coming out,

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.500
things that we couldn't even
have imagined two years ago.

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:16.490
And I'm going to talk
about one of them

01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:18.450
today, Google Big Query.

01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:20.270
But if you're interested in
doing something with data

01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:21.930
analytics, I'm going to
tell you a story.

01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:23.800
You probably know the story if
you've already done this, and

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.290
if you're thinking about getting
into it, you're going

01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:26.420
to learn this story.

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:27.670
So let's start with
a single record.

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:28.630
Here's a single record.

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.390
It's easy to work with,
it fits on your local

01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:32.920
workstation, you can develop
with it without having to

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.340
worry about extra hardware
or extra infrastructure.

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.020
And your manager, and in fact,
this happened to me last week.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.900
My manager came up to me and
said, we need to build a data

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.920
visualization app based on some
of the data you have. And

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.960
I said great, simple.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:45.870
No problem, right?

01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:47.210
You just build it.

01:39:47.210 --> 01:39:49.320
You can use the same kind of web
stack you're normally used

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.150
to, same tools on your
workstation, you're fine.

01:39:52.150 --> 01:39:53.710
Well, it's a hit.

01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:55.480
Now you're a mobile gamer, and
you decide, well, I want to

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.180
build a crowd-sourced app that
shows you which buildings are

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.960
best suited for defending
against zombie attacks or

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.670
something, right?

01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:05.260
So you're using crowd-sourced
data, a lot of data, now you

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.140
have a million records.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:06.640
No, wait.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.450
Now you really have a million
records, right?

01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:09.510
You have a lot of data.

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:10.730
Now, this is still OK.

01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:12.740
You could probably handle this
on the normal application

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.510
stack that you have, some of
the software that you're

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:16.450
using, you're used to.

01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:19.070
But there's going to be a point
where those tools may

01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:21.570
not work, and that's when you
get something like a billion,

01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:22.880
and now you've got a
big data problem.

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.060
So what are some of the things
that you might have to do when

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.220
you get to billions of records,

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:27.950
gigabytes of gigabytes.

01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:30.450
Well, maybe you shard your
traditional MySQL database.

01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:33.590
Maybe you buy new software,
you're switching from one

01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:36.250
stack to another, you're going
from a relational model to a

01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:37.780
no SQL model.

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.700
Or maybe you're preprocessing
data for analytics.

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.270
So you're running your
traditional MySQL database

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:46.090
overnight to get some
kind of results.

01:40:46.090 --> 01:40:47.570
And then maybe you need
more employee time or

01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:49.350
you need more employees.

01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:50.750
And that's when things
get a little crazy.

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:52.410
Then your database starts
looking like the Borg

01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:54.450
spaceship and you've got
terabytes of data, and then

01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:56.160
you're in real trouble, because
then maybe you have to

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.110
rethink your whole system.

01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:00.430
So let me tell you about
scale, right?

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:03.090
So as you move from paradigm
to paradigm, what happens?

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:07.190
Well, you can maybe predict the
cost of new storage, or

01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:09.660
instances, or virtual machines,
there may be a fixed

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:10.660
cost there.

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.850
But moving from gigabytes to
terabytes, moving from

01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:14.420
paradigm to paradigm,
I don't know.

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.240
You don't know what it costs.

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.040
It's hard to predict.

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.820
And new expertise, new
employees, these are things

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.230
that are hard to predict.

01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:23.150
So the total cost of
your scale-up,

01:41:23.150 --> 01:41:24.860
you don't know, right?

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.180
And so when you don't know,
you're not in the application

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:28.800
business anymore.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.260
You're in the infrastructure
business.

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.600
And you're an application
developer.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.830
You're making a game, you're
making a crowd-sourced mobile

01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:35.280
app, something like that.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.540
So you don't want to be in the
infrastructure business.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:39.410
Google's been down this
road too, right?

01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:41.960
When we were called BackRub and
we were just a glimmer in

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.590
a Stanford graduate student's
eye, we had 26 million pages

01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:46.400
in our index, right?

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.550
And then two years later,
we had a billion.

01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:50.720
So our data just scaled
enormously and we had to come

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.176
up with new tools
to handle this.

01:41:52.176 --> 01:41:54.420
And then it quadrupled in the
next couple years, and then we

01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:55.800
added an Image index.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.830
And then by, let's see, 2008,
it hit a trillion, right?

01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:00.150
So we've been down this road.

01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:02.470
And now it's 2012, I think
we're at a gazillion.

01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:04.940
I don't know what the number
is, some huge number.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.410
So that brings to
Google BigQuery.

01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:08.530
OK, so what is Google
BigQuery?

01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:11.170
Google BigQuery is our
tool for analyzing

01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:12.330
massive data sets.

01:42:12.330 --> 01:42:15.040
It uses a SQL-style language
that you may already be used

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.570
to, makes it easy to write
queries on this data.

01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:20.910
But the best part about it, as
a developer the thing I love

01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:23.160
is it's an API, it's
a service.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:26.130
You make calls to it via API,
you can use the programming

01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:28.890
language of your choice,
it's a RESTful API.

01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:30.350
So we use this technology
internally.

01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:31.770
We've written a few
papers about it.

01:42:31.770 --> 01:42:33.950
Internally, we call it Dremel,
and you can read the paper,

01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:35.260
the research paper we
published, if you're

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.075
interested.

01:42:36.075 --> 01:42:38.080
Without getting too technical,
I know this is a lightning

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.910
talk, I don't have a lot of
time, but it's really great

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:40.320
information.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.170
We basically store the data in
a colander format, and it

01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:47.800
helps us retrieve these kind
of queries quickly.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.250
And so I'll show you a demo
in just a second.

01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:52.530
One thing I want to tell you is
the way you use it is that

01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:54.970
you take your data in CSV format
and you send it to

01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:55.940
Google's cloud.

01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:59.290
Once in there, you can ingest it
into the BigQuery data set,

01:42:59.290 --> 01:43:01.790
and then it allows you to
run queries via API.

01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:05.870
So since this is an API, we're
able to actually build a

01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:06.750
browser client.

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:08.550
So when you sign up for
BigQuery, you have access to a

01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:10.630
web browser tool, and that's
actually built

01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:11.430
on top of the API.

01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:13.590
So it's kind of like a way for
us to dog food our own

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:15.360
technology, so I'll show
you an example.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.590
So here's this BigQuery
window.

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:18.200
This is a tool that let's
you browse queries.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.100
You can see, I've been playing
with us today, there's a lot

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:20.890
of queries.

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:22.500
I'm going to show you how
fast this thing is.

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.020
This is pretty remarkable.

01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.750
We couldn't do a lot of the
things at Google without the

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:29.180
speed that this technology
allows us to run queries with.

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:31.810
The first thing I'm going to
show you is a data set of all

01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.330
the revision history of
Wikipedia up until about 2010,

01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:36.200
which is a lot of data.

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.640
So let's count the records in
this data set, and I'll give

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.880
you a sense of how fast
this tool is.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.080
So right now I'm running--

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.350
two seconds.

01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:48.190
In two seconds, we return
the result.

01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:52.062
I don't know if you can see it,
make it a little bigger.

01:43:52.062 --> 01:43:54.290
330 million records
in that data.

01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:56.020
So in two seconds, we
retrieved a count.

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.340
Now, the fun thing to do with
this data set is to see what

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.640
were the most revised
articles, right?

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.420
Which articles got the
most attention?

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.000
So let's do this query,
this will tell us.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.890
Let's run that and see
how long this takes.

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:09.190
The most revised.

01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:11.140
Try to think about it before--
it's already done.

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.020
George W. Bush.

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.060
And I'm always fascinated by
this, followed by World

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:17.350
Wrestling Entertainment
employees pages.

01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:20.460
I think I know why George W.
Bush might be revised a lot.

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:21.870
I wasn't sure about the
World Wrestling thing.

01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:23.410
I think it's because there's a
lot of fanboys and they like

01:44:23.410 --> 01:44:25.910
to add new stuff, the plot
lines are going on.

01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:28.760
So I was looking at this data
set and I thought, you know, I

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.330
want to know why these
things are revised.

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:33.160
So I started looking at the
George W. Bush article, and I

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.200
realized that when people revert
due to vandalism, they

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.630
have a comment in the
revision history,

01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:38.690
reverted due to vandalism.

01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:42.190
So I wanted to see how many
articles were reverted due to

01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:44.720
vandalism or contained vandalism
in the comments?

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.160
And what's fun about BigQuery is
it's so blazingly fast, you

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.190
can run these ad hoc queries
over and over.

01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:50.620
So let's see if I can
find that one.

01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.970
Sorry, I have to
zoom out a bit.

01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:54.670
Oh yeah, here we go.

01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:58.620
So let's see, vandalism in the
Revision History comments.

01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.672
The answer may surprise you.

01:45:00.672 --> 01:45:02.090
Ah, five seconds, right?

01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:06.960
So we went through 100 million
rows in five seconds.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.740
Yes, George Bush, a lot of
comments about vandalism, and

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.270
then Wikipedia itself, and
then Neopets, right?

01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:14.326
And so I gave this talk at
another place and I said, you

01:45:14.326 --> 01:45:15.845
know, I would probably
vandalize the Neopets

01:45:15.845 --> 01:45:17.120
Wikipedia article.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.880
And then Led Zeppelin, the
controversial band Led

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.100
Zeppelin, and then
Adolf Hitler.

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.580
So this is great, right?

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.940
This just shows you the power of
being able to query across

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.950
these massive data sets.

01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:28.760
So I'm interested
in Wikipedia.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.300
One of my coworkers at Google
gave me access to a Wikipedia

01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.730
data dump of the actual text.

01:45:33.730 --> 01:45:34.900
This is just the revision
history.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.530
That's a very enormous set.

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:39.450
And I'm interested in bias, bias
language, because that's

01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:41.280
something I'm interested
in studying.

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.090
So I tried to write
this web app.

01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.840
Let's see if this
thing will work.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:47.090
This is the Wikipedia
Weasel text finder.

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:51.160
So Weasel Words in Wikipedia
are words that have bias

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.500
language or bias
phrases, right?

01:45:57.650 --> 01:46:01.060
So language like, "without a
doubt" or, "it should be

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.100
noted." So the Wikipedia editors
consider this language

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.590
to be indicative of bias.

01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:08.030
So I wanted to see, what
articles contain

01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.480
some of this language?

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.040
So I wrote this app that
actually scans the Wikipedia

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:16.150
text and in seconds, returns
articles that contain some of

01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:16.870
this information.

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:19.140
So here's "many are of the
opinion." Now let's just pick

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.640
a random one like Menahem
the Essene.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.610
Now if you go to this site, and
you can't really see it

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.960
well, but it looks like somebody
has already tagged

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.720
this as a Weasel Word, or maybe
this is an automated

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.170
process, I don't
actually know.

01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:30.030
It's a Weasel Word.

01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:31.630
So "many are of the opinion,"
bias language.

01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:34.250
So I wanted to go back and see,
well, what about articles

01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:36.200
with "it should be noted,"
or "without a doubt?"

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.510
Let's take a look.

01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:39.640
And I'm scanning the
entire Wikipedia

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.650
corpus in seconds, right?

01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:42.770
So here we go.

01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:45.170
Here's a random sampling of
articles that contain this

01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:47.350
bias language.

01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:49.810
Here's one, "it should be
noted." So I don't know what

01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:53.500
this airport is, but it should
be noted, and it's not marked

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:53.960
as Weasel Text.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.560
So imagine what you could
do with this tool.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.990
You could do a daily scan and
look for biased language in

01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.890
seconds, right?

01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:00.480
And you don't have to worry
about the kind of crunching

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.980
away, buying new servers,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:08.120
It's all in API, and
it's very fast.

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:11.440
So let's just recap this.

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.550
So I wanted to get two
points across to you.

01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:15.475
One, your data analysis need
should scale with your data.

01:47:15.475 --> 01:47:17.090
You shouldn't hop from paradigm
to paradigm to

01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:20.290
paradigm if you know you're
going to scale up.

01:47:20.290 --> 01:47:21.810
Your cost and technology
should be predictable.

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:22.920
That's the thing a lot of people
forget when they're

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.580
doing big data is they go from
software to software, and it's

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.550
great, and then they forget
about the cost of switching,

01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:29.950
the cost of maintaining,
the cost of hardware.

01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:32.450
And finally, don't build
infrastructure.

01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:33.060
Build your app.

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.250
You're app developers, right?

01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:36.990
So you can use this tool to
build cool mobile games,

01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:39.400
crowd-sourced tools,
visualizations, dashboards.

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.440
We have people using it to
build game analytics

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:44.550
technology, we have people doing
things like with hotel

01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:48.050
and hospitality industry, just
amazing amounts of data, and

01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:50.030
being able to do real time
dashboards with this tool.

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:51.780
It's great.

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.050
So that's all I have for this.

01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:54.500
I'm going to leave
this up here.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.470
This presentation that I made is
actually in App Engine now,

01:47:57.470 --> 01:48:00.470
and if you want to learn more,
AppEngine.google.com is where

01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:03.710
you can go for App Engine, and
developers.google.com/bigquery,

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:05.370
and that's how you can
get ah old of us.

01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:09.800
And I think we have just enough
time for questions.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:12.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes, questions
about the cloud.

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:14.360
We do actually have
some time for a

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.610
fair number of questions.

01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.960
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sorry
if I came in a

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.460
little late for this.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.430
What's the pricing
model for the--

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:24.940
MICHAEL: Are you talking about
the BigQuery pricing model?

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.430
MALE SPEAKER: The BigQuery.

01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:28.210
MICHAEL: So this actually,
we're still in limited

01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:30.070
preview, and we haven't
launched an official

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.460
pricing model yet.

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.930
The one thing I can say is, the
cost of storing the data

01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:36.610
is very similar to Google Cloud
Storage, it's a very

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:39.820
similar pricing model to that.

01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.085
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More questions
from the live audience?

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.140
No questions?

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:48.070
All right.

01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:49.380
Oh wait, we got someone.

01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:52.380
Last minute questions.

01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.670
MALE SPEAKER: When do you expect
the big data stuff to

01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:55.400
be launched?

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.400
MICHAEL: This particular
product is

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.720
very soon, very soon.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:01.516
Like maybe a month,
a month or two.

01:49:01.516 --> 01:49:03.940
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, I know a lot
of times, the first time

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:06.750
you run a query it's slow, and
then later on, SQL cache

01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.570
catches up and it
becomes faster.

01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:11.170
Does that happen here, do
queries get faster the more

01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:12.930
you run them, or
what kind of--?

01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:14.790
MICHAEL: We don't have any
caching on the server.

01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:17.060
You can do your own caching, and
that's a strategy a lot of

01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.130
people use, but we
don't do any.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.960
Anything else?

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:24.800
I will say one last thing.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.650
If you're interested in using
BigQuery, you can sign up for

01:49:26.650 --> 01:49:29.560
the limited preview and use it
before we do the general.

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:32.785
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions.

01:49:32.785 --> 01:49:37.020
Ooh, questions beget
questions.

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.970
MALE SPEAKER: So is this useful
both with structured

01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:40.460
data and unstructured data?

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:42.450
MICHAEL: So this is for what we
call semi-structured data,

01:49:42.450 --> 01:49:43.660
it's basically structured
data.

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.570
We support a limited amount
of data types.

01:49:45.570 --> 01:49:46.340
MALE SPEAKER: What about
like [INAUDIBLE]

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.170
search and those things?

01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:50.120
MICHAEL: That's maybe
an App Engine thing?

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.330
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we can do
that with App Engine, so you

01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:55.370
can put your data into the data
source, SQL, [INAUDIBLE].

01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:04.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Any more
last minute questions?

01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:09.510
Going once, going twice,
going one to 100 times.

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:10.370
All right, thank you.

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:19.290
[APPLAUSE]

01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:21.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --around
with HTML5 a lot.

01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:24.140
Paul is here to talk to
you about just that.

01:50:29.585 --> 01:50:31.320
PAUL IRISH: I think we have like
a bunch of seats up here

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.710
if you want to fill in.

01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:35.090
Make sure it's not [INAUDIBLE]
crowded back there.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.330
One, two, three, four.

01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.550
Beautiful.

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.542
All right.

01:50:59.542 --> 01:51:02.040
OK, I guess we'll get started.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:02.760
My name is Paul.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.720
I work on the Chrome Team doing
developer relations.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:09.240
And so I like to talk a lot
about how to build web apps

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.654
and what are the new things
inside the browser that you

01:51:11.654 --> 01:51:12.900
get to play with.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:16.705
This talk in particular, we're
going to talk about the new,

01:51:16.705 --> 01:51:20.300
new new, hot stuff, and some of
the cool features that you

01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:24.180
have. So these sort of things
are available in Chrome

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.560
Canary, so Chrome Canary's a
daily build, you get an update

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.760
about once a day.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:32.900
So it's all live, fresh new
stuff, not too many bugs, it's

01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:34.380
pretty solid.

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:37.740
I like to run it side
by side with Sable.

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:41.040
But a lot of these are also in
other browsers too, like a

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.830
Firefox Nightly and
Upper Next.

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.220
So this is what we're going
to talk about today.

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:49.710
Firstly, we're going to stop
with some CSS, kind of what we

01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:50.505
have as far as styling.

01:51:50.505 --> 01:51:53.640
We'll get into some APIs that
are appropriate for games.

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:57.920
Then we're going to talk about
being a nice person to users,

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.880
and like saving their battery.

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.530
I'm plugged in, but my battery
dies all the time, so we're

01:52:04.530 --> 01:52:07.320
talking about how to be very
conscientious about that,

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.650
which I think is a good thing.

01:52:09.650 --> 01:52:12.000
And then I'm going to round up
with some real time voice and

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.240
video stuff that I'm really
quite excited about.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:16.740
All right.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:18.490
We're going to kick off, get
right into it, we're going to

01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:19.740
talk about CSS Regions.

01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:25.600
So CSS Regions is a really
powerful thing, and a lot of

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.360
this work actually
came from Adobe.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.085
So here we have a layout with
just some Lorem Ipsum.

01:52:32.085 --> 01:52:35.720
But you see we have a column
here, the text goes over to

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:39.410
here, and we have kind of this
area down here with a picture,

01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.940
and then again

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.330
two columns down there.

01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:45.660
So semi-complicated layout,
not too bad.

01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.730
But we're using regions.

01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:52.490
And so what that means is that
we've defined these regions.

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:56.260
I'm going to zoom out
once more up here.

01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:57.030
OK, cool.

01:52:57.030 --> 01:53:02.520
So I'm defining my boxes and
the geometry of my page.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.440
And then I have my content,
which actually has all the

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.910
paragraph text.

01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:10.200
So that means that the paragraph
text is just kind of

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.310
filling from box to box.

01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:15.130
And so I'm going to add Content
Editable, I'm just

01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:18.420
using the Chrome Dev tools and
adding Content Editable.

01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:20.950
This allows me to
edit this text.

01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:26.320
And so I could add in some
Chrome hearts HTML5,

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.070
something like that.

01:53:29.070 --> 01:53:30.990
And maybe I'll just
paste it a bunch.

01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:34.500
So you can see it's actually
pushing the text down into the

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.890
next column.

01:53:35.890 --> 01:53:40.120
So this text is flowing from one
to the next to the next.

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.710
So I'm really excited about
this because it basically

01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:45.670
allows for magazine
style layout.

01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:48.480
Layout's always been a
challenge, but Regions gives

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.920
us a lot of power.

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.570
This right here is a prototype
browser build from Adobe, and

01:53:54.570 --> 01:53:56.960
I'll show a few demos
from this one.

01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.510
So this is similar to
the last one, I just

01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:59.950
have these three boxes.

01:53:59.950 --> 01:54:03.210
I'm going to resize it, and
you'll see the text is flowing

01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:05.580
from one to the next to
the next, just kind of

01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.830
filling up the space.

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.935
This is all just purely
defined in CSS.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:19.600
In addition to Regions, the spec
also captures exclusions.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.310
So this is, I want a circle
and a heart, and I want my

01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:27.510
text to work around that, so
I've defined my shapes.

01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:30.780
This is also completely dynamic,
so I could just

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:31.450
define this.

01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:33.910
The text is just working its
way right around that.

01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:36.590
This is the Debug View, kind
of what I see what the

01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:39.620
actual shape is.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:41.850
And then I've got two more
for you on this one.

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:47.290
Again, magazine style layout,
really gorgeous.

01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:50.730
So we can just work against this
shape, even add in a bit

01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:57.930
of just kind of tweaking that,
and I like this one a lot.

01:54:57.930 --> 01:54:59.620
So here we have, let's
see, I'm going to

01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:05.290
turn this off, yes?

01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:06.890
OK, cool.

01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:09.900
So what I have on the bottom is
actually the debugger you

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:14.550
turned on, so I do the shape
of my exclusion.

01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:19.260
And so as I slide this, the
car enters, the mountain

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:22.530
shifts, and we're also seeing
all the text kind of just work

01:55:22.530 --> 01:55:24.340
its way around it.

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.390
So this is a really
exciting stuff.

01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:29.930
Adobe and WebKit are working
together on this, and it's

01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:33.320
available now in
Chrome Canary.

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.000
You just have to go into About
Flags, where a lot

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.960
of this stuff is.

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.660
And inside About Flags, you'll
find a lot of interesting

01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:45.350
experiments, and Regions is one
of the ones that we'll be

01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:49.830
covering today, but a bunch
more stuff is in here.

01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:51.570
All right, filters.

01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:54.200
Now, SVG, if you've done SVG
work, they've had filters for

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.150
a long time, and we haven't
had them in CSS.

01:55:57.150 --> 01:56:03.070
But you've probably wanted to
blur or something, or like

01:56:03.070 --> 01:56:06.580
desaturate just a section
of the page.

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:10.090
Filters brings that,
and we have it now.

01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:12.886
So I'll bring up this demo.

01:56:12.886 --> 01:56:15.010
A nice little seascape,
let's see.

01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:16.875
I'm not going to use
that picture.

01:56:16.875 --> 01:56:18.610
We'll try that again.

01:56:18.610 --> 01:56:21.090
That's pretty good.

01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:27.080
So I have here, this is like an
image element, and I'll add

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.740
some contract.

01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:30.705
So this is just the CSS line
that's making that change.

01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:37.990
There's Drop Shadow in filters,
I can desaturate it,

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:40.490
or of course, we can blur it.

01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:43.850
Now, I'm applying this just to
an image element here, but

01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:44.950
this could be anything.

01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:47.410
This could be a video element,
this could be a paragraph of

01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:49.450
text, this could be--

01:56:49.450 --> 01:56:52.820
you've seen in other cases where
like a modal pop-up will

01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:55.010
come out, and then the entire
background will be like

01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:56.750
semi-blurred, like I think
this is a common

01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:58.830
technique in Flex.

01:56:58.830 --> 01:57:00.850
You can do that, no problem.

01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:03.640
And this works just like
any other CSS property.

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:08.850
So I can use a CSS Key Frame
animation, make your audience

01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:11.870
sick, I'm sorry about that.

01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:14.400
But there's a lot of power, and
this is baked right into

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.650
the platform.

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.630
Good, cool.

01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:22.520
I want to give a shout out
to navigator.connection.

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:25.670
So this is an API where a lot
of times, you'll be building

01:57:25.670 --> 01:57:28.650
like a mobile app and you want
to know, it would be really

01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:30.470
handy if you knew exactly
what sort of connection

01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:31.800
your user was on.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.470
You're going to send out high
resolution imagery if you know

01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:35.440
they're on a fast connection.

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:38.010
Otherwise, you're going to tone
it down a notch, maybe

01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:40.990
not even send any images at all,
maybe just small sizes.

01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:44.770
So Navigator.connection type has
been available on Android

01:57:44.770 --> 01:57:47.310
for a while, it's not
in IOS as of yet.

01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:49.340
They're still actually working
out maybe a potential

01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:53.180
improvement to the spec, but
this allows you to have that

01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:56.150
sort of control and act
upon the network

01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:57.910
layer inside the browser.

01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:06.110
So on YouTube in a little Embed,
you can click the Full

01:58:06.110 --> 01:58:08.620
Screen and it goes full screen,
but there's been no

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.560
way to do that outside
of Flash or other

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.740
plug-in content so far.

01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:16.250
So now we have a Full
Screen API.

01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:20.890
This is implemented across
modern browsers these days.

01:58:20.890 --> 01:58:23.830
So if we have let's say this
video element, we're going to

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:27.180
set up a little on-click
element, and this is the main

01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:30.680
call right here, Request
Full Screen.

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.630
And this is just going to say,
I'd like to take this element

01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:38.720
and go full screen with it.

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.040
So again, the beauty here is
that it doesn't just work on

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.780
videos or images, it
could work on an

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:46.240
entire section of Dom.

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.960
So I'll take this video and
I'll start playing it.

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.490
And so this is just like a Div
of sorts, and I'll just toggle

01:58:53.490 --> 01:58:56.280
Full Screen.

01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.420
And so we just take that entire
Div, we go full screen

01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:01.460
with it, we get that little
notification pop-up.

01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:03.950
And this is similar to the
presentation mode, if you've

01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:08.090
ever done manually Full Screen
in Chrome, it's just that, but

01:59:08.090 --> 01:59:10.110
we've now triggered it
with JavaScript.

01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:13.330
So we can give our users this
option inside the app, instead

01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:18.200
of asking someone to actually
go up here and hit that.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:25.590
And the cool thing here is that
we also know if the user

01:59:25.590 --> 01:59:27.760
is viewing inside Full
Screen, and we can

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.500
have contextual styling.

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:33.250
So this right here,
this is an iFrame.

01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:35.920
And when I take this full
screen, I can actually detect

01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:38.860
that it's now being shown in
that Full Screen mode, and I

01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.280
can restyle it.

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:45.460
So here, it's a lame iFrame, but
when we go full screen, we

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:47.930
kind of crank it up a notch.

01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:48.500
Pretty good.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:52.260
I mean, it's kind of
ugly actually, but

01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:53.470
you have the option.

01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:56.500
OK, cool.

01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:59.710
Pointer Lock API is another API
that is really exciting,

01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:01.200
especially when it comes
to browser-based games.

02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:05.740
I guess quickly, let's
say you're on a

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:07.660
multi-monitor system.

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:10.980
And if you want to run a game,
you're going to want to run it

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.190
full screen, like a first
person shooter.

02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:15.640
And when you bring your cursor
to the edge because you like

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:19.210
looking left or looking right,
you don't want your cursor to

02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:21.260
go on to the next monitor,
you want it to be

02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.770
stuck there, right?

02:00:22.770 --> 02:00:25.970
So the Pointer Lock API allows
you to kind of define, this is

02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:27.790
the area in which
I'm operating.

02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:30.270
So first, you take
it full screen.

02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:35.040
And then now, my cursor
is totally hidden.

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:37.980
So the game can define its own
cursor if it wants, but you're

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:41.180
probably just going to use
this for movement.

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:45.210
And you can react, and you're
kind of stuck in full screen

02:00:45.210 --> 02:00:48.250
until you want to get out of it,
which is the behavior that

02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:50.770
you want when you're
building a game.

02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:54.370
So this was another
partnership.

02:00:54.370 --> 02:00:56.410
Some Google engineers got
together with some Mozilla

02:00:56.410 --> 02:00:59.420
engineers, banged this spec out
in like the course of two

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:02.340
months, and it's implemented
across both now.

02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:06.610
Another one that a gaming
community group got together

02:01:06.610 --> 02:01:12.050
on was the Gamepad API, and I'll
just show this demo here.

02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:17.870
So we're going to show this with
Firefox Nightly, but this

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:20.470
is available in Chrome
as well.

02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:26.960
So we have, this is just a 2D
canvas game, and we're using

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.890
an Xbox USB controller, just
plugs right into the machine.

02:01:31.890 --> 02:01:36.350
And essentially, Gamepad API
can track any sort of

02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:37.430
adjustments to that control.

02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:39.870
So whether it's like a joystick
with a lot of

02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:46.530
precision, or just up/down or
x, y, a, b, triggers, all

02:01:46.530 --> 02:01:50.400
those buttons are covered by
the Gamepad API so you can

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:56.790
enable a more rich input
method into your games.

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:58.160
All right.

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.035
Pause that and go forward.

02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.035
Like I said, I think it's
important to be nice, and one

02:02:07.035 --> 02:02:10.770
of the things being nice is
recognizing kind of the

02:02:10.770 --> 02:02:14.200
context in which your users are
looking at your content.

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.810
Page Visibility API
lets you do that.

02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:21.920
And so Page Visibility API
basically says, is the user

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:23.690
looking at this page?

02:02:23.690 --> 02:02:32.040
So I'll show the demo first.
So cute little guy, HTML5

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.882
video, it's cool.

02:02:33.882 --> 02:02:37.020
If you see at the very top where
we just wired it up so

02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.490
that we count how many seconds
are passing by.

02:02:39.490 --> 02:02:44.640
But if I switch tabs, now
it's immediately paused.

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.560
I go back, it continues.

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.990
So we're able to respond to
the fact that we know, the

02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:55.820
user is not looking here, we
can change the behavior and

02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:56.400
change the status.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.790
I think if you're writing
an IM client, user is

02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:02.650
idle, user is active.

02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:06.130
User is idle, user is active,
or something.

02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:10.260
You might also like, if you were
pulling the server for

02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:12.360
new messages or something,
you're probably going to

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.210
throttle it back.

02:03:13.210 --> 02:03:15.200
You don't need to be asking so
much because you know they're

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.540
not active, you know they're
not there, so you

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.030
have choices there.

02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:22.110
Another similar one is
RequestAnimationFrame.

02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:26.060
Animation And
RequestAnimationFrame is a

02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:28.340
programmatic way of saying, I'm
going to be putting things

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:31.340
out, I'm going to be drawing
things to the screen.

02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.450
But Browser, you probably know
what's best as far as

02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:38.820
hardware, and so why don't you
take care how exactly to

02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:41.890
schedule this?

02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:46.470
So there's two good reasons
to use RAF,

02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:47.750
RequestAnimationFrame.

02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:49.810
So this is a blog post over
on the IE blog, they've

02:03:49.810 --> 02:03:52.140
implemented this in IE 10.

02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:55.300
So right here, it's showing
on this top.

02:03:55.300 --> 02:03:57.860
Typically in animations,
you'll use either a set

02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:00.640
timeout or a set interval and
just bang it against like 10

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.890
milliseconds.

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.270
Sorry, that's what
this one is.

02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:11.260
Every 10 milliseconds, your app
is going to generate like

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:14.830
a new frame of the game and
try and send that out.

02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:18.680
But a monitor like this monitor,
this one, they

02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:20.210
refresh at 60 Hertz.

02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:23.360
So you get a maximum of
60 frames per second.

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:29.420
And if we can make sure that
our game outputs a frame 60

02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:32.260
times per second, so then we
can match and sync it up

02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.080
directly with the time that that
monitor is refreshing,

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.320
that's ideal, right?

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.130
So RequestAnimationFrame
allows us to do this.

02:04:40.130 --> 02:04:42.270
So we're just like, we got new
content, browser, you take

02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.970
care of it.

02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:45.030
And it will keep the
frame rate as

02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:46.920
high fidelity as possible.

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:49.600
Otherwise, these red arrows
indicate that you're actually

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.510
missing frames.

02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:52.260
You're generating all these
frames, and no one

02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.070
ever even sees it.

02:04:54.070 --> 02:05:01.790
The other good benefit is that
just like page visibility API,

02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:04.350
RequestAnimationFrame knows
if you're looking at it.

02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:10.530
So here we have a WebGL
Particles Demo.

02:05:10.530 --> 02:05:15.180
Love particle demos,
always looks good.

02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:16.770
Cool.

02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:19.790
All right, so what I'm going to
do is as you can imagine,

02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:23.730
this is probably a pretty
intense demo.

02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:28.330
I'm going to bring up my Task
Manager in Chrome and move

02:05:28.330 --> 02:05:33.770
that over a little bit more.

02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:35.680
All right.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.180
So in the Task Manager, we can
kind of see how much memory is

02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:40.060
being consumed, the CPU.

02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:44.140
This one over here is the number
of goats teleported,

02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:46.090
I'm not sure why that's
in there, but it might

02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:48.080
be useful to you.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.960
But the thing that we're looking
at right here is the

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:55.060
CPU usage of Particles Morph.

02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:57.800
Right now, it looks like
it's taking up

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:00.346
50%, a decent amount.

02:06:00.346 --> 02:06:04.810
I'm going to switch back to the
other tab, and this figure

02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:05.360
should drop.

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.910
Yes, OK.

02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:10.170
So this is because the Particle
Morph demo is using

02:06:10.170 --> 02:06:11.420
RequestAnimationFrame.

02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:14.110
The browser's like hey, you're
not looking at it.

02:06:14.110 --> 02:06:17.400
I don't need to even
send this out.

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:21.140
This way, my battery is being
conserved as much as possible,

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:22.200
which I like.

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:24.640
And then when I come back, I
know that it's syncing up

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.250
exactly with my Screen Refresh,
so I'm getting the

02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:27.500
highest fidelity as possible.

02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:33.270
Sweet.

02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:38.050
A while ago when HTML5 was
getting a lot of attention,

02:06:38.050 --> 02:06:40.820
there was a lot of focus on a
thing called the Device Tag.

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:43.130
And this is what you
think it is.

02:06:43.130 --> 02:06:47.050
It's getting the actual camera
and microphone from your

02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:49.320
machine and having that
as a first class

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.330
citizen in the browser.

02:06:51.330 --> 02:06:52.220
That's been changed.

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.820
And so instead of the Device
Tag, it's now called

02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:56.890
getUserMedia.

02:06:56.890 --> 02:06:58.250
And this is essentially
how it works.

02:06:58.250 --> 02:07:01.220
You have a video element
function,

02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:02.940
and right over here--

02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:07.380
see if I can get that,
it's somewhere--

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:11.726
is this S being passed
into this callback.

02:07:11.726 --> 02:07:15.770
This S is a stream, and so
first, we're going to grab

02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:18.350
this video element, and then
we're going to create an

02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:23.240
object URL out of the stream
and set that as the

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.960
source of the video.

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:29.190
So this just means, get the
camera, get the microphone,

02:07:29.190 --> 02:07:31.430
and just pipe it through
to this video.

02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:34.150
So essentially, what this
looks like is this.

02:07:36.904 --> 02:07:39.200
Yes.

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.230
All right, cool.

02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:40.800
So here's this.

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.050
This is all built
with JavaScript.

02:07:44.610 --> 02:07:45.290
Good.

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:47.530
I like that.

02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:50.870
So I can apply CSS Filters,
which showed before, get a

02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:53.170
nice effect on there.

02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:56.630
And the guy who wrote this demo,
I asked him for this

02:07:56.630 --> 02:07:58.750
feature a few days ago.

02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:00.000
I think it'll work.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:07.420
Sweet Polaroid effect where it
has to fade in, but if you

02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:09.260
shake it-- yes?

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:10.510
Yeah!

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:16.300
So you can actually, I mean
you can use accelerometer

02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:21.110
data, there's events that fire
in MacBook Pros to respond to

02:08:21.110 --> 02:08:23.950
that, and you can be able to
say, in this case, I want to

02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:26.830
speed up the rendering
of that.

02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:29.290
But this is a really
great API, I'm very

02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:30.540
happy to have it.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.540
The thing I like about all these
APIs is that they mix up

02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:37.740
and they mix well together.

02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:40.310
So we're taking the video, and
now we're applying it frame by

02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:43.690
frame to a 2D canvas, and that
means we can do something like

02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:46.970
[EXPLOSION NOISE], or
just explode that

02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:51.200
video any way we want.

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.750
We can apply any effect.

02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:55.880
So in this one, we are taking
the video and now we're piping

02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:57.940
it through to WebGL, because
we're going to do a little bit

02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:59.690
more comprehensive changes.

02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:02.825
So we can do stuff like this.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.560
Anything you want.

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.670
Whoa.

02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:12.695
I saw a Tweet other day, it was
like, "I don't care who

02:09:12.695 --> 02:09:15.440
you are, but put you in front
of a camera doing these

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.770
effects, and you will turn into
a five-year-old." And

02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:20.530
that is true.

02:09:20.530 --> 02:09:22.190
OK.

02:09:22.190 --> 02:09:22.750
I'm just going to move on.

02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:25.840
I'll be there all day.

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:27.090
This brings us to WebRTC.

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:32.430
WebRTC is--

02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:34.040
well, OK.

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.740
So you might be familiar with
things like, let's see, Google

02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:43.390
Talk, G+ Hangouts,
the live video.

02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:45.280
Live video's coming to
a lot of things.

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.300
You might be familiar with a
small little blue icon where

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:51.050
you video real time chat with
people over the internets.

02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:52.030
Good thing.

02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:55.220
Wouldn't it be nice if we had
it baked into the browser?

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:55.590
Yes.

02:09:55.590 --> 02:09:56.780
Yes, it would be.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.710
So WebRTC is an effort
for that.

02:09:59.710 --> 02:10:02.340
So it's a plugin-free way for
doing real time voice and

02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:04.750
video directly inside the
browser, having nice

02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:07.480
JavaScript APIs so that we
can just wire it in.

02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:11.160
The really cool thing about
this is that because the

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.870
browser is handling it, it can
add in a bunch of extra

02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:16.130
functionality that would be
super hard for us as end

02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:17.290
developers to deal with.

02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:21.060
So like echo cancellation, noise
reduction if it's loud

02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:24.650
in the back of the room, it's
like focusing on me, automatic

02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:27.480
gain control to make sure that
I'm not too loud or too quiet.

02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.100
If the network connection is
bad, like I'm on a slow

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:31.950
connection but the person I'm
talking to is on a fast

02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:34.730
connection, it's just going to
work it out, make sure that

02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:38.470
the fidelity of the video just
kind of scales regardless.

02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:42.100
So there's a lot of good stuff
kind of baked into it.

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:46.400
And the cool thing is that
WebRTC is a cross-vendor

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.690
initiative led by Google, but
Mozilla and Opera are actively

02:10:50.690 --> 02:10:51.350
working on it.

02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:54.820
And so we have an implementation
in Google

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:57.540
Chrome now, but we're expecting
to see it in some of

02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:00.530
these other browsers
pretty soon.

02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:04.740
As far as how this works, it
is peer to peer, but you do

02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:08.030
need to kind of handshake
through a server.

02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:09.910
So this is the way that
it kicks off.

02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:12.620
We set up a new peer connection
through this

02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:16.740
server, this is like
the protocol.

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:18.800
And essentially, this should
look familiar.

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.250
We have a getUserMedia again,
where we're going to get our

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:25.340
video and our audio, set up the
stream, and hook that up.

02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:30.870
So we're really excited about
this and think that not only

02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:34.840
WebRTC but all these features
give you a lot of

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:35.780
functionality.

02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.280
So I want you to think about
kind of the experiences that

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.580
this allows you to provide,
not just the features

02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:44.070
themselves but combining them
together, because I think it

02:11:44.070 --> 02:11:47.810
has some really good
potential.

02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:51.260
A few resources that
I would recommend.

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:55.930
HTML5 Rocks is a Chrome
Developer relations site where

02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:57.300
we just publish a lot
of this stuff.

02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:01.450
It very much focuses on kind
of the edge of browser

02:12:01.450 --> 02:12:03.790
development, so what are the
brand new things coming into

02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:07.650
Chrome and other browsers, a lot
of very in-depth tutorials

02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:10.150
as well, great content.

02:12:10.150 --> 02:12:11.650
I'm really, really
happy with it.

02:12:11.650 --> 02:12:12.680
Check that out.

02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:18.490
HTML5 Please is a site that came
out recently, and it is

02:12:18.490 --> 02:12:24.470
very much focused on like,
people that come to my sites

02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:27.040
are real people with real
browsers and those browsers

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.265
might be a little old.

02:12:28.265 --> 02:12:31.300
HTML5 Please is about making
recommendations to you based

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:34.700
on like, is it OK to implement
this thing, what is the fall

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:37.270
back story, can I
use a polyfill?

02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:39.160
So basically, recommendations
from people who have been

02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:44.310
there before on the right way
to handle every feature.

02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:48.340
And HTML5-demos is another site
where you'll find slide

02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:52.050
decks like this one and a lot of
other demos as well, so I'd

02:12:52.050 --> 02:12:54.120
recommend that out.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.090
There are two sites.

02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:59.210
One is HTML5-demos,
one is HTML5demos.

02:12:59.210 --> 02:13:00.510
Different sites, both good.

02:13:03.250 --> 02:13:05.470
And that's it for me.

02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:11.470
These slides are available at
this case sensitive link that

02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:15.742
you're welcome to write
down or something.

02:13:15.742 --> 02:13:20.800
It's not very friendly, I'm
sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:22.550
But Yeah.

02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:24.940
Thank you.

02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:31.260
[APPLAUSE]

02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:33.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So it looks
like we've got about 15

02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:34.190
minutes for questions.

02:13:34.190 --> 02:13:36.210
So there's plenty of time.

02:13:36.210 --> 02:13:39.650
So if anybody has a question
for this gentleman here,

02:13:39.650 --> 02:13:40.900
please shout it out.

02:13:45.065 --> 02:13:47.290
MALE SPEAKER: Does Pointer Lock
only work in Full Screen?

02:13:47.290 --> 02:13:48.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So the question
for the internet

02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:53.276
audience was, does the Pointer
Lock only work in Full Screen?

02:13:53.276 --> 02:13:57.310
PAUL IRISH: You know, I was
curious about this as well.

02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:58.830
I'm not sure.

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.050
So I believe it does.

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.900
No.

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:14.180
It totally works outside
of full screen.

02:14:17.256 --> 02:14:19.810
I'm not sure.

02:14:19.810 --> 02:14:21.080
This is the page.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.520
Luckily, MDN, Google has
actually been contributing to

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:28.660
MDN recently, and so
I think, yeah, we

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:30.120
contributed this page.

02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:34.140
And so in lot of cases, the
MDN actually has quite

02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:37.520
up-to-date information, on not
only what the compatibility

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.330
story is and what browsers this
is available in, but also

02:14:40.330 --> 02:14:40.900
how to use it.

02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.020
So check that out.

02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:45.292
Sir?

02:14:45.292 --> 02:14:47.772
MALE SPEAKER: Is the video
[INAUDIBLE] just peer-to-peer,

02:14:47.772 --> 02:14:49.570
or could you do group
stuff, group chats?

02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:52.050
PAUL IRISH: Is the video stuff
peer-to-peer or can you do

02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:53.640
group stuff?

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:56.880
So WebRTC, it can totally
be group.

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:59.700
You just need the server to
set up the handshakes, but

02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:04.610
from there on, it can totally
go scale to a group.

02:15:04.610 --> 02:15:05.860
Very cool.

02:15:08.519 --> 02:15:09.736
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
stream video only

02:15:09.736 --> 02:15:12.420
by server with WebRTC?

02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:13.810
PAUL IRISH: Can you
stream video--

02:15:13.810 --> 02:15:14.530
MALE SPEAKER: Only through
the server?

02:15:14.530 --> 02:15:15.220
PAUL IRISH: Through
the server?

02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:17.044
MALE SPEAKER: Just to
the server, though.

02:15:17.044 --> 02:15:17.960
Not to another peer.

02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:19.680
PAUL IRISH: Ah, so you're saying
you want to do that,

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.020
but without going directly
peer-to-peer?

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:23.362
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

02:15:23.362 --> 02:15:26.300
PAUL IRISH: Ah, OK.

02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:26.710
It's a good question.

02:15:26.710 --> 02:15:27.690
MALE SPEAKER: Can you repeat
that question?

02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:30.450
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so the
question is, can you use

02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:33.160
WebRTC without going just
peer-to-peer and instead proxy

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.410
it through a server?

02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:39.110
So yeah.

02:15:39.110 --> 02:15:41.550
I haven't done it, but I don't
see any reason why you can't

02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:43.430
just set up your pure connection
essentially to the

02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:46.270
server instead.

02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:49.090
Yeah, I mean you could totally
manage that at the server

02:15:49.090 --> 02:15:51.090
level and just pass
the connection

02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:53.850
right through to itself.

02:15:53.850 --> 02:15:56.140
So yeah.

02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:57.390
Yeah?

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.425
MALE SPEAKER: What kind of API
is it to kind of map what

02:16:02.425 --> 02:16:04.900
buttons people are pressing on
the Gamepad controller to like

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:07.200
actual [INAUDIBLE]?

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:07.930
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

02:16:07.930 --> 02:16:09.180
So this is a tough one.

02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:10.430
Let's see, Rob Hawkes Gamepad.

02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:20.370
Rob did an excellent
post recently.

02:16:20.370 --> 02:16:23.620
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to find this.

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:27.010
Also look [INAUDIBLE] can bring
up this site right now.

02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:27.970
Please?

02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:30.230
Yes.

02:16:30.230 --> 02:16:31.480
Gamepad, yeah.

02:16:39.209 --> 02:16:41.959
OK, I can't find
this other one.

02:16:41.959 --> 02:16:46.690
So basically right now, with the
Gamepad API, is it returns

02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:51.350
to you what the configuration
is, the model, the

02:16:51.350 --> 02:16:55.240
configuration, of the actual
controller, and then it

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.640
numbers all the inputs from
one to 30 or something and

02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:02.230
then says that input
12 is now reporting

02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:05.719
this stream of events.

02:17:05.719 --> 02:17:08.430
There's two JavaScript libraries
that try and work

02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:10.490
out differences between
controllers.

02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:15.520
One of them is Gamepad JS, and
this is actually made by

02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:19.580
Scott, who is the engineer
who built the Gamepad

02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.410
implementation for Chrome.

02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:24.350
So it's a good guy to build the
JavaScript library for it.

02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:27.950
So yeah, it tries to smooth
over the differences.

02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:32.000
So with different Gamepads, you
will get kind of different

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.099
mappings, and so you essentially
need a dictionary

02:17:35.099 --> 02:17:38.010
to look up like this
to normalize.

02:17:38.010 --> 02:17:39.750
They're trying to figure out a
better way to handle that, but

02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:40.990
right now, you're essentially
looking at

02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:42.290
one of these libraries.

02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:45.510
But these are well-tested and
kind of where the entire

02:17:45.510 --> 02:17:49.500
community is focusing its
effort, so it's a good set-up

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:52.790
to have.

02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:55.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions?

02:17:55.290 --> 02:17:57.309
MALE SPEAKER: Does that
CSS drop shadow

02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:59.260
work with alpha channels?

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:00.459
PAUL IRISH: Work with
alpha changes?

02:18:00.459 --> 02:18:01.610
MALE SPEAKER: Alpha channels.

02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:02.554
PAUL IRISH: Channels?

02:18:02.554 --> 02:18:05.152
Like you have an alpha
channel on--

02:18:05.152 --> 02:18:06.402
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:09.080
PAUL IRISH: Ah.

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.660
Well, hm.

02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:12.417
MALE SPEAKER: Because like,
what's the point of

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:15.340
[INAUDIBLE] drop shadow,
[INAUDIBLE]?

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.969
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, there's a very
large debate regarding

02:18:18.969 --> 02:18:21.780
the sorts of shadows that are
available, and if I have like

02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:26.940
an SVG shape or some
non-rectangle, if I have--

02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:27.544
not text.

02:18:27.544 --> 02:18:30.020
Text has its own shadow.

02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:31.469
Yeah, so there's been a big--

02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:34.190
so I can't cut out a
circle out of this

02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:37.110
unless I used Clip.

02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:38.040
No, clip wouldn't work.

02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:40.070
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:41.954
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

02:18:41.954 --> 02:18:43.889
PNG would not work.

02:18:46.465 --> 02:18:53.049
So the filter is actually,
let's see, FXTF filters.

02:18:53.049 --> 02:18:55.850
So the spec actually comes
over here from the Filter

02:18:55.850 --> 02:19:01.110
Effects cross-functional group,
and this is basically a

02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:04.100
collaboration of people who have
been working on SVG, and

02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:07.590
then people in CSS land.

02:19:07.590 --> 02:19:10.629
And so all the filters, while
I was showing kind of the

02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:16.700
shorthand filters of these guys,
it actually takes in a

02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:18.080
lot of these primitives.

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.790
Those are just shorthand for
mixing up the filter

02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:25.360
primitives, and all of these
come directly from SVG.

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.969
And because they come
from SVG, SVG is all

02:19:27.969 --> 02:19:29.730
about custom shapes.

02:19:29.730 --> 02:19:32.740
And so while I can't bring up
a demo that uses a custom

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:36.650
shape in these filters, I have
no doubt that it works.

02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:42.750
We also, there is hardware
acceleration for--

02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:45.400
I think we landed full hardware
acceleration for all

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:48.400
these filters in Canary.

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:53.530
So that just means they're
faster, which is a good thing.

02:19:53.530 --> 02:19:54.890
Quick question on--

02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:56.420
it seems like you guys
have implemented

02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:58.540
everything that Flash did.

02:19:58.540 --> 02:19:59.500
Is there anything left?

02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.070
I feel like you guys--

02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.954
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

02:20:01.954 --> 02:20:03.722
Good question.

02:20:03.722 --> 02:20:07.280
You know, I was curious
about this as well.

02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.530
What is left?

02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:14.270
There are a lot of wishes.

02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:17.680
I think part of is building
on top of things.

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:23.740
We just finished off Mutation
Observers, which is

02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:30.620
essentially an iteration on
Mutation Events, but they're

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:31.980
far, far more performing.

02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:35.190
So with Mutation Events, you
would subscribe to like DOM

02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:37.985
sub-tree modified, and it would
tell you if anything in

02:20:37.985 --> 02:20:40.210
the DOM had changed.

02:20:40.210 --> 02:20:42.160
People use this all the time
for Chrome extensions, for

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.630
Grease Monkey scripts, when
you're hooking into a third

02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:46.450
party web page and you want to
know if somebody clicked the

02:20:46.450 --> 02:20:48.780
New Tweet button because you're
going to add some part

02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:51.760
of the UI to it, but
things are very not

02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:52.500
performing at all.

02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:57.090
Mutation Observers are a better
way of tracking these

02:20:57.090 --> 02:21:01.500
changes, and it's like
500 times more

02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:03.150
performing than the other.

02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:05.050
So in some cases, it's
things like that.

02:21:05.050 --> 02:21:08.750
Other cases, I've heard, I want
Photoshop's Blend modes,

02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:12.260
like Darker and Multiply
against DOM.

02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:16.310
So like this DIV, I want to
multiply against this other

02:21:16.310 --> 02:21:23.760
DIV. Filters might get us
part of the way there.

02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:28.960
But yeah, there's a lot coming
in CSS in particular that I'm

02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:29.440
happy about.

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:33.110
So like CSS as a language
is limited.

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:35.490
Mix-ins, so things that you
might be familiar with from

02:21:35.490 --> 02:21:38.950
Sass and LESS and the other
preprocessors of variables,

02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:42.040
mix-ins, selector nesting.

02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:45.610
There's specs for all these
things, and some of it's

02:21:45.610 --> 02:21:48.410
starting to land in Canary.

02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:52.170
So CSS variables
in particular.

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.930
We do have a spec for
it that [INAUDIBLE]

02:21:54.930 --> 02:22:00.950
Atkins, who's actually here at
South By, is working on.

02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:01.970
Here it is.

02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:05.390
And our engineering team is
actually implementing this

02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:08.210
like as we speak.

02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:11.080
So we're going to be expecting
to see some of this stuff just

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:12.190
happening for real,
and I'm excited,

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.920
especially in the CSS land.

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:18.370
Layout, we have grid layout,
the brand new Flex Box, the

02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:21.680
Regions that I showed.

02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:27.070
And I would expect the DOM
to be better as well.

02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:29.530
Right now, the DOM, like people
use jQuery because DOM

02:22:29.530 --> 02:22:30.780
APIs are annoying.

02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.370
And I hope we're going
to see that improve.

02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:37.050
There's lot of people that want
to make that better, make

02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:38.300
that more performant.

02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:42.190
Any other questions?

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:48.380
No?

02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:49.610
Cool.

02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:55.000
Well again, HTML5 Rocks,
good stuff.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.890
And if you have any more
questions, feel free to Tweet

02:22:57.890 --> 02:22:59.860
at me or hit be on G+.

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:03.220
I do post a lot of really cool
stuff about HTML5 stuff,

02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:06.960
Chrome Dev tools, on Google+,
try and link it up via Twitter

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.450
when I can.

02:23:08.450 --> 02:23:11.200
So good things, check
that out.

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:12.460
So thank you guys,
appreciate it.

02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:13.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you, Paul.

02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:20.424
[APPLAUSE]

02:23:20.424 --> 02:23:22.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, and
coming up to the stage, we

02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:24.990
have both Josh and Chris, and
they're going to be talking

02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:27.615
about making your maps beautiful
and interactive.

02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:34.790
I'd also like to remind you, if
you want to see this after

02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:37.380
we're done today, we're
recording this whole thing and

02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:40.730
it's going to be available on
the Google Developers' YouTube

02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:42.010
channel page.

02:23:42.010 --> 02:23:45.810
So you can just do a quick
search for that and get all of

02:23:45.810 --> 02:23:49.290
these sessions on video
at home later.

02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:51.330
Maybe there's something you
missed, or you wanted an

02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:53.295
instant replay of one
of Paul's slides.

02:23:53.295 --> 02:23:54.545
You can get all that.

02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:07.756
JOSH LIVNI: [INAUDIBLE] like
a couple minutes here

02:24:07.756 --> 02:24:08.140
for people to settle?

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:08.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
we'll give you a

02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:09.790
couple minutes to settle.

02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:12.210
We do have this one last
session about maps.

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:14.400
If you're in the back and you'd
like a seat, we have

02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:15.840
some lovely seats up here.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.960
They're green, they're
triangular, and they make me

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.610
feel a little bit like I'm
in elementary school.

02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:22.350
You see these chairs?

02:24:22.350 --> 02:24:24.885
These are cool.

02:24:24.885 --> 02:24:26.370
A little desk would be great,
but you see how they have the

02:24:26.370 --> 02:24:27.300
hole in the back?

02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:29.350
Remember that from school?

02:24:29.350 --> 02:24:31.442
I don't know why that
hole's there.

02:24:31.442 --> 02:24:31.900
MALE SPEAKER: Gum.

02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:34.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you can put
the gum through there?

02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:37.450
So yeah, please do come
on up and grab a seat.

02:24:37.450 --> 02:24:39.360
We do have some more
seats available.

02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.230
And why don't you guys go
ahead and take it away?

02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:47.800
JOSH LIVNI: All right.

02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.870
I'm going to make
a run for it.

02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:52.810
Sorry for this noise that's
about to happen.

02:24:52.810 --> 02:24:54.280
Made it!

02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:56.642
We have some speaker effect.

02:24:56.642 --> 02:24:57.130
All right.

02:24:57.130 --> 02:24:58.400
Should we get started?

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:00.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
let's get started.

02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:00.250
JOSH LIVNI: OK.

02:25:00.250 --> 02:25:00.930
Hi, everybody.

02:25:00.930 --> 02:25:02.670
So my name is Josh.

02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:03.310
This is Chris.

02:25:03.310 --> 02:25:05.940
We're on the Maps Developer
Relations Team.

02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:08.060
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We're going to
talk today about beautiful

02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:11.560
maps, so making your geographic
information

02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:13.530
beautiful and interactive.

02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:15.190
And so we're going to be showing
some cool things we've

02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:19.070
been working on, various Google
APIs, a whole bunch of

02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:22.270
awesome HTML5 stuff.

02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:26.140
So let's give a bit of
context to this talk.

02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:29.475
JOSH LIVNI: Yep, here we have
a very early map, Mayan.

02:25:29.475 --> 02:25:31.140
There's a lot of things you
notice about it, a little

02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:32.940
different from the
modern web maps.

02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:36.740
It's smaller, it has a
legend at the top.

02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:41.040
It has none of the HTML5 stuff
that Paul was going over.

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:43.440
And our intent is to try to fix
some of these things in

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.355
future slides, but it's good
to see where maps started.

02:25:45.355 --> 02:25:46.960
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Not
very interactive.

02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:48.740
JOSH LIVNI: Not very.

02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:50.440
So here we get a little
bit interactive.

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:55.020
This is about 15 years ago,
state of the art GIS system.

02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:57.570
Lots of data, people starting
to make kind of these

02:25:57.570 --> 02:25:59.550
interactive maps where
you could toggle

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:01.510
lots of check boxes.

02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:03.280
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The sad thing
here is you have to press

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:05.060
radio buttons to navigate
the world.

02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:07.140
JOSH LIVNI: And press Redraw
to redraw it, and each map

02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:10.325
tile is dynamically done
for you custom.

02:26:10.325 --> 02:26:13.410
But it was a bit slow, not
super user-friendly.

02:26:13.410 --> 02:26:14.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Unfortunately,
some people

02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:15.810
still make maps like this.

02:26:15.810 --> 02:26:17.940
JOSH LIVNI: Yes, they do.

02:26:17.940 --> 02:26:19.180
So things got better.

02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:21.250
We got all the important
countries on an

02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:23.500
early Google Map.

02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:26.040
The key here is we pre-rendered
the tiles in

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:28.860
advance, and so we came up with
this idea of the slippy

02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:30.920
map, where you could call around
and everything's kind

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:33.350
of instantaneous feeling
and just really

02:26:33.350 --> 02:26:34.450
dynamic, nice feel.

02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:35.560
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So you're not
loading everything as you try

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.180
to look around.

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:36.560
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:39.240
So it's not super custom, we've
decided in advance what

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.390
the look and feel is, but
you get this really nice

02:26:41.390 --> 02:26:41.740
interaction.

02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:44.300
So this is kind of the start of
the new age of interactive

02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.060
maps, not that long ago.

02:26:48.570 --> 02:26:51.340
Here we've added some more
countries and some more data,

02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:53.890
and tons and tons of stuff
on these map tiles.

02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:56.440
So these map tiles seem like
they're pre-rendered, but

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:58.260
actually, there's a lot of
interesting customizations you

02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:00.660
can do with them when you go to
the Google Maps, and that's

02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:03.610
what we're going to take
a look at here.

02:27:03.610 --> 02:27:05.010
Little did you know, perhaps.

02:27:05.010 --> 02:27:06.750
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this
is Styled Maps.

02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:10.230
This was launched at
Google I/O in 2010.

02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:14.130
And so it basically allows you
to change the colors and

02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:16.180
display of all the
map features.

02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:19.840
So here we've got our beautiful
landscape is black,

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.980
roads as pink.

02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.660
This is one of my favorite
styles, by the way.

02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:23.320
JOSH LIVNI: He's a professional
cartographer.

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:24.900
That's why we hired him.

02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:25.400
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's right.

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:27.780
JOSH LIVNI: But you switch back
and forth between the map

02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:29.660
and the other version there.

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:31.550
And you can see that what we're
actually doing is we're

02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:34.040
rendering these tiles
dynamically for any style that

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:37.110
you want to have. Maybe show
them the label style.

02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.960
And the idea-- oh, go ahead.

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:39.490
CHRIS BROADFOOT: This is one
of my favorite maps.

02:27:39.490 --> 02:27:42.447
It's a map without a
map, just labels.

02:27:42.447 --> 02:27:43.301
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, you
zoom in and out?

02:27:43.301 --> 02:27:44.830
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Just
an experiment.

02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:46.490
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and so the
idea here is we can provide a

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:47.880
really custom experience
for you.

02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.680
But again, this is
not your data.

02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:52.880
It's a backdrop you can
use to tell your

02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:54.150
story with your data.

02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:57.640
So be sure you always customize
the background and

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:02.070
that your sort of pre-tiled
images are telling

02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.990
the story you want.

02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:04.230
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So you
can use this to

02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:05.530
bring your data alive.

02:28:05.530 --> 02:28:08.310
So if you're displaying stuff
on a Google Map, you might

02:28:08.310 --> 02:28:10.855
want to remove roads if they're
not so important for

02:28:10.855 --> 02:28:13.250
your data, it's really cool.

02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:13.720
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:16.130
Our base map is really designed,
the story we're

02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:18.480
trying to tell, which may not be
the exact same story you're

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.120
trying to tell, like where all
the freeways are, or where all

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:22.465
the public transit.

02:28:22.465 --> 02:28:23.940
Anyway, let's get to
your data, which is

02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:24.730
what the talk's about.

02:28:24.730 --> 02:28:28.050
So here's a bunch of trees
mapped in San Francisco, a

02:28:28.050 --> 02:28:29.720
couple hundred thousand trees.

02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.140
There's lots of it, and this is,
I guess, green dot fever,

02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:35.540
a variety of the red dot fever
that comes around when you're

02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:37.120
trying to, man, I have
a lot of data.

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:38.720
How am I going to put
it on the map?

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:41.980
And the classic way of doing
this, since browsers until

02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:44.140
very recently could only handle
maybe a few hundred, a

02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:46.470
few thousand points, is I'm
going to have to take this

02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:50.170
data, put it on a server, render
up my own tiles, and

02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:52.100
overlay those tiles
on top of the map.

02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:53.050
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
pretty hard.

02:28:53.050 --> 02:28:53.320
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:53.590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
a lot of work.

02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:55.700
JOSH LIVNI: There's a big stack
of things you have to

02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:57.370
take care of and think about.

02:28:57.370 --> 02:28:59.312
We have some tools to make this
easy, but this is kind of

02:28:59.312 --> 02:28:59.830
what you're seeing here.

02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:03.070
These are rendered tiles, and
then we just display these

02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:05.784
PNGs on top of the map.

02:29:05.784 --> 02:29:06.760
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Made with
the map, of course.

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.420
JOSH LIVNI: You can click on
them and get some information

02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:10.440
back, kind of makes a call to
the server and says what's

02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:13.050
here, and here's a tree and
a species and whatnot.

02:29:13.050 --> 02:29:14.240
But your interaction's
limited.

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:16.910
And again, you sort of have to
get it all through this work

02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:18.440
flow of rendering tiles.

02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.100
So what if you could actually
just use JavaScript to put

02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:22.540
your data on top of the map?

02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:25.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this is one
of the solutions to this

02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:26.250
big data problem.

02:29:26.250 --> 02:29:28.400
It's called clustering.

02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:31.960
Unfortunately, it scales only up
to maybe tens of thousands

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:33.930
of points, something
like that.

02:29:33.930 --> 02:29:35.200
It's quite pretty.

02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.170
JOSH LIVNI: And we can't display
all 10,000 either, so

02:29:37.170 --> 02:29:39.220
we've got to only display
a few hundred at a time.

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:40.870
Here's there's much
less than that.

02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:43.160
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You sort of get
sort of a cheap heat map.

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.690
So you sort of get a sense of
where all the points are.

02:29:46.690 --> 02:29:48.220
JOSH LIVNI: Now, there's some
stories that this is actually

02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:49.000
conducive to.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.580
So it's actually sometimes great
to do a Marker Clusterer

02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:53.270
for certain types of stories.

02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:54.690
But it's just important to
remember the inherent

02:29:54.690 --> 02:29:59.200
limitation here is, we can't be
displaying a million points

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:00.670
in JavaScript on the browser.

02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:03.050
So this is one of the techniques
to get around that.

02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:05.700
CHRIS BROADFOOT: As you said, I
mean, get individual points,

02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:08.070
so you can click on them,
whatever you want.

02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:10.040
JOSH LIVNI: So keep in mind, the
Marker Clusterer, you have

02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:12.590
a bunch, a few thousand points,
you want to display

02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:14.040
them on the map.

02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:16.240
And then we should look at what
the future holds, or the

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.320
current now.

02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.460
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this an
experiment I did it would have

02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:22.400
been a few months ago now, just
to see how many points I

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:23.990
could throw at the browser.

02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:27.330
So these are 10,000 crimes
in San Francisco

02:30:27.330 --> 02:30:28.510
over a one-month period.

02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:30.040
JOSH LIVNI: A very safe city.

02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:32.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And I decided,
I just want to render

02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:35.710
all these and see the places
I should avoid when I'm

02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:37.590
visiting the city.

02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:39.890
So I'm coloring different
types of crime

02:30:39.890 --> 02:30:41.130
with different colors.

02:30:41.130 --> 02:30:44.680
And as they are drawn on top of
each other, they stack up,

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:47.180
so you can sort of see hot
spots of crime activity.

02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.900
JOSH LIVNI: And the important
bit here is instead of

02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.620
rendering these as tiles in an
overlay, we're just throwing

02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:54.470
all the vector data down to
the browser, the browser's

02:30:54.470 --> 02:30:55.860
displaying these using canvas.

02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:58.160
So finally, HTML5 has arrived.

02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.710
Canvas.

02:30:59.710 --> 02:31:02.940
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So as I zoom
in, I just keep rendering.

02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:04.710
JOSH LIVNI: OK, all right.

02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:07.010
So here is a bit of
a morbid map.

02:31:07.010 --> 02:31:12.250
This is the last seven to 10
years of traffic fatalities in

02:31:12.250 --> 02:31:13.620
the United States.

02:31:13.620 --> 02:31:15.980
We're looking at about-- go
ahead and type "fatals" into

02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:19.940
the box there, and maybe
zoom in somewhere.

02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:23.200
What we're looking at here is
about, I think, 300,000

02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:26.000
accidents or so.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:26.670
Maybe just--

02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:27.840
CHRIS BROADFOOT: 2,000.

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:28.540
JOSH LIVNI: 278,000.

02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:30.540
And if you zoom in somewhere
else, there's a couple

02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:31.100
interesting things to note.

02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.556
Maybe zoom into Austin.

02:31:33.556 --> 02:31:35.475
There we go.

02:31:35.475 --> 02:31:38.360
So here's a bunch of points, and
what you can see is about

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:42.250
700 accidents or so.

02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:43.890
Move the slider, the
size of the slider.

02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:45.830
One of the things you'll notice
as you zoom in and out,

02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:48.310
you can change it to a really
gruesome-looking map with a

02:31:48.310 --> 02:31:50.370
lot of accidents, or maybe
something a little more

02:31:50.370 --> 02:31:52.330
subtle, you're trying to get
a different point across.

02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:55.790
We can style them according to
different colors, and I'm kind

02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:57.560
of contradicting what I said,
you can't get a lot

02:31:57.560 --> 02:31:58.350
of points in here.

02:31:58.350 --> 02:32:01.730
And what we're doing here is
we're using WebGL to render,

02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:04.470
in the graphics shader, a
lot and a lot of data.

02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:06.160
We can render a significant
amount.

02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:06.610
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Millions.

02:32:06.610 --> 02:32:07.810
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah,
many millions.

02:32:07.810 --> 02:32:09.680
It's pretty exciting, it's kind
of a new world where we

02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:11.790
can send the vector data over,
and actually render these in

02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:14.020
the browser, and actually start
to run different types

02:32:14.020 --> 02:32:15.130
of analysis or filtering.

02:32:15.130 --> 02:32:16.550
So a really simple example,
go ahead and

02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:17.760
hit that filter there.

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.060
You've probably heard
most accidents

02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:20.460
happen close to home.

02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:24.790
So I've just got a filter that
runs on the distance between

02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:27.730
where the accident occurred and
where that car driver is

02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:28.680
registered.

02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:31.120
So you can see as you drag it
on the way up to 100, say,

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:32.760
most of the accidents go away.

02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:36.110
Most people's accidents occur
within less than 100

02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:39.410
kilometers, 60 miles or
so, of their house.

02:32:39.410 --> 02:32:42.672
So maybe zoom out
to Florida, say.

02:32:42.672 --> 02:32:43.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I don't
know where that is.

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:46.340
JOSH LIVNI: There it
is in bottom right.

02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:48.200
So we have this Place API drop
down for people like this.

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:48.580
It's pretty good.

02:32:48.580 --> 02:32:51.170
You just type in whatever you
want, it takes you there.

02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:51.650
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Whoa.

02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.940
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:54.660
So you can see there's a lot
of accidents that happened.

02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.640
It's crazy--

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:58.650
more than 100 miles away from
home, probably a lot of people

02:32:58.650 --> 02:32:59.565
there as tourists.

02:32:59.565 --> 02:33:01.320
So you can kind of get an idea,
here's a tourist spot,

02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.680
everyone goes there,
has an accident.

02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:05.460
The locals still have a lot of
accidents, but there's still

02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:06.340
plenty left for that.

02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:09.340
Whereas you go to a city say
Sacramento, San Francisco, and

02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:11.510
you drag that away, you'll see
almost all of the accidents--

02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:13.270
maybe try, or Austin--

02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:14.520
most of the accidents happen.

02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:19.320
Where did they go?

02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:20.060
Make it a little bigger.

02:33:20.060 --> 02:33:23.660
Maybe that data didn't load.

02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:24.156
Interesting.

02:33:24.156 --> 02:33:25.590
There we go.

02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:29.060
So anyway, you get the general
idea here, which is I can

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.930
throw a lot of points, do cool
techniques kind of like Paul

02:33:31.930 --> 02:33:34.510
was showing, animate these,
filter them, style them based

02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:37.840
on some attributes, and at about
60 frames a second, get

02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:39.480
some pretty dynamic results.

02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:42.970
So let's scoot over to
quick example using

02:33:42.970 --> 02:33:43.790
the exact same stack.

02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:45.740
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
a very bloody map.

02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:46.300
JOSH LIVNI: Not accidents.

02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:50.740
This is just census blocks sized
by population, it's a

02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:51.560
little bit better.

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:54.970
So if you zoom out here, just
a couple zoom-outs, you can

02:33:54.970 --> 02:33:57.710
see I've got millions
of census blocks

02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:58.650
here, that's good.

02:33:58.650 --> 02:34:01.080
And you can drag the
filter if you want.

02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:04.730
And not especially amazing map,
except to show off I can

02:34:04.730 --> 02:34:08.450
display millions and millions
of points in WebGL on top of

02:34:08.450 --> 02:34:11.710
the map pretty easily, and this
is being run through App

02:34:11.710 --> 02:34:12.420
Engine to CloudSQL.

02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:15.930
So no special spatial database
or anything, just toss it into

02:34:15.930 --> 02:34:18.780
MySQL, stream it over in binary
format directly to the

02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:21.680
graphics card, and then I can
work with this in JavaScript

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:23.645
to style and do analysis.

02:34:23.645 --> 02:34:25.910
So pretty cool stuff when you
have really big data that you

02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:27.850
want to have an interactive
feel with.

02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:29.435
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, on
the topic of big data--

02:34:29.435 --> 02:34:31.900
I say data, actually.

02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:33.780
So this is a data set that I've
been playing around with

02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:35.180
for the last few weeks.

02:34:35.180 --> 02:34:36.430
It's really awesome.

02:34:36.430 --> 02:34:38.080
You should check it out if
you're interested in

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:39.250
this kind of stuff.

02:34:39.250 --> 02:34:42.230
It's 25,000 cab trips
in the San Francisco

02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:44.890
area over a week period.

02:34:44.890 --> 02:34:48.280
So you've got here the cab ID,
the time, and the location of

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.000
the cab at that time.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.260
So the cab ID's useful because
you can string together a

02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:56.240
whole bunch of these points and
figure out the path of a

02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.480
particular cab.

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:02.190
So this equates to over
one million points.

02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:06.010
So similar in vain to Josh's
visualization, we can just

02:35:06.010 --> 02:35:08.290
display them all at once.

02:35:08.290 --> 02:35:12.000
So of course all of these
points, one million points all

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.780
stacked on top of each other
doesn't look great.

02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:18.870
So each point, I've got a very
small amount of opacity, so

02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:20.380
they sort of stack up.

02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:23.840
And you can immediately see
the most-traveled streets.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.740
So just for a moment, imagine
that the base map wasn't here,

02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:30.120
you'd sort of be able to get a
sense of the layout of the San

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:32.910
Francisco city, which
is pretty cool, just

02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:35.300
from this raw data.

02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.760
And then we can do something
like take a

02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:38.120
selection of that data.

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:40.730
So here I'm taking
a slice of time.

02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:45.210
So from 4:00 PM on Sunday to
4:08, and you can just see the

02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:48.060
trail of that particular car.

02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:49.390
JOSH LIVNI: Can you zoom it
in a bit there, yeah.

02:35:49.390 --> 02:35:52.300
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this is sort
of interesting, but you

02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:54.080
can't get a sense of the
direction that the car is

02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:55.440
traveling in.

02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:59.770
So we can apply some techniques,
color and scale,

02:35:59.770 --> 02:36:04.110
to sort of show a trail behind
the cab's current position at

02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:06.200
the end of that time slice.

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:08.910
This is sort of cool.

02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:10.630
You get a sense of direction.

02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:13.390
And then we can do some really
cool things like animate

02:36:13.390 --> 02:36:15.820
through, and you really
get a sense of

02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:17.085
the flow of the traffic.

02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:25.090
So just by moving the slice
of time slowly--

02:36:25.090 --> 02:36:29.290
so we're doing about five
minutes of time every second,

02:36:29.290 --> 02:36:30.960
something like that--

02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:32.550
you sort of get a
sense of flow.

02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:35.530
And if I did this through the
whole data set, you'd cycle

02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:38.670
through the days of the week
and be able to see the busy

02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:39.920
and the quiet periods.

02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:44.350
That's sort of cool, but let's
do some more interesting

02:36:44.350 --> 02:36:46.440
things, such as coloring.

02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:50.430
So here I've applied a color
to each point, and it's the

02:36:50.430 --> 02:36:52.810
speed of the car at that
point in time.

02:36:52.810 --> 02:36:55.850
So I've used the cab ID to
figure out where it's been

02:36:55.850 --> 02:36:57.410
traveling, the speed.

02:36:57.410 --> 02:36:58.310
And so this is sort of cool.

02:36:58.310 --> 02:37:01.140
Just by plotting all these
points, you get a sense of

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:03.690
where the traffic
in the city is.

02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:10.300
And if I just zoom in, it sort
of fades out, and we can

02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:14.410
provide a tool like this to sort
of bump up the opacity,

02:37:14.410 --> 02:37:16.990
so you can really start to
explore the data set.

02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:19.680
And so the interesting thing
that you might see here is

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.440
that around the Market Street
area downtown, the GPS is

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:25.310
really noisy.

02:37:25.310 --> 02:37:28.710
So you can sort of see, as
opposed to really straight

02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:32.370
streets, you've got all this
sort of fuzzy points.

02:37:32.370 --> 02:37:34.150
JOSH LIVNI: Tall buildings
are not good for GPS.

02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:35.230
[INAUDIBLE].

02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:36.415
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
apparently cars can't drive

02:37:36.415 --> 02:37:37.665
through buildings.

02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.620
So we can combine these
techniques to sort of get a

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:47.350
colored squiggle moving around
the screen, which I thought

02:37:47.350 --> 02:37:48.580
was pretty cool.

02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:53.217
When I first did this, I sort
of just animated through it

02:37:53.217 --> 02:37:58.190
and stared at it for five
minutes, as I will do now for

02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.650
five minutes.

02:37:58.650 --> 02:38:00.518
MALE SPEAKER: Can you talk a
little bit about what your

02:38:00.518 --> 02:38:05.200
data set actually looks
like to power that?

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:05.590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, sure.

02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:08.100
Let's just look at the next
thing first. So this is a

02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:10.860
one-hour slice of time.

02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:14.350
And this is great, because you
can just scroll through and

02:38:14.350 --> 02:38:18.530
get a sense of the traffic
flows in that hour.

02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:23.260
So you see, it gets really quiet
around four AM, and as I

02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:27.010
keep scrolling through, you sort
of see the sort of more

02:38:27.010 --> 02:38:29.480
macro level of the flows of
traffic throughout the week.

02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:36.050
And it gets really busy
on Friday night.

02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:40.100
And you can see that traffic
starts to get pretty bad

02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:42.870
around 5:00 PM, you notice
people are heading out to

02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:44.120
dinner and whatnot.

02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:50.420
And then Saturday night gets
really busy again.

02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:53.750
And you can do cool things like,
if we just go ahead and

02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:57.150
display the whole data set,
we can go and zoom in.

02:38:57.150 --> 02:39:00.730
So this area looks
a bit funny.

02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:02.920
So it's sort of
interesting-looking for these

02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:06.720
red areas where cars
tend to stop.

02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:10.260
And so another cool one's down
here near the airport, some

02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:14.390
sort of waiting bay or
something like that.

02:39:14.390 --> 02:39:15.050
Sort of cool.

02:39:15.050 --> 02:39:18.440
And this is really awesome,
because you can zoom down into

02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.890
a particular point, which
is sort of amazing.

02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:23.270
JOSH LIVNI: Let's hop back to
that data set to the guy's

02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:25.420
question, because what I think
is so incredible about this is

02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:30.180
it's really just some straight
GPS lat-long times, and then

02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.500
from throwing it out directly at
the browser, we can create

02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:36.020
these pretty incredible,
dynamic, interactive tools,

02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:39.330
rather than having to render
some preset tiles in advance,

02:39:39.330 --> 02:39:40.920
and here's the story,
here's the map--

02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:42.900
which is great and fine, but
you can really start

02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:43.430
to play with it.

02:39:43.430 --> 02:39:45.200
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The other thing
we didn't mention was

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.180
we're using technologies like
Web Sockets to stream

02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:50.890
some the data down.

02:39:50.890 --> 02:39:53.630
So like for the example where
I showed a small slice of

02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:56.540
time, you can stream just that
data down to the client, they

02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:00.700
can start looking at it in
hundreds of milliseconds as

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:04.190
opposed to loading the
full data set.

02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:06.100
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:09.640
Or you could load just some
portion of the map that

02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.770
they're looking at, something
like that.

02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:14.120
JOSH LIVNI: You want to
show the heat map?

02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:14.460
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:18.370
So another visualization of this
data set, basically just

02:40:18.370 --> 02:40:19.820
a heat map.

02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:22.940
So a heat map's really
an intensity map.

02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:27.140
So we can see the most-traveled
roads, which are

02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:29.700
in red, and it sort of
fades out to blue.

02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:34.750
And all of this being rendered
using WebGL as well, so it's

02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:38.150
quite fast. We've got 500,000
points here, I've just taken

02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:39.920
half of the data set.

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:42.800
And you sort of see this really
blurry area around

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.530
Market Street again, which
is interesting.

02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:49.220
But this is a really good way
to see the most frequently

02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:50.790
traveled roads.

02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:53.520
And you sort of get a sense of
where they're stopping for

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:57.260
traffic lights and taking off,
you sort of see a sort of

02:40:57.260 --> 02:41:00.020
triangle pattern at
intersections, which I think

02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:01.610
is interesting.

02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:02.710
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:05.200
And I think again, the main
story here is the problems

02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.260
that used to be really hard--
displaying a heat map, you had

02:41:07.260 --> 02:41:09.200
to set up all this
infrastructure, you had to get

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.250
your points on top of the
geospatial database, you had

02:41:11.250 --> 02:41:12.830
to render some tiles, and
then boom, you have

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:14.100
a static heat map.

02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:16.980
Now we can just get the raw data
and let users sort of see

02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:18.230
the story that they
want to see.

02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:21.040
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You can start
to explore and look at what

02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:24.240
you want to look at.

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:25.760
JOSH LIVNI: So I
think that's--

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:26.510
oh yeah.

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:28.190
What should you do if
you would like to do

02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.970
this type of thing?

02:41:28.970 --> 02:41:30.430
So to kind of start out
at the beginning here,

02:41:30.430 --> 02:41:32.670
just a quick recap.

02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:34.900
Not all the way to Mayan style,
but if you want to

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:37.932
start using some techniques to
make pretty maps, use our

02:41:37.932 --> 02:41:39.850
Styled Maps, makes your
backgrounds, like you noticed

02:41:39.850 --> 02:41:42.230
in these demos, a nice, faded
background lets you tell your

02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:43.580
story nicely on top.

02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:45.260
Maybe the story you have to
tell, you want some really

02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:46.790
vibrant colors, use
that beautiful

02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:47.910
example Chris put together.

02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:49.860
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I have a sweet
video of a Christmas

02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:52.220
styled map, all green and red
and white, it's pretty sweet.

02:41:52.220 --> 02:41:54.570
JOSH LIVNI: You can imagine how
pretty that would look.

02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:56.440
Yeah, so the Style Map's really
good, use that for the

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:57.595
background.

02:41:57.595 --> 02:42:00.310
You've got some couple thousand
points, maybe you

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:03.400
want to cluster them, it's a
good technique, depending on

02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:06.670
the different stories you have.
Dotter, at Open Source

02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:07.960
Library, you can look for.

02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:10.580
That's just a canvas
[INAUDIBLE], so a lot of

02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:13.610
computers don't have WebGL
ready, maybe want to display a

02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:17.300
few tens of thousands of points,
you get that in a nice

02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:21.310
canvas, it's widely supported
and looks pretty good.

02:42:21.310 --> 02:42:25.000
Put your data up on some App
Engine, CloudSQL type of thing

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.810
if you want, and then just
stream it down with web

02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:29.740
sockets or what have you.

02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:33.150
You've got all the HTML5
stuff we covered.

02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:35.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So all of those
links are down at that

02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:41.360
goo.gl short link, which will
also be on the next slide.

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:42.430
Thanks for coming.

02:42:42.430 --> 02:42:43.650
JOSH LIVNI: All right.

02:42:43.650 --> 02:42:44.590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
drive safely.

02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.970
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, yeah.

02:42:44.970 --> 02:42:46.220
Indeed.

02:42:50.010 --> 02:42:51.655
So it looks like we
have about five,

02:42:51.655 --> 02:42:52.620
seven minutes for questions?

02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:53.180
Is that right, Timothy?

02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:54.635
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You do have
time for questions.

02:42:54.635 --> 02:42:55.170
JOSH LIVNI: That's what
I like to hear.

02:42:55.170 --> 02:42:57.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
many can we get?

02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:58.120
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah?

02:42:58.120 --> 02:42:59.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I can
always rely on

02:42:59.250 --> 02:43:00.860
this guy for a question.

02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:01.506
JOSH LIVNI: Uh oh.

02:43:01.506 --> 02:43:02.240
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, cool.

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:06.290
You mentioned kind of briefly
the limit between SVG and when

02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:08.510
you started using WebGL.

02:43:08.510 --> 02:43:11.020
I'd like to know more about
where that limit actually is,

02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:14.480
and then maybe even what, if
any, is the upper limit of

02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:16.690
WebGL for the number of
points you can show.

02:43:16.690 --> 02:43:16.980
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yes.

02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:20.040
So we actually didn't do
anything with SVG, and I

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:23.300
haven't done much work with SVG,
but I think for this kind

02:43:23.300 --> 02:43:26.645
of work, Canvas 2D is faster.

02:43:26.645 --> 02:43:29.750
JOSH LIVNI: You tend to notice
a bit of a panning delay on

02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:32.210
the Redraw when you're working
with SVG, so it kind of

02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:35.070
renders quickly and you have
instant CSS action on it,

02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:39.130
which is great, but it has some
other drawbacks, and we

02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:40.550
kind of prefer going with
the Canvas route.

02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:43.880
But really important question,
which is how far can you get?

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:48.250
5,000, 10,000, 15,000, on
Canvas, and it really is up

02:43:48.250 --> 02:43:49.300
the person and their browser.

02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:50.760
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
their computer.

02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:51.400
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, exactly.

02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:56.600
So most modern browsers, you
could get 20,000 points, no

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.540
problem probably on Canvas.

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.450
But maybe an older browser,
you'd have some--

02:44:02.450 --> 02:44:04.780
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we actually
render Google Map

02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:08.530
Markers in Canvas, and we sort
of say tens of thousands on

02:44:08.530 --> 02:44:12.250
modern browsers and on
non-modern, like thousands,

02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:13.140
something like that.

02:44:13.140 --> 02:44:14.170
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

02:44:14.170 --> 02:44:16.425
And that's really kind of the
same for WebGL, depends a

02:44:16.425 --> 02:44:20.160
bunch on your hardware,
on your graphics card.

02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:22.400
The main limiting factor we've
noticed in WebGL is the

02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:23.910
bottleneck is kind of
the bandwidth to get

02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:24.840
all the data over.

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:26.130
And there's some interesting
things we're thinking

02:44:26.130 --> 02:44:27.800
about to make that.

02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:30.550
So I didn't really show you this
part, but for example in

02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:32.980
the fatality demo, there's
thousands of attributes that

02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:34.770
you can get all these
tables adjoined.

02:44:34.770 --> 02:44:37.670
A really simple API, you just
get only those attributes that

02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:40.520
I want and then bring
those ones over.

02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:42.570
And so there's some techniques
you can use to overcome that

02:44:42.570 --> 02:44:45.000
bottleneck, and the Web
Socket is just getting

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.120
the subset you want.

02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:47.480
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So even though
you can bring big data

02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:49.980
into the client, you might
not necessarily want

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.920
to take all of it.

02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:55.920
There's definitely a case
for taking slices of it.

02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.840
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah but definitely,
a million plus

02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:59.100
points we've been showing,
and pretty

02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:02.145
snappy, no problem here.

02:45:02.145 --> 02:45:03.440
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Heat maps
are pretty intensive

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:05.222
to generate as well.

02:45:05.222 --> 02:45:07.320
So it's cool stuff.

02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.564
Yep, down here?

02:45:09.564 --> 02:45:11.910
MALE SPEAKER: I was just
wondering if the API will

02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:15.750
include a fallback for less
modern browsers for those

02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:18.310
features, like for
WebGL and Canvas?

02:45:18.310 --> 02:45:18.556
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Right.

02:45:18.556 --> 02:45:21.280
So everything we've shown here
isn't in the API itself, it's

02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:24.560
just sort of our experiments.

02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.140
JOSH LIVNI: So as a developer,
you would potentially check to

02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:30.310
see if the person had WebGL,
if so, give them one

02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:33.040
experience, and kind of have
your own series of fall-backs,

02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:35.870
a pretty good technique
to have generally.

02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:37.100
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:37.810
JOSH LIVNI: Yes, exactly.

02:45:37.810 --> 02:45:39.580
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So maybe if
they don't have WebGL, you

02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:42.610
don't have these cool sliders,
you just give them the tiles

02:45:42.610 --> 02:45:45.480
to look at.

02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Additional
questions?

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:53.050
MALE SPEAKER: This might be a
little bit of a segue, but so

02:45:53.050 --> 02:45:55.140
I saw you guys did a lot of
stuff on the map itself, but

02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:57.980
one of the pain points that
I found is the map bubble.

02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:01.450
Were there any developments made
in making it easier for

02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:04.060
developers to customize
the map bubble itself?

02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:04.470
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

02:46:04.470 --> 02:46:07.420
There's a couple Open Source
libraries that sort of

02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:09.920
re-implement a nice-looking
bubble.

02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:12.280
Info Bubble's one of them
that's really, really

02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:13.046
customizable.

02:46:13.046 --> 02:46:15.060
You can use CSS to style it.

02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:18.090
Yeah, check that out.

02:46:18.090 --> 02:46:19.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions?

02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:24.130
No?

02:46:24.130 --> 02:46:24.760
Is that it?

02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:25.552
All right.

02:46:25.552 --> 02:46:29.600
Is there anything else you guys
want to say before we go?

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:29.790
JOSH LIVNI: No.

02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:31.600
We'll be around here for a
little while if you want to

02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:34.440
come up and chat.

02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:37.195
Drive home safe, and
play with WebGL.

02:46:37.195 --> 02:46:38.020
Thanks, guys.

02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:42.050
[APPLAUSE]

02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:44.560
So just a few announcements for
you before we get going.

02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:46.590
Thank you, of course, to all
of our speakers for the

02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.590
excellent material that
they presented.

02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:51.530
I'd also like to thank NewTek
for bringing in that really

02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:54.200
cool tri-caster rig and
making our web stream

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.950
look absolutely fantastic.

02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:59.160
We do have a hot dog
cart out front.

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.030
So if you're hungry, please
do grab some food.

02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:03.510
We also have--

02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:04.060
what's that?

02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:04.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry
to the live stream.

02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:05.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, sorry
to the live stream.

02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:07.610
No hot dogs for you.

02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:11.320
We do have code labs later
today, so please be sure to

02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:12.630
check out that event's URL.

02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:15.070
Just search for South by
Southwest Google, and you'll

02:47:15.070 --> 02:47:18.410
get to our events URL with
speakers, where we're speaking

02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:19.810
all around South By.

02:47:19.810 --> 02:47:21.740
And also, come back for
these code labs.

02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:24.130
It's a really great chance
to get sort of one-on-one

02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:27.050
attention to do some cool
stuff with the APIs.

02:47:27.050 --> 02:47:29.830
And those are at 3:00
PM in this house.

02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:31.510
Anything else?

02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:32.830
I have cue cards.

02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:34.080
They're human cue cards.

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.125
It's really great.

02:47:35.125 --> 02:47:38.040
But thank you so much and have
a great time at South By, and

02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:39.590
do try and stay dry.

02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:40.840
Bye now.
