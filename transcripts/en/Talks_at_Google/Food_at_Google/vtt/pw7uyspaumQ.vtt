00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.980
BEATRICE PELTE: So the
book is over there.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.520
So I don't have a copy now here.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.261
But yes, so this is my second
book entitled "My French Family

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:17.760
Table."

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.190
And often, when I'm asked
what's the difference

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.010
between the first one
and the second one,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.200
is the first one was focusing
more on introducing recipes

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.590
that I know to do across.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.740
And it was actually
divided by occasions.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.730
Whereas this one, four years
later, focuses more on family.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.740
And a title "French
Family Table,"

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.990
meaning that the food is
obviously French by essence.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.550
And specifically
for the book and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.050
for the general understanding
of French cuisine,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.400
I wanted specifically
to try to educate people

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.320
to understanding that
French cuisine is not

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.634
necessarily only meaning
fine dining and elegant.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:06.050
As a matter of
fact, French people

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.140
eat very simple
things every day.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.930
This book is a translation
of the kind of work flow, so

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.820
to speak, of how a typical
French family would eat,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.570
which obviously
sounds very cliche.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.500
But it is our reality every day.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.590
In 2002, I had one daughter.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.440
In 2016, we have two children.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.630
So it even made more sense to
write this book because for me,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.930
educating my children
to taste and good food

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.780
is a strong part
of their education.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.930
So I really wanted this
book to focus on that.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.860
So when you look
at the book, you

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.620
will see that the book
follows the rhythm of our day,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.620
from breakfast recipes to lunch.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.650
And my typical lunch would be
a savory tart, salad, soups.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.720
That's typically
what we enjoy eating.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.340
There's a section focusing
on cooking with my daughter

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.850
specifically, because obviously,
Remy is too small for that yet.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.120
But I want to share the
passion I have to including her

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.310
in cooking food.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.020
So there's a whole
section devoted to that.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.550
There's a section talking
about the typical snack

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.320
that French people
do, which typically

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.170
happens at 4:00 PM
every day after school.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.900
There's a section
on main courses,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.850
and obviously on
desserts, because I

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.760
love to make desserts.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.670
One thing that is worth
noting, but is not

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.300
necessarily the main
focus of my book,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.270
but I want to
mention it more also

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.570
for the second than the first.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.710
It turns out that all
the recipes in the book

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.311
are gluten free.

00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.810
And the reason why
I don't want this

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.230
to be the focus because
for me, the focus has

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.650
to be on enjoyment of
food and not on saying,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.340
this is a special diet.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.670
As a matter of fact, when
people come to the house,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.200
I never emphasize that
the book is gluten free

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.880
or the recipes are gluten free.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.040
It's all about sharing a moment
together around the table.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.180
So that's something that
now, especially, I've

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.280
been eating gluten free
for more than 10 years.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.810
And 10 years ago, things
were very different from what

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.950
they are today.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.460
And I know that now,
there's way more emphasis

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.884
and having a gluten
free diet is more--

00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:33.550
I want to say it's the norm, but
it's more like, oh yeah, right.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.150
It's more available
and accessible.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.990
So that's something
that now we actually

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.300
added on the subtitle
of the book as well.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.790
The first one didn't
have that byline.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.540
So for today, I
chose a recipe that

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.570
is very flexible
in the sense of it

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.160
is a chocolate cake that I
have included in the chocolate

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.590
section of the book.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.440
Because at home, we
eat a lot of chocolate.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.797
We love chocolate every season.

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:04.130
There's no season for chocolate.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.950
So here we are July.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.337
And every day, there's a
chocolate cake at the house.

00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:11.170
The reason why this
cake is very interesting

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.140
is because it's got
three components.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.950
It's got the chocolate
base cake, a decoration

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.959
made of mascarpone cheese and
very simple with a bit of sugar

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.870
and whipped cream, and decorated
with fresh raspberries.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
And the reason why this recipe
is very welcome in any kitchen,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.390
I find, is I use a chocolate
cake base as an everyday cake.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.900
As a matter of fact, I make
this chocolate cake every week

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.470
at the house, something
that I like to nibble on

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.017
throughout the day.

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:40.850
And I'm not kidding.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.140
I do that.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.430
And then when you have friends
coming over for a meal,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.490
it's nice to actually have
something more decorated.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.200
So I use the other
two pieces, which

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.290
is the mascarpone cheese
element and the raspberries,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.210
to dress it up.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.710
The recipes in the book are
actually designed this way.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.300
I like to take an
everyday recipe.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.150
And if I need to transform it
into something more dressed up,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.890
I can with little
touches to finish a dish.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.320
So I'm not going to
give example now.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.476
But if you looked
throughout the book,

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:18.100
some main courses
are designed this way

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.930
where you would have something
that the whole family enjoys,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.870
children included, because
there's nothing that separates

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.930
children from adult food.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.720
But some touches that would be
more complicated for children

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.600
can be added.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.660
So you don't have to think
about two different menus

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.500
when you have
people coming over.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.600
Nobody likes that.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.810
I mean, at home, I try not
to do that whenever possible.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.590
So the cake.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.370
This is a chocolate cake made
with buckwheat and hazelnut.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.360
So it is gluten free, as I said.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.720
It uses chocolate here.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.920
It uses butter and eggs,
hazelnut meal, buckwheat,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.470
and what else?

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.610
A little bit of fleur de sel for
the chocolate base and that's

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.070
pretty much it.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.400
And then for the decoration, I
have mascarpone, whipped cream,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.200
and raspberries.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.230
And finishing touches
with confectioner's sugar.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:21.000
So I'm going to start with
my chocolate and my sugar.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.150
But at home, I usually
put everything by weight.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.470
Something that is
specified in the book

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.850
is always a measure and
weight of every ingredient

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.880
you have for accuracy.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.530
So you need roughly-- I
have the recipe here--

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.770
but I put here 125 grams.

00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:53.370
125, little more.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.370
And the sugar.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.700
I have here 70 grams.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.230
Depending also-- at
home, not to be biased,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.340
but I do use a lot of
the Valrhona chocolate.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.120
And I like to look at the cocoa
contents of the chocolate.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.610
So my favorites are between
66% to 70% cocoa contents.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.780
If you use 66, you might
actually want a bit less sugar.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.280
If you use 70%, you want to
have a little more sugar.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.090
I play it by whatever
chocolate is handy.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.540
But roughly, you want between
70 and 80 grams of sugar.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.850
80 grams of butter.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.220
So you melt that.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.664
So then three eggs.

00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:39.330
Put the eggs in.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.330
That's where the sugar goes.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.160
So here, I don't know what's
the content of that chocolate.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.020
But I'll put roughly 80 grams.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.920
So you put that in here.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.790
You want a texture
that's going to be

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.670
creamy and light in color.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.880
So you can leave that
unattended and then

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.190
let it do its thing
while you prepare that

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.890
and measure the rest
of the ingredients.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.280
I'm done with this.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.130
And I'm now going to measure the
buckwheat flour, the hazelnuts,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.350
and the fleur de sel.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.210
What's nice about
fleur de sel, it just

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.040
adds a little bit
of specks of salt

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.400
to the finer taste of
the chocolate base.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.445
So I need about 40
grams of each flour.

00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:23.980
That's the buckwheat.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.390
I like to use buckwheat with
chocolate specifically recipes.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.660
And then hazelnut.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.860
And this is hazelnut.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.350
You could use almond.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.159
If people are allergic to nuts,
you could use quinoa, millet.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.860
And if it's not important
to eat gluten free,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.190
you can use even regular flour.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.390
The buckwheat is actually
nice for taste factor.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.880
But you could use all purpose
flour as well instead of

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.900
the nuts.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.025
But the nuts actually add a
very good texture to the cake.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:58.230
A little fleur de sel here.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.700
And I keep that for later.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.690
Then I just have to watch
how everything is doing.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.725
Just waiting for the chocolate
to melt with the butter.

00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:12.406
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the gluten thing.

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:16.570
When I lived in France,
flour was everywhere--

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.974
real flour, wheat flour--
bread, pastry, and so on.

00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:23.630
Has the gluten free
fad hit France?

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.880
BEATRICE PELTE: It's starting.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.310
It's not going to be
as prevailing in places

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.400
like the US or even Ireland.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.700
My parents-in-law are Irish.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.350
And there's a lot of people
that actually-- I'm not celiac,

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.400
but there's a lot of people that
are actually celiac in Ireland.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.620
So It's very easy to get
everything gluten free,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.390
including bread in restaurants.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.270
In France, you
would not find that.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.800
So it is still a
challenge for me.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.827
But you get used to
doing without it.

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:55.410
AUDIENCE: It's hard to imagine
eating in France without bread.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.060
BEATRICE PELTE:
But you can make--

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.600
I mean, I made my own bread.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.480
So, I mean, yes, I don't
eat a baguette the same way,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.470
and there are things that
I don't cook the same way.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.280
But there's a lot of foods that
are gluten free in essence.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.500
So when you go to a
restaurant, definitely people

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.020
are educated to it.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.650
They would always accommodate.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.910
But they would not
have replacements

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.370
for-- let's say there's
restaurants in the Boston area

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.500
where they actually even
serve gluten free bread,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.477
good restaurants.

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.060
But in France, that
would be a little,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.100
I think, too much to ask.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.320
So move over here things.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.160
I'm going to turn that down.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.590
So this is nice, light in color.

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:52.580
So I'm going to
put that in here.

00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:03.510
This is what I have now here.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.065
And then I'm going just to
basically use this spatula

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:11.250
to just mix it in together.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.813
AUDIENCE: Can you just leave
it out during the week?

00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:19.700
BEATRICE PELTE: Yeah.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.782
It doesn't last very long.

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:23.240
AUDIENCE: But at
some point, do you

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.640
need to put it in the fridge?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.090
BEATRICE PELTE: Yeah.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.680
I mean, if it's hot weather
like that, I would definitely.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.920
In winter I wouldn't need to.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.570
But when it's hot and it's
really muggy like this,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.330
I would put it in the fridge.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.830
But then I would actually
take it out of the fridge.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.730
It's nicer eaten
at room temperature

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.780
because, obviously, the fridge
is going to make it harder.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.200
It's not actually
unpleasant by any means,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.580
but it just alters the texture,
definitely, makes it harder.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.410
More like-- almost
like a kind of-- it

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.180
loses the moisture of it.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.611
As a matter of fact, I made
one-- what day is today?

00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:06.110
Tuesday?

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.330
I made one-- I forget when.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.160
Sunday maybe.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.890
Yes, when it was very hot.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.390
Sunday.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.380
When it was a little
less hot, Sunday.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.390
And I put it in the
fridge last night.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.430
And I ate a slice earlier
this morning at 11:00 AM

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.430
with a cup of tea.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.480
Normally, you would
put parchment paper

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.720
for easiness of removing the
cake or cutting it better.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.730
But especially if
you have a nice pan

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.460
at home, a ceramic pan,
you could actually bake it.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.440
You just butter it generously.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.210
And then you just
put the batter in it.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.530
And so you notice there's no
yeast or anything or baking

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.950
powder in it.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.730
So it is not a cake that's
going to be very high,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.330
rise very much.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.170
And then you preheat
your oven at 350.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.560
And then you put that in your
oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.320
That's it.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.810
And depending-- the one
that I make at home,

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.040
my pan is a little different.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.870
So actually, it's
a little higher.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.360
I actually use a
rectangular pan.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.050
And then you just
basically eat it like that.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.310
Or then you're going to end
up slicing it for tasting.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.065
So you're going to cut
it in small squares.

00:13:40.604 --> 00:13:42.145
That's just like
this to demonstrate.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.320
When I serve it as a
dessert for guests,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.200
I like to actually
cut slices like this.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.310
And you can see that actually
in the picture in the book.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.020
And so that's a bigger size.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.770
And basically, I would
pipe the mascarpone,

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.630
I would use a tip that actually
has a little decoration.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.390
And you would pipe, let's
say, six pieces here

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.040
with six raspberries on top.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.950
So I can demonstrate
with that as well.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:19.390
The next step is using
mascarpone and whipped cream.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.500
So I have both here
prepared for me.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.390
This mascarpone is
lightly sweetened

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.730
with confectioner's sugar.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.410
The whipped cream here has
this nice, firm texture.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.750
And you basically
combine both together so

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.650
that the mascarpone
is not too dense

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.400
and the whipped cream
makes it a little lighter.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.060
And then you get this,
which is always better

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:52.300
if it's a little-- on
days like today, if I

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.080
was to leave this out, it
would become a little too soft.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.830
So I try to keep it in the
fridge as long as possible

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.640
so that it doesn't
soften, especially

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.220
with the whipped cream.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.520
And then you just
pipe in a little bit.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.755
Actually I'm going to do-- And
then I have my raspberries.

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:46.980
And then the last piece would
be to use confectioner's sugar.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.804
What I would do at
home also is add

00:15:48.804 --> 00:15:51.690
a little bit of cocoa powder.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.210
Or you know what
you could do also?

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.710
Which I always have a
box of that at home.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.780
If you're familiar
with cocoa nibs,

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.830
cocoa nibs are beautiful in
a lot of different ways--

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.590
on finishes like this,
or even with granola

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.210
or any kind of yogurty dessert.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.200
But anyway, confectioner's
sugar always makes things nicer,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.520
I find.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.985
It's a cloud of happiness.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.210
See?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.420
Gives it life.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.440
And then after that, you
would do exactly the same

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.300
with a bit of cocoa
powder like this.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.880
And then you could put-- well,
imagine I have cocoa nibs.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.310
I would put cocoa nibs.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.500
I could put some chopped
hazelnuts, and my little cloud

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.224
of cocoa powder.

00:16:40.224 --> 00:16:41.580
Voila.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.652
That's my recipe.

00:16:42.652 --> 00:16:44.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.300
Thank you.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.120
Any questions?

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.700
AUDIENCE: So my
question is anytime

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.640
people ask me about foods
from my culture, my country,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.470
I can tell them exactly
what I like to cook myself,

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.440
what my parents
cook for me, what

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.830
my two sets of grandparents
eat in restaurants at home,

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.379
and that's pretty much it.

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:06.670
So how do you do your research?

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.180
Or do you do any
research so that you

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.470
can have French cuisine
or French cookbook?

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.420
Or do you just like
present your own ideas?

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.540
BEATRICE PELTE: Well, food
has always been with me

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.829
for many, many years.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.369
And so from being
a little girl, I

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.260
grew up in a very
small village in France

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.430
with very strong
home grown cooking.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.640
So everyone had
vegetable gardens.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.700
And food was really a
prevailing conversation at home.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.090
So my memories of cooking
have been following me

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.100
through the years.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.070
And so when I was
a little girl, I

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.210
kept actually little
notebooks where

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.940
I would cut recipes
from magazines

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.200
and stick them in them.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.420
So it's not something that
just happened recently

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.410
when all of a sudden I
decided to write a book.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.050
But having said that,
so it's something that's

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.060
been with me for a long time.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.050
I'm pretty obsessed with food.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.630
Let's put it this way.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.320
But there's so many
ways to keep up

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.990
with what's happening in
your own home country,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.950
including magazines.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.890
I mean, I have two
that I'm subscribed to.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.200
Being a blogger myself,
I know what's happening.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.710
So I'm reading what's going on
in France on the food scene--

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.980
what people like to eat,
what the food trends are.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.910
But it really depends
on the kind of memories

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.070
attached to your own food.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.980
Where are you from?

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.730
AUDIENCE: Hungary.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.350
BEATRICE PELTE: Hungary.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.650
I still think there's
a lot of things

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.830
that you can explain and go
back to you have your childhood

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.460
memories.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.600
I mean, magazines?

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.190
Are there Hungarian
food magazines?

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.760
Yeah.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.120
So they definitely talk more
about what Hungarians eat.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.346
And it's the same.

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:03.470
As a matter of fact, I got
a package from my mother

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.100
yesterday, including one
of my subscribed magazines.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.810
And I can see,
right, summer comes.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.470
Here comes the vegetable tarts.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:16.490
Here comes the barbecued things
that are typical of France.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.977
I mean, as an example, French
people would have a barbecue.

00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:22.310
Americans would have a barbecue.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.760
But they would eat
completely different things.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.250
So it's just something
that is inside,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:34.190
I think, educating
people to taste.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:39.240
Even the way people
present food is different.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.650
I think it's not difficult for
me to keep up with this here

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.910
because the accessibility
to ingredients is very easy.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.450
There's nothing that
I feel short of.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.760
In Boston, I find
pretty much everything

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.530
if I want to eat or cook
authentic French food.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.630
But my cuisine-- and
I like to say that.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.420
My food is not--
if you're expecting

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.548
to find in the book things like
blanquette de veau or boeuf

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:11.730
Bourguignon or those kind
of very traditional food

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.200
recipes, that's not so
much what I like to cook.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.270
I like to focus more
on traditional recipes,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:24.860
but with my own touches and
the modern way, so to speak.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.930
So it's obviously catering
to the family needs.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.080
Recipes are faster.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.200
They are easier to make.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.150
It's not going to be
boeuf Bourguignon that

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.820
takes four hours to cook.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.830
That's not the kind of
cuisine I offer in the book.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:44.650
It's more catering
to everyday at home.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.992
So it's really what we eat.

00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:48.283
Does that answer your question?

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.363
Yes?

00:20:53.363 --> 00:20:55.828
AUDIENCE: Did you find
that, moving to the US,

00:20:55.828 --> 00:20:59.279
you had to alter the
way that you cook some

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:03.223
just because of-- just
ovens are different

00:21:03.223 --> 00:21:04.720
or the pans are different?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.010
BEATRICE PELTE:
Well, I know people

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.950
a lot talk about some
ingredients like flour,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.590
butter is different.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.216
And actually, I am friends with
people at the Vermont Butter

00:21:18.216 --> 00:21:19.870
and Cheese Company.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.800
And my friend Adleen,
who is actually

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.590
in charge of a big production
part of making cheese and cream

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.260
and everything, always tells
me butter is a big deal.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.460
And it's never going
to be the same.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.450
But I find adjusting
very easy, actually.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.476
If I was really scientific
about food, more so,

00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:47.220
especially with baking--
making a baguette or all

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.155
those kind of
things-- possibly I

00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:51.060
would find flours
more challenging.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.910
But obviously, on my end,
because I also use other flour

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.470
than wheat-based ones, I
don't find any difference

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.570
or challenge.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.080
As a matter of fact, one thing
that I really love moving here

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.300
was in France, as an
example, farmers markets

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.600
are very beautiful
in season, especially

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.819
in the south when you
travel there in the summer.

00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:19.190
But people often
say, oh, there's

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.510
farmers markets throughout
the year in France.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.700
But actually, if
you go to Paris,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.200
and you go to those
marches outside,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.400
and you actually look at the
labels where things come from,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.170
a lot of them in
the middle of winter

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.460
are not coming from France.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.470
They come from Morocco.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.550
They come from Spain or
the Netherlands, wherever.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.050
Whereas when I came
here, I remember

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.950
going to the farmers market
and thinking, Jesus, 10 stands.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.960
That's ridiculous.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.000
And I started really
understanding the whole concept

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.830
of the farmer's
market and why it's

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.840
so nice to have farmer's market
here because what you find

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.910
is what people produce.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.360
And it's no things coming
from Spain or anywhere else.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.090
It's basically what people make.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:05.020
And I ended up preferring those
kind of markets to the ones

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.280
that-- even I'm from the
Northeastern part of France

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.810
where it's not like the
south, you can grow things

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.480
as much with abundance.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.510
And you go to the
market and you really

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.500
find things are coming
from North Africa.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.374
You know, bananas.

00:23:20.374 --> 00:23:21.790
You find everything
at the market.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.179
Well, nobody in
France grows bananas.

00:23:25.179 --> 00:23:27.012
Whereas here, you go
to the farmer's market,

00:23:27.012 --> 00:23:29.640
you just find what
people produce.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.950
And I think that's much better.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.438
That makes more sense.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:39.770
Yes?

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.854
AUDIENCE: So when you're
cooking for your family,

00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:42.770
how long does it take?

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.978
And then how long do you
spend when people come over?

00:23:44.978 --> 00:23:45.895
What's the difference?

00:23:45.895 --> 00:23:47.769
BEATRICE PELTE: So how
long it takes to make.

00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:49.050
And then sorry, the last part?

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.425
AUDIENCE: So how
long when you're

00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:52.460
cooking just for your
family, versus how long

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.710
you're cooking when you're
entertaining guests.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.860
BEATRICE PELTE: Well, it
depends what I obviously make.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.510
But I would say, on
average, I would spend,

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.750
let's say, an hour
in the kitchen.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:13.160
Obviously, when Remy
arrived, there was more chaos

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.360
at home with two children.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.490
But as I said, I don't separate.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.750
So I make one main course.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.740
And that doesn't mean that
our daughter specifically

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.780
will like everything.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.960
But we have a rule.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.060
She needs to try everything,
sometimes reluctantly.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.736
But that's OK.

00:24:33.736 --> 00:24:35.830
We don't win at every battle.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.530
There's always going to
be something she likes.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.710
And then the rest is
pretty much a main course

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.440
that we can-- how do you say?

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.820
As an example, I
would make a risotto,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.380
which from start to finish
is roughly 30 minutes.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.830
You cook it for 20 minutes.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.670
You have maybe 10 minutes prep.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.530
And then with that,
I would make a salad.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.290
And then maybe I would
have smoked salmon,

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:07.420
or I would have a piece of
fish, easy, like a baked fish.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.780
You would have a piece
of nice wild salmon.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.490
You oil with salt,
pepper, fresh herbs.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.725
15 minutes in the oven.

00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:18.100
You don't have to
think about it.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.220
And then a green salad,
and you have dinner.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.420
When guests come, obviously,
it can go from very quick

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.730
like this to I have to be
in the kitchen all day.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.730
And I do that.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.480
I like when my husband asks
me, oh yeah, let's go hiking

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.609
this morning and do this.

00:25:36.609 --> 00:25:38.400
Or let's go do the
shopping in the morning.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.483
I'm thinking, you're
out of your mind.

00:25:40.483 --> 00:25:42.667
I have people coming tonight.

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.250
I'm not going shopping
in the morning.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.700
I'm not doing all those
things in the morning.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.110
I have to focus on the food.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.500
I organize my day around that.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.770
I prep a cold soup that
has to sit in the fridge.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.980
And then I can finish the
main course in the evening.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.850
And the dessert typically,
if it's something like this,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.140
the base would be
baked in the morning

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.070
and I can assemble
in the evening.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.870
But I love what I do.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.000
So obviously,
cooking is something

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.870
that I'm not shy
spending time doing.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:21.420
But the recipes in the
book are definitely

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.451
offering a variety
of lengths and times.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.400
What I love about the
books, even more so

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.690
this one than the first one,
is it's a very lived in book.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.460
It's like we live
with it every day.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.480
As a matter of fact,
which is very rare for me

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.750
to go back to my
own recipes, but I

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.640
take my own book from the
shelf and I cook from it.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.070
And it's like, yeah, the
first one, I can retest.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.750
Yeah, they work.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.060
That's a big deal.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.890
And second, this is really the
food or the recipes we eat,

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.020
whether it's for us
or when people come.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.440
And I really like that about it.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.410
It's really a used book.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.310
Because, like every
person who does what I do,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.460
I own a lot of books at home.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.620
And do I cook from them?

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.650
Probably not from most of them.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.310
I mean, I'm a photographer.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.650
So I like to take time
looking and getting

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.370
inspired by what other
people do, how they do it.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.050
But it's nice to have
a book that I can

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.941
go back to and use every day.

00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:25.700
AUDIENCE: If you're blogging
and working on social media,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.395
do you keep a schedule
for yourself on what days

00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:29.130
you do that?

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.046
BEATRICE PELTE: Right.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.570
Well, that's what I
would want-- OK, I

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:42.660
was able to do that probably
two, three years ago.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.440
The last few years, the
last year and a half

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.630
have been more challenging.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.950
So I'm slowly getting back
into trying, step by step,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.650
first to go back to blogging.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.710
And things have
changed so much also.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.310
When I started, all
there was, was blogs.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.380
And I think one of the
first food bloggers.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.170
I'm not the first exactly,
but among the first food

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.130
blogs that exist.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.970
Now there's so many more blogs.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.220
Even for me, it's very hard
to keep up with everything

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.330
that's out there.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.620
And things have changed.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.260
So myself, I migrated to
become an avid blogger

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.780
to a more avid Instagrammer.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.330
And because what I
do is very visual,

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.620
Instagram is very gratifying
because I can do snap,

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.090
and my picture tells a story
of what's happening in my life

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.590
right now.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.210
So my readership
I think migrated

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.760
from many people
following my blog--

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.040
and they still exist--
to people that now

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.160
follow me a lot on Instagram.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.830
I think on Instagram,
which happened

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.030
for different
reasons-- I don't know

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.440
the truth of how
people sometimes

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.550
get so many followers.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.989
But sometimes along
the way-- and I

00:28:51.989 --> 00:28:54.030
know I've been featured
a few times on Instagram,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.970
so that always helps, obviously.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.220
But I have something
like 60,000 followers,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.670
which started from 0 to 60.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.270
And I think people migrate
themselves from Facebook

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:15.810
to Twitter and blogs still, but
it takes more time with a blog,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.420
depending on what kind
of content you deliver.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.670
I tend to want a nice
story with a nice picture.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.110
So to produce that for
me takes more time.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.210
So I don't have right now a
very tight schedule on that.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.120
I am hopeful to go back
to something better.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.620
But my reality right now
is I don't have the time.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620
Because I do this.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.480
I have the book, but
I have my own clients.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.350
I do a lot of editorial work.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.090
I do commercial work.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.330
This is how I have a living.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.740
The blog is very nice.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.620
The blog is supporting my
work, but I'm not generating
