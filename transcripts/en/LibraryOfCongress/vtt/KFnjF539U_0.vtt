Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.620
[ Pause ]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.290
My name is Nicholas Brown,
and I'm a music specialist

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.480
and concert producer here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.000
It's my great pleasure to
present to you Pontus Lidberg,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.840
who is an acclaimed Swedish
choreographer, and the Library

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.110 position:56%
of Congress and Martha Graham Dance
Company have co-commissioned Pontus'

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.370
new creation "Woodland",
which is a dance

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.700 position:56%
for the Martha Graham Dance Company,
and "Woodland" is set to music

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.960
by American composer Irving Fine.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.260
So, Pontus, welcome.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.560
Thank you so much for being here -

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.860
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Thank you.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm very happy to be
here, thank you -

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.460
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.760
And so can you tell us a little
bit about your background.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.320
When did you start dancing,
and do you have any training

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.980
in music or other forms of -

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.280
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.820
I came from a family that was very
interested in the arts in general.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.900
My mother more so in the performing
arts, and my father more perhaps

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.410
in literature and architecture,
but I was exposed to everything.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.490
And then one day my parents
took me, I was four years old,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.340
to a ballet performance, and I said
that I wanted to do that, and the,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.550
obviously, at four years
old, you don't know anything,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.200
but I had some intuitive sense that
I wanted to dance, and so I did,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.500
and I actually never stopped.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
It just kind of fed
into my education

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.460
at the Royal Swedish Ballet School
that started at ten, and then I,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.530 position:56%
after nine years, I started working.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.560 position:56%
So, you know, it's been a continuous
journey from four years old,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870
but I also played the piano.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.500
I have training in piano,
and around the age of ten,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.150
I had to make a choice if I was
going to pursue music or dance,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.290
and actually that was not so easy.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.290
It was more chance that
made one, you know, that.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.470
Let me say that again.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.500
It was more by chance
that I chose dance.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.850
It had to do with the
audition for the academy

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.720
of music was on a Sunday.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.440
It was dark in the winter.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.520
I was alone with teacher or
something in a room singing

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.090
and playing, and the audition for
the Royal Swedish Ballet School was

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.120 position:56%
on a Thursday, and there was lots of
people and very dynamic and people

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.730
in the corridors, and seemed
like an exciting place.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.740
Honestly, as I remembered
it, it was more because of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.040
that that I chose dance -

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.340
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Really.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.640
That's interesting.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.540 position:56%
And with your dance studies, did you
go beyond the Royal Swedish Ballet.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.250
I know you've had some
training in Martha Graham.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.480
Was that at the Royal
Swedish Ballet -

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.780
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.140
So the first contemporary
dance training that I had

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.440
at the Royal Swedish Ballet School,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.150
which was a classical
ballet training,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.480
but to expose all the
students to contemporary dance,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.500
there were various forms of
contemporary training as well,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.140
and the first one was
Graham technique,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.450
but that was a long time ago -

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh, yeah, no -

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.410
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And what other
contemporary techniques did you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.010
study -

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.250
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: And then
I was exposed to many others,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.900
and it's interesting because
in classical ballet, there are,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.770
of course, styles of training,
but, I mean, in essence,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.160
it's the same thing, but
in contemporary dance,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.460
it's not really the case.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.250
Martha was one of the few who
really codified a technique,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.540
and then others have done it, too,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.020
but it's kind of more following
the style and ideas of a person

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.650
as opposed to a technique
that is universally accepted.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.150
And so we had release technique,
and we had other kinds of training,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.520
but it's not really
comparable I think

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.460
to classical technique training.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And is
there any specific production

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.950
or memory from, say, your teenage
years and your dance training

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.320
that really formed who you
are today as an artist?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.110
Or any specific teacher
that you worked with?

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.120
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: What comes
to mind, and I guess intuition,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.130
you know, what I, what comes
to mind is actually some

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.580
of the travels I did in the summer.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.340
So at the age of 13
onwards, more or less,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.840
every summer there would be some
training travel because, of course,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.060
the layoff period in the school
year was more than two months,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.180
and that's too long not to train.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.610
So I started going to ballet
seminars or camps or guest studies

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.180
at different schools
internationally,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.000
and some of those were eye openers
to me because when you're part

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.670
of a small context in Stockholm

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.570
at the Royal Swedish Ballet
School, it's very small.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.940
You know, there's, you have your,
you know, seven co-students,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.820
and you have your teachers,
and every day's the same,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.060
and it's very formalized and
rigid, and that's what you do,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.800
and then you go out into the world,
and there are different kinds

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.820
of styles and emphasis and
training and students and,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.790
that was eye opening for me,
and there were many actually.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.690
One in particular is I
spent one summer semester

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.180
at the National Ballet
School of Canada in Toronto,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.630
and that was an eye opener because
I felt like I saw different aspects

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.050
of my dancing, and other people saw
that and reflected it back to me,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.470
and that was very important.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.180
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: At what
point did you start choreographing?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I started as soon

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.080
as I had an opportunity,
to be honest.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.220
Even I was I suppose
11 or something.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.350
Because there were school
concerts throughout the year,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.500
and there was one in
particular before Christmas

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.570
where students were
given the opportunity

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.180
to create or to perform a solo.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.160
It was a little bit more informal
maybe than the other concerts,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.780
and I started creating for that.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.830
So I would say as soon as there
was an opportunity to choreograph,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.100
I would take it in school.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.500
And then as a dancer, it
became clear pretty quickly

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.410
that actually creating
dance was more aligned

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.180
with what I wanted
from the art form.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:31.710
I like performing, but what is
necessary is to be creative.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.180
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And
with your choreography,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.670
do you approach working
with ensembles differently

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.400
than with soloists or pairs -

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.700
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.720
Ooh, it's so different.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.700
A recent work, I had
45 dancers in it, and -

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.000
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow -

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.410
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: And
another, other pieces.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.680
Actually, I prefer to do intimate
pieces because I think that my,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.770
one of my strengths is to draw
out things from individuals,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.900
and you can't do that
with huge groups.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.030
You kind of have to step back
and look at the overall picture,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.060
and it's almost more
like organizing, and.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.430
So, I mean, I like doing both,
but I do prefer working intimately

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.910
with people because it's
just more rewarding.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.760
Yeah -

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.410
Do you find there's a difference
in the way you choreograph

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.110
when it's an independent project
that you're doing with your,

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.000
under the umbrella Pontus
Lidberg dance versus working

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.690
with an established company
that has a very set profile -

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.810
at least to the public -

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.110
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.750
I'm adaptable in that way,
and I like to meet contexts

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.860
that inform me because
it's a dialogue.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.250
So I, I'm not the kind of
choreographer that arrives

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.740
and then posts something
regardless of where I am,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.560
but rather I like to first have
a feel for what kind of dancers

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.400
and people am I working with, and
what does that reflect, you know,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.370
in my work, and what
can we do together.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.920 position:56%
Basically, as a young
choreographer, I was more interested

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.230
in creating my own steps, my own
choreography, my own sequences

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.340
and so on, and I did that, but
after a while, I thought that,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:26.710
I started to understand that,
in fact, there is more to find

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.050
when you start collaborating
with people,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.900
and I like the conversational
aspect of creating.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.030
So I prefer that now.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.050
And, of course, some companies
do have a very strong identity,

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.450
like this one, for example,
and that's very nice for me

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.830
because it means that
I get information

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.520
that I wouldn't be
able to have otherwise.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.380
It's, it enriches me, and then

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.670
from that information,
I give back, you know.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.110
So I, it's really conversational.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.280 position:56%
I will give an impetus to something,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.710
and then the dancers will reflect
back to me, and then I take

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.300
that and guide it onwards.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.830
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: I
mean, if we think about the

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.980
"Woodland" project
specifically, what was your process

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.280
of selecting the piece that
you wanted to work with,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.250
and then also how has
the work evolved

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.700
from the very first
conceptual meetings or sessions

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.000
where you were thinking
through things

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.670
versus the first rehearsals to now?

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.490
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well, so
first, I started listening

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:37.870
to a music selection and just
getting familiar with this composer

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.820
and what, by the way, whose
music is rather varied.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.950
But I, it took a little
bit of searching

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:54.130
because initially I was
considering working conceptually,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.060
which is something I sometimes
do, meaning I will have an idea,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.850
and then I will find the
elements that all work together

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:13.860
to make this idea visible or to
work together to create this work.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.220
But I found that Irving Fine's
music, and especially the piece

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.150
that I ended up choosing, I
actually chose another piece first

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.330
of the first one that I chose
was "Serious Song" for strings,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.910
and I was sure that that was going
to be there because I was, like,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.860
this is wonderful, and this
needs to be choreographed,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.960
but I found it very difficult
to pair something with it.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.390
And it was, like, standalone
and too short a section, yeah.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:45.860
So I changed my mind, but the
more I worked with the music,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.630
the more I kind of understood that
actually superimposing a concept

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.970
on this is not going
to work out very well.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:58.570
I have to change my point of
entry and work with the music

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.860
and just kind of listen
to what it's saying,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.540
which is something
I also do sometimes.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.880
It's not new for me at all,
but it's just a different kind

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.000
of entry to the piece.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.340
So that's what I started doing.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:18.280
I was just writing down little
things I heard in the music freely,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.190
and, like, gathering
material that way.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.140
At the same time, I started
rehearsing with dancers,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.050
or started to created, and that
was the first time I had worked

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.820
with these dancers, and as I
mentioned, they are particular.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.120
They have a style.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.130
They have a kind of an
expression that is practiced.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.310
So I started just throwing
material at them

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:49.860 position:56%
to see what they would reflect back,
and we tried, then to rehearsing

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:58.370
that material with the music
and see how that work together.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.270 position:56%
So in the beginning I was very open,
like, to just see what my material,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.350
these dancers, and this music,
what would that, what is that.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.820
And then I started to kind of,
like, more specifically tease

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.940
out what the piece would be.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:18.000 position:56%
But I stayed with the, with a basic,
the fundamental idea for the pieces

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.280
that I have created
something to the music.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.610
It's really the music
that inform the piece.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.910
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.280
What specifically about Fine's
music, like whether rhythm

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.210
or harmonies really lends
itself to being set to dance?

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.730
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well, one of
the challenges that I've found,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.780
and which I hope that
have delivered,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:48.080
we'll see I suppose tonight, is
that I, as I heard the request was

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.810
to work with the music of Irving
Fine, who is no longer alive,

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.440
but to create a contemporary
work with his music.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.530
So that's, meaning taking
mid-century music essentially

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.740
and creating a contemporary work.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.440
And I, that is not super easy -

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.740
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah, I bet -

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.040
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.340
Because his music is particular.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.470
I've, in my ears, especially
in the, at first, you know,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.420
the first time you hear
it, I'm, I was, like,

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.130 position:56%
this is American mid-century music -

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.430
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:23.510
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So that's what,
it's very specific, and so for,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.170
I also considered visually, I was,
like, should I maybe go there.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.260
Should I create something
in century?

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.090
But, which I did not end up doing.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.570
But I think his music
is very sophisticated.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.360
It has a lot of detail.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.000
It has a lot of interesting
kind of turns.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.550
It's not, like a lot of music
nowadays that choreographers

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:54.820
like to us, me included sometimes,
not always, is more, like,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.190
a landscape that continues
for a long time.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.340
I would say, like, Philip
Glass is a good example

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.640
that a lot of people know.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.510
I mean, it continues
similarly for long time.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.620
Changes a little bit,
but it's more, like, a,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.740
you know, highway or something -

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.040
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.340
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Whereas
Irving Fine's music is not that.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.610
There is an idea that
lasts for seven seconds,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.050
and then it goes somewhere
else, you know.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.300
It's very rich in that way.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.130
So that's something I
had to also adapt to.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.610
There's, like, split second
moments that then dissolve

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.580
into the next thing,
but that's also fun

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.140
and interesting to
do choreographically.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.750
So I've, I kind of, I've
created in that way.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.710
It's not very long sequences of
things that go on for a long time,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.820
but rather they change quickly.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.210
It's very beautiful.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.650
It's, I mean, it's very, it
has very beautiful melody

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.560
and very beautiful harmony.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.710
Yeah, so, I mean, that's
always wonderful for dance.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:08.780
I, as I see, dance is a, dance is
really a synergy of many art forms

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.430
because it's the visual aspects,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.580
it's the movement aspect,
it's the what you hear.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.470
It's also can be theater,

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.120
what you're narrating
if that's happening.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.800
There's a lot of things going on.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:30.150
So, of course, the music
being beautiful is very nice -

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.450
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yes.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.020
How did you arrive the
title of "Woodland"?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.580
Is there some kind of
narrative that you come

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.450
to associate with the piece?

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.750
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.830 position:56%
It, it's a title that shouldn't be
taken too literally because it's not

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:48.880
about anything, really, but, again,
as I was creating this, and I,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.990 position:56%
as I was watching my own rehearsals,
one of the things that I see

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.830
in the piece is that it's a little
bit like watching nature or being

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.170
in the forest and watching,
just sitting down, still,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.240
and watching what's unfolding
around you, and, for example,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.020
and this is not literal, but,
for example, there is a fox walks

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.180
through the woods, or a bird
arrives, it sits on a branch

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.890
for a little while and then flies
away, and it doesn't mean anything,

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.300
yet, it can be very
meaningful actually just

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.190
to watch these things unfold.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:31.440
So the idea of a forest was, like,
one of the first words that I came

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.640
up with, but then woodland is
also an adjective of the woods.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.750
So I, that's how I chose the title.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.230
The other connotation is
being lost in the woods.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.520
There's kind of an air of
young adults or children,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.110
not literally children,
but being lost

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.980
in the woods and finding their way.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.280
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Neat.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.760
Very cool, and how would you
say the process was like working

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.830
with the designers to realize
the costumes and to sort

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.240
of bring the vision of the, you
know, multiple aspects together -

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.710
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So they
came in later in the process,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.750
which when there was already
quite a lot of material,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.070
and these ideas were already there.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:22.550
So they designed things that
are inspired by both children

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:30.880
and animals and young adult,
all of it together, and.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.800
Yeah. So that happens
later in the process.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.660
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And what is
it like to be paired with Copland

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.850
and the Barber and the
Chávez on this program -

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.330
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
Well, it's a tall order.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:56.350
I mean, obviously, I-- one
always tries to make the best

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:05.020
and most thoughtful work possible
in any given circumstance, and.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.420
My, what I appreciate most from
this creation has been working

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.260
with the dancers because they have
been very generous, and, like,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.970 position:56%
they have contributed a lot to this.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.510
So that's something I
very much appreciate.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:26.740
Obviously, I think part of
the, part of the challenge

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:32.800
for me being given a composer to
work with who I can't talk to means

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.100
that I have, I'm actually given,
like, a set work, you know.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.340
I could choose to work,
but, nevertheless,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.170
it's a work that already
exists, and that those,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:49.470
that framework is already there,
which is different to coming

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.890 position:56%
up with the concept or a story or a
theme or a, like, from the beginning

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.010
and then have the music
and the dance kind

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.180 position:56%
of be created towards the same goal.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:05.020
So, basically, I, yeah, it's
a different kind of piece than

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.320
"Appalachian Spring " for example -

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: I'm sure -

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.920
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: You
know, it can't be compared.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.610
It's a different, it, the way of
it coming about is very different.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.900
It's, you know.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.670
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Do you know
the story of how the title came

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.440
to be for "Appalachian Spring" -

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.740
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: No -

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
So Copland just wrote it

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.380
as a ballet for Martha.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.060
He didn't have the
associations with all of the sort

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.460
of American folk culture
that we have -

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.760
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Now -

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.360
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.660
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And Martha
at a certain point associated

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.030
with the music with
this poem by Hart Crane,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.950 position:56%
and where it says Appalachian
Spring in there as one of the lines.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.830
And she hadn't even titled
it until very, very late,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.060
and the chief of the music division
at the time had been writing to her

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.150
through Erick Hawkins,
which she wasn't responding

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.050
to letters saying we need a title
more than "Ballet for Martha"

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.850
for the press release
for the performance -

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.150
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.450
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Which was within three,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.750
four weeks already at that -

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.050
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Wow -

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.350
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And
it became this thing that is

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.650
so nationalistic and populist -

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.950
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes -

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.250
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: When that
was not the intention at all.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.550
Which -

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.850
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.150
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Is kind of interesting -

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.450
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.750
Well, that says something about
Martha, I suppose, also, because,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.050
I mean, one never knows, you know.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.660 position:56%
Like, looking back, you can see
what things meant, you know, in the.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:19.180
But, I mean, she was
creating history for a while,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.440
but at some point, I'm
sure that nobody knew

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.740
that that was happening -

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.040
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.340
And it almost didn't happen -

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.640
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah -

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.940
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: They
had delays from 1942 is

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.240
when they first started
talking about the project.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.460
Martha was late to get the
original scenario to Copland,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.210
and Copland was doing a film score.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.540
So he couldn't work
on it, and then -

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.840
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: They had
to decide the second composer,

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.440
who was eventually Chávez -

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.740
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right -

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.780
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: And Chávez
was incommunicado most of the time,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.770
wouldn't send anything back,
didn't meet his deadlines.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.600 position:56%
It was supposed to originally be in
1943 to premiere, then it got pushed

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.490
to the fall of '43, spring of '44,

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.170
and then finally to
fall of '44, which -

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.470
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Wow -

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.770
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
Really interesting.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.070
I'm glad we didn't have those
delays with [multiple speakers] -

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.370
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
Yeah, definitely -

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.670
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Do foresee

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.680 position:56%
"Woodland" having more
performances beyond this initial run

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.980
with the Graham Company?

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.870
Will you ever mount it in Sweden,
for example, or in Europe -

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.260
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well, sure.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.370
I mean, I hope that the company
will continue to perform it.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:17.810
I mean, they will already in New
York coming up in a few weeks.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.110
I don't know.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:25.410
You know, part of creating is that
you become rather myopic close

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:30.700 position:56%
to the premiere, and sometimes only,
like, a year later can you watch it

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.060 position:56%
and actually be objective about it -

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.360
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.330
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: And, of course,
you try very hard to be objective,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.330
and you are working
with it all the time,

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.580
but sometimes you can't
really because it's too close.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:49.210
So I have reconsidered some of my
works in both directions later,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.020
meaning sometimes I will
appreciated them more later,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.580 position:56%
and other times I've felt, like, oh,
actually, this needs to be adjusted.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.630
But that needs to take a while
before I can kind of look

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:05.930
at it objectively, I think.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.230
Yeah.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.560
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown:
What is the experience

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.960
of having the dance performed with
live orchestra versus a recording,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.760
and are there are differences
most pronounced in a music

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.640
like art music, or would it
matter with live electronic music

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.400
versus having it, you
know, [multiple speakers] -

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.700
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Right.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.980
Well, yeah, of course, it makes
huge difference, and I mean,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.360
I made a piece to the music of, to
an original score by Max Richter

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.860
in Dresden, which was
part electronics.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.920
So there was an electronic
backtrack.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.860
There was also strings and piano,
and they had, you know, like,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.090
they had kind of a click track
I think to be able to match it

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.940
with electronics, and which
was not so easy actually.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:23:02.230
But I think it, this is a really
good question because, you know,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:11.330
recorded music is, can be, it can
work against you because you start

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:17.880
to listen for and choreograph
to the recording, not the music.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.090
Like, all sorts of personal
choices that were made during

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.010
that recording you start
taking for granted.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.360
Like, as if that is what
it is, but, you know, when,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.110
as you know when you're playing
something yourself, like,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.000
you can play something
very differently.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.460
Your interpretation doesn't
mean it's right or wrong.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.820
It's just, like, the way that
you hear it is very different.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.240
The way I play piano is, like,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.030
and certain pieces is
different, you know.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.690
Like, the way I hear
it-what I want to bring out.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.350
So it's always interesting when
you meet the orchestra, and you,

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.270
for the first time because
sometimes it's, like, oh,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.620
I missed that [multiple
speakers], like, yeah.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.620
Because maybe you choreograph
something to something

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.720
that was actually just an
artistic choice in the -

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.020
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.320
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Recording,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.620
but [inaudible] the
opposite is also true.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.190
Sometimes you're, like, oh,
you know, this is much better,

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.660
you know, or, like, yeah.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:18.110
So it, both can happen, but I
have a friend who's a conductor.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.410
He likes to say that, oh, like, he
doesn't like to conduct for dance

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.090
because he says there
are only tempos

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.710
in dance - too fast or too slow -

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.010
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Got you.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I mean, and he's
being funny about it, but it's true.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.120
It's sensitive because -

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.420
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.350
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: You know,
what you, what a musician does

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.190
with their fingers or,
you know, small movements

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.640
to create sound can
sometimes be huge movements

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.290
that are precisely timed for a
dancer with their whole body,

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.060
and if you change the
tempo one way or the other,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.360
it can just make or break.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.570
So it is very sensitive actually.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.950
But, of course, having said that,

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.720
I much prefer having live
music to recorded music.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.500
Much.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.800
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.720
Do you prefer working with
a certain genre of music,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.930
or do you enjoy working
with jazz, classical,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.120
electronics, all equally -

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.420
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Equally -

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.720
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.020
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I would say.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.530
Having said that, I think I just,
you know, I have my own universe

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.360
that I'm drawn to and that I like,
and even within different genres,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.700
there's a certain kind of music
that I, that speaks to me.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.010
And there are definitely
gaps in music

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.330
that I don't really know
much about, like hip hop or.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:45.040
There are genres of music that
I don't really know much about,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.920
but I do like working
with living composers

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.150
because you can create
something together from scratch.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.110
That, that's very rewarding.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.710
Sometimes it, you know,

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.480
it also means you don't
know what it's going to be.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.530
So it's a gamble.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.280
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Can
you tell me a little bit

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.510
about how you got involved
in your filmmaking career?

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I, as I grew up
as a teenager, I was very interested

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.330
in photography, and I
had an analog camera.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:28.900
I was, you know, kind of dedicated
in, to taking photographs,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.910
and I also, I did dark
room myself as well.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:42.060
And what that really meant was that
I trained myself to look at things

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.790
through the eyes of a, through
the lens really of the camera,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:50.830
and composition and
imagery sense, and, like,

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.580
telling stories through images.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.590
So it made sense when I
started choreographing

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.740
that I would also work with
film because that's kind

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.380
of a combination of the two really.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.790
I also think that for me
because I'm interested

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:11.200
in so many different aspects
of creating, not just movement

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:19.920 position:56%
or theater or music, but, or images,
but all of them, film is a medium

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.550
that really gives you
the opportunity to work

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.540
with a lot of different layers.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.250
So it's very satisfying, I think.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.770
Having said that, it's very
time consuming, expensive,

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.830
at least the kind of
productions that I push to do.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:47.350 position:56%
And so they're, I get to do many
more stage works per year than film.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.990
Yeah. My film work tends
to take a few years.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.980
Each project takes
four, five years -

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.280
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Wow.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.580
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah -

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.880
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Cool.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.680
When you choreograph, do
you choreograph differently

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.390
for film versus for the stage -

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.090
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:10.760
Swell, the biggest difference
is that with a camera,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.410
I direct the eye of the audience.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.140
I can zoom in on some
button here, you know,

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.870
if that's what I want the
audience to see in a film,

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.110
and that is all they will
see because I decided.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.820
So, but on a stage, you kind
of put everything out there,

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.530
and it's up to each
individual, audience member

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.270
to choose what they see
or be drawn to something.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.220
I mean, you can't control that.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.290
So it's very different actually.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.590
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: What
do you think of this notion

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.750
that the United States Congress
promotes dance and new music

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.670
and new commissions
and choreography?

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.240 position:56%
Because it, I think, working for
them, I know they get a lot of flak,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.380
but sometimes there are
good things that happen -

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.680
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yeah -

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.980
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Around here
that are unexpected I think -

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.280
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:01.380 position:56%
Well, I am honored, and, I mean,
it's very exciting for me to be here

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.530
and to also know that these
seminal works were created

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.340
in this place by the same -

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.330
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
Organizations, and, I mean,

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.820
it's humbling, I have
to say, and yeah.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:22.480 position:56%
Really humbling because it's feel,
I feel it's difficult for me to live

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.710
up to certain things that
have been commissioned here.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.020
But it's very exciting.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.320
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.620
Well, we're so happy to
have you here, for sure.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:38.210 position:56%
I think as we're starting to wrap up
now, I'd love to know what you think

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.090
about the Graham Company's
reputation or,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.060
not necessarily their reputation,
but how they are perceived

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.300
in the dance community
outside of the United States

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.320
versus within the United
States, or is there a difference?

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.750
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I can
only speak to what I know,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:30:00.620
and it's been also interesting and
important for me actually to work

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.760
with the Graham Company

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.510
because Martha Graham really
changed the landscape of dance,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.040
especially in America,
but all over the world.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.000
And all of a sudden I started
to see things that I didn't know

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.930
where they were from, and in
choreographers like Pina Bausch,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.570
for example, I was, like,
oh, that came from Martha.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.160
And in Sweden, you
can see the lineage

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.620
of Birgit Cullberg and [Inaudible].

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.100
You can also see, oh, that came
from Martha, and so I think

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:39.780
that her company, this company is
perhaps not as alive, you know,

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.360
it's not on people's minds
immediately in Europe as much

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.120 position:56%
as it is here, through the name,
obviously, is instantly recognizable

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.210
and people know exactly what it is.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.490
But I have started to
appreciate that, in fact,

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.760
she's very much alive
in many people -

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Yeah -

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.360
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Who
might not even know it.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.560
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Fascinating.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.730
What is next for you
after this project -

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I have a premiere
at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.890
on April 20th for a company
in London called Balletboyz -

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.220
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Oh,
yes, they're wonderful, yeah -

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.830
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
Contemporary dance company -

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.760 position:56%
And do you foresee working with the
Graham Company again in the future -

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.060
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
I certainly wish -

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.360
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.660
Yeah -

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.960
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: That
that will happen, yes -

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.210
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: I mean, what
has it been like to work with Janet

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.610
because she's, you know, in terms
of her vision for the Company

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:40.570
and her supporting
other choreographers?

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.870
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well,

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.060
I think she's doing
exactly what is necessary.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.280
Martha Graham, the Martha
Graham lineage and the heritage,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.780
they already have, and that's
there, and needs to be maintained

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.680
and cultivated and it's very
important, but for a company

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.700 position:56%
to be alive, it also needs new work.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.130
I think you cannot only, I
mean, it's the difference

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:09.320
between being exclusively a
museum or an, living company -

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Sure -

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.950
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So I
think, I mean, she's spot on -

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.250
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: Great.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.680
Well, thank you so much
for taking the time

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.100
to answer some questions, and -

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.400
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Thank you -

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.700
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: We'll look
forward to seeing the premiere

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.850
