00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.540
High ambitions are noble and important, but
there can also come a point when they become

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.800
the sources of terrible trouble and unnecessary
panic. One way of undercutting our perfectionist impulses

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.120
was pioneered by
a British psychoanalyst called Donald Winnicott

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.100
in the 1950s. Winnicott specialised in relationships
between parents and children. In his clinical

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.160
practice, he often met with parents who felt
like failures: perhaps because their children

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.620
hadn’t got into the best schools, or because
there were sometimes arguments around the

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.970
dinner table or the house wasn’t always
completely tidy. Winnicott’s crucial insight

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:54.160
was that the parents’ agony was coming from
a particular place: excessive hope. Their

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.120
despair was a consequences of a cruel and
counterproductive perfectionism. So as to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.540
help them reduce this, Winnicott developed
a charming phrase:

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.580
his parents needed to feel that they were "good enough parents",

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.280
No child, he insisted, needs
an ideal parent. They just need an OK, pretty

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.800
decent, usually well intentioned, sometimes
grumpy but basically reasonable father or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.420
mother. Winnicott wasn’t saying this because
he liked to settle for second-best, but because

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.480
he knew, from first hand, the toll exacted by perfectionism
– and realised than in order to remain more

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.020
or less sane (which is a pretty big ambition
already) we have to learn not to hate ourselves

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.110
for failing to be what no ordinary human being
ever really is anyway. The concept of ‘good

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.280
enough’ was invented as an escape from dangerous
ideals. It began in relation to parenthood,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.520
but it can actually be applied across life more generally,
especially around work and love.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.620
A relationship may be ‘good enough’ even while it has
many dark moments. Perhaps at times there’s

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.020
little sex and a lot of heavy arguments. Maybe
there are big areas of loneliness and non-communication.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.670
Yet none of this should lead us to feel freakish
or unnaturally unlucky. It can be good enough.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.370
Similarly, a ‘good enough’ job will be
very boring at points, it won’t perfectly

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.780
utilise all our merits; we won’t earn a
fortune. But we may make some real friends,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.320
have times of genuine excitement and finish
many days tired but with a sense of true accomplishment.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.620
It takes a good deal of bravery and skill
to keep even a very ordinary life going. To

00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:56.120
persevere through the challenges of love,
work and children is quietly heroic. We should

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.620
perhaps more often sometimes step back in
order to acknowledge in a non-starry-eyed

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.800
but very real way that our lives are good
enough – and that this is, in itself, already

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.000
a very grand achievement.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.240
