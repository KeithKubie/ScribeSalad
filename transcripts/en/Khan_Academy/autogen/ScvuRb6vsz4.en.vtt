00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.570
 You have received this medicine from 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.250
 Nursing student, I think it is necessary to have nursing students 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.890
 Able to do this, in case I was you 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.350
 The patient who receives the medicine 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.880
 So let's solve it 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.440
 I think the issue of transforming this unit is interesting 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.010
 For anyone who wants to practice unit conversion 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.560
 If the question is that we have a doctor 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.740
 This doctor has requested x 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.780
 This is the dose required by doctors 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:39.530
 They say 5 milligrams per pound of patient weight - will 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.780
 Write per pound of patient weight - every 12 hours 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.700
 This is what we are supposed to do 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:58.130
 But giving us the medicine - it's not just 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 Nuggets and milligrams 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.340
 It is even a treat 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.200
 There is a certain amount of fines per milliliter 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.330
 Our treatment 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.180
 It is dissolved with water 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.020
 If this is our medicine supply x 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 We have 0.9 - I write 0 in front 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.590
 My wife, a doctor, says it's necessary to write 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.980
 Zero in front of the decimal point 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.910
 We have 0.9 g / ml of treatment 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 If you want to take 1 ml of treatment 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.410
 And give it to someone, I really give it 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.900
 0.9 grams of this medicine 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.950
 The latest information that we have been given is that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.300
 The patient - his weight - probably should say his mass 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.720
 Because the kilogram expresses the mass, but we recognize the idea 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.790
 The patient's weight is 72.2 kg 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 If there is a bunch of interesting stuff here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.040
 We have to find the dose in milliliters 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.750
 And we have - in fact, not told you 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.580
 the question 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 The question is, how many ml of medicine 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.490
 Should we give the patient at each dose? 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.410
 If ml of medication per dose 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.740
 this is the question 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.430
 There is a set of things 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.000
 We have to move from milligram to gram 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.280
 Then turn it into milliliters 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.520
 We were then told each pound, but we gave later 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.470
 The patient's weight, or mass, is the kilogram 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.820
 So we have to make some conversions here 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.240
 No doubt I can appreciate how this could be 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 Hard and perhaps confusing 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.090
 So let's solve it step by step 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.430
 If the first thing is interesting - and this 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 Something you probably need to know, or maybe you 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.240
 Write it on paper, or maybe you have a calculator 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.610
 Doing this - is how to convert a kilogram to a pound 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.750
 It is good to know in general, if you are turning 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.560
 Between the metric and English systems 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.510
 If 1 kilogram equals approximately 2.2 pounds 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 Not exactly, but that's a good approximation 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.860
 And one pound - if you put 1 above it - one pound 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.550
 Roughly equal to 0.45 kg 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.950
 We will put this in a box 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.240
 This is the only type of external conversion information 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.630
 Which we will need to resolve this issue 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.890
 Everything else we'll need is his calculator, if that does not 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.560
 We want to spend a lot of time in the account 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.200
 If the first thing 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.490
 Let's find the dose of medication per kilogram 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.960
 This per pound, in fact we do not need 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.200
 To know every 12 hours 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.330
 Because we were told, how many milliliters of medicine 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.950
 Keep in each dose? 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.240
 The dose will be in every 12 hours 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.690
 If you know - every 12 hours is a 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.730
 Additional information-- 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.720
 If we want to find these 5 milligrams per pound 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.090
 How do we convert this to milligram / kg? 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.170
 If we put 5 - I'll write it here in purple - 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 5 mg / lbs 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.900
 And then we will convert this per kilogram 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.590
 If we can multiply this by the number of pounds per 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.820
 Kg - I will write it in yellow - × this 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.540
 Information at the top 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:25.300
 I x 2.2 lbs / kg 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.750
 If you feel a bit of confusion - learn, how you know 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.780
 Would you hit 2.2 instead of dividing it at 2.2? 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.350
 This is equivalent to multiplying by 0.5 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.290
 You can pay attention to units 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.230
 Note, I have written 2.2 lb / kg 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.910
 2.2 lbs per 1 kg 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.810
 As you know this will succeed, because we have a pound in 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.180
 Rugs and we have a pound in place 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.420
 This is called dimensional analysis 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.490
 If you feel confused about these things - I think 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.560
 When you get enough exercise, you will find that it does not 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.890
 You have to pay close attention to him 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.240
 But at first, when you begin to solve, in order 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.360
 Make sure you do not hit or divide the wrong thing 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.250
 Just make sure the dimensions have been deleted 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.310
 Lb in rugs, and pound in the place 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.350
 So let's do it 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.110
 The pound in the rugs, and the pound in the square are deleted 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.540
 We hit 5 x 2.2 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.280
 This equals - let us see 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.850
 5 × 2 = 10 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.840
 5 × 0.2 = 1 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.130
 If this equals 11 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.320
 Then we have milligrams in rugs 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.290
 11 mg / kg 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.160
 If we have converted the dose information to 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.880
 Metric metric system 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.750
 This was a mixture between the metric system 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.170
 The former English system 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.190
 Now let's see what we can do 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.120
 Well, let's see if we can get it in terms of how much 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.440
 Ml we have to prepare for each pound 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.650
 If again, we want this - well, actually, let's 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.990
 We turn to love first 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.180
 Because we have milligrams here 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.300
 We have a gram here at the top 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.570
 So let's see if we can turn this thing into a gram 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.760
 As we did previously, we want to get milligram 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.730
 In the place 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.020
 I'll do this orange 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.470
 We want to get milligrams in place and want 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.230
 Love in the rugs 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.110
 Why did you say that? 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.180
 Because I want to delete this and this 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.050
 I want to get the gram in the rugs 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.270
 How many grams per milligram? 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.170
 You can think about this 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.500
 There is one gram per 1000 milligrams 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.150
 Or 1000 milligrams per gram 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.320
 And you beat him 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.150
 If the milligrams are deleted with milligrams, then 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.330
 We get - this is equal to 11/1000 g / kg 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.790
 If we now have everything in unity, we want it 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.050
 In milliliters 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.190
 The question is, how many milliliters of 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.760
 Medication for each dose? 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.870
 Let me down here on this line 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.370
 We got this result 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.630
 We have 11/1000 - I do not want to swear now - Gram 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.920
 Of the drug x / kg 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.240
 This is - we are rewriting 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.100
 This dose is known in different units 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.820
 Let's see how many doses we want per kilogram 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.880
 If I delete the gram from here and get 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.910
 On the miller here 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.790
 Until the gram is deleted, you must get the 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.970
 Gram in the denominator and millimeter in rugs 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.440
 If at one dose, how many grams per milliliter? 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.060
 Well, we've been told 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.260
 It has 0.9 g / mL 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.560
 Or per 1 ml, there is 0.9 grams 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.930
 Notice, I've taken that upside down 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.500
 Because we want milliliters in rugs, and grams in 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.780
 Place, and thus delete them 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.800
 Now let's do this beating 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.370
 If the gram is deleted 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.810
 We have milliliters / kg 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.900
 And then hit 

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.780
 11 / 1,000 x 1 / 0.9 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.100
 I'll keep - let me write this way 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:17.390
 This becomes 11 / 1,000 × 0.9 milliliters of 

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.840
 Medicine / kg 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.410
 We've got this in advance 

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.240
 This per kilogram of patient weight 

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.070
 Finally, we were asked how many kilograms 

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.010
 The patient weighs 

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.190
 If let's do another hit, then we can 

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.220
 Extract the calculator and we run all the calculations at once 

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.130
 Let's hit this b - we want to know how much 

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.310
 Ml per patient 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.280
 We want to delete the kilogram 

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.320
 If we want a kilogram / patient 

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.140
 We are now talking about this particular patient 

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.240
 Not every patient will have the same 

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.390
 Kg 

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.710
 But if we do, the kilogram will be removed 

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.620
 And we have a milliliter / patient - milliliters of 

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.360
 The medication for each patient - exactly what we want 

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.850
 We want 1 ml of medication per dose per patient 

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.960
 But everything we assumed was for each dose 

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.640
 So how many kilograms does the patient weigh? 

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.080
 Well, there are 72.2 kg / patient 

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.660
 This is what the patient weighs 

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.700
 If we do this last beating 

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.290
 We finish 

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.960
 If the answer - and these two things will be deleted - 

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.720
 If the final answer is 11 x 72.2 

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.720
 100 100 × - in fact, that is 100 × 0.9 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.790
 It is easy to find the outcome of their multiplication 

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.070
 This equals 900 

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.150
 900 900 ml / patient 

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.580
 Or we can tell the ml / dose 

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.500
 As you like 

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.460
 Per dose per patient 

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.720
 Let us extract the calculator and do this 

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:54.910
 If we have 11 × 72.2 = 799, 900 900 

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.070
 = 0.88 - Well, we can get closer 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.360
 0.889 

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.690
 I hope the doctor does not mind 

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.440
 If this equals - I will write it in a beautiful color-- 

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:14.830
 0.889 ml of medication per dose 

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.130
 This is what we will give every 12 hours 

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.520
 If asked, how many milliliters 

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.010
 For a treatment that lasts for Leoman? 

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.530
 We have to say, there are 24 hours 

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.910
 We will beat it by 4 

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.250
 But those 12 hours were additional information on this issue 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.750
 But anyway, I wish this presentation was helpful, I will ensure that 

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.710
 Any nurse in the future will give me 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.030
 The right dose 

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.480
 I hope the doctor will also get the right dose of medication to start 

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.050
 Otherwise, everything will be useless 

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.350
 In any case
