behavioral issues yeah it depends what
the behavioral issues are so I don't

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
the behavioral issues are so I don't
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.710
the behavioral issues are so I don't
know what out risk means but so I can't

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
know what out risk means but so I can't
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.109
know what out risk means but so I can't
be too specific but what I can tell you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
be too specific but what I can tell you
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.500
be too specific but what I can tell you
is that almost nothing beats listening

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
is that almost nothing beats listening
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.929
is that almost nothing beats listening
you know like take a kid for a walk

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
you know like take a kid for a walk
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.450

let them talk like listen to them ask

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
let them talk like listen to them ask
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.229
let them talk like listen to them ask
them questions

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
them questions
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.319
them questions
you know because most disturbed people

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
you know because most disturbed people
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360
you know because most disturbed people
and maybe even most people don't

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
and maybe even most people don't
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.190
and maybe even most people don't
actually have anyone they can talk to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
actually have anyone they can talk to
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.819
actually have anyone they can talk to
and they need to talk first of all to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
and they need to talk first of all to
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830
and they need to talk first of all to
find out that someone actually cares

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
find out that someone actually cares
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600
find out that someone actually cares
enough to listen so it's sort of like a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
enough to listen so it's sort of like a
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610
enough to listen so it's sort of like a
validation of the fact that they exist

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
validation of the fact that they exist
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.830
validation of the fact that they exist
and second so that they can sort out

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
and second so that they can sort out
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260
and second so that they can sort out
their own thoughts so as a beginning

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
their own thoughts so as a beginning
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.600
their own thoughts so as a beginning
counselor the best thing you can do is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
counselor the best thing you can do is
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490
counselor the best thing you can do is
listen you don't want to give advice

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
listen you don't want to give advice
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110
listen you don't want to give advice
really you know because what you want

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
really you know because what you want
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090
really you know because what you want
you can ask questions that might lead

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
you can ask questions that might lead
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.310
you can ask questions that might lead
someone in an advisable direction but

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
someone in an advisable direction but
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.859
someone in an advisable direction but
the problem with giving advice is that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
the problem with giving advice is that
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810
the problem with giving advice is that
people are much more likely to remember

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
people are much more likely to remember
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730
people are much more likely to remember
something and to implement it if they've

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
something and to implement it if they've
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920
something and to implement it if they've
thought it up in their own words I think

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
thought it up in their own words I think
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420
thought it up in their own words I think
that actually produces a kind of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
that actually produces a kind of
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850
that actually produces a kind of
neurological transformation the idea has

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
neurological transformation the idea has
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100
neurological transformation the idea has
to be engendered from within it's one of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
to be engendered from within it's one of
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320
to be engendered from within it's one of
the prime dicta of of psychoanalytic

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
the prime dicta of of psychoanalytic
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149
the prime dicta of of psychoanalytic
theory for example I think it's a really

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
theory for example I think it's a really
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.749
theory for example I think it's a really
good one

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
good one
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.080
good one
so yeah when and with regards so Brendon

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
so yeah when and with regards so Brendon
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940

yeah like it's really specific so this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
yeah like it's really specific so this
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.690

showed quite clearly that not only do

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
showed quite clearly that not only do

our retinas say directly detect snakes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
our retinas say directly detect snakes
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550
our retinas say directly detect snakes
but they do a better job in the bottom

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
but they do a better job in the bottom
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590
but they do a better job in the bottom

good at detecting the camouflage

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
good at detecting the camouflage

have specialized circuitry for detecting

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
have specialized circuitry for detecting
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700
have specialized circuitry for detecting
those and there was recent research

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
those and there was recent research
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490
those and there was recent research
conducted that showed that children 6

take out an automatic response to snakes

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
take out an automatic response to snakes
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.840
take out an automatic response to snakes
and so it actually seems to be innate

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850
and so it actually seems to be innate
 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.130
and so it actually seems to be innate
not just not just easily learned so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
not just not just easily learned so
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.250
not just not just easily learned so
that's really quite interesting
