learning and 

00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:12.378

a better person and organization

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:14.379
to collaborate with today.

00:08:17.682 --> 00:08:19.682

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.609
special guests in 

00:08:56.391 --> 00:08:58.596

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:06.238
wonderful to work with!  There 
is Mr. Dodson.

00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:11.284
We are delighted to have members
of 

00:09:13.823 --> 00:09:16.493
Congress, members of the 
Washington city council, our 

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:21.126
various partners in literacy and
collaborators and our generous 

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.127
donors who make so much 

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:28.563
possible because today we're all
here as cheerleaders for books 

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.363
and learning.

00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:29.612
Now, I have to tell you, when I 

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:33.303
started as a children's 
librarian I 

00:09:36.287 --> 00:09:38.287
remember being inspired by a 
young woman 

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.163
who was on the south side of 
Chicago and 

00:09:44.673 --> 00:09:47.605
her name was Judy Zucher and 
when I first walked into that 

00:09:47.606 --> 00:09:50.407
branch library she was on the 
floor having story time with 

00:09:50.408 --> 00:09:54.208
children with ought simple.  
simple.

00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:58.901
She was telling stories and it's
wonderful where imagination and 

00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:00.902
reading can take you.

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:04.420
And today we have young people 
who will join us to have fun 

00:10:04.421 --> 00:10:06.421
with books!

00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:12.283
Ms. Dolly Parton has been 
recognized many times for her 

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:14.284
dedication to the power of 

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:19.115
learning and for more than two 
decades her imagination library 

00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:23.410
has helped hundreds of thousands
of children worldwide, giving 

00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:25.411
them high-quality books to own. 
own.

00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:34.271
No matter what their family's 
income 

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:38.132
and in 2014 she was awarded the 
Best 

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:42.440
Practices Award from the Library
of Congress Literacy Foundation 

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.441
so today we 

00:10:45.507 --> 00:10:47.507
are pleased we will be part of a
milestone.

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.823
The Imagination Library is about
to 

00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:55.435
give away their

00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:00.641
100 millionth book, that's so 
many I 

00:11:01.653 --> 00:11:03.653
could

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:09.026
barely -- 100 millionth book and
we are humbled -- plagues 

00:11:09.027 --> 00:11:12.309
applause that that book will 
join with millions of others at 

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.310
the Library of Congress.  That 
book will be given to us today.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.887
So when the foundation started 
23 

00:11:22.323 --> 00:11:24.999
years ago, the first books were 
distributed to the Tennessee 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
County 

00:11:28.662 --> 00:11:30.662
where Dolly grew up and now it 
is a worldwide phenomenon.

00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:36.397
So without further ado I would 
like to share with you a video 

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:39.600
about the Imagination Library. 

00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:54.498

&gt;&gt; Most of you are probably 

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.365
familiar with Dolly Parton but 
to some Dolly Parton is more 

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.366
than a country music star.  

00:12:22.354 --> 00:12:24.354
&gt;&gt; Everywhere I go the kids call
me the

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.479

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.790
right.

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:04.083
It's a beautiful day for us and 
I'm so happy and excited to be 

00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:08.613
here and I was watching the film
back will on the phone they had 

00:17:08.614 --> 00:17:10.464
and I was watching all that and 
seeing how these things have 

00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:13.137
happened through the years I'm 
proud and honored to be here 

00:17:13.138 --> 00:17:15.994

&gt;&gt; Why not?  

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:26.808
&gt;&gt; They've seen us and they 
know, because I'm interested and

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:28.809
a lot of our 

00:17:31.156 --> 00:17:33.156
guests are interested in just 
how all of this got started!

00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:38.326
What inspired you to create 
this?  This is such a great 

00:17:38.327 --> 00:17:40.327
program. 

00:17:42.005 --> 00:17:43.633
&gt;&gt; You have the idea, the 
Imagination Library, I guess 

00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:45.772
everybody has their story and a 
lot of you may or may not 

00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:51.605
know about me personally, but I 
grew up in the smoky mountains 

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:56.550
of east Tennessee, in a large 
family, there were 12 of us kids

00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:00.202
and my dad was a hard-working 
man, he group up in a family of 

00:18:00.203 --> 00:18:02.203
14 or 15 kids and my dad never 
had a chance to go to school.

00:18:04.503 --> 00:18:06.503
And daddy not couldn't read or 
write 

00:18:07.577 --> 00:18:09.405
but he was the smartest person 
that I've every known so I 

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:11.406
wanted to do something 

00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:15.784
special for him as the years 
went by, I saw how it -- he 

00:18:15.785 --> 00:18:17.785
thought he couldn't learn to 
read after he was grown, it was 

00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:22.365
just one of those things and I 
had the idea to do something 

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:26.321
special for him, you know, in 
the Bible where it talks about 

00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:27.968
honor your father and your 
mother, I don't think that 

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:29.969
necessarily means 

00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:31.469
just to obey them, I think it 
means to bring honor to their 

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.734
name if you can.  
So I got my daddy involved with 

00:18:34.735 --> 00:18:36.735
this program.

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:40.039
I wanted him to feel like he was
part of something special.

00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:44.774
So we started the Imagination 
Library, where we were giving 

00:18:44.775 --> 00:18:46.775
books to the 

00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:53.472
children in our home county, in 
severeSevere Cath, where we were

00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:55.473
born and raised.

00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:01.228
And it became such a popular 
program the governor of 

00:19:01.229 --> 00:19:03.229
Tennessee at that time thought 
the idea was so great they took 

00:19:04.074 --> 00:19:06.074
it all over Tennessee.

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:08.776
Later it went on into Canada and
now we're all over the world in 

00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:10.777
different parts of the world.

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:15.760
So my dad got to live long 
enough to see a lot of it come 

00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:17.761
into being.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.650
He took such pride in the So my 
dad got to live long enough to 

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.650
see a lot of it come into being.
He took such pride in the fact 

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.450
that 

00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:25.877
the little kids call me the 
"book lady" so it started from a

00:19:25.878 --> 00:19:28.162
true place in my heart and it's 
done so much good for so many 

00:19:28.163 --> 00:19:31.437
people through the years.  
&gt;&gt; 

00:19:32.564 --> 00:19:34.564
&gt;&gt; How does it feel to be called
the "book lady"? 

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:41.400
You do so much, you sing and 
write and You do so much, you 

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:40.353
sing
you're known as the "book lady

00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:42.338
You do so much, you sing and 
write and you're known as the 

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:44.162
"book lady" did you ever think 
you would be the "book lady"? 

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:48.357
&gt;&gt; That never crossed my mind 
because I personally didn't like

00:19:48.358 --> 00:19:50.376
school!  
(Laughter.)

00:19:52.447 --> 00:19:54.670
I do more homework now at night 
working on these programs than I

00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:56.671
every did all the years that I 
was in school.

00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:01.379
I never thought about being the 
book 

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.110
lady, the painted lady, yes, the
overaxe 

00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:09.593
guerre rated, overdressed lady, 
but that 

00:20:11.692 --> 00:20:13.692
just goes to show you you can't 
judge a 

00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.579
book by looking at the cover! 
the painted lady, yes, the 

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.180
overaxe guerre rated, 
overdressed lady, but that just 

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.846
goes to show you you can't judge
a book by looking at the cover! 

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.580
(Applause.) 
&gt;&gt; Right?  

00:20:19.392 --> 00:20:21.631
&gt;&gt; That's right, you can't tell.
You love books and reading, were

00:20:21.632 --> 00:20:23.504
there books You love books and 
reading, were there books that 

00:20:23.505 --> 00:20:25.505
shaped you?  You had favorite 
books?  

00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:29.619
&gt;&gt; Well, we didn't have books in
our home because there were so 

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.620
many of us 

00:20:33.592 --> 00:20:35.592
kids, and daddy told us not to 
bring 

00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:40.699
books home dos kids pee on 'em, 
chew on 

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.876
them they can, whatever, so I 
didn't get to bring books home 

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:48.517
but one book in the home was the
Bible and my mother used to read

00:20:48.518 --> 00:20:50.369
from the Bible and tell us Bible
stories so that was the first 

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.223
book that we had in our home.  
And the one that meant the most.

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.329
It has followed me more than any
other book through my life, 

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.364
actually.  
&gt;&gt; And you keep 

00:21:00.571 --> 00:21:03.629
&gt;&gt; And you keep reading it?  
&gt;&gt; I do.  In fact I love to read

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.701
-- excuse me, I have tissues, 
everywhere!  I need one right 

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:07.702
now!  now!

00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:15.819
I'll just wait until someone -- 
but, anyway, I love to read and 

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.109
I do whatever it takes to -- but
I actually loved, you know, just

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.110
anytime I was in school I 

00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:29.295
loved all the ferry tales, I 
wanted to 

00:21:31.567 --> 00:21:34.234
read about the kings and the 
Queens and the traveling so 

00:21:34.235 --> 00:21:36.298
books have always been a great 
thing for me.  

00:21:40.404 --> 00:21:43.253
&gt;&gt; But with your busy schedule 
how did you have time to read 

00:21:43.254 --> 00:21:45.854
because 
&gt;&gt; But with your busy schedule 

00:21:43.254 --> 00:21:43.870
how did you have time to read 
because you were performing and 

00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:47.937
doing so many things?  
&gt;&gt; I always take time to read.  

00:21:47.938 --> 00:21:49.365
I think for anybody that loves 
to read you will find the time 

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:52.635
to read.  I do some of my best 
thinking when I'm readin', if 

00:21:52.636 --> 00:21:58.580
you know what I mean.  I read 52
books a year, a book a week.  

00:21:58.581 --> 00:22:02.452
&gt;&gt; Wow!  
&gt;&gt; So I've always been a reader,

00:22:02.453 --> 00:22:04.453
but 

00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:07.981
there is a part of my brain that
kinda 

00:22:09.249 --> 00:22:11.712
can think of other things while 
I am actually reading and I have

00:22:11.713 --> 00:22:15.587
always loved to read because I 
think in books, with kids, too, 

00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:17.588
with the books that they read 

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.709
it inspires you to dream, and if
you can dream, that leads you to

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.710
success and to other things.

00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:27.540
That's why I think it's so 
important to get the books in 

00:22:27.541 --> 00:22:31.194
the hands of all these special 
little kids so they can start 

00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:33.851
early and go late with 'em!  
&gt;&gt; And they love it.  So you 

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:36.091
make time for reading.  reading.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.230
Does any of the reading help you
with some of your song writing 

00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:43.394
and some of the Does any of the 
reading help you with some of 

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:44.347
your song writing and some of 
the things that you read about? 

00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:48.199
&gt;&gt; These are good questions and 
yes, it does, because I'm really

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.200
inspired by just people in 
general.

00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:55.937
Just like the little kids, a lot
of 

00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:59.072
things that I write I have a 
children's CD out called "I 

00:22:59.073 --> 00:23:01.073
believe in you" and a 

00:23:02.335 --> 00:23:05.007
lot of the songs from that were 
inspired by the books that are 

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:07.008
in the Imagination 

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.428
Library and the Little Engine 
that Could is the first book we 

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:14.429
give out in the Imagination 
Library and I think it talks 

00:23:15.484 --> 00:23:17.320
about how to build confidence 
and to know that you can if you 

00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:19.961
think you can and I really am 
inspired by look at these faces 

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:25.106
today.  I will feel something or
think something and who knows 

00:23:25.107 --> 00:23:27.107
what idea it 

00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:30.211
might trigger in me later on to 
write a song about.

00:23:32.717 --> 00:23:34.743
When you write you go by 
feelings and what touches you 

00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:37.441
and how it touches you and you 
find a clever way to put it into

00:23:38.047 --> 00:23:42.127
a song.  
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that sometimes 

00:23:42.128 --> 00:23:46.867
the books can spire feelings and
things in children and I know 

00:23:46.868 --> 00:23:48.873
that you started the library 
because you believed in what 

00:23:50.309 --> 00:23:52.978
books mean and could mean to 
children.  I know I've seen it 

00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:54.979
happen and I've felt it as a 
child.

00:23:56.939 --> 00:24:00.395
&gt;&gt; You of all people would know 
because you've been doing this 

00:24:00.396 --> 00:24:03.674
for how many years?  You said 
long before you got to this 

00:24:04.498 --> 00:24:06.498
beautiful building!  
&gt;&gt; Too long!

00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:09.193
I remember the books that 
inspired me when I was young and

00:24:09.194 --> 00:24:11.194
you believe that, too?  
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.

00:24:14.527 --> 00:24:16.527
I really think that -- we're 
inspired 

00:24:17.978 --> 00:24:19.978
by everything and children 
themselves 

00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:23.446
inspire me and children do, you,
too, because you work with them.

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:26.790
In every little child there is a
whole world and they're going to

00:24:26.791 --> 00:24:30.484
see it and make things come true
in their little world and 

00:24:30.485 --> 00:24:33.342
they're going to add to the 
world as they see fit according 

00:24:33.343 --> 00:24:37.491
to their talents and their 
personalities, that's why it's 

00:24:37.492 --> 00:24:39.492
so important that they love to 

00:24:40.576 --> 00:24:42.576
love books and learn to read and
be inspired by that.

00:24:44.904 --> 00:24:45.860
Because just like with my dad, 
my dad couldn't read but he 

00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:49.561
really was smart.  smart.  He 
picked up on things and he was 

00:24:49.562 --> 00:24:53.429
very intuitive.  It's my belief 
if you can read, even if you 

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.099
don't have the money to go to 
school, you can especially 

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.100
anymore, you 

00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:00.819
can just -- you can find a book 
-- if you can read, on anything 

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.737
that you want to know, you can 
self-educate yourself and go to 

00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:08.422
college, even, you can pick up 
those kinds of books even if you

00:25:08.423 --> 00:25:12.334
can't get outside your house you
can find a book on any subject 

00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:14.335
and you can educate yourself to 
where you can know about 

00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:19.052
things and actually just 
increase your intelligence and 

00:25:19.053 --> 00:25:20.684
your -- just the whole world 
around and you inspire other 

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:24.611
people with that.  
&gt;&gt; And what about owning a book 

00:25:24.612 --> 00:25:29.494
and saying this is my book!  
It's got my name in it!  

00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:31.943
&gt;&gt; That's what I love about the 
Imagination Library because that

00:25:31.944 --> 00:25:34.791
was one of the things we thought
was so important when we first 

00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:36.792
started it.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.352
And so we wanted the children to
have that book.  They get a book

00:25:42.353 --> 00:25:44.353
for those of you that don't know
the whole thing, I guess they 

00:25:47.863 --> 00:25:50.554
talked about some of it, but 
children get a book from the 

00:25:50.555 --> 00:25:52.555
time they're born 

00:25:55.098 --> 00:25:56.539
they get a book a month until 
they start kindergarten, so we 

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.606
send a book in the mail with 
their name on it, it's not in 

00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:03.385
care of mom and dad it's got 
their little name on it and they

00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:06.377
love to think this is mine!  
They wait at the mailbox, get 

00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:09.630
their book, and to them it's 
personal.  So they're going to 

00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:11.631
take that in the 

00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:15.368
house and make somebody read it 
to 'em because this is mu stuff,

00:26:15.369 --> 00:26:18.272
my stuff, my stuff!  
(Laughter.)

00:26:20.542 --> 00:26:22.403
So I think that is has been a 
real important thing because 

00:26:22.404 --> 00:26:24.877
they also share it with other 
kids.  We're so happy we're such

00:26:24.878 --> 00:26:28.553
a part of that and of all the 
things I have done in my life 

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:31.408
and it's been a lot, because 
I've been around a long time but

00:26:31.409 --> 00:26:35.339
this is one of the most precious
things and the proudest I am of 

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.849
any program that I've every been
involved in in my life is 

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:43.395
working with the little kids.  
&gt;&gt; And you should be, because 

00:26:43.396 --> 00:26:47.665
after getting a book a month 
they're going to have their own 

00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:51.599
&gt;&gt; And you should be, because 
after getting a book a month 

00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:48.955
they're going to have their own 
little library. 

00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:51.086
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. 
&gt;&gt; In their houses, this will be

00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:53.735
their library and their books
&gt;&gt; And you should be, because 

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:57.802
after getting a book a month 
they're going to have their own 

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:56.002
little library. 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. 

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:57.869
&gt;&gt; In their houses, this will be
their library and their books 

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:57.193
and they can pull 'em out.  
&gt;&gt; And they love that.  They 

00:26:57.194 --> 00:26:59.194
love sharing that with kids!  

00:27:02.102 --> 00:27:04.102
&gt;&gt; You mentioned, though, 
sometimes you 

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:07.400
get letters that talk about what
happens after they're not in the

00:27:07.401 --> 00:27:09.401
program.  

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:11.905
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually we get a lot 
of letters when the kids are in 

00:27:11.906 --> 00:27:13.906
the program, we get letters all 
the time 

00:27:17.842 --> 00:27:19.545
from parents and kids, but some 
of the sweetest letters we get 

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:21.546
-- in fact I'll 

00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:24.669
never forget the first one I got
was from a little boy that had 

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.125
graduated from the Imagination 
Library, he was 6 years old and 

00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:29.360
he was bummed out about it!  
(Laughter.)

00:27:30.802 --> 00:27:32.227
He was really mad because he 
just wanted me to continue to 

00:27:32.228 --> 00:27:34.228
send him books!

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.102
He thought this is just not 
fair, this is just not right 

00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:39.144
that I be can't continue to get 
my books!  That's how important 

00:27:39.145 --> 00:27:43.690
it is to them.  
I wrote him back a sweet letter 

00:27:43.691 --> 00:27:47.777
and explained how we do it and 
that's why -- he was being 

00:27:47.778 --> 00:27:49.982
prepared because he was using 
his mind to think about all 

00:27:49.983 --> 00:27:51.983
that!

00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:54.482
We get a lot of sweet letters 
and we treasure every one of 

00:27:54.483 --> 00:27:56.626
them.  

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:01.337
&gt;&gt; And then he can get a library
card.  

00:28:01.338 --> 00:28:04.343
&gt;&gt; Yeah!  
(Chuckles.) 

00:28:07.184 --> 00:28:10.026
&gt;&gt; Did you ever think you would 
get to 100 million books when 

00:28:10.027 --> 00:28:11.560
you started
(Chuckles.) 

00:28:10.027 --> 00:28:14.160
&gt;&gt; Did you ever think you would 
get to 100 million books when 

00:28:10.027 --> 00:28:13.701
you started?  That's phenomenal!
&gt;&gt; Not when we started.  Like I 

00:28:13.702 --> 00:28:15.702
said, it was a very personal 

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:18.808
thing when we started and I just
hoped 

00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:27.719
it would do good in in our 
county, but at that time it was 

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.749
something I was doing for my dad
and the kids in our home county.

00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:34.241
Thank the Lord, he was good!

00:28:35.725 --> 00:28:37.558
David Dodson who is the 
President of the Imagination 

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:39.559
Library, stand up there 

00:28:40.634 --> 00:28:43.115
for a second, David!  
(Applause.)

00:28:45.564 --> 00:28:47.564
He works so hard and he makes me
look 

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:50.649
really good, I take a lot of 
credit for 

00:28:53.428 --> 00:28:54.351
a lot of work that David and 
these folks at the Imagination 

00:28:54.352 --> 00:28:55.997
Library they do.  He travels all
over the world making sure that 

00:28:55.998 --> 00:28:57.998
all these wonderful things 

00:28:59.283 --> 00:29:00.530
happen, making sure that all the
things that we brag about can 

00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:02.531
happen.

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:06.086
I just get out and talk about it
and do my part but it's always 

00:29:06.087 --> 00:29:10.975
like that with anything that 
you're proud of!  It takes a 

00:29:10.976 --> 00:29:12.846
whole bunch of people to make 
things happen and we owe the 

00:29:12.847 --> 00:29:17.540
real thing to the communities 
and all the people that 

00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:18.774
participate, all the 
organizations that get involved 

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:24.009
and they're the ones that are 
making my dreams come true.  

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.221
It's just one of those things 
that everybody takes a lot of 

00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:27.222
pride in.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.839
Because if you're doing 
something with children how can 

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.687
you not feel good about that!  
Look at 'em?  Hi there!  Hello! 

00:29:36.688 --> 00:29:38.751
So, anyway, it's a good feeling 
all around, it's a win-win as 

00:29:38.752 --> 00:29:41.611
they say.  

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.510
&gt;&gt; As I said, at the beginning, 
we are 

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:51.159
so honored that the

00:29:53.137 --> 00:29:54.965
100 million will be given to the
Library of Congress for our 

00:29:54.966 --> 00:29:56.966
youngsters.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.496
We have an unveiling -- 
&gt;&gt; I want to say how honored I 

00:30:00.497 --> 00:30:04.371
am before we pull that little 
thing up that you have taken 

00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:07.249
this to heart and that you have 
taken this in and that we will 

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.250
now 

00:30:10.503 --> 00:30:12.363
have this book that I can 
actually have here forever for 

00:30:12.364 --> 00:30:14.364
all the children all over the 
world certainly in the United 

00:30:16.048 --> 00:30:17.876
States of America here in D.C.  
It's a wonderful place to have 

00:30:17.877 --> 00:30:19.877
this.

00:30:23.378 --> 00:30:25.393
Hopefully through the years we 
have 100 million books so far 

00:30:25.394 --> 00:30:27.394
and maybe we 

00:30:28.522 --> 00:30:30.522
will be back for our billionth 
book, wouldn't that be nice!

00:30:32.403 --> 00:30:34.403
You want to see what's under 
there?  

00:30:37.914 --> 00:30:41.165
&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful story, there
it is, 100 millionth book!  

00:30:42.395 --> 00:30:44.687
&gt;&gt; This is the coat of many 
colors which is a little story 

00:30:44.688 --> 00:30:48.641
-- this lady right here, let me 
mention her name, this is -- 

00:30:48.642 --> 00:30:50.642
what's your name again?  
(Laughter.) 

00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:53.117
&gt;&gt; This is the person who drew 
-- 

00:30:53.982 --> 00:30:55.982
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she illustrated this 
book and 

00:31:00.036 --> 00:31:02.036
we appreciate your name is Brook

00:31:03.603 --> 00:31:05.027
Hughes and she illustrated this 
and I hope you had as much fun 

00:31:05.028 --> 00:31:07.028
drawing this as I did writing 
it.  

00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:10.958
&gt;&gt; I did, it was an honor to be 
part of the project and I loved 

00:31:10.959 --> 00:31:14.869
getting to illustrate your song.
&gt;&gt; Everybody loves it, this song

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.870
is important to me because my 
mother -- I 

00:31:20.643 --> 00:31:22.675
was talking about my dad, my dad
was so very important but my 

00:31:22.676 --> 00:31:24.676
mother to have 12 

00:31:25.837 --> 00:31:27.850
kids and make 'em all feel 
special with no money, she had 

00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:30.076
all the love in the world and 
it's about the little story 

00:31:34.551 --> 00:31:36.551
about -- she told me the story 
about 

00:31:38.015 --> 00:31:40.015
Joseph and the coat of many 
colors 

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.666
because it was getting 
wintertime and 

00:31:45.025 --> 00:31:47.262
she made my coat and momma made 
that and she had the foresight 

00:31:47.263 --> 00:31:50.161
to give me pride in the coat of 
many colors so this book is more

00:31:50.162 --> 00:31:52.162
than a story and it's more than 

00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.215
a song, it's about love, it's 
about 

00:31:57.076 --> 00:31:58.904
attitude, and actually it's 
turned out to be an antibullying

00:31:58.905 --> 00:32:01.142
book.  They use this in Dallas 
rooms to talk 

00:32:04.207 --> 00:32:07.080
about antibullying, and I want 
kids to know it is okay for you 

00:32:07.081 --> 00:32:09.741
to be how you are and who you 
are.  It's good to be different.

00:32:12.777 --> 00:32:14.212
We can't all be the same but we 
have we have to love the 

00:32:14.213 --> 00:32:17.918
differences and accept the 
differences in each other too.  

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.548
This book is about love and 
understanding.  Thank you. 

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:21.549
&gt;&gt; And thank you.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.630
I see you have the coat here.  

00:32:26.932 --> 00:32:28.932
&gt;&gt; This little coat is a replica
of the 

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:32.415
coat that my mom made for me 
because 

00:32:34.966 --> 00:32:36.966
momma used to -- is people used 
to send 

00:32:38.647 --> 00:32:41.519
us boxes of scraps because momma
made the quilts for our bed and 

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.003
the curtains for our windows, 
and she didn't have 

00:32:47.054 --> 00:32:49.533
enough of one fabric to make me 
a coat so that's why she used 

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:52.589
the pieces and that inspired her
to tell me the story from the 

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.445
propel.  That's what this coat 
-- we actually -- this coat, 

00:32:56.446 --> 00:32:58.078
that little song and the story 
has lived forever, we had a 

00:32:58.079 --> 00:33:00.079
couple 

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:03.545
of movies on TV about the little
coat 

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:07.070
and it got good ratings, so it 
shows people are about name and 

00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:09.071
they are about 

00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:13.588
love and it's good to feel that 
warmth and that love about 

00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:15.589
parents because this 

00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:17.848
day and time we don't have 
enough family stuff, there is so

00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:20.867
much stuff going on out there 
that little kids -- I love being

00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:22.868
able to touch the kids and tell 

00:33:25.824 --> 00:33:28.077
them stories and for them to 
feel what it was like back then 

00:33:28.078 --> 00:33:30.078
but it's how it should be now 
with the love and 

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:37.660
acceptance and understanding of 
notparents because this day and 

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:37.660
time we don't have enough family
stuff, there is little kids -- I

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:34.331
love being able to so much stuff
going on out there that touch 

00:33:34.332 --> 00:33:35.331
the kids and tell them stories 
and for them to feel what it was

00:33:35.332 --> 00:33:35.409
like back then but it's how it 
should be now with the love and 

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.419
acceptance and understanding of 
not only just others but your 

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.992

Do I look like the book lady

This is called -- it says Dolly 
Parton, that's my name and

what's your name?  Nice to see 
you, Sammy.  Sammy. 

00:35:21.164 --> 00:35:24.009
This says "coat of many colors" 
that's supposed to me me when I 

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.851
was a little girl wearing her 
coat of many colors.  Let me 

00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:31.607
find my real page here.  here.  
So it starts with all these 

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:33.608
pretty 

00:35:35.105 --> 00:35:37.764
pictures of my mom and my dad 
and my pretty pictures of my mom

00:35:37.765 --> 00:35:38.188
and my dad and brothers and So 
it starts with all these my 

00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:40.189
brothers and sisters in here so 
this 

00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:43.922
says "back through the years I 
go wondering once again back to 

00:35:43.923 --> 00:35:47.573
the seasons of my youth.  I 
recall a box of rags that 

00:35:47.574 --> 00:35:50.438
someone gave us and how my momma
put those rags to use.

00:35:55.161 --> 00:35:59.050
There were rags of many colors 
but every piece was small.  I 

00:35:59.051 --> 00:36:01.051
didn't have a coat and it was 
way down in the fall.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.320
So momma sewed the rags 
together, she 

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.612
sewed every piece with love and 
made my coat of many colors that

00:36:11.613 --> 00:36:13.613
I was so proud of.

00:36:16.127 --> 00:36:18.907
As momma sewed she told a story 
from the Bible she had read 

00:36:18.908 --> 00:36:23.262
about a coat of many colors 
Joseph wore and then she said, I

00:36:23.263 --> 00:36:25.263
hope this coat will bring you 
good luck and happiness.

00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:29.390
And I couldn't wait to wear it, 
and momma blessed it with a 

00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:31.391
kiss.

00:36:34.536 --> 00:36:36.949
So with patches on my britches 
and holes in both my shoes, in 

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.950
my coat of many colors I hurried
off to school.

00:36:41.654 --> 00:36:43.654
Just to find the others laughing
and 

00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:47.580
making fun of me in my coat of 
many colors that momma made for 

00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:49.581
me.

00:36:52.548 --> 00:36:54.548
In my coat of many colors that 
my 

00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:59.041
momma made for me, made only 
from rags but I wore it so 

00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:01.042
proudly!

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.090
Although we had no money, I was 
rich 

00:37:08.276 --> 00:37:10.276
as I could be, in my coat of 
many colors momma made for me.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:17.151
So with pooches my britches and 
holes in both my shoes, in my 

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.152
coat of many colors I hurried 
off to school.

00:37:22.918 --> 00:37:25.781
Just to find the others laughing
and making fun of me, in my coat

00:37:25.782 --> 00:37:27.782
of many colors that momma made 
for me.

00:37:30.926 --> 00:37:32.926
And I couldn't understand that, 
because I felt I was rich!

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.330
I told 'em of the love momma 
sued in every stitch.

00:37:43.047 --> 00:37:45.047
I even told 'em all that story 
momma 

00:37:47.362 --> 00:37:49.224
told me while she sewed and why 
my coat of many colors was worth

00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:51.885
more than all their clothes.  
But they didn't understand it 

00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:53.886
and I 

00:37:55.754 --> 00:37:57.176
tried to make them see that one 
is only tidings only if they 

00:37:57.177 --> 00:37:59.177
choose to be.

00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:03.249
It's true we had no money, but I
was 

00:38:04.876 --> 00:38:05.342
rich as I could It's true we had
no money, but I was rich as I 

00:38:05.343 --> 00:38:05.960
could be, in my coat of many 
colors (singing.)momma made for 

00:38:05.961 --> 00:38:11.858
me.  me.  Can you says momma 
made it just for me.  The end.

00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.181
end.  
(Applause.

00:38:20.401 --> 00:38:22.401
) 

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.360
'Cuz momma made it just for me. 
The end.  

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.529
(Applause.) 
I'm going to go back up on stage
