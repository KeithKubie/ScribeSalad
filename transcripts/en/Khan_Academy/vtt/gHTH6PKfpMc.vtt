00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.640
Welcome to the presentation
on level 4 division.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.540
So what makes level 4 division
harder than level 3 division is

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.690
instead of having a one-digit
number being divided into a

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.700
multi-digit number, we're now
going to have a two-addition

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.890
number divided into a
multi-digit number.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.540
So let's get started with
some practice problems.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.140
So let's start with what I
would say is a relatively

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.210
straightforward example.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.595
The level 4 problems
you'll see are actually a

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:28.300
little harder than this.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:40.320
But let's say I had
25 goes into 6,250.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.660
So the best way to think about
this is you say, OK, I have 25.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.520
Does 25 go into 6?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.300
Well, no.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.900
Clearly 6 is smaller than 25,
so 25 does not go into 6.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.990
So then ask yourself, well,
then if 25 doesn't go into

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
6, does 25 go into 62?

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.740
Well, sure.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.940
62 is larger than 25,
so 25 will go into 62?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.230
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.370
25 times 1 is 25.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.800
25 times 2 is 50.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.180
So it goes into 62
at least two times.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.700
And 25 times 3 is 75.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.900
So that's too much.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.300
So 25 goes into 62 two times.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.820
And there's really no
mechanical way to go

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.030
about figuring this out.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.170
You have to kind of think
about, OK, how many times do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.375
I think 25 will go into 62?

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:29.440
And sometimes you get it wrong.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.560
Sometimes you'll
put a number here.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.180
Say if I didn't know, I
would've put a 3 up here and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.530
then I would've said 3 times
25 and I would've

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.930
gotten a 75 here.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.640
And then that would have been
too large of a number, so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.840
I would have gone back
and changed it to a 2.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.870
Likewise, if I had done a 1 and
I had done 1 tmes 25, when I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.580
subtracted it out, the
difference I would've gotten

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.290
would be larger than 25.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.150
And then I would know
that, OK, 1 is too small.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.970
I have to increase it to 2.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.490
I hope I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060
I just want you to know that
you shouldn't get nervous if

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.520
you're like, boy, every time I
go through the step it's kind

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.170
of like- I kind of have to
guess what the numbers is as

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.800
opposed to kind of a method.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.540
And that's true; everyone
has to do that.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.650
So anyway, so 25 goes
into 62 two times.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.480
Now let's multiply 2 times 25.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.840
Well, 2 times 5 is 10.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.740
And then 2 times 2 plus 1 is 5.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.860
And we know that 25
times 2 is 50 anyway.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.020
Then we subtract.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.970
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.630
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.000
And now we bring down the 5.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.400
So the rest of the mechanics
are pretty much just like a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.540
level 3 division problem.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.250
Now we ask ourselves, how many
times does 25 go into 125?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.720
Well, the way I think about it
is 25-- it goes into 100 about

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.750
four times, so it will go
into 125 one more time.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.560
It goes into it five times.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650
If you weren't sure you could
try 4 and then you would see

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.110
that you would have
too much left over.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.540
Or if you tried 6 you would see
that you would actually get 6

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.020
times 25 is a number
larger than 125.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.380
So you can't use 6.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.520
So if we say 25 goes into 125
five times then we just

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.270
multiply 5 times 5 is 25.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.090
5 times 2 is 10 plus 2, 125.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.400
So it goes in exact.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.922
So 125 minus 125 is clearly 0.

00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:25.150
Then we bring down this 0.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.270
And 25 goes into 0 zero times.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.430
0 times 25 is 0.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.990
Remainder is 0.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.500
So we see that 25 goes into
6,250 exactly 250 times.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.460
Let's do another problem.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
Let's say I had-- let me
pick an interesting number.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.170
Let's say I had 15 and I
want to know how many

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.710
times it goes into 2,265.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.330
Well, we just do the same
thing we did before.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.780
We say OK, does 15 go into 2?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.710
No.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.910
So does 15 go into 22?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.430
Sure.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.250
15 goes into 22 one time.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.220
Notice we wrote the
1 above the 22.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.800
If it go had gone into 2 we
would've written the 1 here.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.260
But 15 goes into 22 one time.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.430
1 times 15 is 15.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.000
22 minus 15-- we could do the
whole carrying thing-- 1, 12.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.380
12 minus 5 is 7.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.850
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.120
22 minus 15 is 7.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.190
Bring down the 6.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.980
OK, now how many times
does 15 go into 76?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.330
Once again, there isn't a real
easy mechanical way to do it.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.210
You can kind of eyeball
it and estimate.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.530
Well, 15 times 2 is 30.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.490
15 times 4 is 60.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.510
15 times 5 is 75.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.500
That's pretty close, so let's
say 15 goes into 76 five times.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.820
So 5 times 5 once again, I
already figured it out in

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.760
my head, but I'll
just do it again.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.200
5 times 1 is 5.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.920
Plus 7.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.740
Oh, sorry.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.210
5 times 5 is 25.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.620
5 times 1 is 5.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.425
Plus 2 is 7.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.040
Now we just subtract.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.640
76 minus 75 is clearly 1.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.770
Bring down that 5.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.090
Well, 15 goes into 15
exactly one time.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.330
1 times 15 is 15.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.340
Subtract it and we get
a remainder of 0.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.410
So 15 goes into 2,265
exactly 151 times.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.370
So just think about what we're
doing here and why it's a

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.100
little bit harder than when you
have a one-digit number here.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.950
Is that you have to kind of
think about, well, how many

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.580
times does this two-digit
number go into this

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.580
larger number?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.480
And since you don't know
two-digit multiplication

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.770
tables-- very few people do--
you have to do a little

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.440
bit of guesswork.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.500
Sometimes you can look at this
first digit and look at the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.600
first digit here and
make an estimate.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.800
But sometimes it's
trial and error.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.990
You'll try and when you
multiply it out you might get

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.510
it wrong on the first try.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.690
Let's do another problem.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.600
And actually, I'm going to pick
numbers at random, so it might

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.020
not have an easy remainder.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.300
But I think you'll
get the point.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.800
I won't teach you decimals
now, so I'll just leave the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.590
remainder if there is one.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:49.580
Let's say I had 67
going into 5,978.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.220
So I just picked these numbers
randomly out of my head, so

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.790
I'll show you that I also
sometimes have to do a little

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.680
bit of guesswork to figure out
how many times one of these

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.350
two-digit numbers go
into a larger number.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.560
So 67 goes into 5 zero times.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.620
67 goes into 59 zero times.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.440
67 goes into 597--
so let's see.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.880
67 is almost 70 and
597 is almost 600.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:27.850
So if it was 70 goes
into-- 70 times 9 to 630.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.820
Because 7 times 9 is 63.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.110
So I'm going to just
eyball approximate.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.060
I'm going to say that it
goes into it eight times.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.950
I might be wrong.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.980
And you can always check, but
well, we're going to actually

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.930
check in this step essentially.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.620
8 times 7-- well that's 56.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.160
And then 8 times 6 is 48.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.900
Plus 2 is 53.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.310
7 minus 6 is 1.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.740
9 minus 9 is 6.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.560
5 minus 5 is 0.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.650
61.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.170
So good.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.240
I got it right because if I got
a number here that was larger

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.560
than-- 67 or larger, than that
means that this number up

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.050
here wasn't large enough.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.770
But here, I got a number
that's positive because

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.530
536 is less than 597.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.070
And it's less than 67, so
I did that step right.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.250
So now we bring down this 8.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.760
Now this one might be a little
bit trickier this time.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.500
Once again, we have almost 70
and here we have almost 630.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.990
So maybe it will go
into it 9 times.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.610
Well, let's give it a
try and see if it does.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.215
9 times 7 is 63.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.720
9 times 6 is 54.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.870
Plus 6 is 60.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.700
Good.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.610
So it did actually go into
it nine times because

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.480
603 is less than 618.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.730
8 minus 3 is 5.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.580
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.970
And 6 minus 6 is 0.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.480
We have a remainder of 15,
which is smaller than 67.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.420
So I'm not going to teach you
decimals right now, so we can

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.970
just leave that remainder.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.690
So what we could say is that
67 goes into 5,978 89 times.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.980
And when it goes into it 89
times, you're left with

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.670
a remainder of 15.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.850
hopefully you're ready
now to try some level

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.560
4 division problems.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.130
Have fun.
