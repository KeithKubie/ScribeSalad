00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.227
So sometimes I get angry,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:19.375
and it took me many years
to be able to say just those words.

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:21.726
In my work,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.777
sometimes my body thrums, I'm so enraged.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.658
But no matter how justified
my anger has been,

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:31.810
throughout my life,

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:36.771
I've always been led to understand
that my anger is an exaggeration,

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.699
a misrepresentation,

00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:41.390
that it will make me rude and unlikable.

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:47.893
Mainly as a girl, I learned, as a girl,
that anger is an emotion

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.625
better left entirely unvoiced.

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:53.837
Think about my mother for a minute.

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.664
When I was 15, I came home
from school one day,

00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:00.106
and she was standing on a long veranda
outside of our kitchen,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.857
holding a giant stack of plates.

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:08.268
Imagine how dumbfounded I was when she
started to throw them like Frisbees...

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.598
(Laughter)

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:11.789
into the hot, humid air.

00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.226
When every single plate had shattered
into thousands of pieces

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.476
on the hill below,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.723
she walked back in and she said to me,
cheerfully, "How was your day?"

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:25.650
(Laughter)

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:30.750
Now you can see how a child
would look at an incident like this

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:36.417
and think that anger is silent, isolating,
destructive, even frightening.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:43.143
Especially though when the person
who's angry is a girl or a woman.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:44.667
The question is why.

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.583
Anger is a human emotion,
neither good nor bad.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.934
It is actually a signal emotion.

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.833
It warns us of indignity, threat,
insult and harm.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:02:01.476
And yet, in culture after culture,
anger is reserved as the moral property

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.792
of boys and men.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:05.650
Now, to be sure, there are differences.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.934
So in the United States, for example,

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.976
an angry black man
is viewed as a criminal,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.583
but an angry white man has civic virtue.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.333
Regardless of where we are, however,
the emotion is gendered.

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:24.704
And so we teach children to disdain anger
in girls and women,

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:28.410
and we grow up to be adults
that penalize it.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:31.545
So what if we didn't do that?

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.164
What if we didn't sever
anger from femininity?

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:39.976
Because severing anger from femininity
means we sever girls and women

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.226
from the emotion that best
protects us from injustice.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:47.671
What if instead we thought about
developing emotional competence

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:49.011
for boys and girls?

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:53.582
The fact is we still
remarkably socialize children

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.875
in very binary and oppositional ways.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.424
Boys are held to absurd,
rigid norms of masculinity --

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:05.518
told to renounce the feminine emotionality
of sadness or fear

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:09.167
and to embrace aggression and anger
as markers of real manhood.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:14.518
On the other hand,
girls learn to be deferential,

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:17.542
and anger is incompatible with deference.

00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:23.248
In the same way that we learned
to cross our legs and tame our hair,

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:27.010
we learned to bite our tongues
and swallow our pride.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.053
What happens too often
is that for all of us,

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:35.348
indignity becomes imminent
in our notions of femininity.

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:41.332
There's a long personal and political
tale to that bifurcation.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:47.799
In anger, we go from being
spoiled princesses and hormonal teens,

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:52.140
to high maintenance women
and shrill, ugly nags.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.704
We have flavors, though; pick your flavor.

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.247
Are you a spicy hot Latina
when you're mad?

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.215
Or a sad Asian girl? An angry black woman?
Or a crazy white one?

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:07.101
You can pick.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.800
But in fact, the effect is
that when we say what's important to us,

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:14.101
which is what anger is conveying,

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:18.000
people are more likely
to get angry at us for being angry.

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:23.917
Whether we're at home or in school
or at work or in a political arena,

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:28.416
anger confirms masculinity,
and it confounds femininity.

00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:31.802
So men are rewarded for displaying it,

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:34.410
and women are penalized
for doing the same.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:38.523
This puts us at an enormous disadvantage,

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:42.467
particularly when we have to defend
ourselves and our own interests.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:47.710
If we're faced with a threatening
street harasser, predatory employer,

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:49.773
a sexist, racist classmate,

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:54.255
our brains are screaming,
"Are you kidding me?"

00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:57.843
And our mouths say, "I'm sorry, what?"

00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:00.893
(Laughter)

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:02.160
Right?

00:05:03.097 --> 00:05:06.231
And it's conflicting because
the anger gets all tangled up

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:09.684
with the anxiety and the fear
and the risk and retaliation.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.360
If you ask women what they fear the most
in response to their anger,

00:05:13.384 --> 00:05:14.979
they don't say violence.

00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:16.458
They say mockery.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.638
Think about what that means.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:24.725
If you have multiple marginalized 
identities, it's not just mockery.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.081
If you defend yourself,
if you put a stake in the ground,

00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:31.446
there can be dire consequences.

00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:37.018
Now we reproduce these patterns
not in big, bold and blunt ways,

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:39.712
but in the everyday banality of life.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.101
When my daughter was in preschool,
every single morning

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.559
she built an elaborate castle --
ribbons and blocks --

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:50.631
and every single morning the same boy
knocked it down gleefully.

00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:55.792
His parents were there, but they never
intervened before the fact.

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:59.583
They were happy to provide
platitudes afterwards:

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:01.875
"Boys will be boys."

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:05.333
"It's so tempting, he just
couldn't help himself."

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:10.104
I did what many girls
and women learn to do.

00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:12.206
I preemptively kept the peace,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.761
and I taught my daughter
to do the same thing.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.436
She used her words.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:20.583
She tried to gently body block him.

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.999
She moved where she was building
in the classroom, to no effect.

00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:31.755
So I and the other adults mutually
constructed a particular male entitlement.

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:35.247
He could run rampant
and control the environment,

00:06:35.747 --> 00:06:40.350
and she kept her feelings to herself
and worked around his needs.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.393
We failed both of them
by not giving her anger the uptake

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:47.417
and resolution that it deserved.

00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:51.444
Now that's a microcosm
of a much bigger problem.

00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:55.254
Because culturally, worldwide,

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.571
we preference the performance
of masculinity --

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:03.039
and the power and privilege
that come with that performance --

00:07:03.063 --> 00:07:07.167
over the rights and needs and words
of children and women.

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:13.368
So it will come as absolutely no surprise,
probably, to the people in this room

00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:19.364
that women report being angrier in more
sustained ways and with more intensity

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:20.538
than men do.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.917
Some of that comes from the fact
that we're socialized to ruminate,

00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:26.901
to keep it to ourselves and mull it over.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.401
But we also have to find
socially palatable ways

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:34.741
to express the intensity
of emotion that we have

00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:38.804
and the awareness
that it brings of our precarity.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.209
So we do several things.

00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:47.601
If men knew how often women were filled
with white hot rage when we cried,

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:49.083
they would be staggered.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.059
(Laughter)

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.664
We use minimizing language.

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:55.434
"We're frustrated. No, really, it's OK."

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.333
(Laughter)

00:07:57.917 --> 00:08:01.003
We self-objectify and lose the ability

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:06.669
to even recognize the physiological
changes that indicate anger.

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:10.019
Mainly, though, we get sick.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:15.686
Anger has now been implicated
in a whole array of illnesses

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.543
that are casually dismissed
as "women's illnesses."

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.773
Higher rates of chronic pain,
autoimmune disorders, disordered eating,

00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:28.241
mental distress, anxiety,
self harm, depression.

00:08:29.257 --> 00:08:33.350
Anger affects our immune systems,
our cardiovascular systems.

00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:37.693
Some studies even indicate
that it affects mortality rates,

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:40.081
particularly in black women with cancer.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:46.866
I am sick and tired of the women
I know being sick and tired.

00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:51.722
Our anger brings great discomfort,

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:56.405
and the conflict comes because
it's our role to bring comfort.

00:08:57.372 --> 00:08:58.944
There is anger that's acceptable.

00:08:58.968 --> 00:09:04.739
We can be angry when we stay in our lanes
and buttress the status quo.

00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:07.358
As mothers or teachers,

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:13.136
we can be mad, but we can't be angry
about the tremendous costs of nurturing.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.643
We can be angry at our mothers.

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:19.372
Let's say, as teenagers --
patriarchal rules and regulations --

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:21.602
we don't blame systems, we blame them.

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:25.542
We can be angry at other women,
because who doesn't love a good catfight?

00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:31.959
And we can be angry at men with
lower status in an expressive hierarchy

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:34.750
that supports racism or xenophobia.

00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:38.159
But we have an enormous power in this.

00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:42.532
Because feelings are the purview
of our authority,

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.172
and people are uncomfortable
with our anger.

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:51.402
We should be making people comfortable
with the discomfort they feel

00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:54.378
when women say no, unapologetically.

00:09:55.917 --> 00:10:00.583
We can take emotions and think in terms
of competence and not gender.

00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:05.394
People who are able to process their anger
and make meaning from it

00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:08.458
are more creative, more optimistic,

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.292
they have more intimacy,

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:12.473
they're better problem solvers,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.519
they have greater political efficacy.

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.440
Now I am a woman
writing about women and feelings,

00:10:20.464 --> 00:10:23.122
so very few men with power

00:10:23.146 --> 00:10:27.106
are going to take what I'm saying
seriously, as a matter of politics.

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:33.737
We think of politics and anger in terms
of the contempt and disdain and fury

00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:36.717
that are feeding a rise
of macho-fascism in the world.

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.519
But if it's that poison,
it's also the antidote.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:45.396
We have an anger of hope,
and we see it every single day

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.206
in the resistant anger of women
and marginalized people.

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:54.334
It's related to compassion
and empathy and love,

00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:57.515
and we should recognize
that anger as well.

00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:06.625
The issue is that societies that don't
respect women's anger don't respect women.

00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:13.555
The real danger of our anger isn't that
it will break bonds or plates.

00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:19.273
It's that it exactly shows
how seriously we take ourselves,

00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:23.201
and we expect other people
to take us seriously as well.

00:11:24.074 --> 00:11:27.934
When that happens, chances are very good

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.167
that women will be able to smile
when they want to.

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.674
(Applause)

00:11:34.698 --> 00:11:35.849
Thank you.

00:11:35.873 --> 00:11:42.563
(Applause) (Cheers)
