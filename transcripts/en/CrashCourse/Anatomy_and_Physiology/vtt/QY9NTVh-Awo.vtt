00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
When it comes to the nervous system, or just
your body in general, let’s face it:

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.240
your brain gets all the props.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.160
And it deserves those props! It’s a complicated,
and crucial, and sometimes crazy boss of an organ.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.920
But your brain would be pretty useless without
a support team that kept it

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.780
connected to the outside world.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.000
Because frankly, like any leader, the more
isolated your brain gets, the weirder it gets.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.330
Put a person in a watery, pitch-black sensory
deprivation tank, and you’ll see the brain

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.340
do some really weird stuff. Without a constant
flood of external information, the brain starts

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.000
to confuse its own thoughts for actual experiences,
leading you to hallucinate the taste of cheeseburgers,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.860
or the sound of a choir singing, or the sight
of pink stampeding elephants.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.109
It’s your peripheral nervous system that
keeps things real, by putting your brain in

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.669
touch with the physical environment around you,
and allowing it to respond. This network snakes

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:51.069
through just about every part of your body,
providing the central nervous system with

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.680
information ranging from the temperature, to the touch
of a hand on your shoulder, to a twisted ankle.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.080
The peripheral nervous system’s sensory
nerve receptors spy on the world for the central

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.659
nervous system, and each type responds to
different kinds of stimuli.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.570
Thermoreceptors respond to changes in temperature.
photoreceptors react to light, chemoreceptors

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.950
pay attention to chemicals, and mechanoreceptors
respond to pressure, touch, and vibration.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.810
And then we’ve got specialized nerve receptors
called nociceptors that, unlike those other

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.340
receptors, fire only to indicate pain, which
is the main thing I want to talk about today.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.399
Because, as unpleasant as a stick in the eye
or tack in the foot may be, pain is actually

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.060
a great example of where everything we’ve talked
about over the last few weeks all comes together,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.740
as we trace a pain signal through your nervous
system, from the first cuss to the Hello Kitty band aid.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.630
By the end of this episode of Crash Course
Anatomy &amp; Physiology you’ll never think

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.990
of a stubbed toe, pounding headache, or burned
tongue the same way again.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.369
Most people go to great lengths to avoid pain,
but really, it’s an incredibly useful sensation,

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.569
because it helps protect us from ourselves,
and from the outside world.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.009
If you’re feeling physical pain, it probably
means that your body is under stress, damaged,

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.740
or in danger, and your nervous system is sending
a cease and desist signal to stop twisting

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.380
your arm like that, or to back away from that bonfire,
or please seek medical attention, like, RIGHT NOW.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.700
So in that way, pain is actually good for
you -- that’s why it exists. I’m not saying

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.880
it’s pleasant, but if you’ve ever wished
for an X-Men-like power to be impervious to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.480
pain, I’ve gotta say, that is one foolish
monkey’s paw of a wish.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.140
Just ask Ashlyn Blocker. She’s got a genetic
mutation that’s given her a total insensitivity

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.310
to any kind of pain. And as a result, she’s
absent-mindedly dunked her hands in pots of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.700
boiling water, run around for days without noticing
broken bones, and nearly chewed off her own tongue.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.860
Luckily, such congenital conditions are very
rare. The rest of us have a whole nervous

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.540
system dedicated to making sure our bodies react with
a predictable chain of events at the first sign of damage.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.920
Like say you just wake up and you’re extraordinarily
hungry for some reason, so you run downstairs

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.170
to grab some clam chowder, but you didn’t put
any shoes on and suddenly you’re like, “YOWW!”

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.160
There’s a tack, fell out of the wall, and
you stepped right on it -- of course.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
Your foot immediately lifts off the ground,
and then you’re assuring your dog that you’re

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.860
not yelling at her, you’re just yelling,
and then you limp over to the couch, and sit

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.020
down, and you pull up your foot, and remove
that spiny devil from your flesh.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.100
You want to talk physiology? So what exactly
just happened in your body?

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.480
Well, the first step was a change in your
environment -- that is, a stimulus that activated

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.930
some of your sensory receptors.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.620
In this case, it was a change from the probably
completely ignored feeling of bare skin on

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.910
a smooth floor to a distinct feeling of discomfort
-- the sharp metal tack piercing your skin.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.010
Your peripheral nervous system’s mechano-
and nociceptors provided that base sensation,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.190
or awareness that something had changed.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.520
Then it went to your central nervous system
-- first to the spinal cord that caused the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.330
immediate reflexive action of pulling up your foot,
and then your brain eventually interpreted that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.250
awareness into the perception of pain, and decided to
pull the tack out and probably say an expletive or two.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.700
Pain itself is a pretty subjective feeling, but the
fact is, we all have the same pain threshold.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.620
That is, the point where a stimulus is intense
enough to trigger action potentials in those

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.820
nociceptors is the same for everybody. But, you and
I might have different tolerances for discomfort.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.500
In general, most doctors think of pain as the perception
of pain -- whatever any given brain says pain is.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.870
So, you’ve got the stimulating event -- foot
meets tack -- and then the reception of that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.560
signal, as the nociceptors in your foot sense
that stimulus, and then the transmission of

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.010
that signal through your nerves to your spinal
cord and eventually up to the brain.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.640
Now remember back how every neuron in your body
has a membrane that keeps positive and negative

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
charges separated across its boundaries, like a battery
sitting around waiting for something to happen?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.140
Well that tack in your flesh is that something.
And it snaps those nociceptors to attention.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.700
Some neurons have mechanically-gated receptors
that respond to a stretch in their membranes

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.530
-- in this case, that happens when the tack
punches through them.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.430
Meanwhile, other neurons have ligand-gated
receptors that open when the damaged skin

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.000
tissue releases chemicals like histamine or
potassium ions.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.540
These channels allow sodium ions to flood
into the neuron, causing a graded potential,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.720
if that hits the right threshold, it activates
the electrical event that sends the signal

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.410
all the way up the axon and gets one neuron
talking to another -- the action potential.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.980
When that action potential races down the
length of its axon to the terminal, the message

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.260
hits the synapse that then flings it over that synaptic
gap to another neuron that’s in your spinal cord.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.040
Remember, signals travel between neurons either
by electrical or chemical synapses.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.870
The electrical ones send an electrical impulse,
while the chemical ones -- the ones I’m

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.370
talking about now -- first convert that signal
from electrical to chemical, by activating

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.680
neurotransmitters to bridge the synaptic gap,
before the receiving neuron converts that

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.980
chemical signal back into an electrical one.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.250
In this case, news of the tack-attack is carried
by specific neurotransmitters whose sole job

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.980
is to pass along pain messages.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.660
Now, so far, your body’s response to the
stimulus has been handled by the sensory,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.090
or afferent, division of your peripheral nervous
system. This is the part that’s involved

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.660
expressly in collecting data and sending it
to the central nervous system.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.000
But at this point, the responsibility changes
hands. The torch is passed.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.360
Because the pain signal has just triggered
an action potential in a neuron in the spinal

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.940
cord, which is part of the central nervous system,
and there it reaches an integration center.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.000
From here, the response is taken over by the
motor, or efferent division.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.710
Once the integration center interprets the
signal, it transmits the message to motor

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.900
neurons, which send an action potential back
down your leg, where it reaches an effector.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.590
And an effector is just any structure that
receives and reacts to a motor neuron’s

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.150
signal, like a muscle contracting or a gland
secreting a hormone.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.500
From here, the motor neurons complete the
whole foot-lifting response until the rest

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.050
of your nervous system gets engaged in the
complicated tasks of figuring out what the

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.740
problem is, and fixing it.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.020
Those are the five steps that your highly
specific neural pathways go through to produce

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.910
what’s known as a reflex arc.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.340
A lot of your body’s control systems boil
down to reflexes just like this -- immediate

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.940
reactions that can either be innate or learned, but
don’t need much conscious processing in the brain.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.550
Lifting your foot when you step on a tack
is an innate, or intrinsic, reflex action

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.900
-- a super fast motor response to a startling
stimulus.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.510
These reflexes are so invested in your self-preservation
that you actually can’t think about them

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.730
before you respond.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.430
All this processing happens in the spinal
cord, so that the control of muscles can be

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.900
initiated before the pain is actually perceived
by the brain.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.990
Learned, or acquired reflexes on the other
hand, come from experience. Like how you learn

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.820
to dodge obstacles while riding a bike or
driving a car. That process is also largely

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.080
automatic, but you learn those reflexes by spending
time behind the wheel, or behind the handlebars.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.140
And reflex arcs stimulate some muscles, while
inhibiting others. For example, the tack in

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.710
your right foot ended up activating the motor
neurons in your right hip flexors and hamstring,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.140
causing that knee to bend and your foot to
lift up.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.949
But it also told the quad muscles in your
left leg to extend and stand tall, allowing

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.150
you to shift your body’s weight off the
tack.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.810
Of course not all reflexes come from pain,
as you’ve probably experienced when a doctor

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.460
tapped your knee and your foot kicked.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.669
Your muscles and tendons are very sensitive
to being stretched too far, or too fast, because

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:58.120
that kind of movement can cause injury.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.199
So for this we have receptors called muscle
and tendon spindles that specifically sense

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:07.639
stretching. If triggered by an over-stretch,
they generate a reflex arc that contracts

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.680
the muscle to keep it from stretching further.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.540
So, when does the brain actually get involved
in all this?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.830
Well, when your spinal cord sent impulses
down the motor neurons, it also sent signals

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.300
up your spinal cord toward the brain.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.850
News of the tack arrived first at your thalamus,
the information switchboard that then split

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.080
the message and sent it to the somatosensory
cortex -- which identifies and localizes the

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.079
pain, like: “sharp, and foot”; as well
as the limbic system, which registers emotional

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:38.479
suffering -- like, “why tack? Why me?!”
And it also went to the frontal cortex, which

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.909
made sense of it all, assigning meaning to
the pain -- like, “oh, I see this tack fell

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.959
from the Crash Course poster on the wall here.”

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:48.699
So basically, although your body has been
reacting all along, it’s not until those

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:53.670
pain signals hit the brain that you have the
conscious thoughts of both “dang, that hurt,”

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.930
and “oh, that hurt because I stepped on
a specific pointy thing.“

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.309
And this is where I want to point out that
we here at Crash Course cannot be held responsible

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:06.169
for any injuries sustained in the process
of owning a Crash Course poster. Enjoy them

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:07.480
at your own risk.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.639
Today you got your first look at the peripheral
nervous system, by learning how the afferent

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:16.569
and efferent divisions provide information
about, and responses to, pain. You learned

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:21.869
about the five steps of the reflex arc, the
different kinds of reflexes you have, and

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:25.980
what your brain has to say about all that
pain, once the news is finally broken to it.
