00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:14.580
-Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.350
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.780
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.800
And I'm so pleased to welcome
you to the annual Robert

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.690
and Maurine Rothschild Lecture.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.910
The Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.370
is dedicated to fostering
inquiry that transcends

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.470
disciplinary boundaries.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.260
It is also uniquely
committed to sharing

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.900
the fruits of advanced study
with a broad public audience.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.070
The calendar card that you'll
find on your chairs today,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.910
lists a number of
compelling upcoming events.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.770
And I hope you'll join
us for some of them.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.820
I especially draw your
attention to the annual Phelps

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.850
Lecture in the Creative Arts.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.630
It will be held on Monday,
October 19, when current fellow

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.300
and choreographer,
Karole Armitage,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.220
will discuss how dance makes
meaning through movement rather

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.110
than words.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.730
I also want you to be
among the very first

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.920
to know about an
event coming in April.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.410
The Center for African Studies,
the American Repertory Theatre,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.140
the new Harvard undergraduate
concentration in Theater Dance

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920
and Media, and the
Radcliffe Institute,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.970
will collaborate to
mount a production

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.880
of Here Word, a dramatic
commentary on gender

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.180
and contemporary Nigerian
society, written and directed

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.890
by Nigerian playwright, Ifeoma
Fafunwa, a play that has never

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.680
before been performed
in the United States.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.810
But today, the Radcliffe--
the Rothschild Lecture.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.020
For the past 25 years
the Rothschild Lecture

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.250
has epitomized the deepest
purposes of Radcliffe.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.030
Harvard alumnus Bob Rothschild
and the late Maurine Rothschild

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.710
was a college, Radcliffe
College alumna and trustee,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.770
established the Rothschild
Lecture at the Schlesinger

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.020
Library in 1990 in honor
of their 50th reunions.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
It has brought to Radcliffe
yard, visionary leaders who

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.610
straddled the worlds of
academia and public life.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.780
And it has become
one of the key ways

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.170
that we have advanced the public
side of the Schlesinger Library

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.130
and of Radcliffe.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.270
These purposes have
mattered deeply

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.560
to Bob, who is truly a
Renaissance man, a business

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.540
executive, a biographer of
an 18th century astronomer,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.420
a serious art collector,
an accomplished sailor,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660
and a generous
university citizen who

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.920
has a long history of
support for Radcliffe.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.390
And his partner in
this mission, has

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.280
been Radcliffe graduate and
Bob's wife, Margaret Touborg

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.260
Rothschild, whose staunch
championship of women's rights

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.830
has helped keep this
lecture series so dynamic.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.500
For a quarter of a century
the Rothschild's generosity

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.970
has allowed us to learn from
leading figures like Anita

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.950
Hill, Barbara Ehrenreich,
[? Marcia Sen, ?] Gail Collins,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.820
and Samantha Power.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.430
Bob is not able to be with
us here this afternoon

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.320
for health reasons.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.100
But I know that the good
vibes will reach him.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.460
So please join me in
thanking Bob and Margaret

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.860
for this wonderful gift of
an inspiring lecture series.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.210
I'm so pleased to have
you all here today

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.680
to mark this milestone with us.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.840
And I hope you will stay for a
reception immediately following

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.490
the lecture, which will
be held in Fay House,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.730
directly next door.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.540
In addition to the
Rothschild's, we

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.490
are also honored to have with
us this evening Radcliffe

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.500
medallist and former Chief
Justice of the Massachusetts

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.180
Supreme Judicial Court,
Margaret Marshall.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
Today's lecture not only
celebrates the 25th anniversary

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.850
of the Rothschild
Lectures, it also

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.589
marks the first
Schlesinger Library event

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.170
under the leadership
of the new Carl

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.470
and Lily Pfortzheimer
Foundation, Director

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.920
of the Schlesinger Library,
Professor Jane Kamensky.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.150
Along with being a
prominent historian

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.720
of early American history,
Jane is a Radcliffe veteran

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.220
in her own right.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.280
She was a Radcliffe
Institute fellow in 2006-07

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.960
and a Bunting Institute
fellow a decade before that.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.660
I look forward eagerly to
working with Jane to further

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.830
develop, diversify,
and digitize,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.640
the libraries
outstanding collections,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.540
and to enrich the relationship
between the library

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.010
and the rest of
Radcliffe, in ways

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.960
that continue to make the
Radcliffe Institute more

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.570
than the sum of its parts.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.540
So welcome Jane.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.370
It's a very big day here.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.230
And for all these reasons,
it was even more important

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.200
than usual to invite an
especially inspiring speaker.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.010
We wanted someone
whose life and work

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.750
embodied both the
spirit of the Rothschild

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.160
Lecture and the Schlesinger
Libraries dedication

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.160
to documenting the
multi-dimensional lives

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.540
of women, a tall order.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.810
In January 2013, I was fortunate
to have the opportunity

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.110
to visit South Africa.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.070
I was so profoundly moved by
what I learned and saw there

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.150
that I returned determined that
the Radcliffe Institute would

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.000
play a role in deepening
understanding in the United

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.620
States of this fascinating,
complex, and inspiring nation.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.250
I learned a lot about Dr.
Mamphela Ramphele while

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.360
in South Africa.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.600
And I was delighted to
discover, upon my return,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.020
that she and the
Radcliffe Institute

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.600
shares some very good friends,
including Margaret Touborg

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.270
Rothschild and Margaret
Marshall, who was born

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.080
and raised in South Africa.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.580
In fact, when Matina Horner
was the President of Radcliffe

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.250
College, Margaret
Touborg Rothschild

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.260
worked to bring Dr. Ramphele to
Radcliffe as a Bunting Fellow.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.170
A tale of two Margaret's.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.460
One Matina and one Mamphela,
it was over-determined

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.460
that we would invite
Dr. Ramphele to speak.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.530
She honors us today by sharing
her insights into the question,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.390
Can African women redefine
liberation for all?

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.420
I will turn to Jane to give
a full introduction to Dr.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.150
Ramphele in just a moment.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.680
But before I do, I want
to pause for a moment

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.370
to consider her experience as
a Bunting Fellow in 1988-89,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.890
when she wrote about
place, power, and South

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.470
African migrant workers.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.550
She also used her
time here to reflect

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.150
on the purposes of
scholarship, as she

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.590
explains in her
marvellous autobiography.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.380
It was here that she began
to search for ways to ensure

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.240
that her academic work
would not distract

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.110
from her political
commitments, but rather serve

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.570
and I quote her,
"as a continuation

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.760
of her previous work
as an agent of change."

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.680
End quote.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.670
And she has certainly
found ways to do that.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.600
As a medical doctor
and an anthropologist,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.200
she has found the parallels
between the participant

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.870
observer in the activist
and the anthropologist.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.710
She listens to people
in their own voices.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.390
She sees the world
from perspectives

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.400
other than her own.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.410
She has helped to create an
anthropology of South Africa

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.110
that moves far beyond in
her words, "the handmaiden

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.890
of colonialism," to building
much deeper understanding

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.540
of South African society.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.510
And in doing that,
she has insisted

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.950
on the importance of
gender alongside race

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.410
as a fundamental
category of analysis.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.900
As a change maker and
a scholar of change,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.100
she has demonstrated the
courage to take risks

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.280
and to rise to what she
so beautifully identifies

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.510
as "the enormous challenge,
to remain human."

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.440
Let me now welcome
to the lectern

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.750
my new colleague in the
Harvard History Department

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.620
and the Radcliffe
Institute, Jane Kamensky,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.570
who will give Dr. Ramphele
a fuller introduction.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.070
Jane.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.120
-It's a great honor as the
brand new Faculty Director

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.880
of the Schlesinger Library to
welcome Dr. Mamphela Ramphele

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.320
back to Radcliffe
and to introduce her

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.490
to you on the auspicious
occasion of this afternoon's

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.880
25th annual Rothschild Lecture.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.310
The Schlesinger is
a premier repository

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.760
of the papers
documenting the lives

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.950
and works of American
women, especially

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.960
the leaders of the
more than century

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.940
long feminist freedom
struggle in the United States.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.210
So it seems particularly fitting
that we hear this afternoon

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.260
from one of the most important,
original voices in the struggle

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.420
for the liberation of South
Africa from apartheid's

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.930
and in the fight for the
freedom of African women.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.640
Battles that Dr. Ramphele has
waged for nearly five decades

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.960
and in which she
continues to manage

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.940
the delicate work of
breaking boundaries

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.660
while building bridges.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.170
If you have not already
read Dr. Ramphele's

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.140
marvellous autobiography, My
Life, a Passion for Freedom,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.110
I recommend that you do so
immediately after the lecture.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.320
The book traces the dawning
of a political consciousness

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.400
that proceeded the headlines
for which she is well known.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.700
She was born in the
Northern Transvaal

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.290
in 1947, a year
before the apartheid

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.420
state took its full legal form.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.750
Both of her parents
were teachers

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.460
and nurtured the
passion for learning

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.170
that drove Ramphele to
complete her medical training

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.540
at the University
of Natal, which

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.690
was a highly unusual path for
a woman of her place and time,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.710
let alone a woman of color.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.860
Much of the credit for this
and subsequent accomplishments

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.250
goes to Dr. Ramphele's grit.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.860
Hers is a story of
perseverance in the face

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.490
of unbelievable
obstacles, including

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.450
law and brute military force.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.470
But Ramphele as she
tells her story embeds

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.110
her life in a web of lineage
as much as individual striving.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.040
And particularly
important to that

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.902
web were the generations of
strong women who preceded her.

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:05.530
Her mother she
writes, "faithfully

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.080
fulfilled her responsibilities
as a newly married young woman

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.410
in the village, but she would
not be bullied by anyone."

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.220
Dr. Ramphele's own biography
shows the deep imprint

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.120
of that maternal legacy
and her commitment

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.660
to passing it on to others.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.760
If Dr. Ramphele's
life work reminds us

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.360
that people shape history,
it is also a tale of the way

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.730
that history makes the
people who live through it.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.440
Hers is, in part,
a story of timing.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.090
She writes,
"Historical accidents

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.700
give rise to major tides,
which sweep the unwary aside

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.490
or redirect them into
paths that they could not

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.740
have anticipated."

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.110
She was not unwary.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.030
She entered medical school
in 1968, a year of rage

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.920
and hope and change
all over the globe.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.810
Along with Stephen Biko
and several others,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.710
Ramphele was a founding member
of the Black Consciousness

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.040
Movement, the powerful
South African strand

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.090
of the global
struggle for freedom

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.960
of oppressed peoples of color.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.370
She recalls herself and Biko
and their cohorts staying up

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.870
at night talking politics,
reading Gandhi and listening

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:27.060
to the voices of Malcolm X and
Martin Luther King on tape.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.400
America's civil rights
movement infused their struggle

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.440
against apartheid, just as the
South African freedom struggle

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.900
would reignite campus
activism in the United States

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.910
in the late 1970s and 1980s.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.650
For many of those
years, Ramphele

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.950
suffered cruelly under
the apartheid regime,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.090
detained under the Terrorism
Act in the wake of the Soweto

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:55.110
uprisings and then banished
to remote [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.660
Yet, she managed not only to
endure there but to build,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.010
establishing community health
programs and other initiatives

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.210
especially directed at the
empowerment of rural women.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.610
As apartheid crumbled, she rose.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.910
She furthered her already
considerable education

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.830
earning advanced degrees in
Public Health and Tropical

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.070
Medicine at the University
of Witwatersrand.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.230
And by the time
South Africa held

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.940
its first democratic elections
in the spring of 1994,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.580
she had earned her PhD
in Social Anthropology

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.520
from the University
of Cape Town.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.590
Those historical
elections took place

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.940
while she was on
sabbatical at Harvard.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.560
She cast the first
vote of her life

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.410
beneath the golden dome
of Bulfinch's State House,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.230
here in Boston.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.610
In the two decades since
that historical vote,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.220
Dr. Ramphele has deepened
her impact in South Africa

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.530
and extended her reach
around the globe.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.610
In 1996, she was appointed Vice
Chancellor of the University

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.320
of Cape Town, an
attainment, she describes,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.350
as beyond her wildest
dreams, and certainly

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.540
beyond the historical
imagination of the world

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.790
in which she was born and
which she helped to change.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.370
In the year 2000, she became
one of the managing directors

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.230
of the World Bank, the
first South African

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.440
to hold that position.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.310
She has been a force for social
justice in the global economy

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.000
and within the contentious
political landscape

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.990
of the new South Africa.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:35.060
In February 2013, she launched
a political party, Agang,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.580
dedicated to quote "True
freedom for all, a job, a home,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.790
and a life of dignity."

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.180
She stepped down from
her leadership of Agang

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.730
last year retiring to the
life of an active citizen.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.850
Although, I have a
feeling that retirement

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:55.310
is probably the softer of those
terms and active the louder.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.870
She continues fully to
embody the highest promises

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.350
of global citizenship, not
least through the telling

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.180
of her remarkable story.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.500
One had to write history to
make history, Dr. Ramphele says.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.480
Emphasizing, in her
autobiography, the importance

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.340
of scholars, storytellers,
archives, and archivists

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.450
to the freedom struggle.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.410
Quote, "Storytelling is
a historical imperative.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.420
We cannot successfully navigate
uncharted waters without some

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.480
script to guide us.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.680
This is particularly
so for women,"

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.350
she says, "especially
black women.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.610
Women have to find a script,
a narrative to live by,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.030
because all other scripts
are likely to depict them

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.780
in roles that fit the
conventional stereotypes."

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.630
There is nothing conventional
or stereotypical about the life

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.150
and work of Dr.
Mamphela Ramphele.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.570
The title of her
talk this afternoon

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.220
is, Can African Women
Redefine Liberation for All?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.070
She demonstrates in
everything she does,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.880
but the answer
emphatically is yes.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.710
Dr. Ramphele.

00:16:24.144 --> 00:16:24.810
-Good afternoon.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.260
I can't tell you what an
honor it is and what a joy

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:42.842
it is to be back here at a
place which shaped my engagement

00:16:42.842 --> 00:16:46.560
in the academic world.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.000
At that time, I came
as a Bunting Scholar.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.930
And as already said,
Margaret, was the moving force

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.730
behind that.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:07.420
I have to thank Radcliffe
for bringing me back

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.770
and for reminding
me of the beauty

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:19.780
and the historical importance
of now the Radcliffe

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.880
Institute for advanced studies.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.079
My little encounter with the
students during lunch time

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:32.580
today convinces me that
you're doing a fabulous job.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.570
It is 27 years ago
that I was here.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.980
And in some ways it
feels like yesterday.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.000
But a lot has happened still.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.310
So I would like to spend
the rest of this afternoon

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:59.810
exploring with you this question
that is the title of my talk.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.330
I'm not so sure about
the self evident part.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.010
But I do believe that we need
to ask these tough questions.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:19.820
But to do so, I want us to
listen, as a starting point,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:27.280
to the voice of a
17-year-old African women.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.350
Here is what she said,
"Navigating a world in which we

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:37.230
women fight to be
free in thought,

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:45.304
in speech, in actions, is
thrilling, as it is vexing.

00:18:45.304 --> 00:18:50.420
Yet, it is precisely
this complex balance

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:57.000
between deep hardships
and intoxicating victories

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.620
in becoming a woman
that I'm realizing

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.580
an extraordinary power.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:10.546
To be made to feel threatened,
I have come to realize,

00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:14.000
that I am in fact
extremely threatening.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:23.360
We women no longer
know our place.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.570
We women no longer
know our place."

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.460
I want you to hold
that in your mind

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.145
as we go back to sketching
the context in which

00:19:36.145 --> 00:19:39.860
this young woman said
these amazing words

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.710
for a 17-year-old.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:48.010
We live in a world in which
knowledge, systems, technology,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.680
tools, and resources
are available to address

00:19:51.680 --> 00:20:00.020
any major challenge that we
face in our global world today.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:07.060
But we seem to lack the
wisdom to govern our affairs

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.250
for the benefit of all citizens.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:15.110
My own country, South Africa,
and the continent of Africa,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.620
are the poster children of
the gap between resources

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.230
and opportunity to
succeed on one hand,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.420
and the real and lived
reality of the indignity

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.490
of poverty and
hopelessness affecting

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.080
most citizens on the earth.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:42.070
This gap reflects the cost
of living with old minds,

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.750
and failing to adapt
to the new world.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.925
South Africa's Constitution is
the envy of many in the world.

00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:56.230
But the lived reality
of many of these people

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.965
is still shaped by inequities
and human indignities.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:09.290
The triple burden of poverty,
unemployment, and inequality

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.620
weigh heavily on the majority
of South Africa's people

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.080
remains color-coded
and gendered.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.490
Just over 64% of
women are unemployed.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.850
And of those employed, few
make it to senior positions

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.630
or to board positions,
whether your

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.630
looking at the private
or the public sector.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.190
Pay parity remains
unattained at many levels

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.610
in both public and
private sectors.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.080
Only 25% of business
owners are women.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.880
And 42% of
entrepreneurs are women.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.340
Black African women,
the majority population

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.560
in South Africa and in
Africa, bare the brunt

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:09.380
of the triple burden of poverty,
unemployment, and inequality.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.780
Africa is home to eight of the
10 countries in the world today

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.560
with the youngest populations.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.330
The proportion of
those below 25 years

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.780
averages 67% in my continent.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:32.726
Ironically, Africa is also led
by some of the oldest living

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:38.760
heads of state, with Uncle Bob--
not your Bob-- Uncle Bob Mugabe

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.640
of Zimbabwe leading the pack.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.870
They are 10 years in office,
average 10 to 35 years,

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:51.110
placing them among
the oldest living

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.810
heads of states in the world.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:59.350
The disjunction between
a youthful population

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.700
that is majority women,
being led by old men

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:10.920
speaks to the old mindset
that needs to be challenged.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.760
The question I would like to
explore in this talk today,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.640
is related to this context.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.640
Can African women redefine
freedom for the benefit of all?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.450
If so what would it take
to redefine freedom?

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.910
How different would
such freedom be

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:43.000
from the post-colonial and
post-apartheid experience

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.520
freedom today?

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.320
What values, what
systems, what practices,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.953
would characterize freedom
for all as a lived experience?

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:03.970
You may well ask, why focus on
African women as change agents?

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.160
History teaches us
that change only

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.290
comes when those who
stand to benefit most

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.000
stand up and make it happen.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.520
The redefinition
of freedom is most

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.930
likely to be done by those who
suffer oppression most and are

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:30.180
conscious of their agency
to bring about change.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.470
The persistence of a
narrative of freedom

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.840
that excludes such change
agents becomes, in this case,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.384
a motivating force.

00:24:41.384 --> 00:24:46.480
Slavery ended when slaves stood
up and challenged their slave

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.850
masters.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.250
Colonialism ended
when subjugated people

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.860
stood up and refused to
be treated as second class

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.530
citizens in the
land of their birth.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:03.770
Apartheid ended when
black people, led

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:09.500
by young black people, stood
up and redefined themselves

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.780
as free from the label
of being Non-white,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.980
Non-European in Africa.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.470
Imagine.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:23.060
And we declared
ourselves black and free.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.940
Post-colonial Africa is
under-performing its potential

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:35.463
to become a thriving, inclusive,
economic, democratic space,

00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:39.190
that leverages the huge
resources, whether you're

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.650
looking at the natural
resources, mineral

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.750
resources, or humans resources.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.070
This under-performance
results from the failure

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:54.600
to utilize the talents and
capabilities of all of Africa's

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.308
people-- men and women.

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:04.120
Africa's narrative of freedom is
that of male liberation heroes

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.740
claiming leadership of
their independent countries

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.890
as an entitlement and their
reward for their contributions

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.950
to the liberation struggle.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.660
Many have failed to
make the transition

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.950
from freedom fighters whose
allegiance to the movements

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.570
takes precedence
over everything else.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.470
They failed to become
public servants

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.800
accountable to all
citizens and respectful

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.841
of their human dignity.

00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:41.160
It is no accident that
these liberation heroes

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.960
are all male modeling themselves
on male dominated power-ides

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.310
in the rest of the world.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.110
One needs only look at
any global gathering.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:03.370
Global leaders are mostly men,
with the notable exceptions

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.240
of Angela Merkel, the
Chancellor in Germany at EU

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.540
level, President Dilma Rouseff
in Brazil at the brics level,

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:22.520
and the singleton African woman
President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.316
of Liberia at the AU level.

00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:30.240
This is the performance
of the world we live in.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.210
Constitutional guarantees of
gender equality and protection

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:39.950
of human rights, that grace
many countries' legal systems,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.790
have yet to become
the lived reality

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.580
for most African citizens.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.690
Gender discrimination, gender
based violence and abuse,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:56.470
conspired to undermine women
and children, in most countries.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:01.850
The dominant narrative in Africa
is that of liberation heroes

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:09.310
and their parties being entitled
to govern-- no more accurate--

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.650
entitled to rule and perpetrate.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.180
In my country, we've got
a president who says,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.610
the [INAUDIBLE] will rule
until Jesus Christ comes.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.050
He may just be surprised
that Jesus Christ comes

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.382
sooner than he is prepared.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.980
Any criticism of
governing parties

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.940
is regarded as disloyal
[INAUDIBLE] liberators

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.980
and he's often heavily
punished through

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.480
socio-economic marginalization
threats and reality

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.890
of violence and intimidation.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.690
The threat of punishment
for disloyalty to the ruling

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.110
party, strikes
fear in the hearts

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:58.000
of entrepreneurs, professionals,
and ordinary people alike.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.490
Compliers becomes seen
as the only option

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.320
for many of those who choose to
remain in their home countries.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.400
Immigration has also come to
be seen as an option for those

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.560
who can go to greener pastures.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.720
And this has resulted
in Africa being deprived

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.910
of the skills, the creativity,
of millions of its citizens,

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.720
due to these
marginalizing tendencies

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.810
of our African governments.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:38.410
We live the stories we tell,
and are told about ourselves.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:43.320
Africa will remain captive to
unaccountable, self-serving

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:50.040
political leaders until such
time that citizens weave

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.330
and embrace a new narrative.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.370
African women are
in a strong position

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.860
to weave a new narrative.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.880
Women's positions as mothers,
sisters, grandmothers,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.565
and care-givers, puts them
in their strategic position

00:30:09.565 --> 00:30:14.770
to tell stories that shape
the lives of the many people

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.650
that they touch.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:21.950
Women's traditional
storytelling, as a role,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.540
has sustained
generations of Africans

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.190
and emboldened them through
folktales, praise songs,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.810
and other formats.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:37.110
These stories tell of their
greatness as a people.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:42.455
And tells of the rich
heritage that is theirs.

00:30:42.455 --> 00:30:48.930
It is time for women to
draw on this rich heritage.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:55.620
It is time for African women to
ask the question with no name.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:02.650
Remember, Betty Friedan, asked
in 1963, in a groundbreaking

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:08.000
book, The Feminine Mystique,
Friedan enabled women

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.580
to ask what they had all
along forbidden themselves

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.790
to confront, Is this all?

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:23.050
Friedan wove together the
threads of the many stories

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:28.160
that American women had not
given themselves the permission

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.930
to tell one another.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:37.850
These woven stories helped to
end the captivity of silence.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.620
Women rediscovered the
power within themselves

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.510
to be shapers of
their own futures,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:49.320
thereby transcending the
then dominant narrative.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.980
The birth of the second
wave of American feminism

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.310
took the courage of one
woman, Betty Friedan,

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.940
to mobilize us to
break their silence

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.912
and demand more of life.

00:32:05.912 --> 00:32:10.140
African women, as this young
woman that I started with,

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:17.270
are increasingly asking, Is this
all that freedom means for us?

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.630
Is this all that freedom
means for our children

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.870
and our grandchildren?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.950
Is this all that freedom means
for African men and women?

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:33.165
Is this all that our sons,
and daughters, and brothers,

00:32:33.165 --> 00:32:37.073
and husbands, and
sisters, mothers, aunts,

00:32:37.073 --> 00:32:42.611
sacrifice their lives for in
the struggle for liberation.

00:32:42.611 --> 00:32:48.060
The answers to these
questions are the threads

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.790
of a new narrative that
African women are beginning

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:56.618
to weave with growing urges.

00:32:56.618 --> 00:33:03.510
Black women writers, according
to an analyst that I quote,

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:07.900
"Committed to
historical intervention

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:13.190
and national reinvention
situating themselves

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:18.740
as new women of a new
Africa, more assertive, more

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:24.600
complex than their mothers, but
still connected with the past

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.010
and situated within
the family lineage

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.420
of female storytellers."

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.720
African women do
not have the luxury

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.900
of weaving exclusionary
feminist narratives.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.800
Their circumstances
demand that they

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.754
weave an inclusive narrative.

00:33:49.754 --> 00:33:52.050
Theirs is a narrative
that is framed

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.100
by their womanhood, their
humanity, their citizenship,

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:01.174
and their inter-generational
responsibilities.

00:34:01.174 --> 00:34:06.140
Inclusive narrative of freedom
affirm the truism that one

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.889
cannot be free in an
unfree environment,

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.750
where others are unfree.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:18.659
An inclusive freedom narrative
embraces the liberation of all,

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:24.179
from racism, sexism,
ageism, poverty,

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:28.710
and the indignity of inequality.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:34.192
So what will it take
to redefine freedom?

00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:39.530
Albert Camus, a twentieth
century French philosopher,

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:43.870
has got wise words in
answer to this question.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:50.010
And I quote, "The only way
to deal with an unfree world

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:56.032
is to be so absolutely free
that your very existence is

00:34:56.032 --> 00:35:00.330
an act of rebellion."

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.550
True freedom challenges the
dominant masculinity narrative,

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.220
that has held the world and
Africa captive for so long.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:12.530
Masculinity framed by
an alpha male narrative

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.020
celebrates dominance.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.340
The element constituting
this dominant masculinity

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.410
are anchored on
power and control.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:28.050
The story goes, real men have
money and control over issues.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.840
They occupy leadership
positions in public life,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.750
flaunt their sexual prowess,
are hardy and boastful

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.250
of their intellectual
superiority.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.680
This dominant masculinity
model operates

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.290
on a competitive "winner
takes all" model of power.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.880
Such an approach to
gender relationships

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.277
undermines those men who
are defined as losers.

00:35:58.277 --> 00:36:01.930
The alpha male dominance
model is sustained

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.220
by undermining other males.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.730
Men who are unable to live up
to the expectations of the alpha

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:14.775
male narrative suffer from
an inferiority complex.

00:36:14.775 --> 00:36:18.805
The sense of worthlessness
drives many men caught up

00:36:18.805 --> 00:36:24.301
in this undermining system to
aggression and substance abuse.

00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:28.490
The vicious cycle
of low self esteem,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:34.540
feeling disrespected, and unable
to communicate inner fears

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:40.410
and hopes, drives the epidemic
of domestic violence and gender

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.770
violence against
women and children.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:49.360
How can African women be
absolutely free in such

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.470
an unfree environment?

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.600
How can they make their very
existence an act of rebellion?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.220
Such absolute
freedom can only come

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:10.170
from drawing on the goddesses
within the women themselves.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.400
The goddess within each
woman is the expression

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.020
of love for the self, love
for those close to one,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.834
and love for humanity.

00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:29.070
The exercise of love in this
manner unleashes a live force

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:35.330
but leads us to a place
closest to the source

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.761
of our very being.

00:37:37.761 --> 00:37:42.830
African women through their
struggles in an unfree world

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:50.470
are sustained by the all
embracing love as a life force.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:56.260
They draw their energy from
narratives framed by Ubuntu

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.770
as we say in my home town.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:06.060
That Ubuntu mirrors universally
recognized feminine principles

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.700
that are set out in a book, if
you haven't seen it, called,

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.520
Athena Doctrine, written by me.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.986
These principles are
connectedness, humility,

00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:25.702
candor, patience, empathy,
trustworthy, openness,

00:38:25.702 --> 00:38:28.400
and flexibility.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.850
These principles
anchor the values

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.815
that stand in
contradiction to those

00:38:35.815 --> 00:38:42.570
of the current
dominant male model.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.590
These transformative
values frame

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.872
the nature of the rebellion
we're talking about.

00:38:49.872 --> 00:38:55.270
That women waged that
rebellion in both the private

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.160
and the public spaces
that they occupy,

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.050
to challenge traditional
conduct of relationships

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.120
between men and women.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.295
African women engaged in
such acts of rebellion

00:39:08.295 --> 00:39:13.480
in an unfree world need
to increasingly draw

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:19.230
on the strength of fellow
women within supportive circles

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.310
so they can succeed together.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:27.490
Such circles need to operate
at the personal and domestic

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.350
level, at the
community level, with

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.535
any institutional settings,
and professional settings,

00:39:34.535 --> 00:39:40.360
at work, at places of worship,
and in the wider society.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:46.650
So [INAUDIBLE] circles and
networks of support for women,

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:53.830
we have to weave within
them to go across

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:59.860
the boundaries of race, of
class, of age, of culture.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:06.260
And this is essential to the
development and sustenance

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.300
of a momentum for
transformative change.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.520
In my work with my colleagues in
my home country in the Eastern

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.290
Cape, we draw on the
strengths and tools

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:24.850
of the traditional African
conversational circle

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.310
to drive transformation.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:32.560
These conversational
circles enable participate

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.630
in communities of men and
women to empower themselves

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.080
in one another.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.885
Letsema, which is
what we call them.

00:40:42.885 --> 00:40:44.730
Letsema means collaboration.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:51.330
The Letsema circle they evoke
the egalitarianism, the trust

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:55.230
building and the
collaborative principles

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.730
that traditional
African societies

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:04.670
used to use to affirm
and to work together

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.760
to take out common challenges.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:14.270
And in doing so, they protect
themselves, as well as

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.410
those who are still to
come in future generations.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:23.390
The symbolic power of
circles of conversations

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.740
enable individuals to
look inside themselves

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:33.180
to claim their space, find
their voice, and link with us.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.870
In a circle there is
no chair or somebody

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.310
who's above somebody else.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.867
We are all the same and
we make eye contact.

00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:46.400
And that's the
affirmation that we need.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.420
Our experience in
this Letsema work

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.370
confirms the
importance of raising

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:57.120
the consciousness of individuals
of the power of the lives

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.610
within themselves.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.010
They become their
own liberators.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.360
The life force
within them enable

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.670
them to reach out to others
to sustain acts of rebellion

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:15.440
against forces that
hold them captive.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.550
Women who are more attentive to
that inner space where the life

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:25.700
source pulsates
and the main actors

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:32.080
and leaders in this inner circle
and in team that is driving us.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.600
I was excited earlier
this year to discover

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.630
the work of Jean
Shinoda Bolen that

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.320
resonates with our work
in this inner circle.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.670
"Women's circles
form one at a time,"

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:53.140
writes Jean, whose
also a union analyst.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.060
"Each circle expands
the experience

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.550
of being in one to more women.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.450
Each women in every circle
who is changed by it

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:09.790
takes this experience into
her world of relationships.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:15.710
Until, one fine day, a
new circle will form,

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.540
and it will be the
millionth circle-- the one

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.650
that tips the
scales-- and brings us

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:30.070
into the post-patriarchal
human era."

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.984
Imagine that.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:38.740
Using experience gleaned from
Jean's participation in women's

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.860
circles since
1985, she argues is

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.810
that these support groups,
learning societies, agents

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.080
of change, can empower members.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:57.410
The author begins by casting a
circle, who, want, when, where.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:03.495
And then moves to centering the
group with common intention,

00:44:03.495 --> 00:44:07.650
with energy,
compassion and wisdom.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:14.605
Two important criteria to
keep those circles alive,

00:44:14.605 --> 00:44:21.180
equality and make sure
that everyone feels safe.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.570
Jean concludes with an
overview of the importance

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.750
of rituals and celebration
in women's circles.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.170
It is in the loving
embrace of the circle,

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:37.210
that more and more women
can and are living out

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:42.080
their lives of rebellion
and changing the world one

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.890
step at a time.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:55.800
So what would an Africa with
redefined freedom look like?

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.170
We now know, for
sure, that equality

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.740
is good for everyone,
rich and poor.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:09.210
The authors of The Spirit
Level, present a persuasive case

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:13.182
that more equitable
societies are healthier,

00:45:13.182 --> 00:45:18.800
have longer life expectancies,
experience less crime,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.780
and in security.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.550
And they reap benefits
of the talents and skills

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.840
of all their people.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:31.490
And they ascribe
this to the trust

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.200
that develops in a more
equal society, which

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:42.120
is a marker of how with
greater material equality

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:49.270
you can help to create a more
cohesive corporate community

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.110
to the benefit of everybody.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:56.110
You only need to look at
Scandinavia and Japan--

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:00.530
even though on the gender
side you may have some issues.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:04.990
We also know from recent
analysis by Thomas Piketty

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:09.140
that wealth accumulation
has over the ages

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:16.168
largely favored property owners
and inheritance of money.

00:46:16.168 --> 00:46:18.280
Of course, in the
twenty-first century

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.486
technology advances has
created new business and so on.

00:46:22.486 --> 00:46:26.720
But at the end of
the day, capital

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.220
begets more capital
accumulation.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:36.280
And the majority of the
inheritors of wealth are, men.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.510
What is the clear
is that societies

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.160
that have succeeded
in overcoming

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:48.930
the burden off the triple
burden of poverty, unemployment,

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.860
and inequality, have focused
on investing in the development

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.950
of talent in all citizens.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:03.625
Instituting taxation systems
that enlarge the common pool

00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:07.910
and equalize the benefits
of development for all

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.180
is essential.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.820
There is a special case to
be made for gender equality

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.430
beyond economics.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:21.690
Gender equality questions lie
at the heart of the personal

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.860
being political.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:31.760
Gender relationships while
being intensity intimate,

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:36.550
are heavily framed and
governed by cultural values

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.340
and reflect how and
who exercise power

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:44.374
in what spaces and [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:44.374 --> 00:47:49.570
The exercise of power
is a political process

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:53.760
with political consequences
beyond the space in which

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.110
the micro processes play out.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:00.180
The transformation of
gender relationships

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:05.120
from the African patriarchal
toxic alpha male dominance

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.030
model, with it's
inherent violence,

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.620
is essential to the
redefinition of freedom for all.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.360
Men, including the
alpha male, who

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.840
lives in terror of losing
control and dominance,

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:26.180
have to sustain their status
by whatever means available,

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.010
including violence.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.570
Such men, both
dominater and dominated,

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:37.110
cannot be fully who they
have the potential to become.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.820
They are too encumbered
by the burden

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.820
of maintaining dominance or
surviving being dominated

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.840
to experience the joy of
absolute freedom and enjoyment

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.910
of relationships
of mutual support

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:58.360
and nurture that only
true freedom can bring.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.220
African women as
storytellers, need

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.990
to weave an empowering
narrative of transformed gender

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:07.680
relationships.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.360
And the opportunities
that stem from that

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.360
in the personal,
the professional,

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.320
and the political spaces
within which they operate.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.680
True freedom is
experienced where power

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.880
is regarded as an enabler.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.755
The more people are enabled
to shape their own futures,

00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:33.260
the more energy
would flow in society

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.820
to unleash talent,
creativity, and innovation.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.970
Societies that have
greater freedom for all,

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.720
especially for women and
girls, do much better

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.820
than those characterized
by domination

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:54.110
of men over women and rich
people over poor people.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:50:00.390
The new narrative being
woven is putting Ubuntu,

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.550
the I am, because you
are, as the governing

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.030
principle in traditional
African societies,

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:13.930
is being used as a powerful
force that can draw strength.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.280
We can draw strength from it.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:20.090
It is an anchor in
interpersonal relationships,

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:25.280
in community relationships,
in which one's humanity is

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.010
affirmed and confirmed
through those relationships.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.320
One becomes a better
person by being continually

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.410
conscious of the nurturing
and empowering affirmations

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.570
of reciprocal relationships.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:43.590
Ubuntu resonates with
similar principles

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:49.240
in other cultures such as the
Japanese and Celtic traditions.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.970
The Celtic view is
particularly powerful.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:51:00.180
Just let me quote this, "The
human body is born compete.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.700
In one moment."

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.280
You don't leave your
hand inside it comes out.

00:51:07.654 --> 00:51:14.610
"The human heart is
never completely born.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:20.930
It is being birthed in every
experience of your life.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.970
Everything that happens
to you has the potential

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.808
to deepen you."

00:51:26.808 --> 00:51:29.720
So.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:35.890
One is only complete as fully
human by experiences of life

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:40.360
and along sides of a human race.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.640
African women need solidarity
circles and networks

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.930
to draw on this on-going
birthing process

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:53.240
towards becoming more fully
human within relationships

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.200
that are nourished by
the life force of love

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.240
for self and others.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:05.110
The difficult task of not
only liberating themselves

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:08.760
from the stranglehold
of patriarchal systems

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:17.160
and the zero sum
approaches to power.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.110
It's tough enough to
do that, but women also

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:27.320
have to liberate their men
because without everyone being

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.450
free, no one can be truly free.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.970
And that can only
be accomplished

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:38.490
as acts of love for humanity.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:42.390
Unfree, fearful men
are the main drivers

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:46.435
of domestic violence and gender
based violence in our streets,

00:52:46.435 --> 00:52:48.940
in our villages,
in the work place.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.430
And for as long as
these men remain trapped

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:57.110
in this toxic masculinity
and patriarchal system,

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:00.496
African politics and the
development of Africa

00:53:00.496 --> 00:53:03.260
will be held captive.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:08.530
Sindiwe Magona, an award-winning
author in my country,

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:12.050
is also a survivor of two failed
marriages and the inequities

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:17.490
of apartheid, is one of the
committed transformative

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.380
storytellers.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.610
She has decided, she
told me the other day,

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:29.860
to rewrite history from the
lens of a black African woman.

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.780
In order to, in her
words, "re-shape selves,

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.520
communities and societies--
when all are categories

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:44.800
of sense-making are
open to re-definition."

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.620
Magona's elegant execution
of this commitment

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:55.840
finds poignant expression in her
novel, called, Beauty's Gift.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.080
If you haven't read it,
I would recommend it.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:07.110
This novel transforms an African
woman dying of HIV/AIDS into,

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.780
in Magona's words, "a
self-government and

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:16.950
self-assured being,
ascended in her ability

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:20.210
to freely locate herself
in any environment

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:23.938
of her own creation.

00:54:23.938 --> 00:54:24.886
Let me conclude.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:31.570
I would like to end
where we started,

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:35.740
by making you listen
to the voices of women,

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.570
young women, who are
the leaders of today

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:45.200
and who are busy
re-defining freedom.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.100
Here's one of them.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.840
"My mother, and my
mother, and her mother,

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.740
we're amazing storytellers.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:01.180
From them, I learned to
tell happy stories that

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.890
build a family,
community, and nation.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.475
I learned that for my
life to be beautiful,

00:55:09.475 --> 00:55:14.590
I have to tell beautiful
stories about it.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:20.490
I grew up watching them and
drinking from their love, words

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.360
and wisdom.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.300
I would like to see the
upcoming generation of girls who

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.640
sees so much love in
there formative years

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.860
from their mothers, their
grandmothers, and carers

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:40.401
so they do not have to seek
love and validation else where,

00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:47.010
but be content with the
love they carry within.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.320
I would like them not to have
invisible ceilings placed

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.243
in their life experiences
and career paths

00:55:55.243 --> 00:56:00.950
by patriarchal systems,
but to be able to flourish

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:04.010
to their best ability."

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:10.580
Do you see why I'm so
optimistic about our future.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.430
Thank you.
