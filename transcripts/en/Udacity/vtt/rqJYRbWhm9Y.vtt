00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.210
In our first example, participants reported how often they watched television.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.660
This is subjective; we're relying on their input. However, in the next example,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.580
we actually had people go in and measure the number hours they watched. That

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.760
would be objective. Again, with our third example, college students reporting

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.540
the number of hours they studied, we can't verify that so that would be

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.100
subjective. They self-reported. We can however, objectively measure the heart

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.720
rate of students watching a horror movie. Finally, measuring the number of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.590
pounds students lost after running three times a week, again, would be an

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.459
objective measure.
