00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.590
Now we know how to go
from a line to slope.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.840
And what I mean there is
if we have a line already,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.370
we can figure out its slope.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.700
But what if we have the slope and
we want the line?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.446
Well, it turns out slope
isn't enough information.

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:18.070
We also need to know, let's say,
a point that the line goes through.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.150
So maybe we know the following.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
We have a line, and
it goes through a certain point (1,3).

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.400
And that line has a slope of 2.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.720
Let's see if we can identify
the correct graph of this line.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.680
Which of these four graphs
meets these criteria,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.934
goes through the point (1,3) and
has a slope of 2?
