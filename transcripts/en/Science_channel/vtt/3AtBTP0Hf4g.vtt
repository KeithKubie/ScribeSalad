♪♪

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.775
THIS GLASSBLOWER IS FULL
OF HOT AIR.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.780
THAT AIR IS PUMPED
INTO CAST-IRON MOLDS

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.150
THAT SHAPE THE MOLTEN GLASS.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.886
EIGHT MECHANICAL GLASSBLOWERS
PRODUCE ALMOST 6,000 BOTTLES

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.055
AN HOUR.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.525
IF THE GLASS COOLS TOO QUICKLY,
IT WILL SHATTER.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.326
SO THE BOTTLES

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.596
PASS INTO A SLOW-MOVING,
TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED TUNNEL,

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.432
WHICH GRADUALLY LOWERS THE HEAT

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:37.202
TO RELIEVE ANY INTERNAL STRESSES
IN THE GLASS.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:39.405
IN THE BLINK OF
ITS SOLITARY EYE,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.674
A LASER CUTTER
TURNS SHEETS OF ALUMINUM

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.511
TO SWISS CHEESE.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.148
THEN THE SPINNERS TAKE OVER.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.284
SPINNER ONE MOLDS EACH DISK

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.820
INTO THE ROUGH SHAPE
OF THE LAMP.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.256
SPINNER TWO REFINES THE SHAPE.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.128
SPINNER THREE CRAFTS
THE METAL CAPS.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.604
A LATHE OPERATOR TIDIES UP
THE ROBOT'S HEAVY HANDIWORK.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.873
BOTTLING CHIEF ALAN IS IN CHARGE

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:18.311
OF MIXING THE TOP-SECRET
LAVA LAMP LIQUIDS.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.146
I'VE WORKED HERE FOR 22 YEARS.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:24.584
ROUGHLY ABOUT A MILLION
LAVA LAMPS I'VE MADE.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.587
QUITE A LOT.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.157
Narrator: FOR LAMP
ONE MILLION AND ONE,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.726
ALAN STARTS WITH THE LAVA,
OR WAX,

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:38.231
WHICH HE WARMS TO
104 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:42.735
NEXT HE MIXES THE MASTER FLUID,
A SECRET BLEND OF CHEMICALS,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.971
DYE, AND WATER.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.912
LAMP ASSEMBLY
IS AN EXACT SCIENCE.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.814
THE WAX IS MARGINALLY DENSER
THAN THE MASTER FLUID,

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:59.552
SO AT ROOM TEMPERATURE,
IT SITS AT THE BOTTOM.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:04.090
WHEN THE WAX WARMS UP,
IT EXPANDS.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.158
NOW IT'S LESS DENSE
THAN THE LIQUID,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.494
SO UP IT GOES.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:13.933
AT THE TOP, IT COOLS AND BEGINS
ITS HYPNOTIC TRIP BACK TO EARTH.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.869
ALAN ADDS A SPLATTER
OF LIQUID RED WAX LAVA

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.606
TO EACH BOTTLE,
FOLLOWED BY TWO WIRE SPRINGS

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:23.442
THAT SIT AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE LAMP.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.044
THESE HELP HEAT THE WAX

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:28.848
WHILE GATHERING WAYWARD DROPLETS
ON THEIR RETURN TO EARTH.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.885
Alan: THE SPRING HELPS TO BREAK
THE SURFACE TENSION UP.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.023
Narrator: 400 BOTTLES
ARE READY FOR FILLING.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.826
LUCKILY, ALAN HAS ONE OF THESE.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:44.297
Alan: WITHOUT IT,
IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:48.267
AND PLUS I THINK
I WOULD GET A CRAMP.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.270
Narrator: THE CAPS GO ON.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.273
THEN IT'S BATH TIME.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:58.278
THE 160 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT WATER
MELTS THE WAX.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.381
AN HOUR LATER, THEY'RE READY
TO BECOME LIGHTS.
