of Asia and that means that countries
are opening up to that talent as well so

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699
are opening up to that talent as well so
 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.339
are opening up to that talent as well so
you see developing countries like

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349
you see developing countries like
 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.129

the market size a country like Indonesia

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190
the market size a country like Indonesia
 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.339
the market size a country like Indonesia
and a city like Jakarta is not

and given the market size of more than
 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.129
and given the market size of more than
200 million people it's a hotbed of
