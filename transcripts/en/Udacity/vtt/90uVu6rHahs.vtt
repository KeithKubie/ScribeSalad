00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.774
In general if you have a person or thing that can do a job in a hours then 1

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:07.680
over a represents the amount of work done by that person or thing in one hour

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.364
time. If you have a second person or thing that takes b hours to do that same

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:20.248
job, then 1 divided by b represents the total amount of work done. By that

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:24.085
thing in one hour. So if it takes them x hours to do the job together, then 1

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:29.542
over x is how much they have done together in that one hour. This would be the

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:34.270
fraction of the job completed. Again, this x is the number that represents the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.750
total time it takes for the job to be completed by two people or objects

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.341
working together.
