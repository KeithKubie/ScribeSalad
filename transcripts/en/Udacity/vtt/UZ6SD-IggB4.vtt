00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well let's go back and remember our rule for shifting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It only applies if we have a dot

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in front of a token,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so we have sort of 2 possible worlds here: this has a dot

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in front of nothing, and this has a dot in front of a token.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We are definitely going to use the dot in front of the token.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And then we need to look at that token,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and it better match the next part of the input.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we haven't seen anything yet--is the next token an open parenthesis?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Oh, it is! We're so happy, this is going to work out perfectly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So then, conceptually, what I do is just

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
shift my finger over one, just a step to the right.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So let's go see which one of those that looks like.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It should have this dot moved in, inside the parentheses.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, this does not quite match.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It doesn't have the parentheses at all--this represents using the wrong rule.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Over here, we've got the right rule,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but we didn't move the dot.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is just the parse state we started with previously.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So that's not the result of shifting.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This, however--this is looking very promising.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We've moved the dot over one--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so now it's inside,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and we haven't changed this starting offset.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We're going to put this in chart[1],

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this information assumes we started with zero tokens .

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then we saw this left parenthesis and Here's where we are now.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Finally, in this last one,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We've mistakenly updated the starting position

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
or the (from) information,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and this would correspond to some other hypothetical input

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
where we had already seen one token,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and now we've seen one more open parenthesis

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we're expecting to see a few more.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's not the input we're currently given.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This doesn't match--there are no hidden tokens

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to the left that aren't shown in the rule.
