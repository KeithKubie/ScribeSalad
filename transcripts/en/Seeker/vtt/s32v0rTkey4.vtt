00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.720
Synesthesia is a rare and incredible condition
where people see sounds, hear colors…

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:18.029
But what happens in someone's brain that makes
them this kind of super-human?

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.289
Synesthesia is a neurological condition where
a person's stimuli are crossed.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.740
When a synesthete experiences stimuli along
one cognitive pathway, another pathway activates

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.050
as well, causing an involuntary sensory experience.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.260
Five percent of humans have some form of synesthesia,
and they can come in different types.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.100
For example, violinist Kaitlyn Hova hears
music and sees corresponding colors; but a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.460
local painter and artist Mary Syring feels
that certain letters, numbers or days of the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.440
week have specific color shades.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.960
If you want to see a VR experience with Kaitlyn,
to experience her synesthesia, we just posted

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960
one here on DNews!

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.030
It's super cool.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.399
To be diagnosed with synesthesia, according
to Dr. Veronica Gross of Boston University,

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.530
the synesthetic reaction has to be quote "involuntary
but elicited," "irrepressible," and "stable."

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.660
There are a bunch of different types of synesthesia.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.300
The most common are color-graphemic, where
letters or numbers seem to have colors or

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.010
patterns -- like Mary, or color-auditory where
sounds produce "colors, textures and shapes,"

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.010
-- like Kaitlyn.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.500
But theoretically, there could be as many
types of synesthesia as there are sensory

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
pairings!

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.810
We could experience taste-hearing pairings
(where tasting things produces a perceived

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.741
sound), or sound-touch (touching different
things produces sounds), smell-color, or a

00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.891
handful of other combinations -- depending
how many senses you believe we have, there

00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.910
could be dozens of synesthetes.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.170
On my other show TestTubePlus, I discussed
how human senses include thermoreception,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.420
pressure, pain, magnetoreception, balance,
and more and more…

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.200
Studies across a bunch of journals have attempted
to figure out just what's going on the brains

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.390
of synesthetes.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.050
Researchers conducted fMRI scans of synesthetes
while

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.450
activating their specific synesthetic triggers
and evidence to support the theory that their

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.319
brains are somehow cross-wired.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.290
In one example, color-auditory synesthetes
saw their superior frontal gyrus light up,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.310
which is connected to self-awareness and the
sensory system, as did what's called the COLOR

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.469
CENTER, or V4 and V8 and it's neighboring
region, the fusiform gyrus (they're not sure

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.420
what that bit does).

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.360
Synesthete was seeing colors, but curiously,
the primary visual cortex wasn't active, indicating

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.569
the color cortex was wired to directly interact
with the fusiform gyrus and somehow… create

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.269
the experience.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.400
Though scientists don't know much about synesthesia,
people who have it say they've experienced

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.319
this extrasensory cross-talk for as long as
they can remember.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.849
Researchers have yet to understand just how
people develop it, but they have identified

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.439
two types, developmental -- or inborn, and
acquired.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.349
Developmental seems to be genetically, passed
on through families, and some theorized synesthesia

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.170
might be an inherited trait on the X chromosome,
as its skews heavily female; but a study in

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.999
the American Journal of Human Genetics disproved
that; finding instead multiple chromosomes

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.680
are implicated in the transmission of the
condition.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.849
Acquired synesthesia, on the other hand, can
manifest in those who are on hallucinogenic

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.170
drugs, or, in people who've had neurological
conditions like epileptic seizures which may

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.300
have altered their physical brain matter.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.650
According to Scientific American, grapheme-synesthetes
report having good memory for phone numbers,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.980
security codes, and polysyllabic anatomical
terminology, because the colors aid them in

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.680
recalling the information.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.739
A paper in PLOS One from March 2015, attempted
to explain letter-color combination synesthesia

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.840
by looking at the magnetic english alphabet
some people have on their fridge.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.469
Of the 6500 synesthetes tested, they found
at least 6 percent of the participants saw

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.030
shades that matched those from the magnetic
toy!

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.450
In fact, those born closer to the date it
was released saw even more alignment with

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.459
the colors: up to 15 percent!

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.349
Some scientists think, perhaps children learned
to associate colors with words or letters

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.730
inadvertently, to aid their memory through
synesthetic adaptation!

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.020
Of course, this doesn't explain all synesthetes,
only a small number, but shows some could

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.080
learn the behavior.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.100
Most of the research I found was in English,
I'd LOVE to see more in other languages, especially

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.210
ideogram-based characters like Chinese!

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.780
In the end, synesthesia is not a disorder,
and the cause remains unknown.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.630
It's an incredible mystery of the human body.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.240
Not all auditory-visual synesthetes see the
same thing, and not all grapheme-synesthetes

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.520
connect the same words, letters or numbers
with the same colors; even within the same

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.210
family, two synesthetes will manifest these
differently.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.810
As of now, scientists are scanning and learning
as much as they can about the condition to

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.460
learn about how our brains perceive the world
and construct our individual realities.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.200
I've been wanting to talk about synesthesia
for a long time, and here on DNews, TODAY,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.110
you might have seen we just posted a brand
new Virtual Reality experience.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.640
You can watch Kaitlyn play the violin and
see her synesthesia along with her music.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.090
It's really incredible.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.321
On the computer you can click and drag the
video around to see what Kaitlyn sees, but

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:26.640
it even better on a phone, because the accelerometer
will follow your head as you look all around

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640
the scene.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.831
EVEN BETTER if you use headphones and grab
a VR headset or one of these cardboard VR

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.240
kits online…

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:45.120
Then you can see what it's like to be 
a synesthete for yourself!
