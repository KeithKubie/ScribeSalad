00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
hi I'm James I'm studying physics for

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490
hi I'm James I'm studying physics for
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.880
hi I'm James I'm studying physics for
GCSE and I want to know what caused the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
GCSE and I want to know what caused the
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.570
GCSE and I want to know what caused the
Big Bang

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
Big Bang
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.970
Big Bang
well James you're studying there for the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
well James you're studying there for the
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.650
well James you're studying there for the
GCSE and you want to know what caused

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
GCSE and you want to know what caused
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.100
GCSE and you want to know what caused
the Big Bang or I would like to know who

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110
the Big Bang or I would like to know who
 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.680
the Big Bang or I would like to know who
so obviously I can't really tell you we

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
so obviously I can't really tell you we
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.019
so obviously I can't really tell you we
imagine that there was some original

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
imagine that there was some original
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849
imagine that there was some original
material maybe a small volume of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
material maybe a small volume of
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.000
material maybe a small volume of
material that started to expand but

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
material that started to expand but
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800
material that started to expand but
we're guessing what made it do that now

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
we're guessing what made it do that now
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.080
we're guessing what made it do that now
the evidence that we have is that the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
the evidence that we have is that the
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359
the evidence that we have is that the
universe is expanding and we have ideas

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
universe is expanding and we have ideas
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.089
universe is expanding and we have ideas
about how the forces of nature work but

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
about how the forces of nature work but
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530
about how the forces of nature work but
so far there's an awful lot of guesswork

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
so far there's an awful lot of guesswork
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479
so far there's an awful lot of guesswork
here and it's certainly not conclusive

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
here and it's certainly not conclusive
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889
here and it's certainly not conclusive
maybe you'll figure this one out

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
maybe you'll figure this one out
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.219
maybe you'll figure this one out
yourself when you come through school
