1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.890
The Joe Rogan experience.
What are these?

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.530
Is this Elon Musk space station on Mars neighborhood sucks.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.410
That's like living in Barstow for the rest of your life.

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.690
What do you even see there?
Yeah.

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.710
If you get trapped in Barstow in a glass bubble,
like halfway to Vegas.
Hey,

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:21.540
remember the files fair?
Pauly shore.
Yeah.
No,
but that they did a real one.
Oh,

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.130
that's right.
We by
the actual bias.
Pauly shore and who else?

8
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.120
Uh,
Stephen Baldwin.
Yeah,
that's right.
The biosphere like that.
How'd that,

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.150
that didn't go so well.
No.
People went crazy.
They go crazy.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.760
Why don't we do that again?
People go crazy,
man.
You don't want,

11
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.650
they don't want to be locked together with each other.

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.580
It's not normal for everybody.
We just stuck in some bubble with each other.

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.530
It's been 25 years since biosphere,

14
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.010
since eight scientists sealed themselves in the biosphere for two whole years.

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.360
What ended up happening to them?
I forget.

16
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.410
It probably went on fuck rampage took more than three months just to make pizza.

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.180
Wow.
What does that mean?

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.330
Did they bring a guy they probably to great ingredients from scratch or

19
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:01.890
something?
Oh No,
of course.
Oh yeah.
They had a live,

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.980
they had to be sustainable inside that little ecosystem where they allowed a

21
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.540
bang each other.
How could,

22
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.050
you forbid that how good your top people want to do in generic,
but it's work,

23
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.060
work,
environment,
harassment.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
He up.
Who's HR?

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.950
Who's going to stop you?
That's right.
Who is HR?

25
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.910
So there's 25 people in their 25 scientists and that's the thing.

26
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.570
Do you think that if people,
if we didn't have laws,
you know,
lot of the society,

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
no police,
how will we just kill each other?
Yes.
[inaudible] it didn't happen.

28
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230
They're like,
Ooh,
who was the law there and the bias?
No,

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.710
I think most of the time we don't even,
what does this say Jamie?
Nevertheless,

30
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.440
the team completed the mission emerging from the outside world after two years

31
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.390
of solitude.
Okay.
Um,

32
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.050
I think most of the time you don't need the law,

33
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
but is that because we know the law exists and people formulated society in the

34
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.280
sense that you could always count on the laws.
So that keeps people in check.

35
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.980
I don't know.
And it depends on where you live.

36
00:01:55.981 --> 00:02:00.150
Like if you live in a poverty stricken crime ridden neighborhoods,

37
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.940
do you need the law of their more or do you need the law?
They're less like what?

38
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:04.650
What is,

39
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.450
what's is is maybe people being arrested a lot causing some of the problems that

40
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:10.440
you're seeing in that neighborhood.

41
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:14.160
And there's some of those arrests because of nonviolent drug offenses.

42
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.930
Like how much,
how much are you turning?

43
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.020
Cause there is a certain percentage of people that get turned into criminals

44
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.480
once they get introduced into the,
the judicial system as a nonviolent person.

45
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:28.150
That person who's just driving towards that,
you're stuck in a fucking,
uh,

46
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.780
full penitentiary with criminals.
Like real criminals,
like violent people.

47
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.650
And then you're just a guy who sells.
We'd be like,
oh my God.
Yeah.
Like fuck,

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.820
what am I doing here?
This is why,
this is why we need to analyze those,
uh,

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.070
isolated,
uh,
environments,

50
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:47.700
those isolated ecosystems with people that's never seen anyone from the outside

51
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.570
see how they handle shit,

52
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.950
kill each other and they kill people that don't pull their weight.

53
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.030
Should we give people kill the week?
No,
I don't think so.
There's,

54
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.010
there's a great book sapiens from uh,
Noah.

55
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.330
What is you've all Herati um,

56
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.410
it's a great book but it just outlines the history of the human race and these

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.590
various tribes that have dealt with like weird shit like that.

58
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.041
Like there's,

59
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.370
there's certain tribes that like when they see like old ladies that are moving

60
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.640
too slow or if a lot of these kids,
they just kill them ma'am.
Yeah.

61
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:20.860
And this one guy was talking about,
I think it was that book.

62
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.840
I'm pretty sure it was the,
that was sapiens.

63
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.660
I read a bunch of books or listened to,
I should say,

64
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:27.250
I don't want to lie and listen to him on tape.

65
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.050
A bunch of them back to back on runs.
Correct.

66
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.660
That we're dealing with this very same issue.
And,
um,

67
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.210
there was talking about this guy who was like call a few of his aunt's dam and

68
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.044
yeah.
And they were like,

69
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.050
all the old ladies are scared of him because he was the guy that they hired to

70
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.510
kill them when they weren't pulling their own weight.
And I'm like,
okay,

71
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.900
but maybe that,
is that a bad thing though?
Because if you're,

72
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.810
if you're part of it,
if you're that old lady,
if that's correct.

73
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.210
If you're part of an older tribe,
if you about our tribe,
right?

74
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.080
And you guys have to keep moving and keeping things going because you're going

75
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.500
to get killed by another tribe and then you have a weaker members of that tribe

76
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.340
that are holding the entire tribe back.
What do you do?
What do you do?
Your risky,

77
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.920
I mean to you,
that's the real question.
Would you,
would you,
would you know,

78
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.930
would you put a bullet in,
you know,

79
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.290
your friend's mom because she wasn't pulling her weight and because that,

80
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.620
that depends on the entire tribe itself.
She's stoned the whole tribe down.

81
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.030
See we,
that's the thing that you do when you don't have much.
Right.
Right.

82
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.360
When you have surplus like we have,
we,
we value,

83
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.600
our older people want to care for them.
Right.
Like,
and [inaudible] and stuff.

84
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.690
Yeah.
Like there's a,
there's a famous video of these two comedians.

85
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:29.291
You seen that video?

86
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.110
There's two comedians and find this lady who's trying to buy gas with like

87
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.590
pennies and shit and they give her money and she starts crying.
It's a tear.

88
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:38.770
Jerker it's a serious tear.
Jerker but what happens in the video?

89
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.680
They give her money.
They find some lady.
Yeah.
They just stay.

90
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.480
They just use two young guys get out and give this lady money and,

91
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.660
and she starts crying and yeah,
just like,
okay.
Gas was like five bucks a gallon.

92
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.780
I had close to probably pain with like pennies and shit.
She's just like,
she's,

93
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:57.160
yeah.
And so they give her some money and she's,
she's like weeping.

94
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.600
Yeah.
It's really,
she,
her husband died just a week ago.
Yeah.
It's like,

95
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.540
it's heavy to turn it off.
I'm gonna start crying.
Stop it.
I want to see you cry.

96
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.740
You don't know,
man.
Hey,
Joel was lost.
We cried,
uh,
not that long ago.
Really?
Yeah.

97
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.540
I cry for happy thing.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.
You don't cry for sad stuff?
Not as much,

98
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.040
man.
Yeah.
I'm all like,
if someone does something really amazing,
I'll start with,

99
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.500
yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
You saw my videos,
you like,
Oh God,

100
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.510
I've got to get him into this guy at the show.
Yeah.

101
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.520
When people do good things that cry.
Yeah.
I get,
I tear up for shit like that.

102
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.560
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Same here.
Yeah.

103
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.130
I'm not into dudes who cry about like stupid shit.
Yeah.

104
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:38.050
Like having too much money on food.
Oh God.
Shut up.
You got out,
man.
You know,

105
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:41.500
if he cry was it always moves?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.

106
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.960
That's what happens when you drive and it says right.

107
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.450
Empty you dumb fucking idiot.
Jesus Christ.
Shabbat an eevee.
