00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop metal plating is a fun and relatively easy

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.680
Project that you can do at home with some easily available supplies and chemicals

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.370
Metal plating is a process by which one metal is chemically bonded to the surface of another this can be used to change the appearance

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.219
electrical conductivity or corrosion resistance of a material

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.680
The purpose of today's video is to learn an easy do-it-yourself method for both copper and nickel plating

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.220
We'll start with the copper plating

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.019
Here's what we'll need for that process sim distilled water some copper sulfate a piece of copper pipe and an old cell phone charger

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.828
It's possible in this experiment will work. Just fine with tap water, but it's best to eliminate any unknown minerals and chemicals

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.398
So that's why we're using distilled water this route kill product

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.139
I think is the cheapest way to get copper sulfate and any sort of pure form it's sold in most hardware stores

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.250
Always be sure you're wearing gloves when handling this stuff because it can be pretty irritating to the skin

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.750
This is just a scrap of copper pipe pretty much any piece of scrap copper will work

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.359
just fine the old cell phone charger is an AC to DC adapter it takes in anywhere between 100 and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.809
240 volts and has an output of five point nine volts

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.830
At point three seven five amps as our first step

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.359
Let's measure off two cups of our distilled water into a glass jar and then let's heat that up in the microwave

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.529
There we go now, we've got our water heated up nice, and hot it's not boiling, but it is quite warm

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.990
So let's measure off one and a half ounces of our copper sulphate crystals and mix our crystals into the water

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.599
We can use glass plastic or I'm using bamboo, but we don't want to use anything metal to stir this up

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.430
There we have it our copper sulphate crystals are almost entirely dissolved into our water moving on to the next step

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.059
Let's prep our power adapter. We don't need the part that plugs into a cell phone, so let's clip that off and split the wires

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.319
Now with our wires split. Let's strip the ends about an inch and a half

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.410
With the wires stripped let's attach alligator clips one to each end

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.269
Making sure that the ends of our alligator clips are not touching each other we can plug in our cord

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.289
One of these is the negative lead and one is the positive to test which is which let's dip the tips of the clips

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.630
into our copper sulfate solution

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.399
We can see that the alligator clip with the black lead has become coated with copper on the tip

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.840
So that's the side that will attach our metal that we want plated with the two leads identified

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.770
Let's unplug our cord while we prep our metals to be copper plated to start out

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.220
Let's try using a regular

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.330
Quarter and see if we can get that to take a nice copper coating before we start dipping it into the liquid with electricity running

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.609
Through it we need to clean and prep the surface so it's completely free of any dirt or oils

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.859
Let's clean this quarter in two stages first

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.480
I've got some very fine steel wool

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.820
And I'm just gonna scour over the entire surface of the quarter every little bit of it to try and clean it off

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190
Then to make sure I've got all degrees removed

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.270
I've got some grease removing soap, and I'll try and wash down the quarter really well

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.639
I'm also wearing gloves so any grease that's on my hands will not get transferred on to the quarter you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.989
See that our quick buffing has made our quarter a fair bit shinier same thing on the back

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.549
There we go with the surface of our quarter nice and buff

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.989
Let's take our soap and really try and clean all the greases and oils off of it

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.540
Our quarter is prepped and ready

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.739
So now let's attach a piece of copper to our positive lead and then the coin to our negative lead

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.870
Now once we plug in the cord

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.269
we should be able to dip the coin down into the liquid and a copper plating should start to appear pretty quickly just

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.459
As a first test I'm gonna dip the quarter down in and then pull it out after only about two seconds

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.620
Let's see if it does anything

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440
One two

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.529
You can see it's already started to get a little bit of a tint around the edges

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.389
So that's going pretty fast put it back in but leave it for a little bit longer

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.269
One two three nine ten

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.500
Boom look at that that is a quarter coated in copper

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.510
Now one thing is often right where the lead is biting into it

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.389
There will be a little spot where the plating isn't very even so I'm gonna move the lead to the other side of the quarter

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.459
And we'll dip it back in this time. I think we'll try leaving in for twenty or thirty seconds

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.469
I'm going to turn it around as well, so the other side of the coin is facing the copper pipe some of the time

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.539
When we go look at that that is a coin with quite a bit of copper

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.590
Plating it. We have a nice shiny copper colored quarter

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.000
Let's rinse off the quarter and see if we can buff that so it's a little bit shinier

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.260
We've got our steel wool. Let's lightly buff our copper and see if it brings out any shine

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.510
Buffed with steel wool that looks pretty good

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.039
Let's also try using a little bit of brass polish to see if it will bring out the shine just a little bit more

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.910
See it's definitely doing something

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.109
Now maybe if I used a Polish that was specifically designed for copper we would get an even better look but brass is

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.049
Mostly made of copper. I think the brass polish is working pretty. Well. Yeah. He's looking good that is one

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.730
Shiny copper quarter see a color comparison between a regular colored quarter and a copper colored quarter

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.820
All right, I really liked how the quarter turned out so now

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.890
I want to try doing the same thing with a nickel and a dime

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.799
So I can just have a whole copper colored set

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.450
There we have it

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.770
I think our copper plating is working out wonderfully so now let's move on to how to do your own

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.149
Nickel plating nickel is a bright silvery colored metal that is very corrosion resistant

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.250
So if you have something that's plated in nickel it will often stay looking nice and new even if it's been around for quite some

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.679
Time for our nickel plating we need even fewer supplies than we did for our copper plating. We've got some distilled white vinegar

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.380
And some guitar strings now you can see down at the bottom that says that these guitar strings

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.380
Have a pure nickel wrap

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.509
The only local sources of pure nickel that I could find

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.610
Was the wrap around these guitar strings and sometimes you can find pure nickel welding rods

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.449
If you're doing this make sure you get some that say they have a pure

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.819
Nickel wrap other strings may say that they are nickel, but unless they say pure nickel on them

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.379
It's probably a nickel plated steel that won't work very well so to start

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.260
Let's just pour off some white vinegar into our glass jar with

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.170
Our vinegar poured into a jar we now want to add a small dash of our salt

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.960
This will help the vinegar be a little bit more conductive

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.220
This is sea salt, but you can really be using any type

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.790
Now we need to remove the pure nickel wire from the steel core of the guitar strings

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.460
You can see that the pack comes with several different thicknesses of guitar strings. Let's start with the thickest one

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.630
If you look very closely as I begin to unwind this wire you can see that

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.290
There is one wire wrapped very tightly around a second wire

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:58.739
With these guitar strings the outer wire is our pure nickel and the inner wire is a nickel plated steel

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:07.079
We now want to unwind all of our nickel wire from off of the inner core pretty simple process. Let's just grab the nickel end

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.679
Secure the rest of the wire and start pulling should unwind

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.910
Once we get about six to eight inches down

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.309
Let's just clip off the core wire do the same thing again until we've pulled the whole thing off the guitar string

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.780
Yeah, that's pretty good right there

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.410
We can toss out the end of our guitar string we won't need it

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.030
Now we want to divide our nickel wire into approximately two even pieces

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.419
All right now I've got a good length of nickel wire. Let's just wrap this around our fingers a few times a

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:53.000
Lot of times actually just keep wrapping until there's only about a foot of the wire left unwrapped

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.820
Go we now have this nice bundle of nickel wire. It's got a tale about a foot long

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.330
so let's squish down our bundle and

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.380
Then let's use that tail to wrap it all closed

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.979
We go one nice little nickel stick

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.400
Let's just do the same thing with the other bit of wire

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.669
Now that we have our two bundles of nickel wire we want to attach one of them to each of our alligator clips that we

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.670
were using before

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.869
At this point we want to lower the alligator clips down into our vinegar until

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.710
Almost all of the nickel is submerged in the vinegar

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.079
I'll also use a little bit of electrical tape to hold them in place so they don't accidentally bump into each other

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.379
Now shortly after plugging in our charger we see bubbles starting to form on the negative end

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.280
You'll want to watch this solution and check up on it every few hours

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.450
The nickel wire will actually begin to dissolve from the end that isn't bubbling

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.630
After 8 to 10 hours you may need to replace it with a new string by that time you may also be able to see

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.460
a slight change in color as your vinegar changes from clear to a slightly turquoise green

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.739
Now we need to plug in our charger and let this sit for 24 to 48 hours

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.390
now here

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.799
I've got a solution that I let sit for about 24 hours and in the process of doing so it

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.830
dissolved its way through two of those nickel guitar string wraps

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.059
So now that we have our solution of what's called nickel acetate

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.719
We can begin to use this to plate nickel on to copper

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.660
Nickel doesn't do a very good job of sticking to most metals, but it will stick to almost anything with a copper base

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.820
So it's copper brass or bronze we successfully coated three silver colored coins in copper now

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.729
Let's see if we can take a copper colored coin and turn it silver the process is basically the same except that instead of using

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:50.870
A copper pipe we just use another one of our nickel wraps attached to the positive end attach it to our cleaned and polished penny

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.750
see it starting to react very quickly I

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.080
Haven't dipped the penny all the way in so we should get a nice dividing line right across it to see the difference

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.300
Beautiful

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.349
There's a shiny half silver penny right there

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:11.539
Let's turn it around and coat the other side, so we just have a completely silver colored pin

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.659
You can see it's currently bubbling more on the spot that wasn't already plated in the nickel

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.830
It's also bubbling quite a bit around the alligator clips, which I think I'm turning back to silver colored

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.339
the nickel goes on very smoothly

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.630
So if you had a shiny object going in you usually have a shiny one coming out

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.309
You probably should not try metal plating any utensils that are going to be using for eating

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.460
Just because if the metal isn't bonding properly it could come off and you know if you have a nickel or copper allergy

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.910
It's just not a great idea

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.520
But I am going to try it on the spoon not to eat with just because I think it will look cool on the nice

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:53.210
Curved surface, you can't really see through the liquid. No orange color comes up out of the blue very well

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.589
We got a little bit around the edges of our spoon that's interesting

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.320
This is stainless steel, and it really doesn't pick up much color very well

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.290
Almost like it resists staining

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.709
Not nearly as fast as the coins those. Just those go almost immediately. It's getting somewhere though

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:18.049
We've got copper building up around the edges

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.400
I even hit this spoon with some light and grit sandpaper to help the copper stick better

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.800
But I think it's just gonna wipe right off with a paper towel

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.620
There we go I think our stainless steel spoon is about as coated in copper as it's going to get

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.630
See it doesn't stay at all

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.300
Not very much little bits down at the tip stayed

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.999
Most of that is just coming right off just for kicks and giggles

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.560
Let's see if we can nickel plate the copper on the end of our stainless steel spoon

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.610
Something is definitely happening lots of bubbling going on down there

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:13.350
Well I think that pretty well worked we had our copper all built up on the back of the spoon now

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.319
And it's turned back to being great colors

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.900
Just sort of a weird model gray now. It doesn't look like a new spoon. It looks like this spoon has

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.150
Maybe been kicking around for quite a few years and just getting eaten up on the edge

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.349
Oh, and it's not sticking it earlier. So you can see it's peeling right off. That's the copper

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:40.049
Is delaminating from the stainless steel, but even though I thought I did a very good job of cleaning this stainless steel spoon

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.809
It does not want to stick to it at all

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.540
There you have it easy do-it-yourself

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:51.900
Copper and nickel plating like I said before nickel doesn't stick to everything but copper does stick to quite a bit

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:57.959
So if you have something you want nickel plated you can copper plate it first and then clean it and transfer it into the nickel

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.450
bath

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.629
Something else that's good to know is these liquids shouldn't really go bad very quickly if you've got a lid you should be able to

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.980
Put that on your jar store

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.710
It away and then pull it out and use it again when you're ready for your next

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:14.339
Plating project if you've got any great ideas of things you think will look good plated in either copper or nickel let us know down

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.320
In the comments and we might just try it out

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.299
Thanks for joining us for this video today and remember to come gear yourself up with hats shirts and other cool merch at the king

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.300
Of random comm see you there
