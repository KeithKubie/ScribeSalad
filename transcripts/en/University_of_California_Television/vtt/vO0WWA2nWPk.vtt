00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:03.634
(soft electronic music)

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.960
- So without further ado,
I'm going to introduce

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.113
Karen Gaffney.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.380
I think her reputation precedes herself.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.493
She is amazing, truly inspiring.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.440
And her talent and energy

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.293
leads to extraordinary accomplishments.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.633
She also is dedicated to
the well-being of others.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
She is a heroine in
every sense of the word.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.570
Many of you may know
this, some of you may not.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.683
She is an English Channel relay swimmer.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:49.880
She's taken this journey
to champion the journey

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.843
for all people with Down syndrome.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.623
It's really inspiring,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.020
and it really inspires
inclusion for all people.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.920
I would just like to say that
your long-distance swimming,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.390
it's evidence that it's
possible that each person

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.893
can meet their potential.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.691
Please join me in welcoming Karen Gaffney.

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.941
(audience applauding)

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.787
- [Karen] Thank you for
a nice introduction.

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:35.170
(microphone feedback)

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.150
That's not me. (laughs)

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.323
Good morning everyone.

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:41.000
- [Audience] Good morning.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.490
- In early January I
received an email from a mom,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.173
who's expecting her second child in May.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.140
She contacted me because
just before Christmas,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.270
she found out that her baby would be born

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.423
with Down syndrome.

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:02.900
In her email, she told me
that she was devastated.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.093
She cried a lot.

00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:07.639
I'm sure you can all relate to that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.547
because she didn't know
much about Down syndrome.

00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:15.373
But what she did know from
her doctor wasn't good.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.993
In fact, it was scary.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750
After a few days, she went to the internet

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.293
and that's where she found me,
and many others just like me.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.150
She told me in her email
that she was very hopeful

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.173
after learning more about the
real story on Down syndrome.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.630
Many people in the medical community

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.530
and the prenatal testing industry will say

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.493
that Down syndrome is
not compatible with life.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.513
Only they don't say it just like that.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.430
They will say trisomy 21
instead of Down syndrome

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.070
is not compatible with life

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.943
because it sounds more
scientific that way, and fearful.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.210
If they say Down syndrome,
then people will start to think

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.000
about all the people they
know, maybe a cousin,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.530
an aunt, or an uncle,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.090
maybe the person who
lives across the street

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.680
or works at their local grocery store

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.743
or at the same company they do,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.260
goes to school with their
daughter, is on a swim team

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.130
with their son, or sits
behind them in church.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.813
Maybe they remember someone
in their high school class.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.113
I know all of you here know
someone with Down syndrome.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.163
So think about us for just a minute.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.823
Are we not compatible with life?

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.490
As soon as I heard from
the mom, I emailed her back

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.680
right away with all sorts
of stories about my friends

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.773
with Down syndrome.

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:18.963
And I showed her this picture,
12-year-old Ben Silverman,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.153
carving the waves of the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.330
She told me that she was crying again,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.673
but this time they were tears of hope.

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:37.333
Oh, did I mention to you
that Ben has Down syndrome?

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:41.370
(audience laughs)

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.330
I wonder how those in the
prenatal testing industry

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.053
measure compatible.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.593
It is a mystery to me.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.790
Maybe they should try to explain it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.289
to Ben, but they'll
have to catch him first.

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.870
(audience laughs)

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.003
It's okay, I know I am different than you.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.370
I look differently, I talk
differently, I walk differently.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.800
I don't hear as well as most of you do,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.350
and I don't see as well either.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.293
And sometimes it takes me
longer to learn things.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.070
Now, another thing that
is different about me

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.600
is that I can swim, like
longer and much farther

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:30.813
than anyone in this room.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.617
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.510
You may be faster than me at the start,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.977
but I will outlast you
on time and distance

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.163
any day of the week.

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:49.720
(audience laughs)

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.410
You should know that I
have some pretty big swims

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.100
on my resume, like a relay
across the English Channel,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.100
a nine mile nonstop
swim across Lake Tahoe,

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:05.630
a six mile swim down the
Columbia River to raise funds

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.900
for the Providence Center

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.020
for the Medically Fragile Children,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.083
in Portland, Oregon where I live.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.570
I also like to tell people
that I am the first person

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.023
with Down syndrome to
escape from Alcatraz.

00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:26.580
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.440
I have done that swim
from Alcatraz Island,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.740
where the prison used to
be, all the way across

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.173
the San Francisco Bay 16 times now.

00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:39.110
(audience exclaiming)

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.440
And unlike some famous prisoners

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.512
who have attempted that swim,
I have lived to tell about it.

00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:48.160
(audience laughs)

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.000
I have done many other open water swims,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.580
in Thunder Lake, the Boston Harbor,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.050
Dun Laoghaire Harbor in Dublin, Ireland,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.693
a five mile swim from Molokini
to Wailea Beach in Maui.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.730
And an eight and a half
mile swim from Vermont

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.753
to New York on Lake Champlain, twice.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.797
I swim two miles a day, and
I work out on weights too.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.883
But I haven't done a big
open water swim in a while.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.482
So, I'd be up for a challenge.

00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:25.590
(audience laughs)

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.480
I grew up swimming, but I also grew up

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.053
knocking on the doors to
inclusion in the classroom.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.360
I was lucky enough to have been included

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.603
in a regular classroom all
through my school years.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.750
We had to change schools
to make it happen,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.753
but I made it.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.270
I have a regular high school diploma

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.800
from St. Mary's Academy,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.330
and a two year college degree

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.670
from Portland Community College,

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.283
along with a teacher's aide certificate.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.590
I worked for a while as a teacher's aide,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.710
but now I'm currently
working 20 hours a week

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.310
at Oregon Health Sciences University,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.973
and I created that role.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.153
And on Fridays, I'll work my
Down syndrome clinic there.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.080
I met with families and their children,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.080
help in the PT room, and I
answer a lot of questions

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.123
about living with Down syndrome.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.710
When I'm not at OHSU or at the pool,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.903
I work on projects for my nonprofit.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.140
Over the last 10 years, I
have talked with audiences

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.520
all around the country
and all around the world

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.750
about the importance
of inclusive education

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.373
for people like me with Down
syndrome or other disabilities.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.400
I have shared my experiences
and helped to influence changes

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.456
and raise expectations of others

00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:57.693
about what people like me can accomplish.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.180
I also talk about the importance

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.260
of regular exercise for everyone,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.453
but especially for people like me.

00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:12.276
(clears throat)

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.440
You know, in the last 60 years,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.960
because of people just like you,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.585
and families just like yours,

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:26.463
we have changed the course
of life for people like me.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.250
It wasn't easy, and it still isn't.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.080
There are still battles
to fight for inclusion

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.450
in too many classrooms around the world.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.053
And breakthroughs haven't
come for everyone.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.963
But, the progress is tremendous.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.470
All over the country, all over the world,

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.520
we have young people with Down syndrome

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.280
graduating from their high schools,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.229
some going on to colleges,
learning employable job skills,

00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:03.603
knocking on the doors of your companies.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.133
We have musicians and artists,

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.473
actors and fashion models.

00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:13.615
We have black belts in Taekwondo.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.910
We have public speakers.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.380
We have golfers, we have surfers,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.973
hockey players, and open water swimmers,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.945
and some of us have even
escaped from Alcatraz.

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:30.455
(audience laughs)

00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:32.660
Now, all right, now I know that all sounds

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.223
pretty compatible with
life, don't you think?

00:10:37.061 --> 00:10:38.646
- [Audience] Yes.

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:41.813
(audience applauding)

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.160
- You know, it is people just like you

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.033
that are making this
happen for people like me.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.540
Now, just as we are
making so much progress,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.541
we have some huge waves coming our way

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.726
threatening to wipe us out.

00:11:02.726 --> 00:11:06.263
One of those waves is prenatal screening.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.440
You see, a whole industry has grown up

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.820
and the race is on to
find newer, faster ways

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.923
to test for Down syndrome before birth,

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:19.863
and you screen us out.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.563
Yes, screen us out.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.830
Efforts are underway to create
a world without Down syndrome

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.610
through abortion, and I
think that it is wrong.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.403
It is very, very wrong.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.160
Down syndrome is being targeted

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.683
because it is one of
the easiest tests to do.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.493
All you have to do is count chromosomes.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.740
Without timely and accurate information

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.800
about all our progress,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.780
if the test shows an extra chromosome,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.405
in many countries around the world,

00:11:57.405 --> 00:12:00.387
pregnancies are being terminated,

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.793
babies are being aborted.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.487
Except with those who say,

00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:08.390
"I know a different Down syndrome,"

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.997
or "wait a minute, let me
learn more about this."

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.990
And those parents have to push back

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.440
on the medical community that
is quick to advise abortion

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.100
instead of education and learning

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.683
about the real story on Down syndrome.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.570
Even though we have support
groups all over the world,

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.690
we still have experts advising families

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.100
with old and outdated data,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.773
data that reflects the past,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.150
data that is rooted in the past

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.710
and reflects what happened

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.617
in the life then in an institution

00:12:49.617 --> 00:12:51.200
and they are wrong.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.183
They are very, very wrong.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.660
Thankfully we have, (clears throat)

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.000
thankfully we have some
ways of our own pushing back

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.960
on the prenatal testing industry.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.723
And one of those ways is medical research.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.700
We have dedicated leaders on
teams here at UC San Diego,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.573
at the Linda Crnic Institute in Denver,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.700
at the (speaks indistinctly)

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.960
Foundation and many
others around the world

00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:27.240
that are focused on finding ways to fight

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.349
the bad effects of that extra chromosome.

00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:35.640
These organizations don't
want to screen us out,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.763
they want to fix what is hurting us,

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.680
and they are working
night and day to outrun

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.763
the prenatal testing industry.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.330
We need to give them all the help we can

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.933
because we are racing for our lives.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.970
We need this medical research,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.910
the kind of medical
research that is focused

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.950
on the causes of our learning problems,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.100
our speech problems, our memory problems,

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.303
as well as the huge
threat many of us face,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.123
and that is the early onset
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.700
It seems this extra
chromosome we all share

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.240
puts us at a much greater risk

00:14:23.422 --> 00:14:25.330
for the early onset of Alzheimer's

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.063
than the general population.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.894
I am close to the age when
those of us with Down syndrome

00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:35.450
are most vulnerable, and quite frankly,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.633
I am scared by that.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.277
I have worked so hard, (clears throat)

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:46.213
(breathing heavily) to
get where I am today.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.163
And so have many other
young people my age.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.093
Sorry.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.780
It is my generation that
is showing what is possible

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.433
because of the hard work of
the generations before us.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.950
But it is also my generation

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.900
that is marching directly
into the ugly path

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.340
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.943
And if that happens, there
is no road back for us.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.720
It is a huge black cloud
that hangs over us,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.443
and our families.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.410
I think it is important for
families to stay current

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.810
on what is going on in medical research

00:15:31.707 --> 00:15:35.253
and learn more about
what they can do to help.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.340
You're lucky to have the UC
San Diego research efforts

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.043
right here where you live.

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:46.750
And you are very fortunate
that UC San Diego

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.680
is on the leading edge of research

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.813
on Down syndrome and Alzheimer's.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.310
I hope you all, wait, sorry,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.770
I hope you will all get
behind the efforts here

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.323
because our future depends on it.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.640
My friend who's expecting her baby in May

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.763
emailed me back again this week.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.313
She told me she was going to
name her baby Holly Karen.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:23.560
(audience murmurs)

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.263
And that made me smile.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.632
Who knows, maybe she'll be a swimmer.

00:16:31.632 --> 00:16:33.060
(audience laughs)

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.423
Or a surfer like Ben Silverman.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.433
Or even better, a medical research.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.730
So, Dr. Mobley, Dr. Rafii,
and (speaks indistinctly)

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.473
I hope you get this Alzheimer's
thing fixed sometime soon.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.147
Otherwise a young lady named Holly Karen

00:16:56.147 --> 00:16:58.940
or a young man named Ben Silverman

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:03.277
just might have to do it for you.

00:17:03.277 --> 00:17:04.110
Thank you.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.139
(audience laughs)

00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:08.306
(audience applauding)

00:17:15.157 --> 00:17:18.490
