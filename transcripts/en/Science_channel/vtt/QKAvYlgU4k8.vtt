00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.567
Narrator: WHEN YOU GAZE UP
AT THE NIGHT SKY,

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.534
YOU SEE STARS.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:10.467
THESE GLITTERY BALLS...
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.033
[ TAPE REWINDING ]

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.801
NOPE.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.634
THESE ORBS OF SWIRLING GASES
ARE PRETTY COOL.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.667
LIKE PEOPLE,
EVERY STAR IS UNIQUE.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:26.000
SIZE, COLOR, TEMPERATURE,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.200
WHICH IS MEASURED IN KELVIN,
ARE SUPER-HOT TEMPERATURES.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.501
IF YOU'RE REALLY WARM
AND YOU'RE LIKE,

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.133
"I WONDER WHAT THE TEMPERATURE
IS IN KELVIN?"

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.701
YOU'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.033
WHEN A YELLOW STAR, LIKE OUR
SUN, USES UP MOST OF ITS FUEL,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.934
IT GROWS TO A MASSIVE SIZE
AND TURNS RED.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.567
ASTRONOMERS CLEVERLY DUBBED THIS
GIANT RED STAR...

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:48.701
PHBT.

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:51.467
THIS RED GIANT IS A GREEDY
MOTHER[BLEEP]

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:55.601
IT WILL EAT NEARBY PLANETS
AND EXPLODE IN A HUGE FIREBALL.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:58.200
IN SPACE, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS...

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.033
[ SILENCE ]

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:07.367
WHAT'S LEFT IS A MUCH SMALLER
STAR BURNING WHITE,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.367
CALLED A WHITE DWARF.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:12.801
THERE ARE ALSO BROWN DWARVES
AND BLACK DWARVES.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.167
THEY ALSO MATTER.

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.901
THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T
DISCRIMINATE.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:22.000
LIKE MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS,
MANY STARS ARE IN PAIRS,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.734
ALSO CALLED BINARY.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.067
OUR SUN IS ALONE, ALSO CALLED...

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.000
AND FOR THE REALLY KINKY,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.801
THERE ARE THREE-STAR
AND FOUR-STAR SYSTEMS.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.434
Man: OH, YEAH.

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:37.367
Narrator: BINARY STARS
DON'T ALWAYS GET ALONG.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.901
USUALLY ONE GETS BIGGER,

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.200
AND AS GRAVITY STEALS MATERIAL
FROM THE SMALLER STAR,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.400
LIKE MY EX.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.200
THESE ARE CALLED VAMPIRE STARS

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.767
BECAUSE ASTRONOMERS FINALLY
PULLED A SENSE OF HUMOR

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.033
OUT OF THEIR ASS.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.367
THE VAMPIRE SUCKS THE LIFE OUT
OF THE VICTIM,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.234
WHICH GETS SMALLER
AND DENSER

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.467
WHILE THE VAMPIRE GROWS SO BIG
THAT IT FEEDS THE MATERIAL

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.234
RIGHT BACK TO THE VICTIM STAR,

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:02.868
NOT UNLIKE THIS BIRD
REGURGITATING ITS LUNCH

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:04.667
INTO ITS BABY'S MOUTH.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.734
IN SUMMARY, STARS ARE BORN,
THEY LIVE FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS,

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.367
AND THEN THEY DIE.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.501
OUR SUN HAS BURNED
FOR 4 BILLION YEARS.

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:18.968
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:21.267
IT WON'T DIE UNTIL THURSDAY.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.501
JUST KIDDING.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.133
NEXT THURSDAY.
