00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.191
The Origin of the QWERTY Keyboard

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:07.509
The first typewriter was introduced to the
United States in 1868 by Christopher Latham

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.509
Sholes.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.860
His first attempt to build a typing device
consisted of a crude and sluggish machine

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.709
that was far from perfect.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.910
The design used letters and characters on
the ends of rods which were called typebars.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.320
When a key was struck, the typebar would swing
up and hit the ink-coated tape which would

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.689
transfer the image onto paper.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.880
The original design of the keyboard positioned
keys in alphabetical order in two rows.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.360
Makes sense, right?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
Well, this arrangement caused the typebars
of the most commonly used combination letters

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.350
of the alphabet (ie.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.879
TH and ST) to be positioned close together,
so when the keys were hit right after the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.820
other with a speed faster than a snail, the
keys would jam.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.989
The attempt to solve this malfunction resulted
in a rearrangement of keys.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.860
In 1868, in collaboration with educator Amos
Densmore, Sholes arranged the letters on the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.070
keyboard for better spacing between popular
keys used in combination.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.670
The results was that this initially made it
difficult for people to find the letters they

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.540
needed to type efficiently.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.300
However, someone who mastered this new key
arrangement would actually be able to type

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
faster because the keys wouldn’t jam.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.100
This was the beginning of the QWERTY keyboard,
which first appeared in 1872.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.860
The first typewriter machine found its way
on the market in 1874 through Remington &amp; Sons.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.630
The device was called the Remington No. 1.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.850
You’re probably thinking it sold out in
minutes since it was the latest and greatest

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.560
technological device to be mass-produced.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.050
The truth is, most people ignored it.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.590
Sure, the machine still had some quirks and
Sholes had yet to figure out ideal customers

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.790
for his invention, but in the late 1870s,
the idea of “mechanical writing” was just

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.240
plain strange for most people.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.210
The accepted norm was to write letters in
legible longhand and many people found mechanical

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.860
writing uncouth or even offensive.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.510
Sholes figured his device would appeal to
clergyman and men of letters first and then

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.380
he’d branch out to the general public; he
didn’t even consider its use in business.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.329
All of these factors probably played a part
in the typewriter’s initial lack of sales.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.799
Four years later, after slight modifications
to the arrangement of the keyboard were made,

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.900
Remington &amp; Sons produced the new Remington
No. 2 model.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.140
The Remington No. 2 included the arrangement
of keys we use today along with the ability

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700
to type both capital and lowercase letters
by using the shift key.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.829
The shift key received its name because it
caused the carriage to shift position in order

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.840
to type either a lowercase or capital letter
which were on the same typebar.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.870
Although the shift key we use on our keyboards
today does not cause the machine to shift

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140
mechanically, the name stuck.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.599
As the typewriter rose in popularity, people
stopped complaining about the weird arrangement

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.459
of keys and started memorizing the keyboard
and learning how to type efficiently.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.700
Although other alternate keyboards tried to
break onto the market, most people decided

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.329
to stay with the QWERTY board, and none of
the other type-writing machines proved successful.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.129
One prominent attempt at a replacement keyboard
occurred in the early 1930s when Professor

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.359
August Dvorak of Washington State University
set out to develop a more user-friendly keyboard.

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.870
He ultimately redesigned the keyboard so all
of the vowels and the five most commonly used

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.670
consonants were arranged on the home row (AOEUIDHTNS).

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.099
Although the design required a typist to frequently
alternate hands to type most words, with the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.130
Dvorak keyboard, a person could type approximately
400 of the English language’s most common

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.379
words just by using the keys of the home row,
compared to 100 words on the QWERTY keyboard.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.819
In addition, using the Dvorak keyboard, a
typist’s fingers would not have to travel

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.329
as far as they did on Sholes’ keyboard to
type the majority of words.

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.150
Dvorak set out to prove his machine superior
to Sholes’, but his keyboard never caught

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.150
on.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.340
Many of the studies used to test the effectiveness
of his keyboard were flawed or were deemed

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.930
a conflict of interest since Dvorak conducted
them himself.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.219
A U.S. General Services Administration study
in 1953 of Dvorak’s keyboard determined

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.959
it didn’t matter which keyboard was used.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.440
Experienced typists in either keyboard typed
at approximately the same speed, with variance

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.970
based more on their individual skill rather
than either keyboard design being superior

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.660
to the other in a larger samplesize or words.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.660
This ultimately killed the Dvorak keyboard
as the majority of people didn’t want to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.510
commit the time or resources it would take
to be trained on a new keyboard.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.140
Thus, the QWERTY keyboard persevered through
today and seemingly will continue to do so

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.780
for the foreseeable future.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.830
As Dr. Dvorak said, “Changing the keyboard
format is like proposing to reverse the Ten

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.870
Commandments and the Golden Rule, discard
every moral principle, and ridicule motherhood.”

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.830
Bonus Facts:
• Author Mark Twain was one of the first

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.440
people to purchase the early typewriter and
is probably the first author to submit a typed

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.919
manuscript to his publisher.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.480
• Frank McGurrin, a court stenographer from
Salt Lake City, is considered the first person

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.270
to master touch-typing on the QWERTY keyboard,
as opposed to the hunt-and-peck method most

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.350
at the time used.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.270
He rose to fame when he participated in typing
contests and demonstrations across the country

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.010
and caused people to take interest not only
in the QWERTY keyboard, but in mastering the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:37.560
touch-typing method.
