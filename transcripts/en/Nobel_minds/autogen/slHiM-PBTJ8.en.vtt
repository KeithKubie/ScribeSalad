that we did leading up to the idea of

that's at and then finished with some

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.650
that's at and then finished with some
 

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.680
that's at and then finished with some
mechanistic studies that have provided

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:26.690
mechanistic studies that have provided
 

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.230
mechanistic studies that have provided
some surprising new insight and how this

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.240
some surprising new insight and how this
 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.250
some surprising new insight and how this
actually occurs so why would you want to

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:33.260
actually occurs so why would you want to
 

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.899
actually occurs so why would you want to
use immunotherapy to treat cancer well I

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:34.909
use immunotherapy to treat cancer well I
 

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.839
use immunotherapy to treat cancer well I
think we all know now that the cancers

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:37.849
think we all know now that the cancers

started is that trying to target the

started is that trying to target the
 

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.940
started is that trying to target the
single causative mutations with targeted

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:06.950

small molecules always essentially leads

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.130
small molecules always essentially leads
 

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.540
small molecules always essentially leads
to relapse after response and that's

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:13.550
to relapse after response and that's
 

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.060
to relapse after response and that's
because there's so many mutations by the

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.070
because there's so many mutations by the
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.460
because there's so many mutations by the
time you target one there's already a

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:18.470
time you target one there's already a
 

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.530
time you target one there's already a
resistant mechanism which the tumor can

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:30.339
simple process and just keeping the
 

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:31.800
simple process and just keeping the
brakes on alerting the T cells keeps

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:31.810
brakes on alerting the T cells keeps
 

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.519
brakes on alerting the T cells keeps
running well we did this well anyway

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:35.529
running well we did this well anyway
 

00:13:35.529 --> 00:13:37.350
running well we did this well anyway
what that's shown on this cartoon in the

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360
what that's shown on this cartoon in the
 

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.389
what that's shown on this cartoon in the
right and there's there's a couple of

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399
right and there's there's a couple of
 

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.269
right and there's there's a couple of
features there that are that are very

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279
features there that are that are very
 

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.470
features there that are that are very
interesting when I first thought of this

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480
interesting when I first thought of this
 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.290
interesting when I first thought of this
one is that we're not retargeting the

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:46.300
one is that we're not retargeting the
 

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.180
one is that we're not retargeting the
immune system not the tumor cells so the

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.190
immune system not the tumor cells so the
 

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.500
immune system not the tumor cells so the
kind of cancer doesn't make any

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.510
kind of cancer doesn't make any
 

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.070
kind of cancer doesn't make any
difference

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.080
difference
 

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.390
difference
it shouldn't make any difference because

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.400
it shouldn't make any difference because
 

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.300
it shouldn't make any difference because
you know all tumors have neo antigens

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.310
you know all tumors have neo antigens
 

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.800
you know all tumors have neo antigens
and that really doesn't matter what kind

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:58.810
and that really doesn't matter what kind
 

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.360
and that really doesn't matter what kind
of cancer say we don't have to make a

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:00.370
of cancer say we don't have to make a
 

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.370
of cancer say we don't have to make a
new drug for every cancer cell it's a

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.380
new drug for every cancer cell it's a
 

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.220
new drug for every cancer cell it's a
universal therapy that could be

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.230
universal therapy that could be
 

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.420
universal therapy that could be
potentially used for any kind of cancer

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:06.430
potentially used for any kind of cancer
 

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.610
potentially used for any kind of cancer
and the second one is since it started

by cross priming you can take advantage

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:11.230
by cross priming you can take advantage
 

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:16.380
by cross priming you can take advantage
of that priming by death to use in

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:16.390
of that priming by death to use in

and so the idea of course is wonderful

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:33.610
and so the idea of course is wonderful
 

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.760

idea but does it work and so this just

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:35.770
idea but does it work and so this just
 

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.680

so when we got this result I was I was
 

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.200

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.330
median life expectancy after diagnosis
with with metastatic melanoma was 11

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.340
with with metastatic melanoma was 11
 

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.520
with with metastatic melanoma was 11
months so it was essentially a death

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.530
months so it was essentially a death
 

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.110
months so it was essentially a death
sentence and there was no drug that had

half years to complete and what you can

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000
half years to complete and what you can
 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.910
half years to complete and what you can
see here because this is the if you live

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920
see here because this is the if you live
 

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.190

control here and what you can see is
 

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.610
control here and what you can see is
removed the survival over about four

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620
removed the survival over about four
 

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.430
removed the survival over about four
months which would have been sufficient

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440
months which would have been sufficient
 

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.230
months which would have been sufficient
for FDA approval because no drug had

for FDA approval because no drug had
 

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.240
for FDA approval because no drug had
ever done that before but as you can see

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.250
ever done that before but as you can see
 

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.010
ever done that before but as you can see
here very interesting thing happens

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.020
here very interesting thing happens
 

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.110
here very interesting thing happens
between two and three years if the

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120
between two and three years if the
 

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.630
between two and three years if the
survival curve flattens out and stayed

00:16:59.630 --> 00:16:59.640
survival curve flattens out and stayed
 

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.250
survival curve flattens out and stayed
that way for the duration of the trial

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:01.260
that way for the duration of the trial
 

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.250
that way for the duration of the trial
which means basically nobody is dying of

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260
which means basically nobody is dying of
 

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.440
which means basically nobody is dying of
the disease after about three years and

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.450
the disease after about three years and
 

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.310
the disease after about three years and
so at my 2015 there was follow-up data

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:10.320
so at my 2015 there was follow-up data
 

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.620
so at my 2015 there was follow-up data
of several thousand patients what you

abalone and there's no reason to think
that it won't be and so I think we've

00:19:57.379 --> 00:19:57.389
that it won't be and so I think we've
 

00:19:57.389 --> 00:20:00.940
that it won't be and so I think we've

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080
any tumor of any histo type that has
 

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.100
any tumor of any histo type that has
defects and DNA damage repair and

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.110
defects and DNA damage repair and
 

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.380
defects and DNA damage repair and
consequently has high low levels of neo

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:51.390
consequently has high low levels of neo
 

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.780
consequently has high low levels of neo
antigens can be treated regardless of

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:53.790
antigens can be treated regardless of
 

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.940
antigens can be treated regardless of
what kind of cancer they are for that

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:55.950
what kind of cancer they are for that
 

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.380
what kind of cancer they are for that
the first time that's ever been approval

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.390
the first time that's ever been approval
 

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.380
the first time that's ever been approval
for a particular genetic defect and in a

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:00.390
for a particular genetic defect and in a
 

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.070
for a particular genetic defect and in a
class of tumors and so we're in a pretty

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080
class of tumors and so we're in a pretty
 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.600
class of tumors and so we're in a pretty
good setting we know a lot of tumors

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.610
good setting we know a lot of tumors
 

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.390
good setting we know a lot of tumors
respond not all and not all of them is

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400
respond not all and not all of them is
 

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.680
respond not all and not all of them is
high a fraction as we would like so to

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:12.690
high a fraction as we would like so to
 

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.690
high a fraction as we would like so to
go forward really in a rational way we

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700
go forward really in a rational way we
 

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.260
go forward really in a rational way we
need to know the cellular mechanism

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.270
need to know the cellular mechanism
 

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.260
need to know the cellular mechanism
molecular mechanisms of the effects so

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:21.270
molecular mechanisms of the effects so
 

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.330
molecular mechanisms of the effects so
that we can you know design the best way

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340
that we can you know design the best way
 

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.180
that we can you know design the best way
to combine things and develop strategies

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:26.190

some insight into what's going on and
 

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.420
some insight into what's going on and
I'm going to go through the details but

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:08.430
I'm going to go through the details but
 

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.560

so I'll just show you one brief thing

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700
so I'll just show you one brief thing
 

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.870
so I'll just show you one brief thing
about what how we've used this to study

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880
about what how we've used this to study
 

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.300

so this went to a phase 3 trial shown

00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:48.269
so this went to a phase 3 trial shown
 

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:50.419
so this went to a phase 3 trial shown
here which unfortunately failed there

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:50.429
here which unfortunately failed there
 

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:52.430
here which unfortunately failed there
was no real significant difference

cancers let's go to pre-surgical trial

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:13.169
cancers let's go to pre-surgical trial
 

00:23:13.169 --> 00:23:14.930
cancers let's go to pre-surgical trial
where the patients are given a couple of

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940
where the patients are given a couple of
 

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.590
where the patients are given a couple of
doses of this case if you live a man

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600
doses of this case if you live a man
 

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.680
doses of this case if you live a man
before they go to surgery and so these

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:21.690
before they go to surgery and so these
 

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.960
before they go to surgery and so these
were guys that were given two doses

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:23.970
were guys that were given two doses
 

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.320
were guys that were given two doses
before they went prostatectomy and so at

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:27.330
before they went prostatectomy and so at
 

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.090
before they went prostatectomy and so at
the time of surgery we get the whole

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100
the time of surgery we get the whole
 

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.119
the time of surgery we get the whole
organ you know - what the pathologist

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:32.129
organ you know - what the pathologist
 

00:23:32.129 --> 00:23:33.919
organ you know - what the pathologist
needs for diagnosis we got the whole

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:33.929
needs for diagnosis we got the whole
 

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:36.289
needs for diagnosis we got the whole
organ and for studies and we can pretty

a really powerful technique to get data

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:47.309
a really powerful technique to get data
 

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:51.440
a really powerful technique to get data
and so this is what we found on the left

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:51.450
and so this is what we found on the left
 

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.749

very sharply you know mass spec and so

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:58.409
very sharply you know mass spec and so
 

00:29:58.409 --> 00:30:00.409
very sharply you know mass spec and so
you can do up to forty three parameters

00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419
you can do up to forty three parameters
 

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:04.039
you can do up to forty three parameters
and so what we did was to use one for

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:04.049
and so what we did was to use one for
 

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:07.340

because we mix everything and analyze it

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039
because we mix everything and analyze it
 

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:15.919

just putting things which look more like
the cells in the grouping here and then

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:23.850
the cells in the grouping here and then
 

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.430
the cells in the grouping here and then
we can identify what those are by

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440
we can identify what those are by
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.940
we can identify what those are by
different markers and then we measure

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:28.950
different markers and then we measure
 

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.399
different markers and then we measure
different clusters of the frequency of

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:31.409
different clusters of the frequency of
 

00:30:31.409 --> 00:30:34.539
different clusters of the frequency of
the cells in different clusters and then

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:34.549
the cells in different clusters and then
 

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:37.970
the cells in different clusters and then
we keep track for every mouse that we

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980
we keep track for every mouse that we
 

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.859
we keep track for every mouse that we
look at we keep track of the size of the

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:39.869
look at we keep track of the size of the
 

00:30:39.869 --> 00:30:42.080
look at we keep track of the size of the
tumor when it was harvested and then we

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.090
tumor when it was harvested and then we
 

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.810
tumor when it was harvested and then we
can relate any particular changes that

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820
can relate any particular changes that
 

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.109
can relate any particular changes that
we see with the ones that the changes

00:30:48.109 --> 00:30:48.119
we see with the ones that the changes
 

00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:51.649
we see with the ones that the changes
that are important to the size of the

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659
that are important to the size of the
 

00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:57.019
that are important to the size of the
tumor and so the way that experiments

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:57.029
tumor and so the way that experiments
 

00:30:57.029 --> 00:31:00.739
tumor and so the way that experiments
done is that we give mice to MERS give

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:00.749
done is that we give mice to MERS give
 

00:31:00.749 --> 00:31:02.599
done is that we give mice to MERS give
them antibody different intervals and

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:02.609
them antibody different intervals and
 

00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:04.549
them antibody different intervals and
then take thirteen in the case of M

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559
then take thirteen in the case of M
 

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:05.000

going to show you just data on MC 38

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:09.990
going to show you just data on MC 38
 

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.200
going to show you just data on MC 38
which is a fairly high mutation load

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.210

these agents by themselves and but we

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760
these agents by themselves and but we
 

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.580
these agents by themselves and but we
also got the same results using a team

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:22.590
also got the same results using a team
 

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.150

are called B 16 B l6 which is very low

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.160
are called B 16 B l6 which is very low
 

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.110

in mutational load it's not affected by

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120
in mutational load it's not affected by
 

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.660
in mutational load it's not affected by
mono therapies with these antibodies so

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:32.670
mono therapies with these antibodies so
 

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.160
mono therapies with these antibodies so
we have to use a vaccine with it but the

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.170
we have to use a vaccine with it but the
 

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.030
we have to use a vaccine with it but the
results are the same with both of them

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.040
results are the same with both of them
 

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.590
results are the same with both of them
so this is what the the MC 38 tumor

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600
so this is what the the MC 38 tumor
 

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.530
so this is what the the MC 38 tumor

cells this is all TC for cells except

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.250
cells this is all TC for cells except
 

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.120
cells this is all TC for cells except
the ones to have Fox p3 and you can see

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.130
the ones to have Fox p3 and you can see
 

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.100
the ones to have Fox p3 and you can see
here there's an over-representation of

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.110
here there's an over-representation of
 

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.320
here there's an over-representation of
red dots so these cells are being

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.330
red dots so these cells are being
 

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.890
red dots so these cells are being
expanded by seats like for when you get

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:25.900
expanded by seats like for when you get
 

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.240
expanded by seats like for when you get
to the cd8 area here you can see that

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.250
to the cd8 area here you can see that
 

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.860
to the cd8 area here you can see that
overall there seems to be a big increase

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:31.870
overall there seems to be a big increase
 

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.240
overall there seems to be a big increase
with pd one but there are patches where

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.250
with pd one but there are patches where
 

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.110
with pd one but there are patches where
secretly four is expanding cells and so

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120
secretly four is expanding cells and so
 

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.410
secretly four is expanding cells and so
this is overall what's going on but what

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:43.420
this is overall what's going on but what
 

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.380
this is overall what's going on but what
you can do of course is do a fina graph

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:46.390
you can do of course is do a fina graph
 

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.990
you can do of course is do a fina graph
where you line up each cluster with all

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000
where you line up each cluster with all
 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.790
where you line up each cluster with all
the marker genes that they express so we

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:50.800
the marker genes that they express so we
 

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.040
the marker genes that they express so we
had all the marker genes from the major

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.050
had all the marker genes from the major
 

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.420
had all the marker genes from the major
cell surface antigens and

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:54.430
cell surface antigens and
 

00:33:54.430 --> 00:34:00.120
cell surface antigens and
differentiation transcription factors in

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:00.130
differentiation transcription factors in
 

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.780
differentiation transcription factors in
this panel and so just to make this

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:02.790
this panel and so just to make this
 

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.750
this panel and so just to make this
approachable or visible here we divided

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760
approachable or visible here we divided
 

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.300
approachable or visible here we divided
by cell time again no difference of the

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.310
by cell time again no difference of the

by cell time again no difference of the
NKT cells T regs there's two kinds

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:12.400
NKT cells T regs there's two kinds
 

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.760
NKT cells T regs there's two kinds
there's one kind that they all have Fox

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:14.770
there's one kind that they all have Fox
 

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.510
there's one kind that they all have Fox
p3 one has a maturation antigen called

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520
p3 one has a maturation antigen called
 

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.730
p3 one has a maturation antigen called
KLR g1 those cells and the smaller

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:23.740
KLR g1 those cells and the smaller
 

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.740
KLR g1 those cells and the smaller

population that are Caylor g1 negative
 

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.230
population that are Caylor g1 negative
you see here look like they're depleted

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240
you see here look like they're depleted
 

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.260
you see here look like they're depleted
by C too late for treatment if you look

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.270
by C too late for treatment if you look
 

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.940
by C too late for treatment if you look
at the cd4 effector cells there's

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:32.950
at the cd4 effector cells there's
 

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:35.430
at the cd4 effector cells there's
there's really two major populations

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440
there's really two major populations
 

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.290
there's really two major populations
there's these cells that I'm going to

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:37.300
there's these cells that I'm going to
 

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.850
there's these cells that I'm going to
talk a lot about these cells from the

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:38.860
talk a lot about these cells from the
 

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.110
talk a lot about these cells from the
rest of the lecture

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.120
rest of the lecture
 

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.330
rest of the lecture
these cells are th1 like would call them

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:42.340
these cells are th1 like would call them
 

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.420
these cells are th1 like would call them
th one like because they have t-bet and

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.430
th one like because they have t-bet and
 

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.640
th one like because they have t-bet and
so they make a lot of get'em interferon

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:47.650
so they make a lot of get'em interferon
 

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.310
so they make a lot of get'em interferon
and TNF alpha but they also have AI

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320
and TNF alpha but they also have AI
 

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.340
and TNF alpha but they also have AI
costs which is makes them a little bit

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.350
costs which is makes them a little bit
 

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.980
costs which is makes them a little bit
strange and I'll come back to what this

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:55.990
strange and I'll come back to what this
 

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:58.320
strange and I'll come back to what this
is a little bit later but those cells

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.330
is a little bit later but those cells
 

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.070
is a little bit later but those cells
are very strongly associated with

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:02.080
are very strongly associated with
 

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.140
are very strongly associated with
decrease in tumor size whereas this

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.150
decrease in tumor size whereas this
 

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.330
decrease in tumor size whereas this
other population which do it just looks

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:09.340
other population which do it just looks
 

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.420
other population which do it just looks
like an activated T so don't really do

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:12.430
like an activated T so don't really do
 

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.020
like an activated T so don't really do
anything

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.030
anything
 

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.030
anything
and then I activate a cd4 they don't

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040
and then I activate a cd4 they don't
 

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.390
and then I activate a cd4 they don't
really do anything with PD one what you

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400
really do anything with PD one what you
 

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.620
really do anything with PD one what you
see is a preference for

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:20.630
see is a preference for
 

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.810
see is a preference for
preferential increase and a subset of

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820
preferential increase and a subset of
 

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.470
preferential increase and a subset of
cd8 cells that have high PD one hi Tim

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480
cd8 cells that have high PD one hi Tim
 

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.560
cd8 cells that have high PD one hi Tim
three you're also high lag three so

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.570
three you're also high lag three so
 

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.900
three you're also high lag three so
these are what we call exhausted they're

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:32.910
these are what we call exhausted they're
 

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.250
these are what we call exhausted they're
terminally differentiated but they're

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260
terminally differentiated but they're
 

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.830
terminally differentiated but they're
also functionally exhausted they do not

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:36.840
also functionally exhausted they do not
 

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.890
also functionally exhausted they do not
divide left themselves but they're

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900
divide left themselves but they're
 

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.270
divide left themselves but they're
dividing here when you give a

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280
dividing here when you give a
 

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.940
dividing here when you give a
deceitfully and a PD one they start

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:43.950
deceitfully and a PD one they start
 

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.980
deceitfully and a PD one they start
dividing and these are also very

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:45.990
dividing and these are also very
 

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.650
dividing and these are also very
strongly associated with smaller tumor

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660
strongly associated with smaller tumor
 

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.850
strongly associated with smaller tumor
size but what is obvious from from these

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:52.860
size but what is obvious from from these
 

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.250
size but what is obvious from from these
data is that despite the fact that

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260
data is that despite the fact that
 

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.720
data is that despite the fact that
they've been treated with that a PD one

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:56.730
they've been treated with that a PD one
 

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.790
they've been treated with that a PD one
antibody they're still expressing PD one

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800
antibody they're still expressing PD one
 

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.280
antibody they're still expressing PD one
so if the antibody goes away these cells

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:01.290
so if the antibody goes away these cells
 

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.230
so if the antibody goes away these cells
are going to stop dividing again we

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240
are going to stop dividing again we
 

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.020
are going to stop dividing again we
haven't changed the phenotype at all and

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.030
haven't changed the phenotype at all and
 

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.150
haven't changed the phenotype at all and
this is also supported by some work from

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160
this is also supported by some work from
 

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.360
this is also supported by some work from
John wary who's shown there's epigenetic

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:11.370
John wary who's shown there's epigenetic
 

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.180
John wary who's shown there's epigenetic
changes in the PD one gene that lock it

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.190
changes in the PD one gene that lock it
 

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.800
changes in the PD one gene that lock it
on in these cells you can't do anything

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:15.810
on in these cells you can't do anything
 

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:19.340
on in these cells you can't do anything
about that and those are not increased

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.350
about that and those are not increased
 

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.860
about that and those are not increased
significantly by CSA for treatment then

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:21.870
significantly by CSA for treatment then
 

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.340
significantly by CSA for treatment then
there are cells here that or PD one

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:25.350
there are cells here that or PD one
 

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.930
there are cells here that or PD one
intermediate they also are terminally

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940
intermediate they also are terminally
 

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.300
intermediate they also are terminally
differentiated and if they express the

Omi's and civil other markers but

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:34.830
Omi's and civil other markers but
 

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.280
Omi's and civil other markers but
they're they're not exhausted and you

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.290
they're they're not exhausted and you
 

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.230
they're they're not exhausted and you
can see these are expanded by both seek

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240
can see these are expanded by both seek
 

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.750
can see these are expanded by both seek
to lay four and pd1 those also are

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760
to lay four and pd1 those also are
 

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.670
to lay four and pd1 those also are
strongly associated with decrease in

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680
strongly associated with decrease in
 

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.510
strongly associated with decrease in
tumor size and then there's these cells

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520
tumor size and then there's these cells
 

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.700
tumor size and then there's these cells
which look like naive t-cells again and

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:49.710
which look like naive t-cells again and
 

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.310
which look like naive t-cells again and
these cells which are they're expanded

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320
these cells which are they're expanded
 

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.890
these cells which are they're expanded
by CTA for as well then these cells

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900
by CTA for as well then these cells
 

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.660
by CTA for as well then these cells
which look like recently activated

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:56.670
which look like recently activated
 

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.050
which look like recently activated
t-cells and and they're actually

00:36:59.050 --> 00:36:59.060
t-cells and and they're actually
 

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.510
t-cells and and they're actually
associated with bigger tumor size so

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520
associated with bigger tumor size so
 

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.650
associated with bigger tumor size so
these are getting in the way of the

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660
these are getting in the way of the
 

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.810
these are getting in the way of the
responses so we've really got three

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820
responses so we've really got three
 

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.650
responses so we've really got three
populations one cd4 which is expanded

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660
populations one cd4 which is expanded
 

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.010
populations one cd4 which is expanded
just by seats left for one seat cd8

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020
just by seats left for one seat cd8
 

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.140
just by seats left for one seat cd8
which is expanded just by PD one and

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.150
which is expanded just by PD one and
 

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.180
which is expanded just by PD one and
then this group which expanded by both

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:17.190
then this group which expanded by both
 

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.610
then this group which expanded by both
that associated that those are the cells

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:19.620
that associated that those are the cells
 

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.900
that associated that those are the cells
that are playing the main role in

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:22.910
that are playing the main role in
 

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:27.950
that are playing the main role in
shrinkage of tumor cells and so it's

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960
shrinkage of tumor cells and so it's
 

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.320
shrinkage of tumor cells and so it's
just sort of summarizes that the

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:30.330
just sort of summarizes that the
 

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.330
just sort of summarizes that the
mechanist is very you know are different

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:33.340
mechanist is very you know are different
 

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.790
mechanist is very you know are different
and that may be why when you put these

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800
and that may be why when you put these
 

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.990
and that may be why when you put these
two things together

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000
two things together
 

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.790
two things together
everything works it works much better

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800
everything works it works much better
 

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.190
everything works it works much better
we're working on that now and have some

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200
we're working on that now and have some
 

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.940
we're working on that now and have some
data in review but measuring these

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:44.950
data in review but measuring these
 

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.890
data in review but measuring these
subtypes is a lot more informative than

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:46.900
subtypes is a lot more informative than
 

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.380

just measuring total cd4s and CD aids

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.390

it's a telling who's going to respond

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:52.530
it's a telling who's going to respond
 

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.450
it's a telling who's going to respond
and the other thing is that the

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:54.460
and the other thing is that the
 

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.000
and the other thing is that the
therapeutic details didn't really matter

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.010
therapeutic details didn't really matter
 

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.700
therapeutic details didn't really matter
in this experiment and so does this

00:37:59.700 --> 00:37:59.710
in this experiment and so does this
 

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.290
in this experiment and so does this
happen in humans well this is not

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.300

then measure just going a little bit

00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:55.339
then measure just going a little bit
 

00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:59.290
then measure just going a little bit
further away from it and measure what

00:43:59.290 --> 00:43:59.300
further away from it and measure what
 

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.540
further away from it and measure what
what cells are there until you get the

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:01.550
what cells are there until you get the
 

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.030
what cells are there until you get the
ones that are the farthest away from a

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040
ones that are the farthest away from a
 

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.070
ones that are the farthest away from a
starting point and so that enables you

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:06.080
starting point and so that enables you
 

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.680
starting point and so that enables you
to to tell the difference between cells

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:08.690
to to tell the difference between cells
 

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.839
to to tell the difference between cells
they might have differentiated from

the furthest difference that they can be
 

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.060
the furthest difference that they can be
from in this case normal t-cell so these

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:25.070
from in this case normal t-cell so these
 

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.490
from in this case normal t-cell so these
are the extreme cells that are the
