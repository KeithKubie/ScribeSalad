00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.900
Hi, my name is Andy and I'm a instructor

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.861
at Udacity. I worked with Sara and Ian and

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:10.790
Ngundega to help prepare this lesson and today I'm

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.390
going to deliver it for you. So, let's get

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.668
started. Up to this point you've familiarized yourself with

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:19.450
MapReduce, you've written some mapper code, some reducer code.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.960
And you probably have a decent understanding of what's

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.820
going on behind the scenes. But you might not

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.590
yet know when to use MapReduce to solve a

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.590
problem. And that's what we're going to try and get at

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.040
in this lesson. We're going to give you a bunch of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.280
problems to solve and actually, each of these problems has

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.170
been deliberately selected, because each of these problems actually

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.970
represents some larger class of problems. In reality, the problems

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.690
you're likely to run into on the job are going

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.820
to fall into one of these certain classes of problems,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.030
which is very convenient because it means you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560
can apply a sort of boiler plate solution, with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.720
some modifications. These boilerplate solutions we call design patterns,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.260
and they're really helpful. In this lesson we'll learn

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.350
about some of these design patterns, and we'll

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.070
practice using them on various problems. We're not going to

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.300
get into the details of where the patterns came

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.000
from, or why they look the way they do,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.830
but, at the very least, at the end of this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.360
lesson, you will have, well for one, you'll practice using these

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.090
patterns and you also have a resource. That you can always

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.460
come back to whenever you run into a problem that can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.380
be solved using one of these patterns. If this kind of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980
stuff is really interesting to you, you should definitely check out

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.500
a book called MapReduce Design Patterns. It's written by Donald Miner

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.680
and Adam Shook and it's really interesting. Anyways, let's get started.
