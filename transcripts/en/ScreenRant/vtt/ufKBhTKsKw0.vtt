00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.390
Some television programs are lucky enough
to have long runs on the air and become part

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.610
of the pop culture zeitgeist.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.180
Others aren’t so lucky.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.540
The really unfortunate are those that come
to our homes full of hope and promise, but

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.720
don’t even make it to multiple episodes.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.090
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 TV shows cancelled
after one episode.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
Heil Honey, I’m Home

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.580
Comedy is usually at its best when it has
an edge, and there aren’t many more controversial

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.050
topics than racial and ethnic humor.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.600
While audiences found a soft spot for the
likes of Archie Bunker, this British sitcom

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.090
went too far.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.930
Starring caricaturized versions of Adolf Hitler
and Eva Braun, the romantic couple sees their

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.950
happy life crumble around them when they become
neighbors to a Jewish couple.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.280
Hilarity obviously didn’t ensue, and it’s
easy to understand why there were problems

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.550
with the premise.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.079
Poking fun at the Third Reich is something
we enjoy, but it needs to be done tastefully

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.649
a la Mel Brooks.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.649
Osbournes Reloaded

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.800
The Osbourne family had one hit reality show,
but they couldn’t make it 2/2 with their

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.899
attempt at a variety show.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.839
Despite backing from American Idol producers,
Osbournes Reloaded couldn’t find an audience

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.460
and was panned by critics, who labeled it
as “Must-Flee TV.”

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.500
We love rocking out to Ozzy, but the sight
of seeing him do comedy sketches in drag and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.720
see members of the clan work “real jobs”
like fast food drive thru obviously didn’t

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.030
have much appeal.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.360
Poor ratings and concerns about the content
on network TV gave Fox no choice but to remove

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.350
it after the premiere episode aired.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.350
Dot Comedy

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.980
At the turn of the new millennium, people
were just beginning to understand the wonders

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.310
of the Internet, and television wanted in
on the party.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.869
Knowing that the world wide web could be a
breeding ground for humor and hijinks, ABC

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.360
green lit this series that would feature want-to-be
stars trying to go viral.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.090
The clip show was prophetic in its vision,
but network executives weren’t pleased with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.799
the low ratings, as the 4.1 million viewers
was a smaller total than the show Dot Comedy

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.140
replaced in the lineup.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.040
If only ABC had waited a few more years, they
might have had a real winner.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.450
Emily’s Reasons Why Not

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
It was big news when star Heather Graham made
the jump from movies to TV, and that’s the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.050
most memorable aspect of the short-lived sitcom
Emily’s Reasons Why Not.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.259
The main culprit was its unoriginal setup,
which saw Graham playing a self-help author

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.100
who comically couldn’t figure out the problems
in her own life.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.810
Bringing nothing new to the table, the show
was panned by critics and failed to draw in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.100
viewers despite a large amount of hype.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.430
With that reaction, ABC had plenty of answers
to the question “why not” when it came

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.520
to the fate of the episodes that were left
over.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.080
Quarterlife

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.910
Hollywood is full of portrayals of people
undergoing a midlife crisis, but quarterlife

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.350
can be just as terrifying.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.970
That was the idea behind NBC’s 2008 broadcast
version of a MySpace series.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.680
Though the web series was a hit that racked
up the hits, the television show couldn’t

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.360
attract a similar audience.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.950
The premiere episode got a dismal response
from viewers, with ratings lower than the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.300
Democratic Presidential debate happening at
the same time.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.019
It was an unheard of failure for the network,
who quickly canceled the show and sent the

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.490
remaining episodes to sister station Bravo.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.020
Shows not every phenomenon is a guaranteed
success.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.220
Secret Talents of the Stars

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.480
A celebrity may be famous for acting or singing,
but that doesn’t mean their skill set is

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.290
limited to a singular talent.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.420
CBS intended to show how gifted our favorite
stars were with an intended seven-week reality

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.840
competition featuring big names like Joe Frazier
and George Takei.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.990
Audiences even had the chance to vote from
home in the tournament, but they didn’t

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.990
take the bait.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.909
The concept was deemed too ridiculous by the
masses, and Secret Talents of the Stars was

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.370
pulled after the first episode aired.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.480
Our guess is nobody had the ability to turn
all TVs to the same channel during its airtime.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480
Co-Ed Fever

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.600
After the success of Animal House, everyone
wanted in on the frat comedy craze, but the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.170
genre wasn’t meant for network TV.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.959
One of the most infamous failures was this
short-lived CBS sitcom, which tried to showcase

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.240
the hysteria of guys being accepted to a formerly
all-girls college.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.069
Uninspired with its setup and character development,
Co-Ed Fever never even made its regularly

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.560
scheduled time slot.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.220
The special “preview night” episode that
aired was so low rated and trashed by critics,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.230
the network pulled the plug right there.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.720
But the series wasn’t a total loss.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.541
One of the sets found a second life as the
girl’s dormitory on the first season of

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.500
Facts of Life, so there’s that.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Breaking Boston

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.110
Usually, reality shows are designed for people
to make financial gains, but Mark Wahlberg

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.720
had a different idea when he launched Breaking
Boston.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.689
The show focused on four young women who were
working to improve their lives in Bean Town,

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.849
hoping for some personal fulfillment along
the way.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.500
It’s an intriguing setup for a show and
had the backing of one of Hollywood’s biggest

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500
stars, but those proved to be its only merits.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.050
Citing “underperformance,” A&amp;E pulled
it from its lineup after a single episode.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.280
America allegedly loves the story of blue
collar people turning things around, but this

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.080
one couldn’t resonate with enough people.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080
The Rich List

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.370
Billed as the most addicting game show since
Who Wants to be a Millionaire was in its prime,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.150
The Rich List turned out to be broke.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.080
Fox heavily promoted the program, especially
during their World Series coverage, but failed

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.650
to sell audiences on the hype.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.830
Premiering to low ratings, network executives
had no choice but to ax it after one show.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.050
The premise was revived in the GSN program
called The Money List, but that iteration

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.050
lasted only nine episodes.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.180
As much as audiences love watching game shows,
it’s clear that there’s a rule to decide

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.650
which ones make the cut and which ones go
home.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.690
Ford Nation

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.080
Thanks to highly publicized scandals, Toronto
mayor Rob Ford and his brother Doug were household

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.620
names, which of course meant they deserved
a TV show.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.770
Promoted as a weekly program that would air
Mondays, Ford Nation actually turned out to

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.360
be a ratings winner for the Sun News Network.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.560
Despite much interest, the show ended up being
too expensive for the fledgling channel to

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.970
produce, as the one episode that aired took
five hours to record and eight more to edit.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.490
Those involved now claim it was only meant
as a one-time deal, but they’re clearly

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.009
trying to save face.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.900
Those are our picks for TV shows that were
canceled after one episode.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.949
Are there any we missed?

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.220
Which shows do you wish got past the first
airing?
