and listen so that got me thinking about

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050
and listen so that got me thinking about
 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.960
and listen so that got me thinking about
it yeah and I had met some youtubers who

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970
it yeah and I had met some youtubers who
 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.610

that working on the Internet it never
 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.160
that working on the Internet it never
stops so we don't really having a tough

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.170
stops so we don't really having a tough
 

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.860
stops so we don't really having a tough
time bouncing life and work so it's

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870
time bouncing life and work so it's
 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.540
time bouncing life and work so it's
something that we love to do and so we

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:52.550
something that we love to do and so we
 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.550
something that we love to do and so we
so often are involved hooked onto the

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560
so often are involved hooked onto the
 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.750
so often are involved hooked onto the
Internet so that's one thing that is

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:55.760
Internet so that's one thing that is
 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.860
Internet so that's one thing that is
like sort of a challenge trying to

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:56.870
like sort of a challenge trying to
 

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.630
like sort of a challenge trying to
figure out you know when do we stop or

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:58.640
figure out you know when do we stop or
 

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.400

refreshing the page and sort of think
 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.630
refreshing the page and sort of think
okay like I should look at this tree

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:01.640
okay like I should look at this tree
 

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.180
okay like I should look at this tree
because it's prettier so that's one part

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.190
because it's prettier so that's one part
 

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.350

building the channel and starting to

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860
building the channel and starting to
 

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.280
building the channel and starting to
understand like the best way to make

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.290
understand like the best way to make
 

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.690
understand like the best way to make
these videos like the biggest challenge

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:10.700
these videos like the biggest challenge
 

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.150
these videos like the biggest challenge
was learning how people learn and I

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.160
was learning how people learn and I
 

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.410
was learning how people learn and I
think we but it was an amazing

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:14.420
think we but it was an amazing
 

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.850
think we but it was an amazing
experiment for us to like start from

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:15.860
experiment for us to like start from
 

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.460
experiment for us to like start from
ground zero

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.470
ground zero
 

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.410
ground zero
and not really be sure where it was

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:18.420
and not really be sure where it was
 

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.150
and not really be sure where it was
going and then see how some videos did

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160
going and then see how some videos did
 

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.710
going and then see how some videos did
better than the others and like

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720
better than the others and like
 

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.480
better than the others and like
understand how the best thumbnail works

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:23.490
understand how the best thumbnail works
 

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.330
understand how the best thumbnail works
or the best title works or whatever and

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340
or the best title works or whatever and
 

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.620
or the best title works or whatever and
from there just having that learning

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:27.630
from there just having that learning
 

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.820

what was the most shocking thing you
learned while researching the book well

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:20.229
learned while researching the book well
 

00:10:20.229 --> 00:10:23.009
learned while researching the book well
one thing that I personally learned

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:23.019
one thing that I personally learned
 

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:24.539
one thing that I personally learned
though that probably wasn't about the

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:24.549
though that probably wasn't about the
 

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:26.399
though that probably wasn't about the
actual research of it was that drawing

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:26.409
actual research of it was that drawing
 

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:28.229
actual research of it was that drawing
for a video which is really kinetic is

00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:28.239
for a video which is really kinetic is
 

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:29.429
for a video which is really kinetic is
much different than drawing for a book

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:29.439
much different than drawing for a book
 

00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:31.229
much different than drawing for a book

00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:47.789
but it was definitely hard yeah we did
like the whole design aspect of it was

00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:47.799
like the whole design aspect of it was
 

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:48.749

worked out but it was like it was
challenging but also must be kind of a

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:53.889
challenging but also must be kind of a
 

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:55.139
challenging but also must be kind of a
different dynamic because generally

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:55.149
different dynamic because generally
 

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:56.639
different dynamic because generally

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:24.539
like answer even more of those uh in the
book for all at once which is really

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:24.549
book for all at once which is really
 

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.069
book for all at once which is really
exciting for us so a lot of the video

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079
exciting for us so a lot of the video
 

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.319
exciting for us so a lot of the video
ideas come from like fans and viewers

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:28.329
ideas come from like fans and viewers
 

00:11:28.329 --> 00:11:30.569
ideas come from like fans and viewers
and stuff yeah he's actually yeah

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:30.579
and stuff yeah he's actually yeah
 

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:32.759
and stuff yeah he's actually yeah
exactly like pretty much every episode

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:32.769
exactly like pretty much every episode
 

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:34.319
exactly like pretty much every episode
we do have come from some sort of

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:34.329
we do have come from some sort of
 

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:35.639
we do have come from some sort of
suggestion whether or not it's like what

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:35.649
suggestion whether or not it's like what
 

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:37.169
suggestion whether or not it's like what
got our brain rolling some are

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:37.179
got our brain rolling some are
 

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:38.639
got our brain rolling some are
immediately just like oh that's it done

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:38.649
immediately just like oh that's it done
 

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:41.399
immediately just like oh that's it done
yeah thanks bloodbath but yeah like I

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:41.409
yeah thanks bloodbath but yeah like I
 

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.569
yeah thanks bloodbath but yeah like I
mean we wouldn't be able to do it

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:42.579
mean we wouldn't be able to do it
 

00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:43.919
mean we wouldn't be able to do it
because week after week we kind of have

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:43.929
because week after week we kind of have
 

00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:45.210
because week after week we kind of have
to go back to the drawing board and so

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:45.220
to go back to the drawing board and so
 

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.369
to go back to the drawing board and so
we need to take some inspiration

00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:47.379
we need to take some inspiration
 

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:49.049
we need to take some inspiration
and the whole point is to find like what

00:11:49.049 --> 00:11:49.059
and the whole point is to find like what
 

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:50.699
and the whole point is to find like what
is interesting to other people like we

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:50.709
is interesting to other people like we
 

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.710
is interesting to other people like we
only represent ourselves and so it's

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720
only represent ourselves and so it's
 

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.479
only represent ourselves and so it's
great just kind of get a sense of what

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:54.489
great just kind of get a sense of what
 

00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:55.799
great just kind of get a sense of what
does the world want to know and how can

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:55.809
does the world want to know and how can
 

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:57.149
does the world want to know and how can
we accommodate all these different

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:57.159
we accommodate all these different
 

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.439
we accommodate all these different
styles of learning and interest and

00:11:58.439 --> 00:11:58.449
styles of learning and interest and
 

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:00.569
styles of learning and interest and
whatnot and so it's essential for us to

00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:00.579
whatnot and so it's essential for us to
 

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:02.129
whatnot and so it's essential for us to
sort of hear from everyone out in the

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:02.139
sort of hear from everyone out in the
 

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.169
sort of hear from everyone out in the
world very nice now we're gonna move to

00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:04.179
world very nice now we're gonna move to
 

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.269
world very nice now we're gonna move to
Twitter which is one of gazaís it's like

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279
Twitter which is one of gazaís it's like
 

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:07.469
Twitter which is one of gazaís it's like
a Twitter than I have physically write

00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:07.479
a Twitter than I have physically write
 

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:08.489
a Twitter than I have physically write
it on a piece of paper which I thought

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:08.499
it on a piece of paper which I thought
 

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:10.400
it on a piece of paper which I thought
was interesting

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:10.410
was interesting
 

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.650
was interesting
Oh so alchemy five-four-three asks we

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660
Oh so alchemy five-four-three asks we
 

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.949
Oh so alchemy five-four-three asks we
were happy five four three good human

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959
were happy five four three good human
 

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:21.559

being uh uh who were your biggest

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:21.569
being uh uh who were your biggest
 

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:25.009
being uh uh who were your biggest
influences in science so Bill Nye was

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019
influences in science so Bill Nye was
 

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:26.420
influences in science so Bill Nye was
one which is crazy yeah for sure as a

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.430
one which is crazy yeah for sure as a
 

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.369
one which is crazy yeah for sure as a
young age definitely I we always talk

00:12:28.369 --> 00:12:28.379
young age definitely I we always talk
 

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:30.439
young age definitely I we always talk
about like we both had great high school

00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:30.449
about like we both had great high school
 

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.600
about like we both had great high school
biology teachers and I think that was

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:32.610
biology teachers and I think that was
 

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.400
biology teachers and I think that was
kind of like the starting point for us

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:34.410
kind of like the starting point for us
 

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.629
kind of like the starting point for us
and probably for many people to be

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639
and probably for many people to be
 

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:38.240
and probably for many people to be
interested in science and that's why we

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.250
interested in science and that's why we
 

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.470
interested in science and that's why we
talk about now like not everyone is

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480
talk about now like not everyone is
 

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.790
talk about now like not everyone is

day that's true that's definitely one of

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899
day that's true that's definitely one of
 

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:44.600
day that's true that's definitely one of
those questions that's like how do you

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:44.610
those questions that's like how do you
 

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.590
those questions that's like how do you
test that like Rick I was dying yeah I

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600
test that like Rick I was dying yeah I
 

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.120
test that like Rick I was dying yeah I
think it's an amazing part of life but

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.130
think it's an amazing part of life but
 

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.470
think it's an amazing part of life but
it's something that obviously yeah it's

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480
it's something that obviously yeah it's
 

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.030
it's something that obviously yeah it's
definitely like maybe perhaps one of the

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040
definitely like maybe perhaps one of the
 

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.410
definitely like maybe perhaps one of the
biggest questions but one thing I've

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420
biggest questions but one thing I've
 

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.400
biggest questions but one thing I've
heard about is that people have done

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:55.410
heard about is that people have done
 

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.600
heard about is that people have done
research where they're actually thinking

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.610
research where they're actually thinking
 

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.129
research where they're actually thinking
about how they can actually like use a

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139
about how they can actually like use a
 

00:13:58.139 --> 00:13:59.990
about how they can actually like use a
specific laser on your skin and like get

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000
specific laser on your skin and like get
 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.460
specific laser on your skin and like get
enough information to find out like when

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.470
enough information to find out like when
 

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.590
enough information to find out like when
biologically you would die which I would

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600
biologically you would die which I would
 

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.179
biologically you would die which I would
never want to know but I've been the

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:05.189
never want to know but I've been the
 

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:07.939
never want to know but I've been the
type of research yeah yeah I know they'd

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:07.949
type of research yeah yeah I know they'd
 

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:10.970
type of research yeah yeah I know they'd
like for you shake oh my god they're

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980
like for you shake oh my god they're
 

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.510
like for you shake oh my god they're
unhealthy how dare you sir

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:14.520
unhealthy how dare you sir
 

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.100
unhealthy how dare you sir
have you seen this no III think maybe be

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.110
have you seen this no III think maybe be
 

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.240
have you seen this no III think maybe be
worse instead of telling you like a

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.250
worse instead of telling you like a
 

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.830
worse instead of telling you like a
general years like oh you have ten more

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:21.840
general years like oh you have ten more
 

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.540
general years like oh you have ten more
years just say like you're gonna die in

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.550
years just say like you're gonna die in
 

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.670
years just say like you're gonna die in
a car accident I'm never getting in a

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680
a car accident I'm never getting in a
 

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.350
a car accident I'm never getting in a
car ever yeah

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360
car ever yeah
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.880
car ever yeah
but then it's like some of those weird

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:28.890
but then it's like some of those weird
 

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.140
but then it's like some of those weird
things where it's like could be getting

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.150
things where it's like could be getting
 

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.940
things where it's like could be getting
in a car being hit by a car and just

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:31.950
in a car being hit by a car and just
 

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.770
in a car being hit by a car and just
knows that yeah you just don't ever

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:33.780
knows that yeah you just don't ever
 

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.400
knows that yeah you just don't ever
leave I'm fine yeah we just never leave

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:36.410
leave I'm fine yeah we just never leave
 

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.420
leave I'm fine yeah we just never leave
we were told that that's why we never

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:38.430
we were told that that's why we never
 

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.360
we were told that that's why we never
like right yeah fair enough and that was

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:41.370
like right yeah fair enough and that was
 

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.070
like right yeah fair enough and that was
another one from Vanessa yeh does have

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.080
another one from Vanessa yeh does have
 

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.500
another one from Vanessa yeh does have
an answer hopefully is the same Vanessa

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:47.510
an answer hopefully is the same Vanessa
 

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.050
an answer hopefully is the same Vanessa
mm what do you think the most important

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
mm what do you think the most important
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.140
mm what do you think the most important
causes in the world that needs science

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.150
causes in the world that needs science
 

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.270
causes in the world that needs science
hmm that's a good one and if you need

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:56.280
hmm that's a good one and if you need
 

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.190
hmm that's a good one and if you need
science either you say really sassy like

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:58.200
science either you say really sassy like
 

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.770
science either you say really sassy like
real science one thing I think is a huge

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:00.780
real science one thing I think is a huge
 

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.990
real science one thing I think is a huge
issue is water and water accessibility I

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000
issue is water and water accessibility I
 

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.920
issue is water and water accessibility I
think that's something where I think

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:03.930
think that's something where I think
 

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.420
think that's something where I think
technology and science is going to be

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.430
technology and science is going to be
 

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.460
technology and science is going to be
extremely important for ensuring that

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:07.470
extremely important for ensuring that
 

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.020
extremely important for ensuring that
people around the world can get it and

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.030
people around the world can get it and
 

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.050
people around the world can get it and
Canada doesn't hog it all oh so I think

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060
Canada doesn't hog it all oh so I think
 

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.190
Canada doesn't hog it all oh so I think
that's something that's important I

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:13.200
that's something that's important I
 

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.080
that's something that's important I
think certainly just the idea of you

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.090
think certainly just the idea of you
 

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.970
think certainly just the idea of you
know exploration of space and making

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980
know exploration of space and making
 

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.590
know exploration of space and making
sure that we are adequately funding

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600
sure that we are adequately funding
 

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.810
sure that we are adequately funding
areas of science that are only going to

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820
areas of science that are only going to
 

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.250
areas of science that are only going to
further like our understanding of the

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260
further like our understanding of the
 

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.170
further like our understanding of the
world and hopefully lead to better

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180
world and hopefully lead to better
 

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.550
world and hopefully lead to better
understanding of how we can conserve

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560
understanding of how we can conserve
 

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.290
understanding of how we can conserve
water or technologies of technologies

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300
water or technologies of technologies
 

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.510
water or technologies of technologies
that will preserve it I think that's

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:29.520
that will preserve it I think that's
 

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.220
that will preserve it I think that's
probably like the fundamental aspect is

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.230
probably like the fundamental aspect is
 

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.840
probably like the fundamental aspect is
having people understand the importance

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:32.850
having people understand the importance
 

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.610
having people understand the importance
of research and just science in general

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620
of research and just science in general
 

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.860
of research and just science in general
is like key to all of the things that

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:36.870
is like key to all of the things that
 

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.480
is like key to all of the things that
matter yeah well luckily I mean you guys

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.490
matter yeah well luckily I mean you guys
 

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.400
matter yeah well luckily I mean you guys
are kind of doing that right with you to

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.410
are kind of doing that right with you to
 

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.070
are kind of doing that right with you to
try and use ooh yeah I think science is

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.080
try and use ooh yeah I think science is
 

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.870
try and use ooh yeah I think science is
becoming very popular in pop culture and

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880
becoming very popular in pop culture and
 

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.610
becoming very popular in pop culture and
that is really important yeah I mean it

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.620
that is really important yeah I mean it
 

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.170
that is really important yeah I mean it
is an interesting thing a quick little

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180
is an interesting thing a quick little
 

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.540
is an interesting thing a quick little
side note sorry tangents like on tangent

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:49.550
side note sorry tangents like on tangent
 

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.790
side note sorry tangents like on tangent
is that science is kind of cool now like

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800
is that science is kind of cool now like
 

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.620
is that science is kind of cool now like
it's it's cool to be curious cuz

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:54.630
it's it's cool to be curious cuz
 

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.940
it's it's cool to be curious cuz
everyone is just is inherently curious

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:55.950
everyone is just is inherently curious
 

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.320
everyone is just is inherently curious
we just want to find out the answers to

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.330
we just want to find out the answers to
 

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.360
we just want to find out the answers to
interesting questions mm-hmm decision to

00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.370
interesting questions mm-hmm decision to
 

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.940
interesting questions mm-hmm decision to
see that kind of be revitalized in

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:01.950
see that kind of be revitalized in
 

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.840
see that kind of be revitalized in
people

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:02.850
people
 

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.270
people
yeah I agree like we do sometimes

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.280
yeah I agree like we do sometimes
 

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.740
yeah I agree like we do sometimes
wonderful bias because we are so

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750
wonderful bias because we are so
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.030
wonderful bias because we are so
obsessed with science and talk but all

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040
obsessed with science and talk but all
 

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.920
obsessed with science and talk but all
the time but we do see it a lot do we

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:09.930
the time but we do see it a lot do we
 

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.600
the time but we do see it a lot do we
realize that you know science has become

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:11.610
realize that you know science has become
 

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.220
realize that you know science has become
really popular for a lot of young people

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.230
really popular for a lot of young people
 

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.390
really popular for a lot of young people
who watch our videos I mean they're

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:14.400
who watch our videos I mean they're
 

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.190
who watch our videos I mean they're
taking their free time watching it and

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:16.200
taking their free time watching it and
 

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.900
taking their free time watching it and
falling in love with this science and

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:17.910
falling in love with this science and
 

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.610
falling in love with this science and
curiosity so I do think there is

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620
curiosity so I do think there is
 

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.110
curiosity so I do think there is
something there and the dress was an

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120
something there and the dress was an
 

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.650
something there and the dress was an
example for us of laughs

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:23.660
example for us of laughs
 

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.439
example for us of laughs
did you see black and blue yeah it's

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:27.449
did you see black and blue yeah it's
 

00:16:27.449 --> 00:16:29.720
did you see black and blue yeah it's
like what was that real quick well show

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:29.730
like what was that real quick well show
 

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.069
like what was that real quick well show
of hands was it black or blue white and

00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079
of hands was it black or blue white and
 

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.499
of hands was it black or blue white and
gold in your light white and gold we see

00:16:33.499 --> 00:16:33.509
gold in your light white and gold we see
 

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:35.389
gold in your light white and gold we see
white and gold no Oh whew look at you

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399
white and gold no Oh whew look at you
 

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.230
white and gold no Oh whew look at you
still brave you're very brave you like

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240
still brave you're very brave you like
 

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.030
still brave you're very brave you like
you're in far betray me good yeah that

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040
you're in far betray me good yeah that
 

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.139
you're in far betray me good yeah that
was an interesting experience to

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:42.149
was an interesting experience to
 

00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:43.249
was an interesting experience to
understand how you can connect with

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259
understand how you can connect with
 

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:44.720
understand how you can connect with
people like a pop culture thing can be

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:44.730
people like a pop culture thing can be
 

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.879
people like a pop culture thing can be
assigned same I mean we like to call our

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:46.889
assigned same I mean we like to call our
 

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:48.109
assigned same I mean we like to call our
channel sometimes like the gateway drug

00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:48.119
channel sometimes like the gateway drug
 

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:50.689
channel sometimes like the gateway drug
to science so finding those elements of

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699
to science so finding those elements of
 

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:52.160
to science so finding those elements of
like that pop culture element that gets

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:52.170
like that pop culture element that gets
 

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.449
like that pop culture element that gets
the whole world interested and then

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459
the whole world interested and then
 

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:55.879
the whole world interested and then
using science as a way to explain those

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:55.889
using science as a way to explain those
 

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:57.710
using science as a way to explain those
things and get interested in more into

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720
things and get interested in more into
 

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.419
things and get interested in more into
science is like important time yeah like

00:16:59.419 --> 00:16:59.429
science is like important time yeah like
 

00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:00.980
science is like important time yeah like
what not happened we were like this is

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:00.990
what not happened we were like this is
 

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.929
what not happened we were like this is
it Mitch this is our calling like the

00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:02.939
it Mitch this is our calling like the
 

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.240
it Mitch this is our calling like the
Demi Lovato was like explain the science

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.250
Demi Lovato was like explain the science
 

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.240
Demi Lovato was like explain the science
let's do this drink some coffee and we

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.250
let's do this drink some coffee and we
 

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.120
let's do this drink some coffee and we
did that was an all-nighter like you it

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.130
did that was an all-nighter like you it
 

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.130
did that was an all-nighter like you it
was an all-nighter yeah there was a

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140
was an all-nighter yeah there was a
 

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.779
was an all-nighter yeah there was a
moment where we had been like on the

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:14.789
moment where we had been like on the
 

00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:16.130
moment where we had been like on the
couch we both saw blue bag we're like

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140
couch we both saw blue bag we're like
 

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.510

you want to use that format as a way to
get science across well we knew we

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:05.950
get science across well we knew we
 

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.710
get science across well we knew we
wanted the science to come first and we

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720
wanted the science to come first and we
 

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.810
wanted the science to come first and we
wanted it to see we know that science

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:09.820
wanted it to see we know that science
 

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.220
wanted it to see we know that science
can be really intimidating for people

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.330
started a second channel East I thought
where we actually talk more about pop

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:21.340
where we actually talk more about pop
 

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.830
where we actually talk more about pop
culture and social justice and other

things that were interesting because we

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.100
things that were interesting because we
 

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.100
things that were interesting because we
like things outside of sine um we

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
like things outside of sine um we
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.110
like things outside of sine um we
started vlogging our lives you can now

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120
started vlogging our lives you can now
 

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.200
started vlogging our lives you can now
watch all of our lies yeah for us it's

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.210
watch all of our lies yeah for us it's
 

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.540
watch all of our lies yeah for us it's
just like bigger and better questions

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:33.550
just like bigger and better questions
 

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.310
just like bigger and better questions
like what else are people curious about

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320
like what else are people curious about
 

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.530
like what else are people curious about
what are new ways that we can get people

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:37.540
what are new ways that we can get people
 

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.290
what are new ways that we can get people
to learn so maybe that steps outside of

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.300
to learn so maybe that steps outside of
 

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.150

science is about evolution and

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720
science is about evolution and
 

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.570
science is about evolution and
innovation so innately we have to keep

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:55.580
innovation so innately we have to keep
 

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.090
innovation so innately we have to keep
evolving and then perfect well I think

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.100
evolving and then perfect well I think
 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.299
evolving and then perfect well I think
it's an innovating I if we could I'd

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:01.309
it's an innovating I if we could I'd

you got it okay so there are a few
 

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:18.950
you got it okay so there are a few
factors at play with this phenomenon but

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960
factors at play with this phenomenon but
 

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.539
factors at play with this phenomenon but
the mere-exposure effect may be the

the mere-exposure effect may be the
 

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:22.279
the mere-exposure effect may be the
biggest simply put we all have a
