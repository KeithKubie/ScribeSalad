the research on demand system was done

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
the research on demand system was done
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050
the research on demand system was done
in the late 1970s and much of his work

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
in the late 1970s and much of his work
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.120
in the late 1970s and much of his work
in

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130
in
 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.830
in
on the a great relationship between

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.310
latter part of the 1980s and from 90s
forward he has done a lot of work on on

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
forward he has done a lot of work on on
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.760
forward he has done a lot of work on on
developing economics it is still active

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
developing economics it is still active
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.960
developing economics it is still active
research is still a very active

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
research is still a very active
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.720
research is still a very active
researcher very much so more findings to

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730
researcher very much so more findings to
 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.400
researcher very much so more findings to
look forward to I probably thinks it

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410
look forward to I probably thinks it
 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.100
look forward to I probably thinks it
okay as the politics just anything to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
okay as the politics just anything to
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.290
okay as the politics just anything to
learn from this kind of research yeah I

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300
learn from this kind of research yeah I
 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
learn from this kind of research yeah I
think us as policymakers you have a lot

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
think us as policymakers you have a lot
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.870
think us as policymakers you have a lot
to learn from this research I think all

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880
to learn from this research I think all
 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.420
to learn from this research I think all
three of his core contributions have a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
three of his core contributions have a
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910
three of his core contributions have a
direct link to policies or demand system

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
direct link to policies or demand system
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.400
direct link to policies or demand system
is a tool you can do to evaluate

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
is a tool you can do to evaluate
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.440
is a tool you can do to evaluate
different types of economic policy

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
different types of economic policy
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.860
different types of economic policy
proposals like changes in taxes there's

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
proposals like changes in taxes there's
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.630
proposals like changes in taxes there's
work on an aggregate income and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
work on an aggregate income and
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.330
work on an aggregate income and
consumption you know it's an important

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
consumption you know it's an important
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.650
consumption you know it's an important
issue when it comes to stabilization

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
issue when it comes to stabilization
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.740

understanding individual behavior is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490
understanding individual behavior is
 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.910
understanding individual behavior is
virtually important find this work on

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
virtually important find this work on
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.760
virtually important find this work on
poverty had a large impact how you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
poverty had a large impact how you
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.530
poverty had a large impact how you
actually go about you measure poverty in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540
actually go about you measure poverty in
 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.290
actually go about you measure poverty in
many developing countries it's the press

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
many developing countries it's the press
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.120
many developing countries it's the press
about consumption as the ordinary

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
about consumption as the ordinary
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.530
about consumption as the ordinary
consumer and thing to learn about this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
consumer and thing to learn about this
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.170
consumer and thing to learn about this
like you and me I think we do first of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
like you and me I think we do first of
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.540
like you and me I think we do first of
all I think we do because we care about

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
all I think we do because we care about
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.930
all I think we do because we care about
the welfare of poor individuals of poor

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
the welfare of poor individuals of poor
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.700
the welfare of poor individuals of poor
households in developing countries and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
households in developing countries and
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.560
households in developing countries and
in order to do anything about that we

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
in order to do anything about that we
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.780
in order to do anything about that we
need to measure see how many they are

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
need to measure see how many they are
 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.520
need to measure see how many they are
and where they live and what you can do

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530
and where they live and what you can do
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.130
and where they live and what you can do
about it but of course also when we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
about it but of course also when we
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.720
about it but of course also when we
think about government's changing

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
think about government's changing
 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.690
think about government's changing
various economic policies I think it's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
various economic policies I think it's
 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.910
various economic policies I think it's
important for us to know how it will

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
important for us to know how it will
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.870
important for us to know how it will
affect our welfare was it hard to make

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
affect our welfare was it hard to make
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.170
affect our welfare was it hard to make
the decision this year this is only my

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
the decision this year this is only my
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.060
the decision this year this is only my
second year in the committee so I don't

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070
second year in the committee so I don't
 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.660
second year in the committee so I don't
have so much to compare with but it's

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670
have so much to compare with but it's
 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.620
have so much to compare with but it's
it's a long process so but I think we're

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
it's a long process so but I think we're
 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.210
it's a long process so but I think we're
in the end we were very much in

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
in the end we were very much in
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.410
in the end we were very much in
agreement that this was a very good

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
agreement that this was a very good
