00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.289
When people started leaving comments asking me t.   Yeeeee o mix dry ice with liquid nitrogen at first

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.939
I thought it was a joke, [but] [then] as the comments continued and continued and continued

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.880
I started to realize that this is a real thing so today

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.119
We're going to try mixing dry ice with liquid nitrogen just to satisfy your curiosity

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.688
And see what happens [you] [already] know that dry ice is just a solid chunk of carbon [dioxide] that's extremely cold at minus

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.639
109 degrees Fahrenheit on the other hand Liquid nitrogen is just liquefied nitrogen gas

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.320
This stuff is minus

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.059
321 degrees Fahrenheit this means the difference in temperature between dry ice and Liquid nitrogen is the same difference in temperature [between]

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.109
boiling hot water and a frozen chunk of ice for this experiment

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.509
I've got the liquid nitrogen sitting in the thermos and that allows it to cool down to where it's happy and very calm

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.860
So if we drop in a piece of dry ice now what kind of reaction would you expect to take place?

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.219
The Liquid nitrogen boils and the dry ice becomes even colder. Let's just reach down in there and see if we can pull it out

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.809
Now the cool thing about this dry ice it has been cryogenically reduced to the temperature of liquid nitrogen

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.110
So instead of being minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit this block of dry ice is now about minus 321 Fahrenheit

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.750
This is amazing. It's actually boiled out most of the nitrogen

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.309
Which of these do you [think] is more dense, [dry] ice or liquid nitrogen?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.469
In other words if I drop dry ice into a glass of liquid nitrogen will it sink or will it float [I]?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.659
Don't see it floating on the top there. Let's add a few more chunks just to be sure

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.799
Yep, I can hear that sinking right to the bottom

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.390
It's really cool. How it [mists] for just a second and then the mist completely disappears?

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.500
And that's because the liquid nitrogen is cooling the dry ice down to cryogenic temperatures

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.389
So we can see the dry ice is more dense than liquid nitrogen because it sinks to the bottom

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.019
Therefore a cold drink cheers, just joking just joking

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.930
for this experiment

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.450
I have two identical bowls of water and two identical chunks of dry ice except the ones been soaked in liquid nitrogen

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.570
The other one hasn't if we drop them at the exact same time into two separate dishes. How are they going to react?

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.879
You can see that both two bowls are reacting about the same. They're producing the same amount of vapor

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.449
They're bubbling at about the same rate. They're both popping off cool little smoke rings

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.630
which is like my favorite part that doesn't really surprise me so much the question is going to be which one lasts longer will the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.969
Colder block of dry ice Outlast the untreated piece

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.880
Now this has been running for about five minutes, and you can see the bowl with the liquid nitrogen treated

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.209
Dry ice actually still has a thicker vapor there was enough cold in the first bowl to keep the reaction going a little bit longer

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.390
we all know that when you drop dry ice into water it forms an

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.268
Amazing missing fog that just seems to flow out of the water

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.599
[so] will it do the same thing with liquid nitrogen for this first experiment?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.939
Let's drill two holes into the same block of dry ice

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.819
We'll put liquid nitrogen in one hole and water in the other and observe the results all right here. We go liquid nitrogen

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.109
it's amazing to think about but the [dryest] is actually so hot right now that when we add the liquid nitrogen it boils it and

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.548
Vaporizes it just an instant, and that's why we're getting the fog flowing off that we are all right

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.049
We got that thing Chock full of liquid nitrogen. Let's add water to the other side and [desert] the difference. [oh]

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.880
That's so cool our block of dry ice is blowing smoke rings

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.100
Now if you notice the liquid [nitrogen] is completely vaporized dry ice is so cold

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.229
It'll freeze water solid but at the same time it's so hot it'll boil off liquid nitrogen

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.519
All water does is cool down to the point where it eventually crystallize and turn into ice

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.399
That's how you make carbonated ice cubes

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.940
This is reaction. I didn't expect

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.839
here's a regular chunk of dry ice try punching that and you end up with sore knuckles Soak the dry ice and liquid [nitrogen] and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.590
It pulverizes without problem. I was not expecting that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.680
That's cool. I'm gonna do that again

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.689
Okay, let's go throw the stuff in the bathtub this dry ice has just been frozen in [liquid] nitrogen

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.299
[we're] going to throw it into the tub here and see what happens

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.769
Okay, that was cool, [but] it feels a little bit weak. Let's dump the rest of it in there

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.359
This is cool our bathtub has just disappeared

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.809
[and] like stings your face when you breathe it

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.599
So what happens when you dip dry ice and liquid nitrogen? Well you get a pretty cool reaction and very very cold dry ice

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.580
So there you have it [guys] now. You know what happens if you put dry ice in liquid nitrogen

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.749
[thanks] for joining me for this experiment today. I'll be looking for in the next video. Talk to you then

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.330
And then through the whole batch into a bathtub full of extremely warm water [oh]

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.619
Dude look at the way that shattered apparently liquid nitrogen frozen dry ice becomes a lot more brittle as well

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.020
whoa

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.020
Oh my goodness

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.280
Okay, that's worthy to [note]
