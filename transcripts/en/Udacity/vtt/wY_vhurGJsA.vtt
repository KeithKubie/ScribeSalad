00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now for the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Indeed, I gave a hint right within the story.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"Battery" is the correct answer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
After 3 hours, my battery had run out.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Which means that until then, I had worked on battery power.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In order to recharge my battery, I reconnected to AC power.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it turned out that it was this difference that caused the program to fail.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When my laptop ran on AC power, which was precisely the configuration

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with which everything was installed,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the program worked just fine.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If it ran on a battery, however, the program failed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It turned out that my laptop ran slower when running on batteries.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This saved energy, but also introduced interesting timeout errors.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I made a mental note to fix this as soon as we got home,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and of course, I gave the demo on AC power

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to make sure that all our tests were not in vain.
