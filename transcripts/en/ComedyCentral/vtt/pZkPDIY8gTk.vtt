00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.140
- Alright, our first headline is in the

00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:05.340
auto racing world.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.280
- NASCAR.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.750
- Daytona 500.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.070
You know they kick off the season

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.450
with like their biggest race,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.980
and a massive crash which
took out about half the race.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.720
Twenty two drivers in all were taken out,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.350
with about nine laps left.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.070
- Massive crash at Daytona.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.773
Erica play the clip one more time.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.440
(imitating crashing sound)

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.680
You can hear that it was,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.690
I mean it was a crazy crash.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.620
How many cars Greg?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.453
- 21

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:33.160
- 21 out of 50.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.330
50 cars started the race,
21 involved in that crash,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.460
and at the time I think ten of them

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.610
were even off before that.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.730
So that's more than
half of the competitors

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.890
out with one turn.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.960
I love that.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.060
I wish that happened in more sports.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.640
Imagine if like on one play in the NFL

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.080
half the players got hurt.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.970
Half the players had
season ending injuries

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.970
on just one play.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.800
It would be like the equivalent

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.660
I think of, as Hines Ward's kickoff return

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.450
in the Dark Knight Rises,
when the entire field

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.240
collapses behind him, and both teams,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.780
everyone on the field dies,
except for Hines Ward.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.503
The deadliest play in NFL history.

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:15.600
I think more sports should have

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.110
this sort of catastrophic possibility.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.370
- When you have the threat of
potential death at all times,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.630
doesn't it make the actual
event more meaningful?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.670
You feel the meaning.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.570
That's why older people
often say, as long as they

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630
don't get the penis cancer,
the end of their life

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.220
is some of the happiest,
'cause they're aware,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.530
at any moment, that it
could have all been over,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.620
and you appreciate it more.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.980
- Yeah, I didn't really take that angle.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.310
I just thought it's more
fun to watch if like,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.660
like an MMA fighter or boxing
fight, there's a chance

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.140
that it could go 12 rounds,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.360
there's a chance that it
could be over in five seconds

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.630
you know, if someone gets knocked out.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.000
And I wish they had that in more sports.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.020
Like I think, in basketball,
they should blind the players.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.810
That way, you could just slam
into someone and it's over.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.290
You could run into the
backboard, you could run

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.510
into the stands by
mistake and kill yourself

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.950
and that would be the end of the game.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.980
And that would be so much
more fun to watch the game.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.060
- Wait, how would they blind
them, what do you mean?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.860
With like, throwing stuff in their eyes

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.280
or they would have a blindfold, or what?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070
- I think you'd wanna make it permanent

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.410
once you get to the NBA level.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.910
Like, in high school you
would blindfold them,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.360
in college you would probably
throw something in their eyes

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.150
that would blind them for periods of time,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.040
and then when you get to the
NFL, you gotta pluck 'em out.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.740
You gotta take 'em with a spoon
like in Slumdog Millionaire.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.810
- Oh yeah. Eugh.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.749
- You'd Slumdog Millionaire 'em.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.420
And then I think the NBA
would be more popular.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.580
You'd get to your seat
before the game started,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.207
'cause you're like, "I don't
know how long this is gonna go.

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:41.927
"I paid a lot of money for these tickets

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.120
"and I don't know what's up."

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.030
Let's say baseball, if
when you swung the bat,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.230
you had to let go of it.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.980
Like, you had to let
go of it on your swing.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.070
Think about how much more exciting

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.013
major league baseball would be.

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.010
How long is the pitcher gonna pitch?

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.090
Could be one pitch, could be
the whole game, you don't know,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.710
'cause the bat's coming at him.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.620
- I like how they, the
announcers, all took it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.530
totally in stride.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.660
I mean, they were kinda like,
"wow, this is a big one!"

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.800
They were calling it a big one,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.580
and there was a little bit of silence,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.777
and then the guy was just like,

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.477
"well, that ruined everything."

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.450
They weren't worried at all
about the safety of the drivers

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.680
or anything, 'cause
that's part of the sport.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.200
- Well, if you heard the crash,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.320
I think you got all the
information you needed.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.040
You didn't have to hear the
announcers pontificate about it.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.713
Erica, play the crash again.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.060
(imitating crashing noises)

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.880
Yeah, when you hear something like that,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.010
what are the announcers gonna do?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.510
How are you gonna add to that?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.620
You can't, unless you
go back and talk about

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.857
Hines Ward's kickoff.

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.240
(laughing)

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.100
The deadliest play in the NFL.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.170
I think that's a lot of the
reason why they're trying

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.580
to get rid of the kickoff.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.030
You know, a lot more touchbacks now.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.568
- Because of Hines Ward?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.300
- Because of the teammates
Hines lost that day.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.007
- Right. When they run
the stats and it's like,

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.357
"oh, the average fatalities
on kickoff returns

00:04:03.357 --> 00:04:05.900
"are way higher than any other play."

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.340
But that's all just Hines Ward.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.750
- And just after that
play is when they executed

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.470
a nuclear physicist right on the field,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.596
in front of everyone.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.580
(laughter)

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.180
Which, you know, I think
the NFL needs more of that.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.390
- Tennis legend Martina Navratilova

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.370
was in the news this
week, by writing an op ed

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.960
in the Sunday Times in London, saying that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.690
it's insane and cheating
for transgender women

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.870
to compete in sports.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.690
So, olympics, bicycles, anything.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.390
- Never in my life did I
think Martina Navratilova

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.090
would speak out against trans people.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.122
If anyone has an ally, you would think

00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:48.360
it would be Martina
Navratilova, who is, you know,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.793
a woman, but could pass
for trans, let's say.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.903
She could make it.

00:04:53.903 --> 00:04:57.600
Her speaking out, it's the last
person I would ever expect,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.010
and I love when people
speak out against things

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.250
that won't affect them,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.830
and could not possibly affect them ever.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.443
Like, Martina Navratilova
does not compete any more.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.870
Why is she talking about this at all?

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.020
And let's go to what she
said, that trans people

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.510
competing in any sport, or in tennis,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.930
is insane and cheating.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.040
Is it cheating?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.850
Yes, but so is using a racket,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.478
and everyone turns a blind eye to that.

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:26.430
(laughing)

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.630
Is it insane?

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.130
Again, I'm gonna have to agree with her.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.570
That in today's day and
age, I think trans people

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.670
have better things to do than play tennis.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.500
That if I had a trans daughter or son,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.200
I would not let them play tennis.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.240
I would have more
activities for them to do.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.080
- Like what?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.090
- Hockey.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.710
I think the trans community
could excel at hockey.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.603
I think the trans community
would be great at soccer.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.850
I think the trans community--

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.557
- You're going through the
names of sports that you know.

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:04.557
- ... could dominate the
NFL, if they chose to.

00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:10.580
I think they'd be really
good at swimming, diving.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.810
I think running.
- You're still going.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.580
- I think track and field, pole vault.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.170
But tennis?

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.840
Get the fuck out of my face.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.760
- The topic didn't even come
up, having to do with tennis.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.110
It had to do with the
cyclist that she randomly

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.850
decided to back.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.680
You know the microphone is picking up you

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.530
opening the turkey jerky bag, Anthony.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.847
I mean, talk about dropping
the ball (laughing)

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.490
and professionalism.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.300
- When I wanna show disrespect,
I eat while I'm working.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.330
It's strictly for disrespect.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.030
- I mean, it worked.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.230
She was talking about a cyclist,
but my favorite thing was,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.020
she kinda got caught up in
this by saying this wasn't fair

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.020
back in October, and
she says, then she spent

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.750
the ensuing months researching the topic

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.390
so that she could be better suited

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.990
to write this opinion piece.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.630
Which, I love the image
of Martina Navratilova

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.080
spent the last three months
just researching trans topic,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.750
and she got deep into
it, in terms of hormones,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.350
and men have muscle and bone density,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.490
and they can't measure that.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.640
It's like, don't you have
something better to do?

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.930
- Now the story's getting stranger.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.360
This sounds to me like she got caught

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.470
looking at trans porn
and tried to cover it up

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.433
by bailing notices for a research project.

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:32.266
(laughing)

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:34.570
And then they're like,
"wait, we just did chicken."

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.477
She was like, "let me
say something and just

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:38.837
"get it out of the way
before I get embarrassed."

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.650
Yeah, wasn't, in the '70s or something,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.350
there was a trans woman
or guy who ran a race

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.957
or did something, and they were like,

00:07:48.957 --> 00:07:53.957
"oh, men are going to become
trans so they can win medals."

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.880
And that never happened.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.020
Like, no one has that priority.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.680
- Right. Renee Richards,
who played tennis,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.460
I believe was kind of
the first famous trans.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.293
- Yeah, it was tennis.

00:08:05.293 --> 00:08:06.126
- It was tennis.

00:08:06.126 --> 00:08:09.250
I think there was a 30 for 30 on it.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.660
But yeah, that whole thing sounds very,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.340
and you know, she's
been called transphobic,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.900
that her big argument was that,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.900
what's to stop a man from doing it,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.860
and then they get the trophies,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.750
and then they change their
mind and make some babies.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.210
Then they can go back to wanting

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.101
to be a woman and make babies.

00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:32.980
That's a long way to go.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.730
- And also, imagine that person,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.973
that has no bragging rights what-so-ever.

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:38.393
It's like, "yeah, I
pulled a fast one on 'em.

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.417
"I got sick of these chicks
getting their trophies,

00:08:42.417 --> 00:08:47.377
"so I thought I'd go through
a long and painful procedure

00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:49.570
"and then win some, and
then switch it back.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.420
I'm no fool."

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.400
Yeah, it's hilarious that
she came out with this.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.090
It's just an old person talking
about old person things.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.060
Erica, anything you wanna add?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.603
Any other sports you think
trans people would be good at?

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.920
- Field hockey.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.640
- Field hockey, that's one.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.070
Lacrosse,
- Lacrosse, definitely

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.160
- I think they'd be awesome at.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.640
Horse riding, equestrianism.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.390
Equestrianism is what they call it.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.233
Curling.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.393
- Bobsledding.

00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:17.540
- Bobsledding.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.870
Regular sledding.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.950
Skiing, snowboarding.
- Snowboarding.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.370
Windsurfing.
- Like recreational sledding?

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.630
What is regular sledding?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.901
- Water skiing.
- I think crossfit.

00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:27.930
Like I know that's not a real thing.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.083
But like, video games?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.190
Video games, I think trans
people would be good at.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.430
- Chess.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.300
- Chess, checkers.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.570
- Ping pong.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.800
- Ah, that's too close
to tennis, you know.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.950
Badminton, I wouldn't put in there.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.570
Basically, the trans community,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.570
stay away from rackets
and paddles, in that way,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.330
and we don't have a problem.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.670
You've got other sports you're good at,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.540
you don't need tennis.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.400
Erica, before we move on, one more time,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.661
play the clip of the crash.

00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.360
(imitating crashing noises)

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.193
Good job.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.644
(hard rock)
