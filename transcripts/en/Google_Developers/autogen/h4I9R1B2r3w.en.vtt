00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.670
 project android applications wants 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.740
 say design for mobility 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.260
 always keep in mind the scenario of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.660
 use of mumbai and device 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.420
 applications it contains are 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.730
 applications used in motion in 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.460
 which the user does not have your complete 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.970
 attention where your app is yours 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.380
 app is not the center of his thoughts 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.840
 the use of mobile applications e 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.480
 often inserted in a context driven by 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.370
 multitasking where the user could 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.620
 interrupt the flow several times 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.900
 natural that you imagined the app 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.650
 because maybe he's getting one 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.530
 phone call I just received a text message in 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.170
 more clearly there are limits 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.830
 physical then reduced control screens 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.760
 limited battery consumption 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.119
 connection to the network not always 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.950
 optimal is constant is another thing 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.830
 to consider that the download e 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.080
 data upload is not always free 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.850
 for the user 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.329
 let's see now some of the operations that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 require more resources in terms of 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.439
 battery consumption that have a high 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.249
 impact on the battery then use 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.979
 of the network 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:30.310
 in the event of poor network coverage 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.030
 mobile consumption is very high 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.649
 using bluetooth gps to make itself 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.789
 when the switch-off is avoided 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.280
 screen 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.189
 using the camera indoors 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.840
 of the oil application reactivate the screen from 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.249
 a standby state 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 these are all high-level operations 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.450
 impact on the battery that 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.369
 toast to the battery 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.399
 let's see some of the gestures now 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.979
 most common is generally accepted by the 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.320
 user's mental model from 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.840
 use 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.870
 the simplest in applications 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.090
 really the simple touch on the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.759
 release that launches the functionality of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 basis for the given element then there is the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.700
 long wait too long 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.640
 release that allows you to enter 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 selection mode often selection 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.870
 of one or more items on a list 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.120
 the opening of a context is the menu that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 allows you to make reports on i 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.630
 selected items and then we have the swipe 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.170
 which often serves to navigate between 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.020
 views of the same hierarchical level e 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.840
 it is also useful for showing contents in 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.800
 overflow the classic and the case of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.340
 dl of navigation ros the double touch 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.170
 which is often used for 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.060
 enlarge the element if expected e 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 we also used for the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.180
 selection of texts are double touch 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.700
 two touches two touches in rapid succession 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.120
 then we have double touch and drag that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.959
 serves to enlarge or reduce the zoom 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.739
 taking as a reference point 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.470
 just that of double touch 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.180
 the google maps application and is a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.000
 some of the best to protest this 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.549
 this is what we are doing next 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.769
 that long pressure with drag 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.750
 often this gesture is used 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:33.519
 to rearrange items or inside 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.610
 of a list promoting items in a 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.739
 determined containers then remain the 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.829
 last two the last two gestures which 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.049
 are the pilots in the cross then touch with 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.150
 credit moving outwards top 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.060
 agreed inward movement 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.370
 the first is useful to enlarge the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.769
 general content of the view that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.890
 second useful to make the 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.130
 always the main content of the view 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.590
 that we are looking at one of the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.780
 most common mistakes is to create 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.830
 confusion of its own in the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.480
 management of 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.940
 of gestures supported by 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.980
 application to avoid the problems of the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.560
 generally the strategy of making sure that 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.470
 the app immediately responds one 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.040
 determined gesture and above all not 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.130
 conflicts must be created between two or more 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.140
 gestures one of the main challenges in the 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.480
 release an android application of 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.250
 quality is definitely a guarantee 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.920
 good experience on many versions 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 of the operating system in circulation e 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.050
 on the multitude of devices on the market 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.780
 in the image we see the historian of the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.710
 releases of the operating system from cupcake 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.710
 to kit kat 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.920
 is a distribution that you can find 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.620
 a graph that you can find on the site 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.890
 android developer and it is constantly 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210
 updated then when you face the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.930
 design of a new application 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.200
 you can update yourself by going to these from 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.790
 food here we have as we were saying how 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.410
 we said the release history from 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.080
 operating system 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.240
 and here we can see the distribution 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.760
 of various screen sizes 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.100
 of the various diversities 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.350
 so on the one hand we have one 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.690
 still quite distribution 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.600
 consisting of old versions 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.460
 on the other hand the absolute necessity seen 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.280
 the very high level of the competition 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.310
 to create a unique user experience 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.730
 almost magical with ours 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.680
 the good news is that from android 4.0 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:41.560
 therefore and pil is of 14 all the producers 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.750
 are required to include themes with themes 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.880
 android or in their distribution 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.260
 this is a good thing because 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.440
 starting from here it was possible 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.360
 define a plus to the municipality showed 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.370
 unifying the lines 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.190
 general guidance and creating an experience 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.560
 consistent uniform to android users 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.720
 android in general communion 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.320
 defined provides 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.630
 an action bar for actions 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.480
 fast is the hierarchical navigation on 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.650
 various features of the app 1 rig and shawn 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.510
 drover in which to insert the navigation 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.670
 of the different sections of the app is a 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:26.860
 container and as android programmers 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:29.740
 probably a ministers who towards 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.660
 thirteen could make us life a lot 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.460
 easier 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.950
 the problem is that at the moment 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.550
 register this video distribution is 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.320
 the one you see here is also there 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.230
 the need for 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.970
 having to provide user support with 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.970
 old versions of the operating system 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:55.080
 reto meyer in google and youtube 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.570
 and 13 suggested creating the best 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.150
 best possible experience 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:04.360
 possible for all users 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.919
 especially those who use the latter 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.100
 devices on the market because 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:11.710
 actually those are yours 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.510
 target considering that hundreds of 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.030
 thousands of new devices come 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.780
 activated every day and that come 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.580
 released new very useful features 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.570
 from the android team to the new ones 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.060
 distributions 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:28.990
 so if the advice comes from meier it is 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.600
 one of those to be followed by mine and by 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.540
 create a unique and flowing experience 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.970
 pleasant to anyone with an eye on 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.220
 regarding clearly to whom to device of 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.870
 last generation 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.060
 obviously all this requires a 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:47.590
 correct support for most 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.990
 of the different screens more to a diet 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.880
 however of continuous continue to 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.070
 keep a version of your app 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:08:01.120
 for old platforms thanks 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:01.120
 to support many epic exhibitions 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:11.569
 more information at this link is 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:13.280
 really all for now live I invite you to 

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:16.520
 follow the next videos where 

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.580
 we will deepen the individual or ipad defined 

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.490
 by google guidelines to understand 

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.419
 exactly which scenarios to fold them here 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:31.430
 find my references for any 

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:33.050
 type of suggestion or question is the 

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.269
 next appointment where we will talk 

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.070
 of the application structure as 

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:39.700
 implement good navigation 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.700
 Hello
