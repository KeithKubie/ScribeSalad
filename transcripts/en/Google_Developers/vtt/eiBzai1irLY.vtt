LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.510
Welcome to GeoCasts, where you
can walk your way through what

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.490
you can do with Google Maps.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.920
I'm Laurence Moroney, and in
this first part of the series,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm going to talk about how
you can get rich mapping

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.610
functionality in your
apps with very little work

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.100
by delegating it to Google Maps.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.920
Say you need some basic
capabilities in your mobile app

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.330
to link out to a map, show
directions to a location,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.820
or display what the destination
looks like Street View.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.850
Delegation is the
easiest way to do this.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.910
The key to this is
in using URL schemes.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.940
A URL scheme allows your
app to open another app.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.980
Using the Google Maps URL
scheme you can, for example,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.450
have your users
open the Google Maps

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.400
app from within your
own app, and then you

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.710
can configure the app
to open at a location

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.130
that you want, with a
route that you want,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.460
and many other
mapping scenarios.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.720
Here you can see how you can use
a URL scheme and an Android app

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.200
through using
Google Maps Intense.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.310
You can see how to look
at a particular location,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.280
view restaurants in San
Francisco, navigate to a place,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.320
even see a street view
of the Swiss Alps.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.930
Now, you can use URL Schemes
and iOS with the same effect.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.750
But because not all iOS users
have Google Maps installed,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.920
you can fall back to
launching the Google Maps

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.130
website in the app's
absence with code like this.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.150
So that's it.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.670
The first step in
walking your way

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.600
through what you
can do with maps,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.380
and how you can control the
Google Maps app or Google Maps

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.650
site using URL schemes, and it
will do all the work for you.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.720
Now that's all very
nice, but it does

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.500
involve people leaving your app
if you want to give them a map.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
If you want to keep them in
your app, take a look at part 2.
