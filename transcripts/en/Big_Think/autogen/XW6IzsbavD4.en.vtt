00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.910
 
for me the way that I deal with it is if

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920
for me the way that I deal with it is if
 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.879
for me the way that I deal with it is if
I lose a big hand I the first thing that

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889
I lose a big hand I the first thing that
 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.909
I lose a big hand I the first thing that

happens is I start thinking did I do
anything wrong in the hand let me think

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689
anything wrong in the hand let me think
 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.550
anything wrong in the hand let me think
about in a sort of deconstructive way in

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560
about in a sort of deconstructive way in
 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.010
about in a sort of deconstructive way in
analytical way what was my play during

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
analytical way what was my play during
 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.389
analytical way what was my play during
the hand what was the other players

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399
the hand what was the other players
 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.549
the hand what was the other players
responses could I have done something

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559
responses could I have done something
 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.019
responses could I have done something
different should I have done anything

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029
different should I have done anything
 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.420
different should I have done anything
different was anything in my control

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430
different was anything in my control
 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.000
different was anything in my control
that went wrong now that does two things

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010
that went wrong now that does two things
 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.840
that went wrong now that does two things
the first thing is that it shuts that it

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850
the first thing is that it shuts that it
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.580
the first thing is that it shuts that it
kind of shuts down that sort of limbic

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590
kind of shuts down that sort of limbic
 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.410
kind of shuts down that sort of limbic
system response and gets you into your

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420
system response and gets you into your
 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.270
system response and gets you into your
frontal lobe which is actually really

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280
frontal lobe which is actually really
 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.740
frontal lobe which is actually really
important so the frontal lobe is where

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
important so the frontal lobe is where
 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.660
important so the frontal lobe is where
we think the limbic system is where we

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670
we think the limbic system is where we
 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.760
we think the limbic system is where we
have our emotions if we let our limbic

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770
have our emotions if we let our limbic
 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.790
have our emotions if we let our limbic
system go really light up then that

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800
system go really light up then that
 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.620
system go really light up then that
actually shuts our frontal lobe down so

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630
actually shuts our frontal lobe down so
 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.910
actually shuts our frontal lobe down so
we're not going to think clearly going

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
we're not going to think clearly going
 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.990
we're not going to think clearly going
forward so by immediately saying i'm

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000
forward so by immediately saying i'm
 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.130
forward so by immediately saying i'm
going to start thinking about this

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
going to start thinking about this
 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.270
going to start thinking about this
analytically and i'm going to start

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280
analytically and i'm going to start
 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.490
analytically and i'm going to start
going through the hand you're really

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
going through the hand you're really
 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.649
going through the hand you're really
subverting that that sort of emotional

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659
subverting that that sort of emotional
 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.450
subverting that that sort of emotional
response through almost through

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460
response through almost through
 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.069
response through almost through
distraction but there's actually sort of

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079
distraction but there's actually sort of
 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.319
distraction but there's actually sort of
a psychophysiological thing that's going

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329
a psychophysiological thing that's going
 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.090
a psychophysiological thing that's going
on but the other thing it does is it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100
on but the other thing it does is it
 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.010
on but the other thing it does is it
really trains you to look at mistakes as

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020
really trains you to look at mistakes as
 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.080
really trains you to look at mistakes as
opportunities which i think is really

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
opportunities which i think is really
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.270
opportunities which i think is really
important to say there isn't a failure

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280
important to say there isn't a failure
 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280
important to say there isn't a failure
like i didn't fail in a hand i made a

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290
like i didn't fail in a hand i made a
 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.960
like i didn't fail in a hand i made a
mistake and that's an opportunity for me

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970
mistake and that's an opportunity for me
 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.210
mistake and that's an opportunity for me
to learn and not make that mistake in

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220
to learn and not make that mistake in
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.820
to learn and not make that mistake in
the future and really become a better

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830
the future and really become a better
 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.230
the future and really become a better
poker player because of something I

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240
poker player because of something I
 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.680
poker player because of something I
might have done wrong and sometimes the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690
might have done wrong and sometimes the
 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.539
might have done wrong and sometimes the
conclusion after you've gone through

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549
conclusion after you've gone through
 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.130
conclusion after you've gone through
this is not that you did anything wrong

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
this is not that you did anything wrong
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.380
this is not that you did anything wrong
but things just went wrong like you had

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390
but things just went wrong like you had
 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.170
but things just went wrong like you had
aces and they had fives and they put all

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
aces and they had fives and they put all
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.399
aces and they had fives and they put all
their money in the pot when they were

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409
their money in the pot when they were
 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.690
their money in the pot when they were
only going to win eighteen percent of

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
only going to win eighteen percent of
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.760
only going to win eighteen percent of
the time and they happen to win and

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770
the time and they happen to win and
 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.410
the time and they happen to win and
those kinds of things you don't have any

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420
those kinds of things you don't have any
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.570
those kinds of things you don't have any
control over and I think very good poker

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580
control over and I think very good poker
 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.149
control over and I think very good poker
players get very good at saying I'm not

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159
players get very good at saying I'm not
 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.289
players get very good at saying I'm not
going to get upset about things that I

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299
going to get upset about things that I
 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.179
going to get upset about things that I
have no control over I'm going to focus

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189
have no control over I'm going to focus
 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.590
have no control over I'm going to focus
on the things that I do have control

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600
on the things that I do have control
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.940
on the things that I do have control
over because those are the things that

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
over because those are the things that
 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.380
over because those are the things that
are going to make me a winning player in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
are going to make me a winning player in
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.020
are going to make me a winning player in
the future

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
 
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.090
