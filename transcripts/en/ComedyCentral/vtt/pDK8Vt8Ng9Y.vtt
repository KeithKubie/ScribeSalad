&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD
DO DIFFERENTLY?

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.724 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN YOU SAY OUTSIDE AGITATORS,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.161 line:91%

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.874 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THAT'S HOW THE SAYING GOES.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:53.045 align:start position:0% line:91%
CNN TOOK THE AWKWARD APPROACH TO
HANDLING RACIAL TENSIONS, AND

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:55.715 line:91%
FOX TOOK THE RACIAL APPROACH TO
HANDLE THEIR AWKWARD TENSIONS.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.416 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TWO STORES.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:02.922 line:91%
THIS GUY IS WALKING OUT WITH A

YOU HAVE A LOT OF FREE LIQUOR
WITH THE THE FIVE-FINGER PROGRAM

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.397 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERE.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.667 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT WAS A CLIP FROM
FOX NEWS' "BLACKS DO THE

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.935 align:start position:0% line:85%
DARNDEST THINGS!."

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:19.772 line:91%
BUT FOX LOVES A GOOD COMPARISON,
AND THOSE COMPARISONS DON'T GET

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.874 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONFUSED WITH ANNOYING THINGS
LIKE LOGIC.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.443 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS DOESN'T LOOK OR FEEL
LIKE THE UNITED STATES OF

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.577 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERICA.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:33.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
