00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:09.938
The city sky is, frankly, rather boring.

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:12.988
If you look up at the patches of
murk between buildings,

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:15.248
you might be able to pick out
The Big Dipper,

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.392
or perhaps, Orion's Belt.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.131
But hold on. 

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.419
Look at that murky patch again
and hold our your thumb.

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.059
How many stars do you think
are behind it?

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.603
Ten, twenty? Guess again.

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:29.305
If you looked at that
thumbnail-sized patch of sky

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.406
with the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.318
instead of points of light,
you'd see smudges.

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:35.873
These aren't stars.

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:38.857
They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way.

00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:41.119
Cities of billions of stars,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:46.472
and more than 1,000 of them
are hidden behind your thumb.

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:49.592
The universe is bigger than
you can see from the city,

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:53.941
and even bigger than the starry sky
you can see from the countryside.

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.776
This is the universe as 
astrophysicists see it,

00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:03.461
with more stars than all the grains
of sand on Earth.

00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:05.397
By staring up at the stars at night,

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.808
you've taken part in the oldest science
in human history.

00:01:08.808 --> 00:01:10.749
The study of the heavens is older than

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:14.843
navigation, agriculture, perhaps
even language itself.

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:19.499
Yet unlike other sciences,
astronomy is purely observational.

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:23.164
We cannot control the parameters
of our experiments from lab benches.

00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:26.150
Our best technology can send
man to the moon,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.149
and probes to the edge of 
the solar system.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.508
But these distances are vanishingly small

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.811
compared to the yawning gulfs 
between stars.

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:37.264
So how can we know so much
about other galaxies,

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:41.871
what they're made of, how many there are,
or that they're even there at all?

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.924
Well, we can start with the first thing we
see when we look up at night: the stars.

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:49.161
What we are trying to learn
is their properties.

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:53.504
What are they made of? How hot are they?
How massive? How old?

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.882
How far are they from Earth?

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.144
And believe it or not,

00:01:57.144 --> 00:02:02.225
we can learn all of these things
simply from the light shining in the sky.

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:07.114
We can decipher one kind of stellar message
by turning starlight into rainbows.

00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:08.859
When you look at a rainbow on Earth,

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.008
you're really looking at light
from our Sun

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.309
being scattered through water droplets
in the atmosphere

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.520
into all the different wavelengths
that make it up.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.653
And we study the light from other stars,

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:23.685
we can create rainbows on demand
using not water droplets,

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.503
but other specific instruments that
disperse light.

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:30.005
When we look at the scattered
light from our sun,

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.466
we see something strange:
dark lines in our rainbow.

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:37.090
These lines are the characteristic
fingerprints of atoms.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.087
Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere
soaks up light at specific wavelengths,

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:46.576
and the amount of absorption depends on
how many of these atoms there are.

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:50.598
So by observing how much light is missing
at these characteristic wavelengths,

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:53.912
we can tell not only what elements are
in the Sun's atmosphere,

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:56.620
but even their concentrations.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.769
And the same idea can be applied to
study other stars.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.276
Make a spectral rainbow, 
see what's missing,

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:04.719
and figure out which elements are present.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.354
Bingo. Now you know what stars
are made of.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.999
But we aren't restricted to just
the wavelengths that our eyes perceive.

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.051
Consider radio waves.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.123
Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100
to your car,

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:21.314
but they can also travel almost
unimpeded through space.

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:22.828
Because they've come so far,

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:26.487
radio waves can tell us the very
early history of the universe,

00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:30.457
from just a few thousand years
after The Big Bang.

00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:34.321
We can also study the infrared light,
emitted by colder objects,

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:37.041
like the gas and dust clouds in space,

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:42.199
and the ultraviolet light from the hot
stars recently born from those clouds.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.871
Studying different wavelengths 
not only gives us

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.245
a more complete picture
of any single object

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:49.942
but also different views of the universe.

00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:54.290
For this reason, astrophysicists use
several different kinds of telescopes

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.911
covering the spectrum from the infrared
to the ultraviolet to the X-ray,

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:03.141
from giant radio dishes to giant
silver mirrors to space satellites,

00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:08.018
detecting light that would be otherwise
blocked by the Earth's atmosphere.

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:09.973
Astrophysicists don't just see

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:13.385
the billions of stars among
the billions of galaxies in the universe.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:17.223
They hear, feel and sense them
through many channels,

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.387
each revealing a different story.

00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:24.055
But it all begins with light,
the kind we can see and the kind we can't.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.697
Want to know the secrets of the Universe?

00:04:26.697 --> 00:04:28.314
Just follow the light.
