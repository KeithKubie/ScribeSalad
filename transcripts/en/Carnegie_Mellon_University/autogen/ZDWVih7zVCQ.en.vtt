you

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:04.019
 
 

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.299
 
you're at Carnegie Mellon University my

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:06.309
you're at Carnegie Mellon University my
 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:08.070
you're at Carnegie Mellon University my
lab is really interested in how we can

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080
lab is really interested in how we can
 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.799
lab is really interested in how we can
engineer human tissues both for disease

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809
engineer human tissues both for disease
 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.569
engineer human tissues both for disease
models the better understand disease

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:12.579
models the better understand disease
 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.489
models the better understand disease
progression outside the body but

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499
progression outside the body but
 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.260
progression outside the body but
ultimately we want to build engineered

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270
ultimately we want to build engineered
 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.090
ultimately we want to build engineered
tissues that can repair or replace

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100
tissues that can repair or replace
 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.160
tissues that can repair or replace
organs inside the body for different

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170
organs inside the body for different
 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.930
organs inside the body for different
kinds of therapies well my lab at CMU is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940
kinds of therapies well my lab at CMU is
 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.400
kinds of therapies well my lab at CMU is
really trying to engineer these human

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410
really trying to engineer these human
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.660
really trying to engineer these human
tissues and I think the most exciting

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670
tissues and I think the most exciting
 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.910
tissues and I think the most exciting
applications of these are in both drug

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920
applications of these are in both drug
 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.800
applications of these are in both drug
development and eventually organ repair

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810
development and eventually organ repair
 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.270
development and eventually organ repair
or replacement for drug development

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280
or replacement for drug development
 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.190
or replacement for drug development
right now it costs billions of dollars

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200
right now it costs billions of dollars
 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.110
right now it costs billions of dollars
to develop new drugs and that's mostly

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120
to develop new drugs and that's mostly
 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.150
to develop new drugs and that's mostly
because between an animal trial and a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160
because between an animal trial and a
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.410
because between an animal trial and a
human clinical trial there's really

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420
human clinical trial there's really
 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.540
human clinical trial there's really
nothing in between with a 3d engineered

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
nothing in between with a 3d engineered
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.490
nothing in between with a 3d engineered
human tissue on the bench top we can

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500
human tissue on the bench top we can
 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.530
human tissue on the bench top we can
determine if a drug is efficacious for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540
determine if a drug is efficacious for
 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.229
determine if a drug is efficacious for
toxic much sooner at lower cost so that

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239
toxic much sooner at lower cost so that
 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.120
toxic much sooner at lower cost so that
really increases the quality of the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130
really increases the quality of the
 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.680
really increases the quality of the
drugs are developing the longer term

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690
drugs are developing the longer term
 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.690
drugs are developing the longer term
goal and this is more 20 to 30 years out

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700
goal and this is more 20 to 30 years out
 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.030
goal and this is more 20 to 30 years out
is creating an engineer tissue that we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040
is creating an engineer tissue that we
 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460
is creating an engineer tissue that we
can use to repair or eventually replace

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470
can use to repair or eventually replace
 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.139
can use to repair or eventually replace
an entire organ at sailing and this

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149
an entire organ at sailing and this
 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.209
an entire organ at sailing and this
could address a wide range of diseases

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219
could address a wide range of diseases
 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.549
could address a wide range of diseases
from heart disease to the lung failure

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559
from heart disease to the lung failure
 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.100
from heart disease to the lung failure
to kidney dialysis

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
to kidney dialysis
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.010
