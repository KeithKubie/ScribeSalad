00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's do another ratio problem
that's a bit of a classic.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.300
So, let's say that I start off
with a certain number of fruit.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.430
So, I have some
number of fruit.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.800
But I'll get back to
that in a second.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.080
But we know that the ratio.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.070
We know that the ratio -- we
know that the ratio of apples

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.080
-- I'll do apples in
this reddish color.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.840
The ratio of apples to oranges.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.930
To oranges, those colors
are very similar.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.570
Let's say, it is equal to --
let's say it is equal to 5:8.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.390
So it's equal to 5:8.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.100
5:8.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.260
Or I could also write it
as 5:8, just like that.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.670
That's the ratio of
apples to oranges.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.890
Now, the next thing that I know
about this problem is that when

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.320
I take away 15 -- when
I take away 15 apples.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:13.810
So, take away 15 apples,
and the ratio becomes 1:4.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.320
The ratio of apples to
oranges becomes 1:4.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.080
How many apples -- let
me write it this way.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:45.320
How much total fruit do
I have after taking

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.860
away the 15 apples?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.750
The 15 apples?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.790
How much total fruit do I have?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.280
So let's do a little
bit of algebra.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.660
Let's say that x is the number,
x is equal to the number of

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.005
fruit that we start with.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.050
How much fruit are we going
to end up with at the end?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.220
We're taking away 15 apples.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.280
We're not doing anything
to the oranges.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.440
So we know that x minus 30,
I'll do that in a different

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.600
color, x minus 15, we take away
15 apples, x minus 15 is equal

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.595
to the number of fruit
we end up with.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.660
We know these two
things are true.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.790
And now, we know that we start
off with a ratio of 5:8.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.560
So we know that the ratio of
apples to oranges is equal to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.840
5:8 that we start off with.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.660
Or, that's just another way of
saying that for every group --

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.020
assuming that we can divide our
group of fruit into even -- or

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.270
we could divide it into a set
of groups, and every group

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.350
has the same number of
apples and oranges.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:23.210
That means that for every group
of, what, 13 fruits, 13 fruits,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:33.240
there are 5 apples
and 8 oranges.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.030
That's what this tells me.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.130
For every group of 13
fruits, there are 5

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.750
apples and 18 oranges.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.480
And how many groups of
13 fruit are there?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630
Well, I have x total fruit.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.020
So if I divide x divided by 13,
if I take x divided by 13,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.580
that is equal to -- this
is 13 thirteen right here.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.240
This is the 3.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.180
I have 13 fruits per group.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.850
I have x total fruit.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.390
So this is the total
number of groups.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.390
So this is equal to
the number of groups.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.110
Now, for every group,
I have 5 apples.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.600
So how many apples am
I starting off with?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.850
This is the number of groups.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.720
For every group,
I have 5 apples.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.730
So I'm starting off with
5 times that apples.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.510
5x over 13 apples.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.160
5x over 13 apples.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.940
Now, for every one of these
groups, I also have 8 oranges.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.800
So, how many oranges do I have?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.200
I have 8 times that.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.840
Because for every one of
these, I have 8 oranges.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.320
So 8 times that is
8x over 13 oranges.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.800
Fair enough.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.500
That's what I start off with.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.350
Now, when I'm done we said
that the ratio of apples

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.390
to oranges becomes 1:4.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.080
Becomes 1:4.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.190
Or, another way of saying that
is that, for every 5 -- right,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.700
if you add these two numbers
together, for every 5 fruit

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:15.196
there are 1 apple
and 4 oranges.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.510
Fair enough.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.590
So, how many groups of
5 fruit do we have?

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.660
Well, this is the total number
of fruit we're left with

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.080
after we took 15 away.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.600
So how many groups
of 5 do we have?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.550
We take the total
number of fruit.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.250
x minus 15.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.780
Divide it by how many
fruit we have per group.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.810
And this is how many groups
of -- this is equal to

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.720
the groups of 5 fruit.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.250
Of 5 fruit.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.550
Now, for each of these
groups, I'm going to have

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.790
1 apple and 4 oranges.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.180
So how many apples and oranges
do I now have after I took

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.730
away 15 of the apples?

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.090
I took away 15 fruit?

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.370
Let's think about
this a little bit.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.920
How many apples am
I going to have?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.270
I have 1 apple for every
1 of these groups.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.350
So, that's how many -- so
the number of groups is the

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.350
number of apples I have.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.610
So, I'm going to have x
minus 15 over 5 apples.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.920
And then how many oranges
am I going to have?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.630
For every one of these groups,
I'm going to have 4 oranges.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.790
So, I'm going to have 4
times this many oranges.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.290
So we could write that as 4/5
times x minus 15 oranges.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.630
That's just 5 times the
number of groups of 5 fruit.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.390
Now, what doesn't change?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.340
I'm messing with the number of
apples, but I never changed

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.290
the number of oranges.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.760
So, this number which is
the number of oranges we

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.660
started off with, has
to equal this number.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.570
The number of oranges
we ended up with.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.770
There's many ways to do this
problem, but this is the way

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.122
that's popping out of me that
might be straightforward.

00:06:52.122 --> 00:06:54.230
So let's see if we
can solve for x.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.960
This has to be equal to that.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.350
That never changed.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:09.790
So you could say 8x over 13 is
equal to 4/5 times x minus 15.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.590
And, maybe, the best way to do
this, let's multiply both sides

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.530
of this equation times 5/4.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.690
So, times 5/4 times 5/4.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.760
These cancel out.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.660
That just becomes 1.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.070
What does this become?

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.680
This becomes, you get
a 4, divide it by 4,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.520
you get a 2 there.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.860
This becomes 10x over 13.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.140
10x over 13, that's the
left-thand side, is

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.550
equal to x minus 15.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.070
Now, let's subtract
x from both sides.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:50.400
And we get 10x over 13 minus
x is equal to minus 15.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.040
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.300
And so, what is this?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:01.430
This is the same thing as 10x
over 13 minus 13x over 13.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.570
That's just x.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.470
Is equal to minus 14.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.310
And then, 10 minus 13, this is
equal to -- so this is minus 3x

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:17.180
over 13, is equal to minus 15.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.420
Now, we can just multiply
both sides of this equation

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.570
by minus 13 over 3.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.460
Multiply this side
by minus 13 over 3.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.300
I picked that number so that
this and that cancel out.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.080
And that and that cancel out,
and the negatives cancel out.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.740
So I'm just left with
x on that side.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.080
And then, the right-hand
side becomes what?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.010
The negatives cancel out.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.260
I can divide the 15 and the 3
by 3, so that becomes a 5.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.260
And then this becomes a 1.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.510
And I'm just left
with 5 times 13.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.380
This was just, times plus 13, I
wrote that just to make sure

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.740
that you understood that the
negatives canceled out.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.390
So, 5 times 13 is what?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.320
5 times 12 is 60, so
x is equal to 65.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.320
But that is not our answer.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.955
Remember what x was.

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:07.970
x was the number of
fruit we started with.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.820
We just figured out that
this is equal to 65.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.940
But what the question asked,
the question wanted to know is,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.700
how much total fruit do I have
after taking away

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.805
the 15 apples.

00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:21.330
So the question wants to
know, how many after

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.800
taking the 15 apples.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.050
If I started with 65, I give
away 15 of the fruit, all of

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.620
them are apples, then I'm
left with 65 minus 15,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.590
which is equal to?

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:37.550
50 pieces of fruit.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.960
50 pieces of fruit.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.950
That's what they're asking for.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.180
50 pieces of fruit.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.310
If you want, you can go on and
figure out how many apples you

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.060
started with, you finished
with, the number of oranges, or

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.970
whatever else, but this
is what they're asking.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.060
How much total fruit, not the
number of apples, total fruit,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.680
do I have after taking
away the 15 apples?
