00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.325
 Let's think about what's going on 

00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:04.181
 with the median and average values â€‹â€‹of a given set of numbers, 

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:06.225
 when changing one of the numbers. 

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.035
 Let's take a look at this example. 

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.101
 A group of four friends like to play puzzles together, 

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.186
 each recording the highest score of all 

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:16.906
 for a game. 

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.201
 Their highest scores are between 180 and 220, 

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:25.357
 except for Adam, whose highest score is 250. 

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.725
 Then Adam makes a great game 

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:31.092
 and achieved a new highest score of 290. 

00:00:31.092 --> 00:00:35.110
 How the rise in Adam's highest score will affect the average 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.199
 and the median? 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.149
 Now, as always, stop the video paused 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.257
 and see if you can find this yourself. 

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:43.956
 Let's think about what has been said. 

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.698
 We have four friends, 

00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:50.063
 each recording the highest score, 

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:51.548
 so we will have 4 data points, 

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:55.100
 the highest score for each of your friends. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.549
 Let's see, this is the lowest score of all friends, 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.917
 this is the second lowest, the second highest 

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.447
 and this is the highest score of friends. 

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:03.423
 Let's see. 

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:06.070
 Their highest scores are between 100 and 220, 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.973
 except for Adam, whose highest score is 250. 

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:12.525
 Before Adam played this amazing game, 

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:14.220
 the results look similar. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.976
 The lowest score is 180. 

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:21.202
 Adam notes 250. 

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:22.711
 And if you take Adam out of the picture, 

00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.056
 the highest score is 220. 

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:26.821
 And we do not really know what this result is 

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.422
 right there. 

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.628
 Now that Adam is playing a great new game 

00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:32.903
 and has a new highest score of 290, 

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:34.691
 how will the set of data look like? 

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.401
 Well, this man's highest score has not changed. 

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:41.030
 This friend's highest score has not changed. 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.159
 This friend's highest score has not changed. 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.908
 But now Adam has a new highest score. 

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:49.854
 Instead of 250, he is now 290. 

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:51.669
 So my question is, 

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:54.549
 the first question is how does the median change? 

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.609
 Well remember that the median is the average number. 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.163
 And if we look at the four numbers here, 

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:01.859
 the median will be the average 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.623
 of the two members in the middle. 

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.668
 So we'll get the average 

00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:08.662
 from what we have in place of this question mark and 220. 

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:12.238
 This will be the median. 

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.396
 Once Adam scored a new highest score, 

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.137
 how do we calculate the median? 

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.600
 Well, we still have 4 numbers 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.450
 and the middle two are still the same two mean numbers. 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.368
 Whatever the friend's highest score, he has not changed, 

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:26.750
 so we will have the same median. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.572
 We will have 220 plus a question mark divided by 2. 

00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:32.381
 It will be half the question mark and 220. 

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.935
 So the median 

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:39.184
 does not change. 

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:41.146
 The median does not change. 

00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:44.549
 Let us now think about the average value. 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.356
 Well, at the average we have the sum of all these numbers 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760
 and then divide to 4. 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.200
 Then we take the sum 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.930
 of all these numbers and divide it into 4. 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 Which sum will be higher? 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.806
 Ok, the first 3 numbers are the same, 

00:02:57.806 --> 00:03:00.322
 but you have a larger number in the second list. 

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:05.307
 290 is greater than 250. 

00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:08.279
 So if we take these 4 numbers and divide them into 4, 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.042
 you will have more value, 

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.202
 than if you take these 4 and divide them at 4, 

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:14.408
 because their sum will be larger. 

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:16.753
 So the average value will go up. 

00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.194
 Avarage value 

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.563
 will grow. 

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:24.559
 So the median does not change, and the mean grows. 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.017
 Well, here they say they both grow. No, that's not true. 

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:31.130
 The median will grow. No, the median does not change. 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.039
 The average will increase. Yes. 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.170
 And the median will remain the same. 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.395
 Yes, that's exactly the same we talked about. 

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.695
 And if you want to do it a little more specifically, 

00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.690
 you can replace the question mark with a number. 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.275
 Perhaps this question mark is 200. 

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:48.080
 And if you try 200, 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.634
 to make things specific, you will see that 

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.329
 this will really be the case. 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.697
 The median will be half of those two numbers. 

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:56.276
 As I randomly chose 200. 

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:59.253
 It can be any number found 

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:01.635
 between 180 and 220, 

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.058
 but you see that for this example 

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:05.774
 it is very clear that the median does not change. 

00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:08.308
 But the average value increases because we increase the sum. 

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:09.698
 We increase the sum by 40, 

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:11.347
 because we have increased 

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:13.413
 the last number by 40.
