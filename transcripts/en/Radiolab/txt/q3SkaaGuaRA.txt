Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N y. S. E. N. P. R. Hello David. Yes. Hello. This is pat. Oh, hi pat. All right, let's begin with this story from our producer Pat Walters. Pat, go ahead. Okay. So I heard this one from this guy named David, Ms. David bus to ss. He's a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. And this particular story, it comes from a book that David wrote. Um, could you just, just tell me, uh, the little story that you begin your book with? Okay. Yes. Um, this is one of the things that, uh, this was one of the things that sparked my interest in the topic of murder. The whole thing happened several years ago. I had a very good friend, another professor at the university,

Speaker 2:          00:51          and I used to socialize with him and his wife. And one evening they were throwing a party and invited me over. And so when I went to the party, a party was already in full swing. And I got there, uh, walked in and asked his wife, uh, where this friend of mine was. And, uh, she got a disgusted look on her face and said that he was up in the bedroom. And so I went up to the bedroom to find them. And he was in a, in a rage, in a rage.

Speaker 1:          01:22          How, like you walk into the room, what do you find? Well, he's

Speaker 2:          01:25          started, he started fuming that his wife had, had dissed him. And what did she do? Uh, she expressed disapproval about his, uh, clothing choices. She made fun of his shirt or something, but did it in publicly in front of her friends. So it was a kind of, he felt publicly humiliated.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And while David's sitting in the bedroom with this friend, the guy looks up at him and he says, I'm going to kill her. How did he say it? Like quietly or like through his teeth,

Speaker 2:          01:58          you know, I'm going to kill her.

Speaker 1:          02:01          David had always known this guy to be pretty mild mannered, but he,

Speaker 2:          02:07          it is a, uh, a large, very strong man, um, with a black belt in karate. I knew what he was capable of. And so I suggested that we go out for a walk and I basically spent the next half hour walking around with him, trying to cool him off. But eventually he did. He just calmed down. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And did you go back to the party then and like continue dinner partying for awhile?

Speaker 2:          02:38          Yeah, I did. Yes. And he did too. And then he seemed fine when I said goodbye to him, it seemed common. I left and went home and then it was several hours later in the middle of the night that I got the call

Speaker 1:          02:53          and it was his friend

Speaker 2:          02:54          and he says, can I come over and sleep on your couch? Uh, if I don't leave my house right now, I'm going to kill her. He was in this, um, a state of fury, he said, and um, and instead of hitting his wife, he smashed his fist into the bathroom mirror and then realized that he had to leave the house or he was gonna do damage to her.

Speaker 1:          03:25          And so he says that in, you're like, okay, yes, come over now.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Like, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Meanwhile, later that night and the other side of town,

Speaker 2:          03:33          his wife, um, went into hiding, literally disappeared for six months and didn't tell anyone where she was because she was terrified that he was going to kill her.

Speaker 1:          03:46          This story made us wonder, is David's friend, is he unusual or does everybody at some point have something dark in them that just tip toes out? Just from time to time? Yeah. This is Radiolab and today we're going to get back so to speak. We've done a good show. This is the bad show. So you asked like, why do people do bad things actually mean to be bad anyways? Like how do you tell the real baddies from the rest of us? That's time our, I'm Jad have them. Ron, I'm up. [inaudible] this is Radiolab, the bad show.

Speaker 3:          04:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:28          back to bed. Okay. Uh, so what happened to David that night with his friend, got him really curious about murder and badness and all these things we're thinking about. But it wasn't until a few years later that he learned something that really put what happened that night in the context. The next, at this point, David moved on to a new university and he's teaching an introductory psychology class

Speaker 2:          04:49          and I devoted one class session to the topic of homicide and why people kill. And I designed a little, um, questionnaire where I simply asked the students, you know, have you ever thought about killing someone? And they would circle yes or no.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Then he left some space at the bottom for them to elaborate if they said yes,

Speaker 2:          05:11          and, you know, the class ended. And I went back to my office and I just sat at my desk and I started reading these and I was just astonished

Speaker 1:          05:19          to find page after page of yeses and not just yeses,

Speaker 2:          05:24          but these very vivid descriptions about

Speaker 1:          05:28          who they would kill, where they do it, when the precise method, how many of them went into that kind of detail?

Speaker 2:          05:36          Uh, I would say 75 or 80%. Wow. Um, and are you a little bit like horrified? Like, oh my God, my students are murderer. All right. Well, I horrified as I was, I was pretty stunned. And so I expanded the sample where we asked about 5,000 people all over the world. Singapore Heru the UK.

Speaker 1:          05:58          That same question, have you ever thought about that

Speaker 2:          06:00          killing someone? And 91% of the men said yes and 84% of the women,

Speaker 1:          06:08          yes. I've thought about killing someone.

Speaker 2:          06:10          Yes. If any sizable fraction actually acted on their homicidal fantasies, the streets would be running, running red.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Yeah. But that's just a, those are fantasies. And some of them actually seem like, well, here's one, something more than just fantasies from

Speaker 2:          06:26          a woman. Sure. Okay. This is a 20 year old female. Uh, we ask, who did you think about killing? And she said, my ex boyfriend, um, we lived together for a couple of months. He was very aggressive. He started calling me a whore and told me he didn't love me anymore. So I broke up with him. Then a few months later he started calling me, trying to get back together, but I didn't want to. He said that if I ever had a relationship with another man, he was going to send the videos of us having sex to all the people in my university. The thing is that I do have a new boyfriend, but my ex boyfriend doesn't know it that yet and I'm terrified that he'll do what he says. Then suddenly the thought occurred to me that would, my life would be much happier without him and existence and then she said, I actually did this. I invited him for dinner and as he was in the kitchen looking stupid, peeling the carrots to make salad, I came up to him laughingly, gently so that he wouldn't suspect anything. I thought about grabbing a knife quickly and stabbing him in the chest repeatedly until he was dead. I actually did the first thing, but he saw my intentions and ran away. When asked how close she came to killing him, she estimated 60%

Speaker 1:          07:45          well 60 I don't think I've ever had a fantasy that that anatomically specific where I would see the part of the other person that I was going to stab or plan it like that. Well. Have you ever been blackmailed the way this woman was being blackmailed? No. No one has ever said about a six tape that I've ever know. So you don't know. It is a fair question to ask. What are the conditions under which you or me or any of us could do evil things? I think they'd have to be extreme in the extreme. Well, you know how mine? No. And you know what? This actually brings us to our first top of the hour. So let me just to set it up. Robert, I'm going to give you this piece of paper here. What is this? So these are some word pairs. Read these words that use these words here. Yep. Nice Day. Fat Neck. Yes. Sad face. What is it? Soft hair. Yeah. I don't know what this is. You just wear it. I want you to commit them to memory fi. Commit them to memory. You know, and while you're doing that, just give me your finger. I'm going to ask that first little electro test finger. Let me go hard, Dan. Just wait a second. Clear air. He said, give me the paper back. W ready? Time's up. So I'm just gonna go into this other room over.

Speaker 3:          08:57          Can you hear me? All right. So I'm gonna talk to you over this intercom. Okay, let me give you a test. I'm not ready for the day. Intention, right? To the best of your memory. Which word was mashed with Nice? Was it? Nice Day. Nice sky. Nice job. Nice chair. Antifreeze. I don't want, wait a second. Just push the button. The corresponds to the right way to go.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Okay. I'm choosing job wrong.

Speaker 4:          09:28          The answer is day hiring, man. 285 olds have to give you a little,

Speaker 1:          09:35          what did you just, you just of you're drunk. Obviously. No need to be an alarm. That was not a real shock. We were just enacting an old, very famous experiment that you might've heard about. It is May, 1962 done by this guy. An experiment is being conducted in the elegant interaction laboratory at Yale University that Stanley Milgram talking about the experiment in the film in case you've never heard of, this probably happened in case you haven't. Here's what he did. He recruited a bunch of subjects. Subjects are 40 males between the ages of 20 and 50 normal everyday dudes. The subjects range in occupation from corporation president, the good humor man and plumbers and he ran them through something like what you and I just did, right. He would have each subject sit down at a table right here in front of this really impressive looking machine. This machine that had lots of switches on. It

Speaker 4:          10:22          generates electric shocks on your press, water, the switches all the way down. The learner gets a shock

Speaker 1:          10:27          and in the other room there was a guy, then he called the learner who is supposed to have memorized some words and every time that guy got a word wrong, I'm like, you just did. Yup. Tapping costs, answers. Night. Volunteer was instructed to shock that guy with higher and higher voltage. Now the volunteer couldn't see the guy who was shocking, but he could definitely hear him Milgrom staged the whole thing, like it was some experiment about memory and punishment, but of course it wasn't about that. I can tell you please. It was about how far would these people go, how many times would they shock that sad SAP in the next room just because they were being told Tim guy yelling. Of course it was an actor and the shocks weren't real, but the questions in the air at the time were very real prosecution. The attorney general, this was a moment when human cruelty was on trial. Quite literally when I stand before you judges of Israel in this commode, I used to accuse, I don't five them and any or maybe d, I do not stand alone.

Speaker 5:          11:34          The Milgrim actually begins these experiments the same year that Adam Eichmann goes on trial for Nazi war crimes. That's radio producer Ben Walker. He'll be our guide for the segment and in the trial when the prosecutors essentially ask him how you came to commit genocide, he would say over and over again, it was not my personal affair. I was just following orders. I had to do what I was ordered and it's this defense. This is basically what Stanley Milgrim set out to test 185 votes in a lab. Yale University with a bunch of regular Americans, like is that something that the universal yeah, or just 10 Eichmann thing. Yeah. He figured maybe 1% of these men would keep flicking the switches up to the highest voltage, but that's not what he found. 65% were willing to shock their fellow citizens over and over and even past when they were screaming in pain.

Speaker 4:          12:38          Sounds happened to that man in that

Speaker 5:          12:40          even when they stopped screaming. Yeah, when they were maybe dead.

Speaker 4:          12:43          You better check in on him, sir. He won't answer me or nothing. Please continue. Go on. Twitter.

Speaker 5:          12:49          They continued shocking their corpses.

Speaker 4:          12:53          Wow.

Speaker 5:          12:55          His experiment remains one of the most famous experiments of the 20th century in 1962 Stanley Milgrim shocked the world was his study on obedience is still trotted out to explain everything from hazing to war crimes. What is there in human nature to gang behavior allows an individual to act inhumanely genocide harshly. It's like a downloadable from the Internet. Instant defense for doing wrong, but if you look at Milgram's work closely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like this guy did, oh x, how's Lim professor of psychology at the University of Exeter? Then a different picture will emerge. Really that story has been told 1,000,001 times for the last 50 years. We've just got to get, oh, got to get out for it. Now what you need to understand about Alex Haslam is that he hates it when interviewers only want to talk about the baseline study. The one that everybody knows, the so called baseline, the 65% one, the one we just talked about.

Speaker 5:          13:55          Yeah. So there's more, there's more too. Yeah. Because actually he studied between 20 and 40 different variants of this same paradigm. Stanley Milgram took electric shock very seriously. He did this experiment a bunch of times and a bunch of different ways how all sorts of different things. He would change where the shocker and the Shaki Sat. Yet women participantcy had an experiment who wasn't a scientist, but it was a member of the general public and every scenario produced a different result. Really? Yup. Let me, I mean, I'm just, uh, I've got in front of me, I've just got the, uh, the data from the Milgrim. So let me just get that. I mean, so again, the baseline studies is the one where 65% of volunteers go all the way, highest dose of electricity, exciting sex. But in experiment number three, if they put the Shaki in the same room with a shocker, so the shocker can actually see the person that he's shocking obedience tropes to about 40% in an experiment.

Speaker 5:          14:54          Number four, when the teacher has to hold the learner's hand down on the plate, in order to him to feel the shock, they drops to about 30%. Wow. Experiment 14. If the experiments are, he is not a scientist, but is an ordinary man not wearing a white coat, obedience drops to 20%. Well, how low can we go? Okay, here's another one. Experiment 17. There's you and this to other participants, both actors. If those two participants refuse to go on, like saying like, I don't want to kill a guy. Boney 10% under those circumstances, go on. And then the final one, experiment 15 of course, normally you just have one experiment who's giving you these instructions. But if you put two experimenters in the room and they start disagreeing with each other, and this one you get 0% going on zero z arrive in that condition.

Speaker 5:          15:44          You said Zero Nolan and go right to the zero at one post. No one not assault. Exactly 0% well, all right, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about my fellow man. One second. Hey Sh. Okay, where is he? Am I'm in a closet closet because this room is echoey and you know there's nothing like a closet full of clothes to like help balance that out. That's true. That's true. All right, let's keep going. So you see, it's just in that one experiment that 65% of people are willing to go all the way, but in all of these other scenarios, they don't. And even when they do say yes, even when they go along with the experiment, as you can see in the film, they struggle

Speaker 4:          16:25          using the last switch on the board. Please. I'm not getting no answer. Please continue. The next word is white.

Speaker 5:          16:30          They have debates with them.

Speaker 4:          16:33          Do you think you should look in on him? Please?

Speaker 5:          16:35          Fights with the experiments, Huh?

Speaker 4:          16:37          Not Once we've started the experiment of something happened on mad and attacked or something like that. The experiment requires that we continue, go on and put down that. Don't the man's health mean anything? Whether the learner likes it or not. We might might be better than that.

Speaker 5:          16:49          What's interesting is that how all of these struggles, all of them play out the same way. It's the experimenter prodding the shockers along.

Speaker 4:          17:00          You're going to keep giving them what, 450 volts every shot now.

Speaker 5:          17:03          Correct. For me, it's all about the prods connect words white. This is what totally pulled me into this story. Prods Stanley Milgrim had four scripted prods that he wrote out for his experimenters for when the subjects didn't want to continue. Yup. The first one was, please go on and if they didn't go on, if they resisted, he experimented with break out prod number two. The experiment requires that you continue.

Speaker 4:          17:29          Well, the experiment requires, I mean I know it does, sir, but I mean he's up to 195 [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          17:35          and if they still were resisting or struggling, they'd get prod number three. It's absolutely essential that you continue. It's absolutely essential. It's a little bit more direct. It's a bit stronger. It's not an order, not quite, but the fourth prod, really the, the critical, the critical

Speaker 6:          17:50          false prod is an absolute order. The fourth prod is

Speaker 4:          17:54          you got to know where the choice. Do you have no other

Speaker 5:          17:57          choice teacher? You must continue. That is definitely an order. Exactly, but every time the experiment are pulled out, the fourth prod, and this was confirmed when the experiment was redone in 2006 total disobedience, Hodel, disobedient. Anytime the experiment said you must continue, the shocker would say, hell no. I've

Speaker 4:          18:21          don't. You have no other choice teacher. I have a choice. I'm not going to go ahead with it. Well, we'll have to discontinue the experiment. I'm sorry.

Speaker 5:          18:34          Here's another one.

Speaker 4:          18:35          You have no other choice. You must want to have a choice. How does it do you all continue up? We're going to have to discontinue the experiment, have to, he says cut it out. After all, he knows what he can stand. That's my opinion. That's where I'm going to stand on it.

Speaker 6:          18:53          Well, so the subjects seem willing to shock another human being, but as soon as you say it's an order, they don't do it. Now that's important. It's very important because if you ask university undergraduates, what does the Milgram study show, they will invariably say something like they showed that people obey orders. Okay. Well actually the one thing that the study really doesn't show is that people are, bay ordered is a pretty big thing. To me. This is a pretty big thing to mess, isn't it? Really? See, wait, if it doesn't show that people are just obeying orders. Yeah, and what does it show? Okay. I think it looks, it's like this. All right, let's go on to our instructions. We will begin with this test. The participants are there in the, in the study, I've got a, a very plausible, very credible high status scientists.

Speaker 6:          19:39          And as I say, just scientific institution, Yale, who is going to do this powerful piece of science, right? Your voice toward that microphone is the room. So they sit down in the chair thinking, wow, this is really important. I'm about to help this quest for knowledge. I really want to do a good job. Now as we sort of know in life, lots of things that we do, they worthwhile doing and not always easy. And you find yourself in a situation where you've got to do something that's hard, like shocking, an innocent stranger over and over. But if you think that's the right thing, if you think that science is worth pursuing, you say, okay, I'll go along with this. So you're saying you're shocking these people because they thought it was worthwhile. Look to participants. You know, they're not, it's not. It's not just blind to beaten. So tell me, so yes sir. No Sir. Three bags full sir. They're engaged with the task that trying to be good participants. They're trying to do the right thing. They're not doing something because they have to. They're doing it because they think they ought to. And that's all the difference in the world.

Speaker 6:          20:47          Suddenly I'm thinking

Speaker 2:          20:48          this is actually a darker interpretations. The original, absolutely darker stay are doing. And no question about it. They have the agency. Yep. And they think it's right. Although clearly they on some level, they know it isn't

Speaker 6:          20:59          does this sort of chilling comparison, which is a speech that Himmler gave to the SS cmss leaders when they were about to commit a range of atrocities. And he said, look, this is what you're going to do is of course you don't want to do this. Of course nobody wants to be killing other people and we realize this is hard work. But what you're doing is for the good of Germany and this is necessary in order to advance our noble cause.

Speaker 3:          21:24          Wow.

Speaker 2:          21:25          So then, Hey, wait, I'm almost done guys. Give me two more minutes. Two more minutes. Okay. So in the Milgrim case [inaudible] with the idea is that people will do bad if they think it's good, like the good noble cause. Well what's the noble cause in this case? Science, science. You can see this in the surveys that the men filled out after the experiments were over. This was exactly what was on my mind. If the experiment, if the experiment had to be successful, it had to be carried on. The questionnaires they filled out are part of the Milgrim archive at Yale. We're willing to help in a worthwhile experiment and it's kind of surprising. A lot of them are really positive even though they've just been told that they were duped. Research in any field is a must, particularly in this day and age. Do you think that more studies of this sort should be carried out? Definitely, yes.

Speaker 6:          22:16          We as, as onlookers to the study, we have this kind of Godlike, uh, sort of vision of like, well of course what they're doing is wrong, but if it looks at it from another perspective, there's a sense in which you could celebrate what they're doing. You're, I mean, I'm not suggesting one should, but I'm just saying there is a sense in which these people are prepared to do something that's very painful to them and to someone else because they want to promote science. Well, you know, you can see that's a good thing. I mean, you know

Speaker 2:          22:42          God cause it's like we started with this experiment that we all see as evidence of humans, latent capacity for evil. You tell us actually no, under some circumstances we don't do the bad thing we're told to do because here's another flip. We don't have to be told. In fact, we hate being told, but we will do it on our own if we think it's good. Yeah. Now you're saying actually that you could read that, that very dark fact as being actually evidence of something quite Nobel. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          23:08          Well if you dressed it up and if you just had some minor variants, the paradigm you could presume that we make, you know, make these up. These are people who are incredibly noble. They are, I mean it's the fact of course that they're administering pain to a stranger. That's what's horrifying about it. But imagine they were administering paint themselves. Imagine they were really where I had to administer shocks themselves or something. But if they were prepared to do that, when I suspect a lot of them would, um, then we'd say, these are people who really believe in Saas and isn't this a good thing that we have people in our society who are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good?

Speaker 3:          23:39          Huh.

Speaker 2:          23:40          So in the end, where do you come down? Do you leave this experiment in a light mood or in a dark mood? Uh, I th

Speaker 6:          23:46          I, I overall, I would say in a powerful mood, we're close to some really fundamental truths about human nature.
