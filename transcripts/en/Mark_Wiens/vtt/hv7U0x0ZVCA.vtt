00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.526
- We're all sitting down for lunch now

00:00:01.526 --> 00:00:03.181
and they also have a
couple of other dishes

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:05.940
that Ying's mom and aunt made.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.188
I'm gonna start with the frog though.

00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:11.605
(cheerful ukulele music)

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.950
Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens
with migrationology.com.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.645
I'm in Nakhon Sawan in central Thailand

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:22.771
and today for lunch,

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.815
Ying's aunt said that she's
gonna cook up some frog.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.390
So stay tuned for some delicious frog.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.614
And also I wanna remind you,

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.723

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:33.045

for lots more food and travel videos.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:39.908
Okay, now I'm kinda squatting
in the banana field.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:41.831
Let's go see what she's cooking.

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.693
She's getting ready to
cook right over there.

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:46.504
Right now at first she's just pounding up

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.504
some chilies and garlic.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.065
Oh yeah, there's a whole bag
of green peppercorns here.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.673
Oh, these are one of my favorite things

00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:05.340
in the entire world.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:08.453
I love them so much that I need to

00:01:08.453 --> 00:01:10.786
take a bite of it right now.

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:21.101
And then she's pounding it now with the--

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.923
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:26.882
Now she's pounding it
up with the curry paste.

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:30.715
(loud crunching and pounding)

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.882
(package rustling)

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.084
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:47.975
These are some big meaty frogs.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.268
You can see those muscles
on those hind legs.

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:54.185
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:59.297
(cheerful ukulele music)

00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:01.964
(loud pounding)

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:08.122
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:17.929
I think she's not gonna mince it fully

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.045
but just kinda chop it up

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:21.822
into little bite size kinda pieces.

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:24.197
That is some really meaty frog.

00:02:24.197 --> 00:02:26.773
Okay and as she is
finishing chopping the frog,

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:29.856
I'm gonna snack on some green pepper.

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.839
(loud crunching)

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:36.616
I love it.

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:39.861
Oh, it's so spicy

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.583
when it's fresh like this.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:45.456
And so much of a like pure pepper flavor.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:46.956
Oh it's wonderful.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.541
I can snack on this like popcorn.

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:53.624
It's so good.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:00.846
And this one is spicy

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.562
but sometimes it can be spicier.

00:03:03.562 --> 00:03:05.031
Like sometimes it can really,

00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:09.198
oh okay, I can feel that
burning down my throat now.

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:20.407
Lighting up that wok

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:22.515
and first goes in a bunch of oil.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:24.098
Oh, a bunch of oil.

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.046
And then in goes all of that curry paste

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.724
and chilies and garlic
that she pounded up.

00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:36.110
Oh, that's like a, an oil bath.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.485
That is gonna bring out
some serious flavor.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:43.235
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.930
That curry paste and chilies is just kinda

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.887
sizzling in that oil for a little while

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:55.175
and she is washing some
of the green peppercorns.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.458
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:03.208
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.856
This aroma of frying chilies
and garlic and curry paste

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.609
just never gets old.

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.026
It's one of the greatest aromas on earth.

00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:21.343
And now goes in the frog,

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:22.760
all of that frog.

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:42.287
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:46.854
(laughing)

00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:49.250
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.608
And as that frog is cooking away

00:04:50.608 --> 00:04:53.272
she's taking the leaves
off some bai kaphrao

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:54.939
which is holy basil.

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:01.269
I'm gonna go ahead and stir up the frog.

00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:05.465
Oh, this is gonna be oily and delicious.

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:11.239
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:17.146
And she just said that if you
add a lot of the holy basil

00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:18.609
it will smell really good.

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:21.692
It will have a really nice fragrance.

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:34.866
And then in go all of
those green peppercorns.

00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:43.823
And then the final step is
to add in all of the basil

00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:46.114
and you always wanna
add the basil at the end

00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:47.683
and then immediately turn off the fire

00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:48.751
or not cook it very long

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.641
because it will start to lose its flavor

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.726
as it cooks longer.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.125
So you just wanna basically
throw it in at the end

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:58.307
let it use the heat from
the preexisting meat and oil

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:00.591
and things inside of the dish

00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:04.591
and just let that holy
basil wilt into the dish.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:10.416
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:19.158
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:26.917
That's a countryside style hot pad.

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:28.459
And it is ready.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:29.554
She said it's fully cooked

00:06:29.554 --> 00:06:32.887
and all that basil has just wilted down.

00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:39.443
We're all sitting down for lunch now

00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:41.199
and they also have a
couple of other dishes

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.058
that Ying's mom and aunt made.

00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:47.509
They're a selection of
fried meats and fish.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.144
This is the dried fried catfish.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:52.690
This is another dried fried fish.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.595
Some moo tod, which is fried pork.

00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:57.151
And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna
start with the frog though.

00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:59.234
It's definitely on the oily side

00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:01.980
but it looks and smells so good.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.813
Oh, I gotta get some of
that basil though too.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:09.504
Big chunk of basil there.

00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:11.864
Alright, let me start with this.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.602
And I'm not sure, I think the best way

00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:17.152
will just be to bite it, eat it,

00:07:17.152 --> 00:07:19.319
and then remove the bones.

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:24.087
Oh yeah.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.290
Or maybe you can just bite
right through the bones.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.373
Or maybe not.

00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:37.347
It is pretty oily but
that flavor is incredible.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:38.849
The red chilies.

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.977
What I really like are the
green peppercorns in there.

00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:43.817
The garlic, the basil.

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.062
It's just a harmony of wonderful flavors

00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:48.739
and even as much chili as is in there,

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.402
it's not extremely spicy.

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:53.232
But it just has a really
wonderful chili fragrance.

00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:56.649
(cheerful ukulele music)

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:04.294
Okay, I'm gonna start next with this fish

00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:08.461
and even (speaking foreign language).

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:15.851
Yeah it is pla salid, which
is some type of gourami

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.514
and fried like a chip.

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:20.514
Oh, like a serious chip.

00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:31.632
Yeah, it's like a salty fish jerky.

00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:38.543
You gotta really chew that
up to get through those bones

00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:40.539
but it is really good.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.956
(cheerful ukulele music)

00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:05.719
It's so good but

00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:08.326
frog is something

00:09:08.326 --> 00:09:10.370
you don't really wanna
eat when you're in a hurry

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.475
'cause you have a lot of

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:14.858
eating around little bones to do.

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:18.474
But every bit that you get tastes so good.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:19.911
Do I have some?

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:21.398
I'm trying to look at that screen.

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:24.224
I think I might have
some chili oil on my chin

00:09:24.224 --> 00:09:25.910
that got stuck on my chin.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.629
But that was delicious food.

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:31.661
Eating frog is kind of like eating crab.

00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:34.399
It's one of those things
that you wanna leisurely eat

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.515
and you have to take your time eating.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:36.779
You don't wanna eat it quickly

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:41.490
due to having to navigate your
way around the little bones.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.490
But the flavor that comes out of it,

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.301
frog is just delicious.

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:50.695
I love eating meals like that

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:52.982
where you're just sitting here.

00:09:52.982 --> 00:09:55.918
And also just a quick cultural tip.

00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:58.630
Often times in the
countryside in Thailand,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.926
they will cook up some dishes
in the middle of the day

00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:03.906
and then you'll eat

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:04.739
and then that food,

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:06.755
they'll save that food
for later in the day,

00:10:06.755 --> 00:10:07.857
maybe the next meal

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.679
or whenever you get hungry next.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:12.511
But I am stuffed and ready to relax.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.819
That was a great lunch.

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:16.027
Thank you very much to Ying and her family

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:19.007
and her aunt especially
for cooking up that frog

00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:21.188
which was especially for me, she said.

00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:24.039
She wanted to cook it for me.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.308
And my mouth is on fire.

00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:27.375
That was wonderful.

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:28.625
And then right behind the house,

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:30.309
there are a bunch of fruit trees

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:33.226
and I'm not sure of the
name of the fruit in English

00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:35.601
but it's a little berry like fruit.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.093
And let me see if I can find one.

00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:39.067
Oh there's one.

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:41.484
There's one right over there.

00:10:42.526 --> 00:10:46.183
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:48.600
In Thai this is called dakob.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.980
Oh, it's so sweet.

00:10:55.127 --> 00:10:57.380
And the only reason I know
what it tastes like already

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.722
because I've been snacking
on them before lunch.

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.741
But it explodes very
similar to a blueberry

00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.648
But it explodes very
similar to a blueberry

00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:05.234
with all those little seeds.

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:07.151
But then it has a taste

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:12.159
almost like a really really
really overripe mango.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:14.492
Really sweet and like pulpy.

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:18.824
Micah wants to quickly
say goodbye to all of you.

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:20.731
Micah, say goodbye.

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.564
Micah.

00:11:23.797 --> 00:11:25.951
He had a good lunch while
I was eating as well.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.708
While I was eating that frog.

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:31.570
Micah, I can't wait 'til
you can eat some frog too.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.227
Oh, he opened his mouth.

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:34.810
(laughing)

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.835
Oh, he drooled when I said frog.

00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:39.069
I'm gonna end this little lunch video

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:40.687
in Nakhon Sawan right here.

00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:42.189
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:43.798
Please remember to give
