[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:07.120
HENRY HARDING: My
name's Henry Harding.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.140
I'm in the agency Go-to-Market
team supporting the GCast

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.220
Agency team.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.210
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.750
I'm just going to introduce
my good friend Andy.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.290
He's been a member of or a
part of the LGBT activist

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.860
community and the Democratic
political community

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.300
for the past 40-plus years.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.859
And beyond that, he
also wrote the book

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.400
that is on the chair
in front of you,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.757
which you're happy to take.

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:34.090
He was the author of "The
Best Little Boy in the World,"

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.750
which is a landmark memoir
about growing up gay.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.000
He claims that he
invented the password

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.530
hint, which I do not believe.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.680
And he also-- fun fact-- was
one of the original investors

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.790
in "Nunsense."

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.870
So if sort of like nun parody
musicals are your thing,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.606
then you should definitely
ask Andy all about it.

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:54.730
But with that, I'm just
going to let him come on up

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.606
and talk to you.

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:56.974
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.742 --> 00:00:59.700
ANDY TOBIAS: Thank you.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.870
Thank you.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.260
It's so fun to be here.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.540
I love Google.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.680
Some of you I know.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.850
Some of you I don't.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.808
Those of you I know,
you've heard these stories

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.410
over and over and over again.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.740
And we don't want to jeopardize
Google's (c)(3) status.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.660
You are a nonprofit, right?

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.085
But Henry left
out the 18 years I

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:20.460
was treasurer of the Democratic
National Committee until,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.870
like, five minutes
ago, because he doesn't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.120
want to jeopardize the status.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.680
But those of you who are
strong Trump supporters,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
raise your hands now so I
be more careful what I say.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.680
OK, got that out of the way.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.340
So I want to just
talk for a few minutes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.590
and then open up to questions
for whatever you want,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.890
because that's more fun.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.830
But I was sort of tasked with
LGBT activism or whatever

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.950
over the years, the decades,
since the last millennium

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.780
and before any of you--

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.900
long before your
parents were born.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.890
By the way, I turned 70 a
month ago, and it is great.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.540
And I want you to know that--

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.730
I mean, this is important.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.450
I mean, don't rush
it, but you are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.640
going to have such a
great time when you're 70.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.320
And you can't imagine that now.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.539
I mean, you figure 30 is
going to be a nightmare.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.370
But it's so great.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.657
OK, so it wasn't always
this easy to be gay.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.240
And I'm still not
all that good at it,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.480
but in 1973, I had
the courage to write

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.740
under a pen name this book.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.820
This is the original hardcover.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.619
The publisher was so
horrified, the sales force was

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.160
so horrified that the publisher
had done this thing that they

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.350
basically tried to
suppress it and wouldn't.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.130
But there hadn't been a
book like this for kind

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.270
of coming out for boys.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.160
I didn't use my real name
because in 1973, some people

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.074
were brave.

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:48.990
I've never been brave.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.580
I'm still not brave.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.460
Anybody know who
Frank Kameny was?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.310
See, I mean, Frank
Kameny is our hero.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.830
And a woman named Barbara
Gittings, our hero.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.040
Frank Kameny and Barbara
Gittings and 10 other people

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.240
marched around the
White House in 1965,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.800
four years before Stonewall
and all this kind of stuff,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.200
with signs basically saying,
I'm homosexual, and my rights--

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.230
gay is good, and you
should respect my rights.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.906
I'm an American citizen.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.280
They were better
signs than that.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.460
But can you imagine the
courage to do that where

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.610
everybody hated you, except the
few people who secretly were

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.320
in the same situation,
but they pretended

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.099
to hate you even more so that
they wouldn't be found out?

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.640
Anyway, the world
was very different.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.640
So I did this thing.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.530
And I do these every 25 years.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.514
So this is 1973, and then
the sequel came out in 1998.

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:51.930
It was called "The Best Little
Boy in the World Grows Up,"

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.700
which is quite arguable.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.680
I'm not sure-- I'm
still basically 12.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.510
And now I'm working
on the trequel, which

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.582
Henry will certainly be
in, and other friends.

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:06.540
The reason for the
investment book, by the way,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.190
is you're all going
to be so rich,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.700
and I want you to spend it well.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.020
And I'm basically a
writer, not a talker,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.769
so I figure, if
give you the book,

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.480
if I don't do this part
well, it's not my problem.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.820
You've got a book.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.019
How often do you do that?

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.950
And this is a book that's going
to make you so rich, so OK.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.410
So what I wanted to do, which I
actually had never done before,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.980
so it may or may not
work, but I'm working

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.220
on the trequel, the third one.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.250
And I wrote a little
bit of it that I

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.050
thought might be
fun, just for you

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.590
to get a sense of what life
was like way back then for me

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.090
to start.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.810
And then I'll stop
with reading things

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.060
and tell you a few more things.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.460
Where'd it go?

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.560
But do you all know
the Broadway subway

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.950
line that goes all the
way up to 242nd Street?

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.000
I guess it's the 1?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.680
Somebody probably
takes it from wherever.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.900
Do you all live in Brooklyn?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.313
Anybody live in Manhattan?

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.290
And how many people know
who Barney Frank is?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.151
OK, so Barney was chairman of
the House Financial Services

00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:13.650
Committee.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.950
Dodd-Frank is Barney Frank
and all that kind of stuff.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.869
Anyway, so in the
new book, which

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.410
may be called "The Best Little
Boy in the World Gets Cranky,"

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.520
but I'm not really cranky.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.080
Bernie Sanders is cranky.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.540
He's a wonderful man,
but he is cranky.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.850
If you ever meet him,
he's a cranky man.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.710
But whatever the
title is, I'm going

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.224
to have kind of normal chapters.

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:35.640
But then I think
I'm going to have

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.024
alternative histories,
kind of in between some

00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:40.440
of the chapters of how the
world would have been different

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.100
if just one little thing
had been different,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.440
such as 77,000 votes in this
last election, or whatever,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.170
but OK.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.020
And the main reason
I'm reading this

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.050
is just to give you a
sense of what it was like.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.600
And some of you even-- it's
not all that easy these days.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.260
I don't know where you all
grew up, but for some of you,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.380
it was probably the
simplest thing in the world.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.090
Everybody at [INAUDIBLE] was
gay, or straight, or didn't

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.220
care, and it was fine.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.954
And the one of you who's
here from Mississippi,

00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:11.120
it was a nightmare, and
your parents kicked you out,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.619
even though it was just three
years ago, and all that stuff.

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.380
So it's still not all that easy.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.821
But in 1964, it was
really not easy.

00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.320
The other reason I
want to read this

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.710
is just to say how
lucky I've been

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.249
and how much luck has to do with
so much of people's success.

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:31.790
And so when we encounter people
who aren't as fortunate as we

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.260
are, it's not just because
we're so much smarter and better

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.760
looking.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.225
It may be a little bit because
this thing didn't happen

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:39.350
that I'm about to read you.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.126
This is an alternative history.

00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:42.500
"So I'm on the
subway, on the way

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.270
to school on an
unusually warm April

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.730
day at the end of my
senior year, attache case

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.620
behind the calves of my chinos.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.330
I know, what kind of
kid wears a jacket

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.640
and tie to school, an
all-male school, no less,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.530
let alone with an attache case?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.720
Do you even know what
an attache case is?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.730
Was I some sort of attache?

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.530
No, but it was 1964.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.390
I was co-editor of the
high school yearbook.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.630
Lots of prep schools and
country day schools and colleges

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.660
back then were all boys or
all girls, as Horace Mann was.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.100
No, I was not molested."

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.870
Any of you go to Horace
Mann, by the way?

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.850
OK, but you know that
they have this huge--

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.517
"No, I was not molested, but
knew almost all the teachers

00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:19.100
who, decades later, would make
the front page of the 'New York

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.450
Times.'

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.575
Backpacks had not yet
been invented, at least

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.950
not in our household, and I
had been up most of the night

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.620
finishing the last third of the
yearbook, laying out the photos

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.420
and making the crop
marks so that they'd

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.190
fit the pages and
the text, all this

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.062
with paper and rubber cement."

00:07:33.062 --> 00:07:34.520
Anybody know what
rubber cement is?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.272
Probably not.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:38.480
"And red pencil and the
kinds of things that would be

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.000
rendered obsolete minutes
later with Quark and Photoshop

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.930
and all the rest.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.535
Back then, the world
still used hot type,

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:46.160
better than how the
monks hand-lettered

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.520
Bibles or the block letters
Gutenberg or Ben Franklin used.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.440
In a blink of time,
we've gone from all that

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.200
to all but effortless,
all-but-free typesetting

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.130
and book design.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.820
But I digress.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.220
Look it up-- hot
type, molten lead.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.540
The thing is, as sleep-deprived
as I was, I was elated.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.030
This was it, the final
third of the yearbook

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.950
ready to hand the
printer that day,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.960
the final several
weeks of the final year

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.130
of a six-year endeavor soon
to culminate in graduation.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.710
Six years is a long time to
an 11-year-old just turned

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.490
17 and about to graduate, six
years of stress to perform well

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.532
in class and on tests and on
the soccer field, terrified

00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:23.990
of running into an
opposing player,

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.810
though that was what
we were supposed to do.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.300
And in the pool, swimming
a mile each morning,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.110
72 laps before class many
days, the only one in the pool.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.570
And on the wrestling
mat, after Coach Cramp--"

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.630
which was his real name.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.780
He was the swimming
coach, Coach Cramp--

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.659
"after Coach Cramp decided
I would never get fast

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.820
and handed me off to
Coach Quinn, who thought,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.830
wrongly, I might
make a good wrestler,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.260
which really terrified me
on more than one level.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.470
But how could I let on?

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.730
But all that was behind me.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.080
I had made it.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.250
Spring had sprung.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.850
[INAUDIBLE] tulips
were in bloom--

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.350
tech would 50 years later make
that front-page story as part

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.310
of the scandal--

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.760
and Harvard loomed.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.080
Once more, I had managed to
catch the train Neil Landau was

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.210
on, the bad boy in our
class with whom, therefore,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.310
I was desperately in love.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.217
He would be kicked
out a few weeks later,

00:09:15.217 --> 00:09:17.300
after those same six years
of stress and struggle,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.840
just days before
graduation, for smoking.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.740
Not even weed-- we didn't know
such things then-- tobacco.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.230
And not even on
campus, down at Lou

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.730
and Tito's soda shop at the
base of the stairs of the subway

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.964
at Broadway and 242nd Street.

00:09:29.964 --> 00:09:31.880
Granted, it wasn't his
only infraction, merely

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.750
the last straw.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.790
But that's what the
world was like in 1964,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.000
at least at Horace Mann.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.780
You could be
expelled for smoking.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.450
Imagine what would have happened
to you for being homosexual.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.690
Or so I imagined, more
or less constantly,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.600
which is why 10 minutes would
never pass without my checking

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.160
to make sure I was
adequately hiding

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.090
my secret, which I knew I would
have to hide all my life."

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.820
A couple years ago,
I flew to China

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.250
and came out with
Nixon's grandson.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.050
I mean, Nixon's
grandson I assume

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.810
is straight, but came out to
the vice president of China

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.940
and the whole top of the
Communist Party of China.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.580
But at the time, "I
would have to hide

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.700
all my life, a life that I
couldn't imagine extending much

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.830
beyond the safety of
my all-boys school

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.665
and the all-male college
for which I was bound.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:18.290
Was I checking out the girls on
the subway when my friends did?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.200
Was I being adequately
jockish to fool everybody?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.800
But oh, how in love
I was with Neil,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.080
who was as close as our class
could come to a juvenile

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.810
delinquent-- not
very close at all.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.850
And whether it was one
of those mornings when,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.980
my having boarded the
train at 66th Street,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.070
he simply got on at
79th, or one of those

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.220
when his not having boarded
at 79th, I got off at 86th

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.560
and took the next train so
I was to accidentally come

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.809
upon him as I went through car
to car looking for a good seat.

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.600
However it happened
that particular morning

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.000
that we were on the same
train, there he had been.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.150
And as he and I and a
couple of other classmates

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.520
finally got 242nd
Street, clattering down

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.539
the 112 steps to
the street level,

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:02.330
marveling at the summer
weather and ducking

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.538
into Lou and Tito's for a
coffee or vanilla egg cream

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:07.860
before class, I was
basically in heaven.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.200
Could it get better than this?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.410
Neil, the weather, Harvard
acceptance, yearbook completed?

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.370
[GASPS] Which is when a
horror gripped me like none

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.080
I had ever felt before.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.140
The yearbook-- the yearbook
that the entire school looked

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.500
forward to on class day, the
yearbook that the five prior

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.340
editions of which I,
like all my classmates,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.340
had on my shelf at home
chronicling our youthful

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.480
progress, the yearbook my older
brother Goliath had edited

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.040
before he went off to
Harvard four years earlier--

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.580
and not co-editor
either, like me,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.910
which was a source of no small
shame to me, who had to share

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.040
his glory with Larry [? Jay. ?]

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.500
The yearbook all my
classmates and I and faculty

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.900
would shortly be writing
little notes to each other in.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.160
What would I write in Neil's?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.794
What would he write in mine?

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:56.210
The yearbook that would shortly
be the talk of the school,

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.670
because for the first time
in Horace Mann's then 75-year

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.820
history, it had color
end pages and photos

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.615
throughout the previously
boring ad pages.

00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:05.990
I would get
advertiser permission

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.300
to sponsor pages of
photos above their logo.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.910
Had I chosen too many sports
photos, too many wrestling

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.460
photos, too many of Neil?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.340
The yearbook, the final third
of which, decades before backups

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.300
and Dropbox, was in my attache
case ready for the printer.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.770
Where was it?

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.600
I had been so taken
with the morning,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.030
and with Neil, and with
our impending freedom,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.360
I had left it on the train.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.370
In a city of 8 million
and a subway system

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.200
of 425 miles of track,
electrified by adrenalin

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.780
at levels never
before experienced,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.880
I bounded back up
those 112 stairs

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.280
in the slim hope the train
might still be in the station.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.115
242nd Street was, after
all, the last stop,

00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:45.740
so it would sit there
for a few minutes

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.370
before taking on passengers
for the long trip back south.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.560
The platform was empty.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.574
My life was very possibly over.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.240
I instinctively kept
running all the way

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.150
to the end of the station,
as if to catch the train,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.120
or perhaps outrun it to 238th
Street, where it would next

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.310
stop.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.160
And I ran all the way
to the control tower

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.650
I had never, in
six years of riding

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.650
the train to that station,
really paid attention

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.460
to and had certainly
never entered.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.200
I ran up those
stairs, wild-eyed,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.061
hoping against hope that they
could perhaps stop the train.

00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:18.560
There were a couple
of guys up there

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.101
manning the tower,
one of whom turned

00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:21.890
to me as I burst
in and said words

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.320
that changed my life forever.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.280
Are you looking for this?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.030
It seems they do a
walk-through at the end

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.010
of the line for
garbage and dead bodies

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.710
or whatever had been
lost and might be found.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.260
Can I just say that
if they hadn't,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.320
or that if they had just
tossed it in the trash,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.510
or if it had been kept
for its attache value

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.210
but the contents
tossed in the trash,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.910
I can't say for sure what my
life would have been like,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.400
but it would have
been very different.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.890
Conceivably, on some level,
I would have been forgiven.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.940
Conceivably Harvard would not
have rescinded my admission.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.705
But even then, and
who's to say, I

00:13:56.705 --> 00:13:58.330
would have been
forevermore the guy who

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.000
ran the wrong way at the
championship game and seconds

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.145
before victory scored a
touchdown for the other team.

00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:05.020
We all know that guy.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.850
The first guy in
Horace Mann history--

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.550
and Horace Mann history was
a big deal to a boy like me--

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.190
to have torpedoed the yearbook
that the staff had worked

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.500
so hard on, that
had cost so much--

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.995
color end plates did
not come cheap in 1964--

00:14:16.995 --> 00:14:19.120
and that the entire school
had been looking forward

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.910
to keeping for the
rest of their lives.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.490
This would be the defining
moment for the best little boy

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.970
in the world?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.050
And even though they
were entirely unrelated--

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.900
but wait, no, they
weren't unrelated.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.180
I had committed this
colossal catastrophe because

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.150
of my desperate love
for the unsuspecting,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.280
in truth not tremendously
bright, but wonderful,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.680
miraculous Neil Landau.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.260
So there was linkage.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.850
And maybe somebody, somehow
would figure it out.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.810
Presumably not, but
even so, I would know.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.190
The guilt and shame would
have been overwhelming.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.900
Unclean, people
would have shouted,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.390
pointing as
leperously I slunk by.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.492
My happy gene might have seen me
through"-- more on that later--

00:14:58.492 --> 00:14:59.950
"but I might today
be sleeping over

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.990
a subway grate in the
winter, on a park bench

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.740
the rest of the year.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.980
Perhaps in an
ultimate time travel,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.460
alternate reality irony,
the very bench that, as life

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.680
turned out I wound up
naming for Charles,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.600
who was for 17 years my
partner, and Henry knew.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.649
But he handed me
the attache case.

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:20.440
My heartbeat eventually
returned to normal.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.773
The yearbook was a huge success.

00:15:21.773 --> 00:15:26.500
No one knew that I had
that other terrible secret.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.082
And though I've certainly had
a few disappointments, one just

00:15:29.082 --> 00:15:31.540
now when I looked to see what
Neil did write in my yearbook

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.080
and see that he wrote nothing,
and even a little heartbreak,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.080
I try never, ever to
forget how lucky I've been,

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.240
in 1,000 ways."

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.180
Remind me to tell you.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.870
In fact, remind me to
tell you about John Rawls

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.532
and why Warren
Buffett is a Democrat.

00:15:46.532 --> 00:15:48.490
"I count my aggressive
atheist little blessings

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.810
quarter-hourly."

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.020
So I've been very lucky.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:59.210
The world was so different back
then that to have been gay,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.030
I mean, it was all-consuming.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.630
So I go to Harvard, and I am
the only gay person at Harvard.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.660
Probably not really true,
probably about 2,000 others,

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.880
but how would you know?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.070
They couldn't know about me.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.500
I couldn't know about them.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:21.520
My junior year, I realized
that there was one other,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.490
because he was looking
at the same guys I was.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.790
And he was the resident
tutor in our dorm.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.320
And everybody loved him.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.790
He was such a character.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.789
He was fat and
hard to understand.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:33.580
He had a big cigar.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.620
Motherficker this, motherfucker
that, all this kind of stuff.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.650
But he was so smart, and he
was so interested in politics,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.020
and he would do battle with--

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.280
the tables were for eight, and
there would be 10 or 12 or 14

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.460
people all crowded around
with their trays of food

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.235
on their laps so they
could hear this guy.

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:55.360
And they would do battle
with him, and none of them

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.260
could come close.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.450
And these were
smart-- most of them--

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.780
smart guys.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.430
And I noticed he was kind
of paying special attention

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.790
to the people that I was
paying special attention to.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.960
And I went, oh my god,
there's one other person.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.980
Why does it have to be him?

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.560
I mean, he's wonderful
and popular, but no.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.259
Why can't it be one of
my roommates, two of whom

00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:20.050
I was in love with?

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.633
One went on to be
mayor of Cincinnati,

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:23.020
and another went
dean of students

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.603
at the University
of British Columbia.

00:17:24.603 --> 00:17:26.275
And now they know
all about my life

00:17:26.275 --> 00:17:27.400
and all this kind of stuff.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.260
We're still friends.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.660
But no, just this guy, OK.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.610
That was 1967-ish.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.810
Cut to-- what is it now--
four or five years ago.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.160
And we never talked
about it back in college,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.660
and it'll be years
before either one of us

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.370
came out or did
anything about it.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.740
We just kind of were so
lonely and so yearning on.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.480
Eventually we became
aware and all that stuff.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.780
So now it's five
years ago, and I

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.370
am one of the groomsman
in his wedding.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.100
He's no longer a resident
tutor at Harvard.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.690
His wedding in Massachusetts,
in attendance are Nancy Pelosi

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.850
and I think John
Kerry and all that.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.199
His name was Barney
Frank, and he went on

00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:23.740
to become chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.970
And he had been totally lonely,
the only gay person at Harvard,

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:28.630
in his mind.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.850
I was totally all that.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.600
That's how much the
world has changed.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.590
And you know all
this, and you saw

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.120
the president of
the United States

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.420
in the second inaugural
talking about our journey

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.290
is not complete.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:49.030
From Selma to Stonewall, and
Seneca Falls to Stonewall,

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.950
it's so amazing what's changed.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.030
But it took a long time.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.230
So one of the things I remember
is in the '70s, after I--

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.880
so I finally came
out when I was 23.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.270
And you could write
a book about it.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.264
And people had to use pen names,
and they had to be careful.

00:19:10.264 --> 00:19:11.680
And when they went
to Fire Island,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.935
they wouldn't call
collect from the pay phone

00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:15.310
because it would
say Fire Island,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.720
and they couldn't
have people know

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.920
that they were on Fire Island.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.169
Even though there are actually
quite a few communities

00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:22.980
in Fire Island
that are straight,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.390
it still could be
a telltale sign.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.450
You could lose your job.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.630
You could all kinds of stuff.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.640
And we had, I remember, somebody
trying to get me involved.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.530
I was still only
26 or something.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.290
And one of the old people--

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.130
32 or whatever--

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.250
Henry appears to be 27, but
I think you're 32, right?

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.640
Something like that.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.430
So these old guys all trying
to get me involved, and we

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.500
had a little group called
[? Nypack, ?] I think

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.970
is what it was called.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.050
And we would meet with people
running for office, including

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.460
somebody who wanted to become
governor one day, Andrew Cuomo.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.330
And these politicians
would have to come.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.880
Some of us wouldn't
even use our last names.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.580
I was writing for "New
York" magazine back then

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.209
under my real name,
but the excerpts

00:20:15.209 --> 00:20:16.750
of "The Best Little
Boy in the World"

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.020
were under the pen
name, because again, I'm

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.350
very brave and courageous.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.030
And you could see,
I mean, Cuomo,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.804
it was not comfortable for him.

00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:30.720
And I don't blame him.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.740
It was 1976 or whatever it was.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.190
But we've come so far.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.770
I'd rather leave the
Don't Ask, Don't Tell

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.770
and DOMA and anything
you want to--

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.080
trans stuff and whatever you
want to talk about to Q and A.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.030
I just want to tell
you two more things.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.810
You have now the only investment
guide you'll ever need--

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.657
I mean ever.

00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:55.240
But it's a little
embarrassing to have

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.610
to revise it every five
or six years, which I do,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.340
because they do things like they
invent the internet, you know,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.510
where gold is no longer
fixed at $35 an ounce by law.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.830
So the basics never change,
but some of the details do.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.290
But in addition to the only
investment guide you'll ever

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.900
need, I've written
the only relationship

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.720
guide you'll ever need.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.650
And since this is
possibly the only time

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.017
I will get to meet you,
although some of you, I hope,

00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:22.600
are going to come on Wednesday
to meet Joe Biden and all that,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.420
and others will be in my pool
on July 4th for a lobster.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.970
Henry will give you
all the details.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.800
In case this is the
only time I see you,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.490
you need to know what little
I know about relationships.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.100
I didn't give you that
book, the only relationship

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.720
guide you'll ever need,
because it's only one sentence.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.150
And even I wasn't--

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.260
there's not a large
enough font in the world

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.880
to justify putting that in a
book and charging $14 for it.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.090
But this actually, for
what it's worth, to me,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.924
this is kind of 80% of it.

00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:55.840
The other 20%, you could
write books and books

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.730
and books and books.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.500
But 80% of it is be
nice to each other,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.450
as I'm sure you already are, and
find humor in the compromises,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.700
as I'm sure you already do--

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.560
they're worth it.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.570
And those of you who
are in relationships,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.720
I know one of you, and
I know your partner

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.660
and all that stuff.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.770
I mean, Charles and
I were so different.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:29.120
He couldn't spell or
punctuate or add or subtract.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.150
But he could make--

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.730
Mister, you probably have some
of his clothes in your closet.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.490
If you have any Ellen Tracy or
Anne Klein or Charles Nolan,

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.960
you have his clothes.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.820
He could make
anything look good.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.980
We were once at a thing
where Arianna Huffington

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.580
had to be the Queen of
England for a little skit

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.550
that we were doing at a big
thing, but with no notice.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.050
And our little team, she had
to be the Queen of England.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.800
And everybody looked
to Charles because he

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.925
was going to figure it out.

00:22:57.925 --> 00:23:00.680
And he said, all right,
get me a tablecloth

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.400
and a container of tinfoil.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.850
And they went to the kitchen
and found their thing.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.700
She looked more like the Queen
of England than the queen.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.330
Anyway, so Charles
was amazing that way.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.550
I can't draw a straight line.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.730
I can't draw a curvy line.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.740
I have no fashion
sense whatsoever,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.460
as you can see,
on and on and on.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.590
But we found humor
in the compromises.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.090
Anyway, so that's that part.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.140
The other thing I want to
tell you is what motivates me

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.810
and why--

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.630
and this is going to
sound corny, I'm sure,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.530
to most of you,
but I believe it.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:42.189
I believe that after 10,000
human generations, which

00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:43.480
is about what it's been, right?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.770
20 years divided into 200,000
years or so of humans--

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:53.230
10,000 human generations
of struggling and suffering

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.260
and shivering and itching
and smelling horrible

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.387
and being terrified
of saber-tooth tigers

00:23:58.387 --> 00:23:59.220
and everything else.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.111
And really, except
until very recently,

00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:03.610
I'm sure there were
nice sunny days,

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.110
and they didn't
realize how awful

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.320
it was because they didn't know
that people could conceivably

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.180
live past 15 and all
that kind of stuff.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.765
But it was horrible.

00:24:13.765 --> 00:24:14.890
I mean, they had no Velcro.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.900
They had no fat-free cheese.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.260
They had no Google.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.010
And you had to drive
their own cars.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.960
Can you imagine?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.560
They didn't even
have autonomous.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.730
Anyway, after 10,000
human generations,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.320
we are alive, and not just alive
like in Bangladesh or Bolivia

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.169
or some lovely nice
place, but in the center

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:35.960
of the whole thing.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.600
And not just in the center
of the whole thing in New

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.020
York or London or Shanghai.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.870
But in the-- today.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.970
I'm not normally
allowed to come here.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.160
I'd love to get one
of those little passes

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.470
so I could come here
all the time, just

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.030
to be able to get free hot
chocolate and all that stuff.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.920
But we are-- this is it.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.410
After 10,000 human
generations, we

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:02.320
are either on the cusp of
unimaginable prosperity,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.546
of the type actually that
we enjoy ourselves now,

00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:05.920
but most of the
world doesn't get

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.010
to live the way you and I do.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.690
And by the way, a cusp
is for good things.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.930
Brink or precipice
is for bad things.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.600
Or-- OK, politicians like
constantly, oh, we're

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.330
on the brink of-- no.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.760
Anyway, we're on the cusp
of unimaginable prosperity,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.580
and by the way, mortality, as
Bill Gates said 30 years ago,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.080
it's just a software problem.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.270
I have a small chance
of living forever,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.460
which I'm really enjoying
that small chance.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.480
I'm not counting on it.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.880
But I floss, and
I do these things,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.540
because if you play your cards
right, you could live forever.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.760
You guys have a much
better chance than I do.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.910
And some people, oh, who
would want to do that?

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.610
Well, I do.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.300
Or at least I'd like to be the
one who decides when I stop.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.850
And all shriveled up and bald?

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.580
No, if they can do mortality,
I can have as much hair

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.150
as I want, and I'll be tall
and anything I want to be.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.310
I mean, we are at
this amazing moment.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.450
I have magic.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.685
I have more magic in this pocket
than Merlin ever dreamed of.

00:26:02.685 --> 00:26:04.060
I have all the
world's knowledge,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.410
all the world's symphonies.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.590
I mean, the kings, czars,
we live-- it's amazing.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.680
Or we're on the brink of
hurtling off the rails

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.210
and making the planet,
this little spaceship that

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.080
were 2 and 1/2 billion
passengers when I was born,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.740
and there are 7.5 or 7.6
billion now-- triple.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.430
And I'm still, as you
can see, a young man.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.200
We really could,
between nuclear winter,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.740
which is not a good
solution to global warming,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.470
and bioterrorism
and all the other--

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.380
we could make this spaceship--
not probably in the next--

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.910
we won't all die in the
next 10 or 20 years.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.120
But we could, if we don't
get on a sustainable

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.030
path in the next 10 or
20 years, it's not clear

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.850
that the cockroaches
10,000 years from now

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.100
won't be looking back
and telling little baby

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.130
cockroaches, saying, you're
not going to believe this.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.330
But once upon a time, like a
second ago in geological time,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.440
there was this species.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.862
They thought they were so cool,
and they made these motels

00:27:01.862 --> 00:27:03.570
with sticky floors
that you can check in,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.130
but you can't check
out all that stuff.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.480
I don't know--
actually does anybody

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.590
know roach motels anymore?

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.680
Do they still make them?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.420
And the cockroaches
will be here,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.580
and the planet will be
here, but we may not,

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.640
just like I think it's Easter
Island or one of those, where

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.157
the whole thing just
collapsed because they started

00:27:20.157 --> 00:27:22.740
too much erosion from too much
firewood because there were too

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.890
many people, and it just got
out of balance, and it was over.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:31.050
My feeling is, we have such a
responsibility to the 10,000

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.420
generations who suffered
and strived and did

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.867
so much ingenious thinking
and trying to figure out

00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:38.450
whether the Moon goes around the
Earth or we go around the Sun

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.570
or what.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.430
All those folks, we owe it
to them not to screw this up.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.900
And to the next
10,000 generations,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.710
we especially owe it to
them to let them have it.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.290
So it's a huge deal
for me to come and get

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.660
to talk to you, because
you are at the center

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.340
of this whole thing.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.110
And you're not each, I realize,
the CEO of Google or Alphabet

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.650
or whatever.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.470
But this is a big deal.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.700
Come on Wednesday if you can.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.255
And for the Democrats--

00:28:07.255 --> 00:28:09.630
I'm sorry, because I'm not
probably supposed to do this--

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.840
but if you're not going
to run for office,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.590
then help us get some balance
back into this government.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.650
Because the Trump vision and
the Mitch McConnell vision

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.570
and the Scott Pruitt climate
change is a hoax vision--

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:24.970
he runs the EPA--

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.600
this is not the way
we are on the cusp.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.100
This is the way
we're on the brink.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.840
OK, way too much.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.650
I'm done.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.420
Would anyone like
to ask a question?

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.080
And if you don't, Henry will.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.880
HENRY HARDING:
[INAUDIBLE] in the mic

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.762
back there and the
mic back there.

00:28:44.762 --> 00:28:46.220
That might be a
little bit too much

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.261
from a logistics standpoint
to have people get up

00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:48.980
and walk over.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.300
So I might just,
if it's all right,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.924
hand this mic around to you guys
if you have specific questions

00:28:52.924 --> 00:28:54.972
and be little Vanna
White for a second.

00:28:54.972 --> 00:28:56.930
But I actually do have
a question to start off.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.356
So I am not joking.

00:28:58.356 --> 00:28:59.980
I want to hear about
the password hint.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.970
So to the extent that you
claim that you've invented it,

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.900
that's my primary inquiry.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:02.990
ANDY TOBIAS: To
the extent that I

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.660
claim I'm the best little boy
in the world, I never lie.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.220
So you've all heard of Quicken.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.020
Before Quicken, there was Andrew
Tobias' Managing Your Money.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.940
And I only brought one
version of it because--

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.670
this you've probably
never seen-- in the book

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.996
that I wrote under a pen
name, I disguised everything.

00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:20.120
I didn't really go to Yale.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.703
I went to Harvard,
but I made it Yale.

00:29:21.703 --> 00:29:22.850
That makes it a novel.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.000
So people say, are you going
to write another novel?

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.486
I never wrote a
first, any novel.

00:29:27.486 --> 00:29:28.610
It's hard to write a novel.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.930
I don't have the
talent to do that.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.096
They say, of course you did.

00:29:31.096 --> 00:29:33.680
You say, changing it from
Harvard to Yale doesn't make it

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.220
a novel.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.220
Changing Henry's name to
Harry doesn't make it a novel.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.270
Anyway, so I changed the
company I worked for to IBM

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.250
to show that I was--

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.000
because I went to
Harvard Business School,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.520
and that was kind of
IBM-ish, and straight-laced,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.620
and suit and tie, and
all this kind of stuff.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.280
And then, ironically, my
software, Managing Your Money,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.320
IBM did--

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.200
anybody heard of the PCjr?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.490
There was a thing--

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.990
how old are you?

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.700
You've got to be like 100.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.580
So it was on Apple too, and
it was on the very first Mac

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.705
and all that kind of stuff.

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:13.730
And it was on the IBM
PC with floppy disks.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.470
Has anybody seen
a 5 and 1/4 inch?

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.750
This is a 5 and 1/4
inch floppy disk.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.890
We had people calling
in the help desk

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.010
to try to cut them
with scissors.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:30.290
Anyway, but the
PCjr was terrible.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.610
I mean, IBM did a
terrible job with it.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.200
But my face was on the front,
and I'm an IBM part number.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.610
And this was the cartridge that
you would put it in the PCjr.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.950
So for a minute, I have no--

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.210
I can't program anything.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.532
I can't code.

00:30:45.532 --> 00:30:47.990
I know a little bit about, if
you have an open parentheses,

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.715
you really--

00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:50.840
if, then, else, you better
have a close parentheses

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.964
and all this kind of stuff.

00:30:51.964 --> 00:30:55.490
But I just had the great
job of saying, well,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.867
could it have a word
processor inside too?

00:30:57.867 --> 00:31:00.200
And then they would go off,
and we designed our own word

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.670
processor, has commands that are
completely different from Word

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.980
Perfect back then or Word.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.390
Could it do your taxes?

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.620
How about life expectancy?

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.960
I'd like to have it tell
me how long I can live.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.320
It was fantastic, this software.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.650
We decided it should be
password protected, because you

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.160
got all your
checking stuff on it,

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.920
and you got all your stock
portfolios and stuff.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.950
But what if you forget your
password or you lose it?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:36.186
So they were going to do this
thing where, I think by then,

00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:38.810
they would give you four choices
of where you go to high school

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.727
or whatever.

00:31:39.727 --> 00:31:41.060
I'm not even sure they had that.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.893
I think maybe you just
put in your password,

00:31:42.893 --> 00:31:45.390
and if you forgot it,
you were out of luck.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.400
I can't remember.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.629
But I said to this
wonderful guy, Jerry Rubin,

00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:51.170
who deserves all
the credit for this.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.682
I said, Jerry, why
don't we do this?

00:31:52.682 --> 00:31:54.390
Why don't we let them
say their password,

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:59.810
and then they can put
in a hint and say,

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.844
it's the name of the dog
that we had up at the beach,

00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:06.260
or whatever the hint is where
they'll definitely remember,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.150
because they wrote
their hint themselves.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.590
And he said, OK,
we could do that.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:10.269
And we did.

00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:12.560
And it's still a good way to
do it, and a lot of places

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.610
don't do that.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.640
And yes, I invented
the password hint.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.690
And yes, I forgot to patent it.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.217
And if I had patented
it, I wouldn't

00:32:20.217 --> 00:32:21.800
need to ask you to
come to this thing,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.400
because I could just pay for
the whole election myself.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.330
So I did.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.960
HENRY HARDING: OK, so
with that, a question.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.320
I'm just going to hand
her the mic, I think.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.050
Walking back there is going
to be way too awkward.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:36.904
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:36.904 --> 00:32:38.320
Thank you so much
for coming here.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.445
This has been really great.

00:32:39.445 --> 00:32:42.680
I have a quick question more
to do with the political side

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.300
of your life.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:43.820
ANDY TOBIAS: Yes.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.069
AUDIENCE: Which is that as
all the people in this room

00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:48.980
are looking at their own
forms of political engagement

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.320
with the current
administration, if you see,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.890
given your experience
in the field,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.890
if there are
particular engagement

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.860
strategies with administrations
like this one that you think

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.960
are more effective than
others, particularly

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.020
coming from individuals
who are LGBTQ--

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.740
I think that's probably a
representative constituency

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.380
in here--

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.390
and who may find that this
administration is extremely

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:19.760
hostile to them and to
their families, what

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.520
have you seen as infective,
really effective engagement

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.740
strategies for people
like us to be able to use

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.080
in administration like this?

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.790
ANDY TOBIAS: Well,
none of us really

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.040
has that much experience
with administration

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.780
like this because
there's never been one.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.840
You can look back to
1933 in another country

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.252
and try to get a sense of
what that would be like.

00:33:38.252 --> 00:33:40.460
I have a little column every
day at andrewtobias.com,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.950
and tomorrow's talks
pretty directly

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.640
about some of that stuff.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.280
But I think the good
news on our issue, which

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.160
is a very important issue to us,
and it's a very important issue

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:59.120
to the country, but it's not an
existential issue for mankind,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.594
I think the good news is
the cat is out of the bag,

00:34:03.594 --> 00:34:05.510
or the toothpaste out
of the tube or whatever.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.120
Enough Americans, even
including Republicans,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.969
not necessarily
Republicans in Congress,

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:17.480
but enough Americans and enough
people in the civilized world

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.510
have opened their hearts,
and gotten to know us,

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.429
and opened their minds that,
especially among young people--

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.920
not that we mustn't
always be vigilant,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.810
and not that we're
entirely there yet,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.770
because we're not
entirely there yet.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.519
And we're certainly
not entirely there yet

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:35.030
in Mississippi or Uganda,
which Uganda is not

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.250
part of the civilized
world, and Mississippi is.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.239
But they need to get
further along with us.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:44.239
But I think in
terms of our stuff,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.929
we want to just keep supporting
HRC and the task force

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.969
and GLSEN and Lambda
and all these things,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.340
and, frankly, Democrats.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.070
Because all the
progress we've made

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:02.340
has, from the beginning
of this effort,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.710
which was basically in the '60s
is sort of when it started,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:12.770
Democrats pretty quickly became
almost unanimously on our side.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.020
There were Southern Democrats
not so much at first,

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.040
and there were
issues and all that.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.998
But basically, especially
in the last 20 years,

00:35:17.998 --> 00:35:20.270
when all these progress
legislatively happened,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.790
Democrats are
unanimously with us.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.042
And Republicans, not out in the
countryside, human Republicans,

00:35:26.042 --> 00:35:28.250
but the ones who were elected
in Congress, especially

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.142
with the extreme polarization
from all the gerrymandering

00:35:31.142 --> 00:35:32.600
and why everything
has gotten more,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.045
they have to appeal to their
most extreme base and all

00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:36.830
that, Republicans
have been blocking us

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.840
on everything, every
step of the way,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.060
and continue to,
to a large extent.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:46.340
And there will be judges
that Trump gets confirmed--

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.870
hopefully not Gorsuch.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.510
One of my gay friends is
one of his best friends,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.160
and he assures me
he's a lovely guy.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.609
And I'm sure he is
a lovely guy, but he

00:35:54.609 --> 00:35:56.150
believes that
corporations are people

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.790
and all this kind of stuff.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.889
So I think-- and I
don't get a commission.

00:36:02.889 --> 00:36:04.430
And I don't want to
be an ambassador.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.410
I'm not even treasurer
anymore after 18 years,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.750
but I am getting
paid on Wednesday.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:13.640
At the annual LGBT dinner,
after 18 years at $1 a year,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.676
they're going to
give me a 5-foot--

00:36:15.676 --> 00:36:17.050
bigger than this
screen, I think.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.780
I'm looking for like 5 feet
by 2 and 1/2 foot check

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.486
for 18 years at $1 a year.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:24.860
We're haggling
over the interest,

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.740
because it seems to me I
should get interest, right?

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.810
But this dinner,
where last year we

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.640
had Hillary and
Barbara Streisand,

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.240
and in the three previous
years we had President Obama,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.590
we kind of took it for granted.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.423
Of course the president
of the United States

00:36:41.423 --> 00:36:44.880
would come and talk to the
LGBT Democratic fundraiser.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.880
This year we got Joe
Biden, and Whoopi Goldberg,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.899
and Jane Lynch,
and Billy Porter,

00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:50.440
and Barney Frank's
going to be there,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.770
and David Mixner is
going to be there,

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.630
and Ambassador Hormel,
who was the very

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.120
first openly gay
ambassador in America

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.520
ever to be an ambassador.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.790
And now we have like seven,
or we did until Trump.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.480
Anyway, so I don't
say this because I

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.840
get a commission on it.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.510
And I don't want a job.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.690
But I actually believe,
biased though I might be,

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.230
that actually to
support Democrats,

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.640
or to run for
office, but I don't

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.530
want to have you leave Google
before your option's best.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.360
To run for office
would be great.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.130
To support friends
and people that

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.740
inspire you to run for office
would be great, especially

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.824
in places that are purple.

00:37:30.824 --> 00:37:32.240
If you get a chance
to be assigned

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.406
to North Carolina for Google
or something like that,

00:37:34.406 --> 00:37:38.180
we need your vote there, not
quite so much in New York.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:45.980
But to be involved in politics,
and to be respectful of people

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.050
who don't agree with us.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:53.120
Hillary, at last year's dinner,
I was as far from Hillary as I

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.350
am from you, [INAUDIBLE],,
when she said--

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.730
she had pneumonia.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.630
We didn't know it at the time.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.250
But that was that period
she had pneumonia.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.700
And she was with friends--

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.320
granted 800 friends, and there
was press there, I guess,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.900
and so she shouldn't
have said this.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.361
But she said that thing about
the basket of the deplorables,

00:38:13.361 --> 00:38:15.110
that half the people
voting for Trump are,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.140
and the other half are--

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.420
it was a dumb and
unfortunate thing to say.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.000
And even that little thing--
there were much bigger factors,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.930
but that alone might have been
enough to change the thing.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:32.120
But with a few exceptions--
obviously virulent racists are

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.290
deplorable--

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.860
but most people who voted
for Trump are not deplorable.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.630
They were bamboozled.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:43.640
And we need to talk to them with
respect, which they deserve,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.680
and not tell them that they're
idiots, which they're not.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.010
But they have sure been fooled
by Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.040
and Fox News and Roger Ailes--

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.090
I'm not even sure how much
peace he should rest in--

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:03.410
and Trump, who has
told us, not only

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.190
are we going to get
tired of winning.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.190
I mean, we're going to
be winning so much we're

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.750
going to get tired of winning.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.479
We are going to have great
health care, as I guess all

00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:12.770
you do because we're at Google.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:17.200
But great health care,
not for the same price.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.290
Everybody's going to
have great health care.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.040
And not just less,
at a fraction--

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.770
nay-- and how often you hear
nay anymore, other than a horse?

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.540
Nay, at a tiny
fraction of the cost.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.510
These are his words.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.135
You are going to have
great health care

00:39:32.135 --> 00:39:34.520
at a tiny fraction of the cost.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.200
It's 1933 all over again.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.770
How many of you
know that Trump kept

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.400
a book of Hitler's speeches
by his bedside for years?

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.579
Nobody, it's amazing.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:46.620
So my friend Marie Brenner
wrote a profile of him

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.530
for "Vanity Fair" about
17 or 18 years ago.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.000
And his ex-wife,
Ivana, told her that.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.881
And she said, what?

00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:56.380
He kept a book of
Hitler's speeches?

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:56.875
What?

00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:58.830
She said, yeah, it's in my
divorce attorney's safe.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.910
You want to see the book?

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.624
And so she goes to Donald--

00:40:03.624 --> 00:40:05.040
and by the way, I
call him Donald.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.320
I have friends
who golf with him.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.810
I have friends who--

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.380
one of his bankers
is a friend of mine.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.080
When he was just Donald
Trump, OK, not my cup of tea,

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.750
but go ahead.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.270
Be Donald Trump.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.290
But to run the world?

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.840
No.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.020
So anyway, Maria goes to
Donald and says, what?

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.650
Is this true?

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.580
You have a book of Hitler's
speeches by your bedside?

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.300
And he got all defensive.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.449
He said, well,
first of all, Marie,

00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:33.990
it's not a book of
Hitler's speeches.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.940
It's "Mein Kampf."

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.570
OK, great.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.090
You've got "Mein Kampf"
by your bedside, OK.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.870
And second, it was a
gift to me by the head

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.060
of Paramount Pictures, a
Hollywood movie studio,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.410
and he's Jewish.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.710
So give me a break, Marie.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.610
So Marie goes to
Marty Davis, who

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.840
is the head of Paramount
Pictures at the time.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.430
He's since met his ward.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.830
And what about it, Marty?

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.840
As so Marty says,
well, first of all,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.440
even though it doesn't
matter, and even

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.330
though I do run a Hollywood
studio, I'm not Jewish.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:11.610
And second, no, it
wasn't "Mein Kampf."

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:17.140
It's a book of Hitler's
speeches called "My New Order."

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.630
So, A, that's true.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.850
And B, I went on after I--

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.755
and "Vanity Fair" then
republished all this last year.

00:41:23.755 --> 00:41:25.796
And it was in "Vanity
Fair," and I wrote about it

00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:28.500
about 1,000 times in my
column, which six people read.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.820
Thank you and you and you.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.730
It was seven until
my mom passed on.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.300
But anyway, so, I mean,
it's been out there,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.406
and some people know this.

00:41:38.406 --> 00:41:41.402
And by the way, if you're like
the head of marketing for P&amp;G

00:41:41.402 --> 00:41:43.110
or something, that's
an interesting thing

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.970
to have by your bedside,
because how do you

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.730
influence mass psychology,
and how do you--

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.470
OK?

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.880
And it's not dispositive.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.802
I'm not saying that
Trump is Hitler.

00:41:53.802 --> 00:41:56.010
But I'm not sure Hitler
wanted to be Hitler when he--

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.480
he just wanted to make America--

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.170
I mean, make Germany great
again and get China and Mexico--

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.320
I mean, get England and
France's boot off his neck.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.150
You know, and get
rid of the Jews--

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.510
I mean, I'm sorry, the Muslims.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.320
You know, I mean,
some parallels.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.080
This is scary stuff.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.030
Oh, so I went on eBay,
and I bought the book.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.920
And I now have the
book by my bedside.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.760
And I haven't read
the actual speeches.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.060
It's a lot of speeches,
and I'm a real slow reader.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.000
But the introduction and the
forward, one by a French guy

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.270
and one by a British, the
book came out in 1941.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:34.080
And the copy I have, I told this
story last night to a friend

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.590
who said, is it signed?

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.570
Is it autographed?

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:38.850
No, it's not
autographed by Hitler.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:43.310
But the forward and
the introduction

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.110
tackled the question of, as
you read the speeches that

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.480
follow, what is
there about this that

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.730
allowed this man to be
democratically elected

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:54.050
in 1933, which he was?

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.300
He didn't have 50% of the
vote, but he had enough.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.870
Neither did Trump.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:58.960
He had enough.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.590
And you read these analyses,
descriptions of his rhetoric

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.580
and his style, and
you say, oh my god.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.920
And so I took some
of the excerpts

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.970
and put them on my little
blog post thing every day.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.720
I put them on this
blog post, and I didn't

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.890
say what they were about.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.848
And everybody assumed I
was writing about Trump

00:43:18.848 --> 00:43:20.280
and that I was taking an ex--

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.590
little bit stilted language.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.991
Well, yeah, it was from
1941, and they wrote a little

00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:24.490
differently.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.400
One was British.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.110
So I don't want to
make too much of that,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:33.150
but this is a time like
no other in our history.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.380
And we may somehow get out
of it and right ourselves

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.910
before too much
more damage is done.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.670
But an awful lot of damage
has already been done.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.910
Around the world,
I have no problem.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.650
China's great.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.510
Russia would be
lovely if they didn't

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.810
have a journalist-murdering
and autocrat,

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.970
kleptocrat, plutocrat.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.290
But China's fine.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.950
But they're picking up the
slack that we're-- we're losing

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.370
our ability to help
lead the world,

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.650
which isn't necessarily
great for us.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.510
But it's also not
great for the world,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.450
because the world
needs sober leadership.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:19.040
In Barack Obama, I think we
had the most solid, cerebral,

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.100
sensible, wonderful
leader of my lifetime

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.830
and in a long, long time.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.740
And Clinton, other than a
couple of obvious issues,

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.720
was terrific as well.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.400
I don't think Bush
was in that league.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.020
And Trump is in a whole--
it's a whole other ball game.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.520
This is not American democracy.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.226
This is a big problem.

00:44:38.226 --> 00:44:40.350
If anybody is brave enough
to ask another question,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.750
it will be the yes or no answer.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.750
HENRY HARDING: Does anyone
have another question

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.240
they want to offer up here?

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.597
I saw your hand previously.

00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:50.910
AUDIENCE: So how often
do you encounter people

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.212
telling you your first
book changed their lives?

00:44:54.212 --> 00:44:55.170
ANDY TOBIAS: I'm sorry?

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.690
AUDIENCE: How often to you run
into people who came to you,

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.540
say your first book
changed their lives?

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.180
ANDY TOBIAS: Well, every
once in a while it happens.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.820
And it's the nicest--

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.660
way better than any royalties
ever could have been.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.610
AUDIENCE: Was it translated
into different languages?

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.690
ANDY TOBIAS: No, and I kind of--

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:19.970
well, yes, it was translated by
someone from Google, actually.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.730
It was translated into Romanian.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.960
So I get an email.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.990
People don't-- sometimes
I'll meet somebody in person.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:29.552
Other times it's an
email or something,

00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:31.010
including a guy
who just came-- you

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.310
know, people are still just
coming out when they're 48

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.990
or whatever.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.650
It's amazing.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:35.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it was given to me

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.397
as a gift when I first came out.

00:45:37.397 --> 00:45:38.230
ANDY TOBIAS: Really.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.722
AUDIENCE: Somebody
older than me.

00:45:39.722 --> 00:45:40.930
Well, he was 30 at that time.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.470
ANDY TOBIAS: Yes, old.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.511
AUDIENCE: He was like,
this book changed my life.

00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:45.350
I hope we change yours as well.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.320
ANDY TOBIAS: Well,
it's very gratifying.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.390
And so this guy from Romania--

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.670
I think only five people
have read it in Romanian.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.640
I'd love to see it in Spanish
or some other languages.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.400
And one other thing
to say about that

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.430
is, so I used to get these
wonderful hand-written letters

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:05.140
or typewritten letters
in the '70s and the '80s.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.150
You wrote the story of my life,
and all this kind of stuff.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.682
They were very nice letters.

00:46:10.682 --> 00:46:14.545
And then Amazon was invented,
and it had five stars,

00:46:14.545 --> 00:46:16.510
and it made me feel
really good, or 4 and 1/2,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.301
or whatever it had.

00:46:17.301 --> 00:46:18.910
It was very nice.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.250
And then I stopped
looking for a long time.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:24.520
And I looked back maybe
10 years ago or something,

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.660
and it was down to three stars.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.230
And there were all
these one-star reviews.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:33.620
And at first, you know,
desperate for love

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.520
before all other
things, I think, oh no.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.192
This is terrible.

00:46:39.192 --> 00:46:40.900
Basically, they were
saying, what a dick.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.445
I mean, this guy,
he was a homophobe,

00:46:42.445 --> 00:46:45.380
and he is so impressed
with himself,

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.230
and he's a dreadful person.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.230
Why do people like this
book and all this stuff?

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:53.370
And at first I was
a little crushed.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.870
And then I realized-- maybe
this is just a rationalization--

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.750
but I realized, this is great.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.521
This is really a wonderful
barometer of how much progress

00:47:01.521 --> 00:47:02.020
we've made.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.200
Because today's kids cannot--

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.520
I mean, they can process.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.540
They're real smart.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.990
But they can't fully grasp
how different the world was.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:14.020
And even some of my
peers have forgotten.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.700
Because now you go back and
you read it, and you think,

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.360
yeah, what a dick.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.080
But the world was
very different.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.740
And I agree.

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.310
I was a dick.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:25.420
But we evolve.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.830
And anyway, so the third one,
hopefully people won't think

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.500
I'm--

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.541
well, they probably will.

00:47:30.541 --> 00:47:32.510
But anyway, thank
you for the question.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.520
And I'm glad you--

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.665
HENRY HARDING: More
questions right up here.

00:47:35.665 --> 00:47:38.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I hate to
take it back to the election.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.740
But I wanted to ask you, since
you're a Democratic Party

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.730
insider, for lack of a better
term, if you could give us

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.060
your thoughts on what you
think really transpired

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.660
and what steps the party's
taking in terms of a postmortem

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.910
to make sure something like
this doesn't happen again?

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.076
ANDY TOBIAS: Great question.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.960
You know, a lot
of things happen,

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.490
and here's how I would rank why
this unbelievable perfect storm

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.690
tragedy happened.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.920
The most important thing
is, without ill intent,

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.290
the media assured everybody that
this man had absolutely no path

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.930
to 270.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.340
So if you stay home,
not a big thing.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.870
If you vote for Jill Stein
or Gary Johnson, not going to

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:24.730
change the world.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.330
If you even want to do a
little-- forgive my language--

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.920
a little fuck you to whatever.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.527
I'm not happy.

00:48:30.527 --> 00:48:32.860
I mean, of course I don't
want Trump, but I'm not happy,

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.510
and you should know it,
so I'll vote for him just

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.890
to kind of let-- you
know, because he's not

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.110
going to be president, so
it's safe to vote for him.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.900
If a million people out of the
63 million who voted for Trump

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.810
were in that last category,
and of the 9 million

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.049
who voted for Johnson
and Stein half of them

00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:47.590
wouldn't have thrown
their votes away

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:51.410
if they realized this man could
actually become president,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:55.000
and if the 10 or 15
million who didn't turn out

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.940
to vote because, you
know, why do I have to?

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.901
If they hadn't been assured
that he couldn't win,

00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:03.400
she would have had
80 million votes,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.960
and he would have
had 62 million.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.520
And that would have been enough.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.410
You know, even in
the Bush-Gore world

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:13.540
and in the electoral college,
she would have won handily.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.100
So that's the first
thing in my view.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.183
And that wasn't nefarious.

00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:19.220
That was just terrible.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.520
But when you have
the former KGB,

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.050
when you have
thousands of agents

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.959
and a concerted,
intentional, sustained attack

00:49:27.959 --> 00:49:30.250
on our country to try to
destabilize our country, which

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:35.350
is happening, and destabilize
the world, which is happening,

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:36.942
I do take issue.

00:49:36.942 --> 00:49:38.650
I kind of understand
it, but I take issue

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.960
with those of our talking
heads who go on TV

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.130
and they say, now, I'm
not saying it would

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:43.280
have changed the election.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.710
Well, of course it would
have changed the election.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.126
I mean, you couldn't
have gotten--

00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:48.010
77,000 votes didn't
happen because people

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:53.170
reading Facebook fake stuff
from KGB kind of people.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.040
They're reading how
horrible Hillary is,

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.720
and they're getting
it reinforced.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.954
I mean, you guys know
a lot more about how

00:49:58.954 --> 00:49:59.870
all these things work.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:04.220
But you do no evil, and Putin
is all about doing evil.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.400
So that was a huge
thing, I think.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.550
And then the last big piece--

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.797
well, so the third one that's
smaller, but still very

00:50:12.797 --> 00:50:14.630
meaningful and a little
bit related to this,

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:18.650
is the Comey stuff and the
way the media played it.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:22.717
This email thing is as big a
deal as Russia attacking us.

00:50:22.717 --> 00:50:24.050
These are two equivalent things.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.640
Each one is a scandal.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.730
We've got to be even handed.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.188
We don't want to lose readership
or whatever the reason is.

00:50:28.188 --> 00:50:30.070
And we want to have a dog fight.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.900
So the Comey stuff, I don't
think it was intentional,

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.580
but it was a big problem.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.300
And then finally, I mean,
the basket of deplorables

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.510
sitting eight feet from
me, that was kind of

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:44.670
like the 47% comment
that Romney did.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.040
And Romney's not a--

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.970
boy, if we could have
Romney instead of Trump,

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:52.565
Romney is a smart,
sane guy who, you know,

00:50:52.565 --> 00:50:56.375
et cetera, et cetera, not
my first choice, but OK.

00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:58.250
Anyway, so those were
the things that did it.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.050
Now the party, one area that
Barack Obama was not great at,

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.910
because he did have
a lot on his plate,

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.120
and not everybody is perfect
in every way, and nobody

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:13.970
that I know, is he didn't pay
too much attention to the DNC.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.360
And having a lovely woman,
who is a friend of mine

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.310
and all that, Debbie
Wasserman Schultz,

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:25.160
but having a part-time chair of
the party for four years, who

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.630
also has a mother of
three, and was Congress,

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.460
this was not a good idea.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.650
This was an opportunity
to really build the party

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.490
and build leadership and
do all sorts of things.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:43.042
Now we have a really dynamic
chair, who I don't think--

00:51:43.042 --> 00:51:45.500
I mean, his strongest suit is
not TV, which is unfortunate,

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.166
because that's how
most people know him.

00:51:47.166 --> 00:51:49.430
And so Tom Perez, if
you've seen him on TV,

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:53.720
you hopefully say, guy's got
a lot of fight, which he does.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.140
And he's smart, and he's for
all the right things, all great.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.560
Somehow it's not Bill
Clinton's communication skills

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.580
or whatever.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.480
But he is really good.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.800
And I got calls from way up
in the Obama administration,

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.970
people saying, of all the
cabinet secretaries we had,

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.769
Tom was either the best or tied
for first with two or three

00:52:14.769 --> 00:52:15.310
other people.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.490
He was labor secretary.

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.340
So we have a great chair who
was working 80 hours a week.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.770
We've just hired a lesbian
CEO named Jess O'Connell, who

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.910
ran EMILY's List until
a couple weeks ago

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.630
and expanded its membership
from 3 million to 5 million.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.965
By the way, for those of you
who are either LGBT or allies--

00:52:33.965 --> 00:52:36.297
I mean, I actually
find this a little--

00:52:36.297 --> 00:52:38.630
I mean, I'm not sure we should
have everybody know this,

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:42.650
but there are nine
officers of the DNC.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.610
Three of them, the finance
chair, the treasurer-- not me,

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:52.820
the new one that I recruited--
and the secretary are all LGBT,

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.590
as is the CEO.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.580
So we kind of own the
place and run the place.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.940
And those of you who can,
you should come on Wednesday

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.180
at 6 o'clock.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.904
And Henry or whatever,
or ask me after class,

00:53:06.904 --> 00:53:07.820
and we'll sign you up.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.840
And yes, you'll have to mortgage
the studio that you've just

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.970
finally got that studio.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.725
Oh my god.

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:20.400
Or just wait to renovate
the kitchenette.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.730
Are there any 40-somethings
who work here?

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:26.762
HENRY HARDING: No.

00:53:26.762 --> 00:53:28.220
We have two minutes
left, so I want

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.897
to be sensitive if there's one
speedy question that anyone

00:53:30.897 --> 00:53:33.639
has.

00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:35.149
OK, yes.

00:53:35.149 --> 00:53:36.190
AUDIENCE: I have one now.

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:37.586
How do you change people?

00:53:37.586 --> 00:53:39.627
You talked before about
talking to purple states.

00:53:39.627 --> 00:53:42.910
But how do you just change
people's opinion on things?

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.340
How do you make people
understand LGBT, understand

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.230
climate change?

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:48.570
It shouldn't be
a partisan issue.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.730
ANDY TOBIAS: Well, yeah, so I
mean that's a great question.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:58.230
And on LGBT, the way is
just to get to know them.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.300
Nobody could know
you and not like you.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.960
But that's largely
it is just say,

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.230
so what rights would
you like me to have,

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.450
and which ones
should I not have?

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:13.110
But not in a--

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:14.980
I mean, I tend to
get confrontational,

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.130
and I get sarcastic, and all
the things you shouldn't get.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:21.230
But there's a guy named
Richard Viguerie who

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:23.490
is the father of right-wing
conservative direct mail,

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.170
and I've been going
to the same thing

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:28.830
each year for like 30 years, I
think on Renaissance weekend.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:29.580
And I see Richard.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.070
He's incredibly
genial and all that.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.820
But he is a very
devout Catholic.

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:39.030
And I said to him once, with 300
people in an audience, I said,

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.860
Richard--

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.450
and Charles was
with me at the time,

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.370
and a lot of people like
Charles and all that.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:48.750
I said, I know you feel
very strongly about this.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:52.290
So just pretend for a minute you
can have it any way you want.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.680
What rights do you want
Charles and me to have,

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.590
and what rights can we not have?

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.250
And just tell us,
what do you think?

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.920
Well, let me think about that.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.920
I'll talk to you next
year about it or whatever.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.830
And then next year came,
and he didn't talk about it.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.090
So the LGBT one--

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.910
on the climate change,
you've got tribes.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.280
And you got people who
only watch Fox and only,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.090
all this kind of stuff.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.062
But we don't have to
get 100% of the vote.

00:55:19.062 --> 00:55:20.520
I mean, it would
be wonderful if we

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.810
can change the educational
system and get more people to--

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.270
and begin to-- it's
such a big topic,

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.590
and obviously there
are no easy answers.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.510
But it is important
to realize that we

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:37.050
haven't failed if we only
get more votes than they get.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.801
At least that gives us a
chance to have our agenda work,

00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:45.300
and give people health care,
and have them not want it taken

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.510
away, and stuff like that.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:52.620
Anyway, you're great to come,
and thank you for Google.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.230
And it's a miracle, Google.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.509
I mean, it's totally
changed my life.

00:55:57.509 --> 00:55:59.050
I've been writing
about this forever.

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:00.064
I mean, it's a miracle.

00:56:00.064 --> 00:56:01.980
I don't know how it
works, but it's a miracle.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:02.550
So thank you.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.633
HENRY HARDING: Let's give
him a round of applause.

00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:05.850
[APPLAUSE]
