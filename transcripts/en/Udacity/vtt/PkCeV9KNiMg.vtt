00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.980
And the final line here actually draws the chart on our webpage similar to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.020
a call in D3 to append HTML and SVG elements into a webpage.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.190
And that's it.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.890
A five line bar chart.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.640
Now, it might seem like a lot of overhead to learn a new library to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.400
do something that D3 already does for us.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.690
But using Dimple will not only allow us to iterate much quicker on

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.700
our visual design process.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.660
But it'll allow us to actually think how we want to when designing charts.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.420
In columns, axes, data types and the relationships between them.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.280
And that is the true power of a well made abstraction or interface or API.
