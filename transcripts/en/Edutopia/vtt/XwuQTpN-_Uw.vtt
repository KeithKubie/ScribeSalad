00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:11.386
&gt;&gt;I generally wake up,
5:30 every morning.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.996
Some days mo-- try to work
out and get all the running.

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:18.536
I go to the gym and then try to
get to school around 7:00, 7:15.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:20.716
I wish I could get here
earlier, but you can't.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:22.696
Working after school is impossible.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:25.566
So that has to happen in the
morning if it's gonna to happen.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:29.156
Then from there, I generally sit
down, put my computer, turn it on.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:31.286
I meet with the RISE students
in the morning first thing.

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:34.616
And then from day to day it
changes, whether you know--

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.376
there's meetings each day,
whether it's individual check-ins

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:41.846
with my grade level chairs, meetings
with grade level chairs as a group.

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.416
You know, meetings with Mark,
the school director and the rest

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:45.836
of the admin team on Mondays.

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.476
And then parent office hours and
trying to schedule when those happen.

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:54.886
And generally, you know, it probably
goes until 6:00 plus each night.

00:00:54.886 --> 00:01:00.856
Come home and eat and then start--
actually it's hard for me personally

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:02.716
and some people may be
better at this than myself,

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:06.226
but to get the bigger projects
done at school or even replying

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:07.456
to emails that take some thought.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.206
A lot of that has to
happen at home at night.

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.696
So generally I like
to kind of unwind.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:14.736
I'm not much of a sleeper.

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:16.856
So I like to unwind and
maybe whether, you know,

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.046
there's a basketball game on or
whatever it may be, you know,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.576
I like to make dinner
and so forth and do that.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.686
And then I'll kind of settle down
at the desk around 10:00, 10:30.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.006
And I generally- generally work
until about 12:30, 1:00 each night

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.636
and do it all again the next day.

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:37.066
I used to be a lot stronger at Friday
happy hours, but now come Friday,

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.696
my body, it's shutdown time.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.866
And so I maybe only go
out for a drink or two.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.446
But yeah, I don't stay out very
late on Fridays very longer.

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:47.746
To build relationships with students
you really, really have to go

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:51.906
out of your way to try to put
yourself in their- in their position

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:54.796
and to open up to them and
show that you're vulnerable

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.246
and you've overcome some obstacles
and you've faced challenges.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.456
While you know, I would
never even try to pretend

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:01.996
that what I've overcome in my life is
anywhere near what our students have

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.206
to overcome to get to college.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.856
But you know, we all overcome
some challenges and rec--

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.356
being open to them about that.

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:13.546
But at the same time remaining
or keeping that, you know,

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:18.586
authoritative presence that-
that they still respect you.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:22.746
They can open up to you and say a
lot of things but yet they want to,

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.826
at the same time kind of
impress you because they are--

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:29.666
they look up to you for who you
are and for being vulnerable.

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:32.526
I think it is definitely scalable.

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:37.386
I think the one thing
that we have going

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:41.876
that the large ISDs
don't have, is the size.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.986
You know, having an
extremely large high school

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:47.386
and extremely large middle
school, it's just too hard

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:50.986
to know what's going on and if I
can quality control how students are

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.606
doing, to get to know the student,
because that's a huge part,

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:54.626
that relationship building.

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:58.156
And even as an administrator, the
fact that I can name you know,

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:00.116
first and last name of every
student in this school,

00:03:00.116 --> 00:03:01.286
I think plays a huge part.

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:03.926
So when I walk around, it's just
not hey buddy, hey you guys.

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:06.186
It's you know, hello Jose.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.176
Hey Priscilla, how is
your day going so far?

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.176
And I think that's-
that's a big part of it.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.436
And I don't know if larger schools,
you know, if they have the ability

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:16.156
to break down into
smaller communities.

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:19.166
I think that's one thing that
would be advantageous for them.

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:22.326
But I think it's-- the
scalability is there.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:25.116
In my first year in the role of
principal going from, you know,

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.416
full time teacher into
principal, I just realized

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.276
in how many directions you
get pulled throughout the day.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.056
Whether it's, you know, a parent
all of a sudden shows up and wants

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:35.906
to meet or a student discipline
issue gets brought to you.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.476
And on top of that
having to, you know,

00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:40.136
create agendas for upcoming meetings.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.026
Projects that need to
take place and whether

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:46.136
to make a final exam schedule, submit
some paperwork to the home office

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:50.166
and trying to do it all at the same
time and being accessible to everyone

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:53.376
at all times on top of getting in
the classrooms where I need to be.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:55.946
Observing teachers, getting
a feel for the students,

00:03:55.946 --> 00:04:00.716
just being a presence around campus,
I wasn't doing a very good job.

00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:03.646
So looking at that, what I did for--

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:06.676
halfway through last year
and then set myself up again

00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:08.816
to do it this year, is just really--

00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:11.596
took a couple weeks where I just
wrote down everything that I'm doing

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.326
in a day, you know, every
half an hour, what am I doing?

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:13.836
What am I doing?

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.776
I kind of collected all of
that and figured out okay,

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.226
I need to block out some time.

00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:20.906
And also let staff know
that the open door poss-

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.026
the open door policy still exists.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:26.386
But you know, if people are just
coming in and out at any time,

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:28.996
then I'm not going to be very
effective in my job in terms

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:30.216
of getting in the classrooms.

00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:33.766
We are all committed to one
thing and that is recognizing

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:36.456
that our students need more than
what's being offered currently

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:37.956
by their zone public school,

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.206
because they're not gonna
have the opportunity to go

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:42.596
to a four year college with the
education they're receiving.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.856
So that- that core mission, that
that's what we're all here for,

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:49.016
is ensuring that our students
are prepared to graduate

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:52.486
from a four year college,
that common bond, you know,

00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:53.916
is what makes us successful.

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:57.956
And that's true of any
successful organization, you know.

00:04:57.956 --> 00:04:59.816
We use like the Southwest
Airlines example.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.826
Everyone knows that they're a low
cost, you know, low fare airline.

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:03.796
And that's what they are.

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:05.226
That's what they're really good at.

00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:07.036
And I think that's kind of
the way we look at ourselves.

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.516
As we are-- we're not
gonna overtake any ISD.

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:12.946
We're not trying to become the
biggest school district in Houston.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:17.586
But we do want to try to push
education in the city of Houston

00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:21.186
to show that it is possible
and hopefully continue

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:25.026
to build relationships with the
ISD that they can then, you know,

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:27.116
learn from what's been
successful for us and we can learn

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:28.536
from what's worked for
them and hopefully,

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:30.606
create a city specifically
in Houston

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:34.000
where we're sending more
students off to college.

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:36.026
