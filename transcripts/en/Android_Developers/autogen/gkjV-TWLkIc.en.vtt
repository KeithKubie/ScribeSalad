gonna talk to you about the strategies
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779
gonna talk to you about the strategies
of getting your IOT devices connected to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
of getting your IOT devices connected to
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820
of getting your IOT devices connected to
the Internet to the cloud and everything

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
the Internet to the cloud and everything
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.410
the Internet to the cloud and everything
else so we're gonna go through the whole

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
else so we're gonna go through the whole
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900
else so we're gonna go through the whole
process end-to-end and we're gonna talk

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
process end-to-end and we're gonna talk
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700
process end-to-end and we're gonna talk
about how Google's software platforms

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
about how Google's software platforms
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490
about how Google's software platforms
such as Android things firebase and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
such as Android things firebase and
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.430
such as Android things firebase and
cloud IOT core help this to help to make

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
cloud IOT core help this to help to make
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.459
cloud IOT core help this to help to make
this much easier to do so as many of you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
this much easier to do so as many of you
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.950
this much easier to do so as many of you
probably know and that's why here today

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
probably know and that's why here today
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.770
probably know and that's why here today
is that IOT is huge and it's gonna be

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
is that IOT is huge and it's gonna be
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.760
is that IOT is huge and it's gonna be
bigger than anything we've seen before

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
bigger than anything we've seen before
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.250
bigger than anything we've seen before
so in the same way that we saw phones

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
so in the same way that we saw phones
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920
so in the same way that we saw phones
were orders of magnitude larger than pcs

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
were orders of magnitude larger than pcs
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660
were orders of magnitude larger than pcs
I think we're gonna see IOT devices

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
I think we're gonna see IOT devices
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790
I think we're gonna see IOT devices
being orders of magnitude larger than

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
being orders of magnitude larger than
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740
being orders of magnitude larger than
them we're gonna be surrounded by IOT

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
them we're gonna be surrounded by IOT
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.740
them we're gonna be surrounded by IOT
devices on a day to day basis that do

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
devices on a day to day basis that do
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630
devices on a day to day basis that do
all kinds of different tasks for us and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
all kinds of different tasks for us and
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.980
all kinds of different tasks for us and
there's not going to be just one device

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
there's not going to be just one device
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750
there's not going to be just one device
you're gonna have tens or hundreds of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
you're gonna have tens or hundreds of
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.100
you're gonna have tens or hundreds of
them doing all kinds of interesting

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
them doing all kinds of interesting
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050
them doing all kinds of interesting
things and so today we're going to give

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
things and so today we're going to give
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719
things and so today we're going to give
you some hints as to ideas on how to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
you some hints as to ideas on how to
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060
you some hints as to ideas on how to
best build these kind of IOT devices and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
best build these kind of IOT devices and
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130
best build these kind of IOT devices and
how to connect them secure them and so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
how to connect them secure them and so
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.550
how to connect them secure them and so
forth so firstly let's discuss the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
forth so firstly let's discuss the
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170
forth so firstly let's discuss the
basics of Android things hopefully most

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
basics of Android things hopefully most
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640
basics of Android things hopefully most
of you have seen the intro talk if you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
of you have seen the intro talk if you
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410
of you have seen the intro talk if you
haven't we have a bunch of talks here at

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
haven't we have a bunch of talks here at
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090
haven't we have a bunch of talks here at
i/o that cover what Android things is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
i/o that cover what Android things is
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490
i/o that cover what Android things is
but the core concept of Android things

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
but the core concept of Android things
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230
but the core concept of Android things
is that it's based on a system on a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
is that it's based on a system on a
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539
is that it's based on a system on a
module which is shown in the image over

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
module which is shown in the image over
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.859
module which is shown in the image over
there which is the little small board

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
there which is the little small board
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.679
there which is the little small board
and so the salm contains the CPU the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
and so the salm contains the CPU the
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530
and so the salm contains the CPU the
Wi-Fi the memory and it's supported by

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
Wi-Fi the memory and it's supported by
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510
Wi-Fi the memory and it's supported by
we buy what we call a board Support

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
we buy what we call a board Support
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819
we buy what we call a board Support
Package and this provides the drivers

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
Package and this provides the drivers
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.530
Package and this provides the drivers
the kernels the libraries and everything

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
the kernels the libraries and everything
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.600
the kernels the libraries and everything
but it also provides updates and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
but it also provides updates and
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270
but it also provides updates and
security from Google and using an

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
security from Google and using an
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609
security from Google and using an
Android thing some it makes it really

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
Android thing some it makes it really
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.770
Android thing some it makes it really
easy for developers to build IOT devices

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
easy for developers to build IOT devices
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230
easy for developers to build IOT devices
and also to help ensure that they're

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
and also to help ensure that they're
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060
and also to help ensure that they're
secure and that they're kept up to date

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
secure and that they're kept up to date
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.499
secure and that they're kept up to date
because those are the kind of things

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
because those are the kind of things
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240
because those are the kind of things
that consumers need now with their

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
that consumers need now with their
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.760
that consumers need now with their
devices one other thing that makes

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
devices one other thing that makes
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860
devices one other thing that makes
Android things unique is that its

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
Android things unique is that its
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.390
Android things unique is that its
support

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400
support
 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.390
support
really powerful types of processing on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
really powerful types of processing on
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.399
really powerful types of processing on
device so you don't need to do things in

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409
device so you don't need to do things in
 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.350
device so you don't need to do things in
the cloud but you can do video and audio

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360
the cloud but you can do video and audio
 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240
the cloud but you can do video and audio
processing you can do machine learning

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250
processing you can do machine learning
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.309
processing you can do machine learning
and you could do everything on device

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319
and you could do everything on device
 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.350
and you could do everything on device
because we have phone level CPU

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
because we have phone level CPU
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.720
because we have phone level CPU
performance on these Android things

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
performance on these Android things
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.789
performance on these Android things
Psalms and the other thing is that it's

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799
Psalms and the other thing is that it's
 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.160
Psalms and the other thing is that it's
based on Android so you can use all of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
based on Android so you can use all of
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.839
based on Android so you can use all of
familiar developer tools that you're

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849
familiar developer tools that you're
 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.240
familiar developer tools that you're
used to such as Android studio and all

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
used to such as Android studio and all
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.710
used to such as Android studio and all
the existing code that you have if

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
the existing code that you have if
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.160
the existing code that you have if
you're an Android developer and so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170
you're an Android developer and so
 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.300
you're an Android developer and so
you'll be right at home using Android

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
you'll be right at home using Android
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.160
you'll be right at home using Android
things if you've done Android

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
things if you've done Android
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050
things if you've done Android
development before so there are lots of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
development before so there are lots of
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.399
development before so there are lots of
other talks at i/o that you can go to

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409
other talks at i/o that you can go to
 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.960
other talks at i/o that you can go to
learn more about that but what we're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
learn more about that but what we're
 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.849
learn more about that but what we're
going to focus on today is how we can

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859
going to focus on today is how we can
 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.190
going to focus on today is how we can
take advantage of all these things that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200
take advantage of all these things that
 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.020
take advantage of all these things that
come with Android things to make your

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
come with Android things to make your
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.449
come with Android things to make your
IOT devices easier and better for you so

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459
IOT devices easier and better for you so
 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.729
IOT devices easier and better for you so
that in mind let's get into an example

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739
that in mind let's get into an example
 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.110
that in mind let's get into an example
that we're going to use throughout this

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120
that we're going to use throughout this
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640
that we're going to use throughout this
talk to sort of explain what we're

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
talk to sort of explain what we're
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.899
talk to sort of explain what we're
talking about so we're gonna build an

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909
talking about so we're gonna build an
 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.550
talking about so we're gonna build an
IOT washing machine because why not and

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560
IOT washing machine because why not and
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.899
IOT washing machine because why not and
everyone's excited about using machine

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909
everyone's excited about using machine
 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.860
everyone's excited about using machine
learning and tensorflow

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
learning and tensorflow
 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.259
learning and tensorflow
so therefore we probably should be using

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269
so therefore we probably should be using
 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.390
so therefore we probably should be using
a washing machine that does machine

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400
a washing machine that does machine
 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.979
a washing machine that does machine
learning on board it should have a

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989
learning on board it should have a
 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.629
learning on board it should have a
camera that looks at your laundry and

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639
camera that looks at your laundry and
 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.369
camera that looks at your laundry and
then while it's washing your clothes

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379
then while it's washing your clothes
 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.839
then while it's washing your clothes
it does machine learning algorithms to

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849
it does machine learning algorithms to
 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.420
it does machine learning algorithms to
analyze how clean it is and it can also

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430
analyze how clean it is and it can also
 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.949
analyze how clean it is and it can also
allow you to see how your laundry is

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959
allow you to see how your laundry is
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.420
allow you to see how your laundry is
being washed when you're at work in case

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430
being washed when you're at work in case
 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.770
being washed when you're at work in case
you're interested in seeing this kind of

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780
you're interested in seeing this kind of
 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.629
you're interested in seeing this kind of
thing happen so I guess we could call

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639
thing happen so I guess we could call
 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.500
thing happen so I guess we could call
our new product tensor wash so when we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
our new product tensor wash so when we
 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.479
our new product tensor wash so when we
build this tensor wash washing machine

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
build this tensor wash washing machine
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.369
build this tensor wash washing machine
most washing machines still have a

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379
most washing machines still have a
 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.689
most washing machines still have a
control panel on the front because you

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699
control panel on the front because you
 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.699
control panel on the front because you
still want to control it manually now

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709
still want to control it manually now
 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.830
still want to control it manually now
because Android Things supports really

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
because Android Things supports really
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.020
because Android Things supports really
powerful devices you could actually have

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030
powerful devices you could actually have
 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.909
powerful devices you could actually have
like a screen on the front it could run

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919
like a screen on the front it could run
 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.339
like a screen on the front it could run
OpenGL you could have videos and audio

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349
OpenGL you could have videos and audio
 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.129
OpenGL you could have videos and audio
playing how so that's one option that

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139
playing how so that's one option that
 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.330
playing how so that's one option that
you could build maybe in the deluxe

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340
you could build maybe in the deluxe
 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.119
you could build maybe in the deluxe
model of the machine however if you want

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129
model of the machine however if you want
 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.159
model of the machine however if you want
to reduce the cost to make a cheap IOT

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169
to reduce the cost to make a cheap IOT
 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.930
to reduce the cost to make a cheap IOT
washing machine then you probably want

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940
washing machine then you probably want
 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.839
washing machine then you probably want
to get rid of the display and so we're

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849
to get rid of the display and so we're
 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.460
to get rid of the display and so we're
gonna leave that out for this example so

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
gonna leave that out for this example so
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.379
gonna leave that out for this example so
the machine is going to be IOT enabled

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389
the machine is going to be IOT enabled
 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.909
the machine is going to be IOT enabled
it's gonna have a few buttons on the

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919
it's gonna have a few buttons on the
 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.559
it's gonna have a few buttons on the
front but pretty much everything is

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569
front but pretty much everything is
 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.599
front but pretty much everything is
going to be controlled via a phone which

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609
going to be controlled via a phone which
 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.750
going to be controlled via a phone which
we're going to talk about a bit so the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760
we're going to talk about a bit so the
 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.879
we're going to talk about a bit so the
real magic of a machine like this is

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
real magic of a machine like this is
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.529
real magic of a machine like this is
when it's connected to the Internet and

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539
when it's connected to the Internet and
 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.779
when it's connected to the Internet and
so you can monitor the machine remotely

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789
so you can monitor the machine remotely
 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.120
so you can monitor the machine remotely
you can view what the camera sees you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
you can view what the camera sees you
 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.040
you can view what the camera sees you
can trigger off a wash cycle when you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
can trigger off a wash cycle when you
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.420
can trigger off a wash cycle when you
work when you're driving home whatever

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430
work when you're driving home whatever
 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.969
work when you're driving home whatever
so the user is not in the house and they

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979
so the user is not in the house and they
 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.170
so the user is not in the house and they
could be potentially anywhere in the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
could be potentially anywhere in the
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.700
could be potentially anywhere in the
world so we don't want to restrict it to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710
world so we don't want to restrict it to
 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.649
world so we don't want to restrict it to
just being controlled from something

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659
just being controlled from something
 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.809
just being controlled from something
that's close by in the house so we

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819
that's close by in the house so we
 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.070
that's close by in the house so we
really need to have an internet

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080
really need to have an internet
 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.619
really need to have an internet
cloud-based connection with some kind of

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629
cloud-based connection with some kind of
 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.080
cloud-based connection with some kind of
you know cloud solution behind that and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090
you know cloud solution behind that and
 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.700
you know cloud solution behind that and
we can add all kinds of fun features by

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710
we can add all kinds of fun features by
 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.740
we can add all kinds of fun features by
having cloud support so we could have it

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750
having cloud support so we could have it
 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.960
having cloud support so we could have it
awarding points for you know not washing

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
awarding points for you know not washing
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.490
awarding points for you know not washing
your clothes or not wasting water too

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500
your clothes or not wasting water too
 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.159
your clothes or not wasting water too
much it could report faults to a service

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169
much it could report faults to a service
 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.499
much it could report faults to a service
department and in order to support all

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509
department and in order to support all
 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.230
department and in order to support all
this the machine needs Wi-Fi and we're

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240
this the machine needs Wi-Fi and we're
 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.550
this the machine needs Wi-Fi and we're
not going to cheat by just plugging in

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560
not going to cheat by just plugging in
 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800
not going to cheat by just plugging in
an Ethernet cable into it so we have

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810
an Ethernet cable into it so we have
 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.499
an Ethernet cable into it so we have
this washing machine we need it to

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509
this washing machine we need it to
 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.559
this washing machine we need it to
connect to the cloud we need and we need

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569
connect to the cloud we need and we need
 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.540
connect to the cloud we need and we need
to share state with the clouds so that a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550
to share state with the clouds so that a
 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.790
to share state with the clouds so that a
phone could control the device so there

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800
phone could control the device so there
 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.439
phone could control the device so there
are many possible cloud services we'll

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449
are many possible cloud services we'll
 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.149
are many possible cloud services we'll
talk about a few of them today but

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159
talk about a few of them today but
 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.790
talk about a few of them today but
firstly in order to make this kind of

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800
firstly in order to make this kind of
 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.480
firstly in order to make this kind of
thing work

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490
thing work
 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.610
thing work
we need to firstly get the device onto

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620
we need to firstly get the device onto
 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.920
we need to firstly get the device onto
the network and so many devices these

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930
the network and so many devices these
 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.529
the network and so many devices these
days these days are Wi-Fi based so the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539
days these days are Wi-Fi based so the
 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.930
days these days are Wi-Fi based so the
device requires an SSID and a passphrase

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940
device requires an SSID and a passphrase
 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.870
device requires an SSID and a passphrase
to join the network many devices don't

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
to join the network many devices don't
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.820
to join the network many devices don't
have a keyboard or a display like in the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830
have a keyboard or a display like in the
 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.290
have a keyboard or a display like in the
case of our washing machine so

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300
case of our washing machine so
 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.670
case of our washing machine so
everything needs to be handled by the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680
everything needs to be handled by the
 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.969
everything needs to be handled by the
phone and if we use a phone then the

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979
phone and if we use a phone then the
 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.680
phone and if we use a phone then the
device needs to spin up a Wi-Fi access

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690
device needs to spin up a Wi-Fi access
 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.749
device needs to spin up a Wi-Fi access
point of its own the phone connects to

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759
point of its own the phone connects to
 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.140
point of its own the phone connects to
it

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
it
 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.540
it
it sends all the login details over and

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550
it sends all the login details over and
 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.370
it sends all the login details over and
then the device reconnects to the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
then the device reconnects to the
 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.370
then the device reconnects to the
network and uses that information and if

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380
network and uses that information and if
 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.230
network and uses that information and if
anything goes wrong for any reason the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
anything goes wrong for any reason the
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.459
anything goes wrong for any reason the
phone has no way of knowing what

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469
phone has no way of knowing what
 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.930
phone has no way of knowing what
happened and so it's a very delicate

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940
happened and so it's a very delicate
 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.570
happened and so it's a very delicate
process and so it can be problematic for

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580
process and so it can be problematic for
 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.909
process and so it can be problematic for
some phones or Wi-Fi networks and so

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919
some phones or Wi-Fi networks and so
 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.559
some phones or Wi-Fi networks and so
many developers find this challenging to

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569
many developers find this challenging to
 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.059
many developers find this challenging to
get right so we're gonna go through some

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069
get right so we're gonna go through some
 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.269
get right so we're gonna go through some
hints on how to make this better and and

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279
hints on how to make this better and and
 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.670
hints on how to make this better and and
next the device needs to know who the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680
next the device needs to know who the
 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.860
next the device needs to know who the
owners of the device are so you want to

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870
owners of the device are so you want to
 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.170
owners of the device are so you want to
make sure that the device is viewed and

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180
make sure that the device is viewed and
 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.209
make sure that the device is viewed and
controlled only by the owner of the

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219
controlled only by the owner of the
 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.129
controlled only by the owner of the
device and anyone else that they trust

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139
device and anyone else that they trust
 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.230
device and anyone else that they trust
so we need some kind of authentication

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240
so we need some kind of authentication
 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.390
so we need some kind of authentication
token that needs to be issued by a

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
token that needs to be issued by a
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.640
token that needs to be issued by a
server that the user then uses to

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650
server that the user then uses to
 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.589
server that the user then uses to
control this token we put on the device

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599
control this token we put on the device
 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.290
control this token we put on the device
and then that's what the device uses to

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300
and then that's what the device uses to
 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.320
and then that's what the device uses to
contact the internet and the cloud if

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330
contact the internet and the cloud if
 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.060
contact the internet and the cloud if
the user factually resets the device

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070
the user factually resets the device
 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.430
the user factually resets the device
then we need to forget this token and

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440
then we need to forget this token and
 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.839
then we need to forget this token and
everything else and

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849
everything else and
 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.939
everything else and
the device should reset itself so that a

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949
the device should reset itself so that a
 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.100
the device should reset itself so that a
different user could use the Machine and

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110
different user could use the Machine and
 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.989
different user could use the Machine and
none of the previous history is

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.980
is something that you trust we also need
to verify the proof of possession of a

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
to verify the proof of possession of a
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.050
to verify the proof of possession of a
key the key itself is not transferred

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060
key the key itself is not transferred
 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.970
key the key itself is not transferred
across a network or at least not the

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980
across a network or at least not the
 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.269
across a network or at least not the
private part of the key and but we need

00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279
private part of the key and but we need
 

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.590
private part of the key and but we need
to check that the other computer has

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600
to check that the other computer has
 

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.300
to check that the other computer has
possession of it and it gives us a proof

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
possession of it and it gives us a proof
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.970
possession of it and it gives us a proof
of that so doing this right in practice

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980
of that so doing this right in practice
 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.350
of that so doing this right in practice
can be really hard building these

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100
make sure that all the clients are
 

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.829
make sure that all the clients are
actually instances of that web service

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839
actually instances of that web service
 

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:14.449
actually instances of that web service
what you want to do is authenticate that

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459
what you want to do is authenticate that
 

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:16.430
what you want to do is authenticate that
it's it's one of your devices but you

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440
it's it's one of your devices but you
 

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.139
it's it's one of your devices but you
don't actually care which one and you

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:18.149
don't actually care which one and you
 

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:20.389
don't actually care which one and you
can actually do an anonymous

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399
can actually do an anonymous
 

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:25.069
can actually do an anonymous
authentication in that case also we need

00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079
authentication in that case also we need
 

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:26.720
authentication in that case also we need
to bind a fennec ation to meaningful

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
to bind a fennec ation to meaningful
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.880
to bind a fennec ation to meaningful
expectations we to make sure that we're

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:28.890
expectations we to make sure that we're
 

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.250
expectations we to make sure that we're
indicating what we're thinking what

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260
indicating what we're thinking what
 

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.009
indicating what we're thinking what
we're expecting to authenticate let me

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019
we're expecting to authenticate let me
 

00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:35.210
we're expecting to authenticate let me
give you a couple of examples if there's

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220
give you a couple of examples if there's
 

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.860
give you a couple of examples if there's
a if there's a device in front of you

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:36.870
a if there's a device in front of you
 

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.290
a if there's a device in front of you
and you'd wanted you want to

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300
and you'd wanted you want to
 

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.199
and you'd wanted you want to
authenticate that device you bind it to

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:42.209
authenticate that device you bind it to
 

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:43.430
authenticate that device you bind it to
something physical buying something

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440
something physical buying something
 

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.079
something physical buying something
physical in the device if the device has

00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:45.089
physical in the device if the device has
 

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.180
physical in the device if the device has
a screen you can display a code both on

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:47.190
a screen you can display a code both on
 

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.259
a screen you can display a code both on
your phone and on the screen for example

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:48.269
your phone and on the screen for example
 

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:50.990
your phone and on the screen for example
that's that's a physical binding of that

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000
that's that's a physical binding of that
 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.040
that's that's a physical binding of that
authentication that's a common

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.050
authentication that's a common
 

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.630
authentication that's a common
experience when you do like a bluetooth

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:53.640
experience when you do like a bluetooth
 

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.319
experience when you do like a bluetooth
pairing or something like that but you

00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:57.329
pairing or something like that but you
 

00:13:57.329 --> 00:13:59.210
pairing or something like that but you
can also use like as I sticker on the

00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220
can also use like as I sticker on the
 

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.470
can also use like as I sticker on the
device or a barcode and we'll talk about

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480
device or a barcode and we'll talk about
 

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.380
device or a barcode and we'll talk about
that a little bit more same thing goes

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.390
that a little bit more same thing goes
 

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.639
that a little bit more same thing goes
with an encrypted channel if you've

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:04.649
with an encrypted channel if you've
 

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:05.990
with an encrypted channel if you've
established an encrypted channel and now

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000
established an encrypted channel and now
 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.300
established an encrypted channel and now
you need to authenticate that channel

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.310
you need to authenticate that channel
 

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.260
you need to authenticate that channel
bind your earth in ocation to that

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:09.270
bind your earth in ocation to that
 

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.620
bind your earth in ocation to that
channel so if you're using using a

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:12.630
channel so if you're using using a
 

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.710
channel so if you're using using a
standard protocol like TLS HTTP this is

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720
standard protocol like TLS HTTP this is
 

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.940
standard protocol like TLS HTTP this is
already done for you you don't have to

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:16.950
already done for you you don't have to
 

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.639
already done for you you don't have to
worry about it I but if you're what if

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:19.649
worry about it I but if you're what if
 

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:20.780
worry about it I but if you're what if
you're doing something between two

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:20.790
you're doing something between two
 

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.940
you're doing something between two
devices for example and and they don't

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:22.950
devices for example and and they don't
 

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.949
devices for example and and they don't
support that kind of a protocol and you

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959
support that kind of a protocol and you
 

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:29.630
support that kind of a protocol and you
need to think about this so let's go

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:29.640
need to think about this so let's go
 

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.699
need to think about this so let's go
back to our tensor watch example and

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:31.709
back to our tensor watch example and
 

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:32.510
back to our tensor watch example and
take a look at all the authentication

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:32.520
take a look at all the authentication
 

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.610
take a look at all the authentication
that needs to happen so we'll start in

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620
that needs to happen so we'll start in
 

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.680
that needs to happen so we'll start in
the completely unproven State so we just

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.690
the completely unproven State so we just
 

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.300
the completely unproven State so we just
took our tensor washing machine out of

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.310
took our tensor washing machine out of
 

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.680
took our tensor washing machine out of
the box so let's assume that our smart

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:42.690
the box so let's assume that our smart
 

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.480
the box so let's assume that our smart
phones already set up our smart phone is

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:44.490
phones already set up our smart phone is
 

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.660
phones already set up our smart phone is
able to authenticate web services I

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:46.670
able to authenticate web services I
 

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.660
able to authenticate web services I
using HTTP TLS and and also in our case

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:50.670
using HTTP TLS and and also in our case
 

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.829
using HTTP TLS and and also in our case
let's assume that we have a Google

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839
let's assume that we have a Google
 

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:52.939
let's assume that we have a Google
account we've logged in so on the phone

00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:52.949
account we've logged in so on the phone
 

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:54.889
account we've logged in so on the phone
and so those those web services are able

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899
and so those those web services are able
 

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:57.800
and so those those web services are able
to authenticate the the phone and and so

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:57.810
to authenticate the the phone and and so
 

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.150
to authenticate the the phone and and so
there's a two-way authenticated

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160
there's a two-way authenticated
 

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.240
there's a two-way authenticated
relationship there the first thing we

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.250
relationship there the first thing we
 

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.009
relationship there the first thing we
need to do is we need to authenticate

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019
need to do is we need to authenticate
 

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:05.900
need to do is we need to authenticate
this new device we want to do is we want

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:05.910
this new device we want to do is we want
 

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.160
this new device we want to do is we want
to send it credentials those credentials

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.170
to send it credentials those credentials
 

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.620
to send it credentials those credentials
to be valuable Wi-Fi passwords access to

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:09.630
to be valuable Wi-Fi passwords access to
 

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.680
to be valuable Wi-Fi passwords access to
cloud services and we want to make sure

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:12.690
cloud services and we want to make sure
 

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.970
cloud services and we want to make sure
we're sending it to the right device

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980
we're sending it to the right device
 

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.220
we're sending it to the right device
before we before we send it over

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.230
 

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.990
and once we've provisioned that we want

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000
and once we've provisioned that we want
 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.980
and once we've provisioned that we want
to end up in this state where we have

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:21.990
to end up in this state where we have
 

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.449
to end up in this state where we have
two-way authenticated relationships

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459
two-way authenticated relationships
 

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:25.759
two-way authenticated relationships
between the tensile washing machine and

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:25.769
between the tensile washing machine and
 

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:27.230
between the tensile washing machine and
cloud services so I've given two

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240
cloud services so I've given two
 

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.329
cloud services so I've given two
examples here a firebase and cloud IOT

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339
examples here a firebase and cloud IOT
 

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:31.190
examples here a firebase and cloud IOT
core then we're going to use with with

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.200
core then we're going to use with with
 

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.630
core then we're going to use with with
tensor watch and for both of these we

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:35.640
tensor watch and for both of these we
 

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.790
tensor watch and for both of these we
wanted a two-way relationship again

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800
wanted a two-way relationship again
 

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.350
wanted a two-way relationship again
that's indicating Web Services will use

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360
that's indicating Web Services will use
 

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.970
that's indicating Web Services will use
the standard TLS HTTPS and we'll use

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:42.980
the standard TLS HTTPS and we'll use
 

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.110
the standard TLS HTTPS and we'll use
those different forms which we'll talk

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120
those different forms which we'll talk
 

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.420
those different forms which we'll talk
about one more data a little bit later

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.430
about one more data a little bit later
 

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.910
about one more data a little bit later
to cenek 8 the device but but those

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920
to cenek 8 the device but but those
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.250
to cenek 8 the device but but those
credentials are going to be provisioned

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.260
credentials are going to be provisioned
 

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.660
credentials are going to be provisioned
during this process from the phone so

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:56.670
during this process from the phone so
 

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.040
during this process from the phone so
soon you may have noticed that there's a

soon you may have noticed that there's a
 

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.050
soon you may have noticed that there's a
110 occation that didn't go both ways in

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060
110 occation that didn't go both ways in
 

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.639
110 occation that didn't go both ways in
my example what about this one here in

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:01.649
my example what about this one here in
 

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:03.740
my example what about this one here in
yellow from 10 siwash to the phone is it

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:03.750
yellow from 10 siwash to the phone is it
 

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.269
yellow from 10 siwash to the phone is it
ok for the tensor watch device to come

ok for the tensor watch device to come
 

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.490
ok for the tensor watch device to come
out of the box and not authenticate the

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440
phone that's gonna set it up so we've
 

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.389
phone that's gonna set it up so we've
put it this way because it's really

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399
put it this way because it's really
 

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:13.310
put it this way because it's really

we wanted to to build out this case and

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500
we wanted to to build out this case and
 

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.230
we wanted to to build out this case and
mostly that's okay it doesn't come out

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240
mostly that's okay it doesn't come out
 

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.460
mostly that's okay it doesn't come out
of the box with credentials that it's

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:31.470
of the box with credentials that it's
 

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.319
of the box with credentials that it's
going to be giving out its receiving

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:33.329
going to be giving out its receiving
 

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:35.230
going to be giving out its receiving
credentials and so it's less important

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240
credentials and so it's less important
 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.940
credentials and so it's less important
then they for example then the phone

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:37.950
then they for example then the phone
 

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.470
then they for example then the phone

that device to come out of the box and
get itself set up it'll have to come out

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:50.550
get itself set up it'll have to come out
 

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.310
get itself set up it'll have to come out
of it come out of the box already with

you don't use a los 2.0 you need to

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:26.800
you don't use a los 2.0 you need to
 

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.760
you don't use a los 2.0 you need to
think about some of these concepts the

two big ones are token scope and token
 

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.690
two big ones are token scope and token
lifetime token scope is describes what

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:33.700
lifetime token scope is describes what
 

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.370

privileges are associated with the token
 

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.110
privileges are associated with the token
so what can the bearer of this token get

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120
so what can the bearer of this token get
 

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.900

when the token expires there's this

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:43.300
when the token expires there's this
 

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.020
when the token expires there's this
notion of refresh tokens versus access

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.030
notion of refresh tokens versus access
 

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.910

little bit better so let's think about

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539
little bit better so let's think about
 

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:36.230
little bit better so let's think about

well or at least we need to think about

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679
well or at least we need to think about
 

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.560
well or at least we need to think about
it in both directions we can think about

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:45.570
it in both directions we can think about
 

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.740
it in both directions we can think about
who has access to a device who can who

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:48.750
who has access to a device who can who
 

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.870
who has access to a device who can who
can send commands to the device who can

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880
can send commands to the device who can
 

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.129

read data from the device and so forth
 

00:20:52.139 --> 00:20:54.320
read data from the device and so forth
we also need to think about what does

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.330
we also need to think about what does
 

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.750
we also need to think about what does
the device have access to what rights

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760
the device have access to what rights
 

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.850

it to a web service for example we want

00:21:04.009 --> 00:21:04.019
it to a web service for example we want

to use the principle of least privilege

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:05.539
to use the principle of least privilege
 

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:07.850
to use the principle of least privilege
we don't want to give more privileged

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860
we don't want to give more privileged

we don't want to give more privileged
than necessary this is a really common

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220
than necessary this is a really common
 

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.500
than necessary this is a really common
problem with IOT and I think it's

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:12.510
problem with IOT and I think it's
 

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.970
problem with IOT and I think it's
because it's so easy it's so easy to

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980
because it's so easy it's so easy to
 

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.279
because it's so easy it's so easy to
just give the device a total

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:16.289
just give the device a total
 

00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:18.049
just give the device a total
authorization for the service that's

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059
authorization for the service that's
 

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.250
authorization for the service that's
connecting to because then you won't

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260
connecting to because then you won't
 

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.210

have any more problems you won't have

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220
have any more problems you won't have
 

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.490
have any more problems you won't have
any authorization errors and everything

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500
any authorization errors and everything
 

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.680
any authorization errors and everything
will just work the problem is if the

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:24.690
will just work the problem is if the
 

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.169
will just work the problem is if the

we want to be after we provision because
 

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.379
we want to be after we provision because
we want to have a two-way authorization

00:22:44.379 --> 00:22:44.389
we want to have a two-way authorization
 

00:22:44.389 --> 00:22:45.820
we want to have a two-way authorization
with firebase so we're gonna use the

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:45.830
with firebase so we're gonna use the
 

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.039
with firebase so we're gonna use the
firebase real time database and it can

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.049
firebase real time database and it can
 

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:49.960
firebase real time database and it can
sync it can sink down to the device it

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:49.970
sync it can sink down to the device it
 

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.580
sync it can sink down to the device it
can also sync data from the device up to

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:51.590
can also sync data from the device up to
 

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.110
can also sync data from the device up to
the cloud and when it sinks down the

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120
the cloud and when it sinks down the
 

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.399
the cloud and when it sinks down the
device we can get to use that to issue

00:22:54.399 --> 00:22:54.409
device we can get to use that to issue
 

00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:55.930
device we can get to use that to issue
commands to the device and so there's an

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:55.940
commands to the device and so there's an
 

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.100
commands to the device and so there's an
authorization where firebase is

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.110
authorization where firebase is
 

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.620
authorization where firebase is
authorized to to give commands to the

00:22:59.620 --> 00:22:59.630
authorized to to give commands to the
 

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.990
authorized to to give commands to the
device and the device is authorized to

device that's what we're using at the
station so quick review we talked about

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.020
station so quick review we talked about
 

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.840
station so quick review we talked about
a syndication checking that something is

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:34.850
a syndication checking that something is
 

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.480
a syndication checking that something is
genuine or valid authorization checking

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:37.490
genuine or valid authorization checking
 

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.530
genuine or valid authorization checking
then it is allowed to do what it's

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:38.540
then it is allowed to do what it's
 

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.870
then it is allowed to do what it's
trying to do and at the station which is

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880
trying to do and at the station which is
 

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.940
trying to do and at the station which is
checking the integrity of a computing

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:42.950
checking the integrity of a computing
 

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.130
checking the integrity of a computing
device specifically and now Wayne is

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:45.140
device specifically and now Wayne is
 

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.419
device specifically and now Wayne is
going to show us how to do all this with

00:26:46.419 --> 00:26:46.429
going to show us how to do all this with
 

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:47.770
going to show us how to do all this with
Android things cool

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:47.780
Android things cool
 

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.440
Android things cool
thanks okay so now we've discussed the

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:50.450
thanks okay so now we've discussed the
 

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.750
thanks okay so now we've discussed the
key concepts so now let's talk about how

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760
key concepts so now let's talk about how
 

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.640
key concepts so now let's talk about how
we'd build something like this using the

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:54.650
we'd build something like this using the
 

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.320
we'd build something like this using the
various pieces that are available on

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:56.330
various pieces that are available on
 

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.600
various pieces that are available on
Android things and from other services

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:58.610
Android things and from other services
 

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.970
Android things and from other services
that Google provides the first step is

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:00.980
that Google provides the first step is
 

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.500
that Google provides the first step is
we can use something called nearby

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:02.510
we can use something called nearby
 

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.080
we can use something called nearby
connections and so nearby connections is

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.090
connections and so nearby connections is
 

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.669
connections and so nearby connections is
great because it provides an abstraction

00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679
great because it provides an abstraction
 

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:08.380
great because it provides an abstraction
layer that helps to find nearby devices

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.390
layer that helps to find nearby devices
 

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.900
layer that helps to find nearby devices
and it establishes an encrypted

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:10.910
and it establishes an encrypted
 

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.150
and it establishes an encrypted
communications Channel so under the hood

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:13.160
communications Channel so under the hood
 

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.450
communications Channel so under the hood
it uses Bluetooth ble Wi-Fi hotspots

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:16.460
it uses Bluetooth ble Wi-Fi hotspots
 

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.580
it uses Bluetooth ble Wi-Fi hotspots
it uses whatever is available to it at

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:18.590
it uses whatever is available to it at
 

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.620
it uses whatever is available to it at
the time and the other nice thing about

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:20.630
the time and the other nice thing about
 

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.390
the time and the other nice thing about
it once the connections established is

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:22.400
it once the connections established is
 

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.160
it once the connections established is
it provides a short human readable code

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.170
it provides a short human readable code
 

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.890
it provides a short human readable code
on both sides that you can display on

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:26.900
on both sides that you can display on
 

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.860
on both sides that you can display on
screens now many of you have used like

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:29.870
screens now many of you have used like
 

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.900
screens now many of you have used like
devices where it shows a little code on

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:31.910
devices where it shows a little code on
 

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.549
devices where it shows a little code on
the screen and that's great in most

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559
the screen and that's great in most
 

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:35.410
the screen and that's great in most
cases but we mentioned earlier that the

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:35.420
cases but we mentioned earlier that the
 

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.940
cases but we mentioned earlier that the
washing machine doesn't have a screen on

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:36.950
washing machine doesn't have a screen on
 

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.370
washing machine doesn't have a screen on
it so we don't have quite enough

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:39.380
it so we don't have quite enough
 

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.169
it so we don't have quite enough
security that we need and we're going to

00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:41.179
security that we need and we're going to
 

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:42.460
security that we need and we're going to
talk about how to address that in a

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:42.470
talk about how to address that in a
 

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.350
talk about how to address that in a
minute but nearby connections is sort of

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360
minute but nearby connections is sort of
 

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.000
minute but nearby connections is sort of
the first building block that we're

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.010
the first building block that we're
 

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.530
the first building block that we're
going to use and so if we look at some

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:47.540
going to use and so if we look at some
 

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.810
going to use and so if we look at some
code snippets this is just sort of an

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:49.820
code snippets this is just sort of an
 

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.190
code snippets this is just sort of an
abbreviated version of a nearby

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200
abbreviated version of a nearby
 

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.830
abbreviated version of a nearby
connection sample you can see here that

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840
connection sample you can see here that
 

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.330
connection sample you can see here that
we created nearby connections client at

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:55.340
we created nearby connections client at
 

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.850
we created nearby connections client at
the top we then specify some discovery

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:57.860
the top we then specify some discovery
 

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.250
the top we then specify some discovery
options we just use the default value

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.260
options we just use the default value
 

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.650
options we just use the default value
p2p cluster that's doesn't matter so

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:02.660
p2p cluster that's doesn't matter so
 

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.020
p2p cluster that's doesn't matter so
much what we use here and once we start

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.030
much what we use here and once we start
 

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.540
much what we use here and once we start
the discovery process we need to have a

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:07.550
the discovery process we need to have a
 

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.540
the discovery process we need to have a
service ID so in this case it's calm dot

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:10.550
service ID so in this case it's calm dot
 

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.760
service ID so in this case it's calm dot
example dot tensor wash and that is like

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:12.770
example dot tensor wash and that is like
 

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.950
example dot tensor wash and that is like
our products ID it's not the name of

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960
our products ID it's not the name of
 

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.649
our products ID it's not the name of
your app on Android it's the prod

00:28:16.649 --> 00:28:16.659
your app on Android it's the prod
 

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:19.830
your app on Android it's the prod
so they call it a service ID but it's

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840
so they call it a service ID but it's
 

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.450
so they call it a service ID but it's
what the name of your device is or

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.460
what the name of your device is or
 

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.129
what the name of your device is or
whatever you want to call it and then we

00:28:23.129 --> 00:28:23.139
whatever you want to call it and then we
 

00:28:23.139 --> 00:28:24.810
whatever you want to call it and then we
also have an endpoint discovery callback

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:24.820
also have an endpoint discovery callback
 

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.200
also have an endpoint discovery callback
which nearby connections will call your

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.210
which nearby connections will call your
 

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.200
which nearby connections will call your
code whenever a new device is discovered

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.210
code whenever a new device is discovered
 

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.570
code whenever a new device is discovered
and what you would do is you'd maintain

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:33.580
and what you would do is you'd maintain
 

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.820
and what you would do is you'd maintain
a ListView and you would have a UI that

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:35.830
a ListView and you would have a UI that
 

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.560
a ListView and you would have a UI that
updates showing all of the devices that

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:37.570
updates showing all of the devices that
 

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.909
updates showing all of the devices that
have been discovered because only we

00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919
have been discovered because only we
 

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:40.289
have been discovered because only we
want to be able to support more than one

00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:40.299
want to be able to support more than one
 

00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:42.359
want to be able to support more than one
device being available at a time and

00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:42.369
device being available at a time and
 

00:28:42.369 --> 00:28:44.070
device being available at a time and
then once the user was selected the one

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080
then once the user was selected the one
 

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.229
then once the user was selected the one
they want they can pick it and then we

00:28:46.229 --> 00:28:46.239
they want they can pick it and then we
 

00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:49.320
they want they can pick it and then we
can establish a connection on the device

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:49.330
can establish a connection on the device
 

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.710
can establish a connection on the device
side nearby supports a start advertising

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720
side nearby supports a start advertising
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.539
side nearby supports a start advertising
method where you basically provide a

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:54.549
method where you basically provide a
 

00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:56.549
method where you basically provide a
human readable name of the device and

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559
human readable name of the device and
 

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:58.799
human readable name of the device and
then you put the same service ID in and

00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:58.809
then you put the same service ID in and
 

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:00.779
then you put the same service ID in and
then you also set up some callbacks that

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:00.789
then you also set up some callbacks that
 

00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.700
then you also set up some callbacks that
will be called whenever a connection is

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:02.710
will be called whenever a connection is
 

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.690
will be called whenever a connection is
established so when the user has

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:06.700
established so when the user has
 

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.180
established so when the user has
selected the device so they've picked it

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.190
selected the device so they've picked it
 

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.460
selected the device so they've picked it
on the screen now we need to use the

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:11.470
on the screen now we need to use the
 

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.529
on the screen now we need to use the
request connection method which will

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:13.539
request connection method which will
 

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:15.629
request connection method which will
handle establishing the connection to

00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:15.639
handle establishing the connection to
 

00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:17.669
handle establishing the connection to
the remote endpoint ID that's been

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679
the remote endpoint ID that's been
 

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:19.799
the remote endpoint ID that's been
passed in once again there are callbacks

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:19.809
passed in once again there are callbacks
 

00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:22.649
passed in once again there are callbacks
there and then on connection initiated

00:29:22.649 --> 00:29:22.659
there and then on connection initiated
 

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:25.499
there and then on connection initiated
is used when the connection is starting

00:29:25.499 --> 00:29:25.509
is used when the connection is starting
 

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:28.739
is used when the connection is starting
to that device and it fills in a content

00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:28.749
to that device and it fills in a content
 

00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:31.019
to that device and it fills in a content
ocation token which is that short code

00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:31.029
ocation token which is that short code
 

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:34.049
ocation token which is that short code
we mentioned so nearby connections gives

00:29:34.049 --> 00:29:34.059
we mentioned so nearby connections gives
 

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:36.539
we mentioned so nearby connections gives
you a short human readable value once

00:29:36.539 --> 00:29:36.549
you a short human readable value once
 

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:38.129
you a short human readable value once
again we don't have a display so we'll

00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:38.139
again we don't have a display so we'll
 

00:29:38.139 --> 00:29:39.180
again we don't have a display so we'll
talk about how to do all that in a

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.190
talk about how to do all that in a
 

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.419
talk about how to do all that in a
minute

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:39.429
minute
 

00:29:39.429 --> 00:29:41.219
minute
but you can see here the code is really

00:29:41.219 --> 00:29:41.229
but you can see here the code is really
 

00:29:41.229 --> 00:29:42.539
but you can see here the code is really
simple to work with nearby connections

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:42.549
simple to work with nearby connections
 

00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:44.749
simple to work with nearby connections
and it gets us going quite quickly

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:44.759
and it gets us going quite quickly
 

00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:46.950
and it gets us going quite quickly
the next thing Darren talked about

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960
the next thing Darren talked about
 

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.499
the next thing Darren talked about
attestation and verifying the device so

00:29:49.499 --> 00:29:49.509
attestation and verifying the device so
 

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:51.149
attestation and verifying the device so
we need to make sure that the device in

00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159
we need to make sure that the device in
 

00:29:51.159 --> 00:29:52.619
we need to make sure that the device in
front of us is the one that we're

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:52.629
front of us is the one that we're
 

00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:55.169
front of us is the one that we're
actually connecting to so what we do on

00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:55.179
actually connecting to so what we do on
 

00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:57.180
actually connecting to so what we do on
the phone is we actually create what's

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.190
the phone is we actually create what's
 

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.680
the phone is we actually create what's
called a random challenge so it's a

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:58.690
called a random challenge so it's a
 

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.570
called a random challenge so it's a
random number that's unique just for

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:00.580
random number that's unique just for
 

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.639
random number that's unique just for
this connection and then we send that

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:02.649
this connection and then we send that
 

00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:05.219
this connection and then we send that
over to the device and we use this to

00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:05.229
over to the device and we use this to
 

00:30:05.229 --> 00:30:07.349
over to the device and we use this to
prevent replay attacks and the device

00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:07.359
prevent replay attacks and the device
 

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.389
prevent replay attacks and the device
takes the random challenge it combines

00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399
takes the random challenge it combines
 

00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:11.129
takes the random challenge it combines
it with the authentication code from

00:30:11.129 --> 00:30:11.139
it with the authentication code from
 

00:30:11.139 --> 00:30:12.899
it with the authentication code from
nearby connections brings them together

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:12.909
nearby connections brings them together
 

00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:16.019
nearby connections brings them together
and then it uses this to generate a new

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:16.029
and then it uses this to generate a new
 

00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:18.539
and then it uses this to generate a new
key in the Android key store with the

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:18.549
key in the Android key store with the
 

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:21.060
key in the Android key store with the
attestation certificate chain this

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.070
attestation certificate chain this
 

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.529
attestation certificate chain this
certificate chain is then sent back to

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:22.539
certificate chain is then sent back to
 

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:24.960
certificate chain is then sent back to
the phone and the phone can then check

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:24.970
the phone and the phone can then check
 

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.889
the phone and the phone can then check
it which we'll talk about in a minute

00:30:25.889 --> 00:30:25.899
it which we'll talk about in a minute
 

00:30:25.899 --> 00:30:28.229
it which we'll talk about in a minute
and even though we're using a random

00:30:28.229 --> 00:30:28.239
and even though we're using a random
 

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:30.419
and even though we're using a random
challenge the auth code from

00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:30.429
challenge the auth code from
 

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:32.249
challenge the auth code from
nearby is important because it helps to

00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:32.259
nearby is important because it helps to
 

00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:33.960
nearby is important because it helps to
bind it to the encryption channel that

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:33.970
bind it to the encryption channel that
 

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.119
bind it to the encryption channel that
we're using right now and another thing

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:36.129
we're using right now and another thing
 

00:30:36.129 --> 00:30:37.499
we're using right now and another thing
is that it's also important to rate

00:30:37.499 --> 00:30:37.509
is that it's also important to rate
 

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:40.200
is that it's also important to rate
limit failed connections so what you

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:40.210
limit failed connections so what you
 

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.489
limit failed connections so what you
don't want is for someone to be able to

00:30:41.489 --> 00:30:41.499
don't want is for someone to be able to
 

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:43.320
don't want is for someone to be able to
constantly connect your device and try

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:43.330
constantly connect your device and try
 

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.419
constantly connect your device and try
random codes and try to get it to

00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:45.429
random codes and try to get it to
 

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:46.919
random codes and try to get it to
generate some keys you better off rate

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:46.929
generate some keys you better off rate
 

00:30:46.929 --> 00:30:48.330
generate some keys you better off rate
limiting that to prevent people

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:48.340
limiting that to prevent people
 

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.119
limiting that to prevent people
attacking your device here's some of the

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:51.129
attacking your device here's some of the
 

00:30:51.129 --> 00:30:52.680
attacking your device here's some of the
code that does that don't worry about it

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:52.690
code that does that don't worry about it
 

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.820
code that does that don't worry about it
too much I just wanted to sort of show

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:53.830
too much I just wanted to sort of show
 

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.289
too much I just wanted to sort of show
you some bits and pieces of what there

00:30:55.289 --> 00:30:55.299
you some bits and pieces of what there
 

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:57.779
you some bits and pieces of what there
is but on the device we have the

00:30:57.779 --> 00:30:57.789
is but on the device we have the
 

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.239
is but on the device we have the
authentication token from nearby we take

00:31:00.239 --> 00:31:00.249
authentication token from nearby we take
 

00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:02.850
authentication token from nearby we take
in the random challenge that we got

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:02.860
in the random challenge that we got
 

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.039
in the random challenge that we got
earlier we combine it together we use

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:05.049
earlier we combine it together we use
 

00:31:05.049 --> 00:31:06.930
earlier we combine it together we use
this code to generate the signing key

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:06.940
this code to generate the signing key
 

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.570
this code to generate the signing key
here and the interesting part about when

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:09.580
here and the interesting part about when
 

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.249
here and the interesting part about when
you generate something in the Android

00:31:11.249 --> 00:31:11.259
you generate something in the Android
 

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:13.529
you generate something in the Android
key store is that it's done in a trusted

00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:13.539
key store is that it's done in a trusted
 

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:15.389
key store is that it's done in a trusted
execution environment so we don't

00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399
execution environment so we don't
 

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:17.430
execution environment so we don't
actually keep the key in our app we

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440
actually keep the key in our app we
 

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.720
actually keep the key in our app we
actually keep it in the trusted

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:18.730
actually keep it in the trusted
 

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.930
actually keep it in the trusted
execution environment and this is nice

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:21.940
execution environment and this is nice
 

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.519
execution environment and this is nice
because it means that even if someone

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:23.529
because it means that even if someone
 

00:31:23.529 --> 00:31:25.230
because it means that even if someone
hacks in our app they don't have the

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240
hacks in our app they don't have the
 

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.639
hacks in our app they don't have the
ability to pull out the private key so

00:31:26.639 --> 00:31:26.649
ability to pull out the private key so
 

00:31:26.649 --> 00:31:28.440
ability to pull out the private key so
that adds extra security to what we're

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.450
that adds extra security to what we're
 

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.350
that adds extra security to what we're
doing so anyway we put all this stuff in

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360
doing so anyway we put all this stuff in
 

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.239
doing so anyway we put all this stuff in
all those purple values are all just

00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:33.249
all those purple values are all just
 

00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:34.919
all those purple values are all just
standard constants that you use so don't

00:31:34.919 --> 00:31:34.929
standard constants that you use so don't
 

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:37.259
standard constants that you use so don't
worry about capturing this exactly later

00:31:37.259 --> 00:31:37.269
worry about capturing this exactly later
 

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:38.489
worry about capturing this exactly later
on we're going to release a sample that

00:31:38.489 --> 00:31:38.499
on we're going to release a sample that
 

00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:39.989
on we're going to release a sample that
has all of this in it but I just wanted

00:31:39.989 --> 00:31:39.999
has all of this in it but I just wanted
 

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:41.009
has all of this in it but I just wanted
to sort of walk you through a bit of it

00:31:41.009 --> 00:31:41.019
to sort of walk you through a bit of it
 

00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:47.249
to sort of walk you through a bit of it
but at the end you end up with you you

00:31:47.249 --> 00:31:47.259
but at the end you end up with you you
 

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:48.960
but at the end you end up with you you
extract out the certificate chain and

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:48.970
extract out the certificate chain and
 

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.629
extract out the certificate chain and
that is what you then pass back to the

00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639
that is what you then pass back to the
 

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:53.549
that is what you then pass back to the
phone for it to check it and do whatever

00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559
phone for it to check it and do whatever
 

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:55.799
phone for it to check it and do whatever
it's going to do so Darren mentioned

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:55.809
it's going to do so Darren mentioned
 

00:31:55.809 --> 00:31:58.080
it's going to do so Darren mentioned
earlier the concept of a certificate

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.090
earlier the concept of a certificate
 

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.019
earlier the concept of a certificate
chain and so the factory provision at a

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:01.029
chain and so the factory provision at a
 

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:03.029
chain and so the factory provision at a
station key also comes with a

00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039
station key also comes with a
 

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:06.060
station key also comes with a
certificate chain from this leaf all the

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.070
certificate chain from this leaf all the
 

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.409
certificate chain from this leaf all the
way back to the Android things root

00:32:07.409 --> 00:32:07.419
way back to the Android things root
 

00:32:07.419 --> 00:32:09.060
way back to the Android things root
certificate so now we have a full chain

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.070
certificate so now we have a full chain
 

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.799
certificate so now we have a full chain
for the key we just generated so right

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:10.809
for the key we just generated so right
 

00:32:10.809 --> 00:32:11.789
for the key we just generated so right
on the bottom that's what we just

00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799
on the bottom that's what we just
 

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.980
on the bottom that's what we just
created and it links all the way back to

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:13.990
created and it links all the way back to
 

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.489
created and it links all the way back to
the Android things root so now a tensor

00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:17.499
the Android things root so now a tensor
 

00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:19.080
the Android things root so now a tensor
wash is generated it's custom

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.090
wash is generated it's custom
 

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.119
wash is generated it's custom
attestation key and certificate chain

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:21.129
attestation key and certificate chain
 

00:32:21.129 --> 00:32:22.830
attestation key and certificate chain
and we've sent the chain back to the

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840
and we've sent the chain back to the
 

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.930
and we've sent the chain back to the
phone so the phone needs to verify that

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:24.940
phone so the phone needs to verify that
 

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.820
phone so the phone needs to verify that
this is a legitimate device that's

this is a legitimate device that's
 

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.980
this is a legitimate device that's
untampered with and that it's also the

one in front of us it's actually a
 

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.980
one in front of us it's actually a
pretty tedious process there's a number

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:31.990
pretty tedious process there's a number
 

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.450
pretty tedious process there's a number
of steps and it's probably something

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:33.460
of steps and it's probably something
 

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.739
of steps and it's probably something
that we should put in a library in the

00:32:34.739 --> 00:32:34.749
that we should put in a library in the
 

00:32:34.749 --> 00:32:36.690
that we should put in a library in the
future but the gist of what you need to

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.700
future but the gist of what you need to
 

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.639
future but the gist of what you need to
do is you need to verify that the

00:32:38.639 --> 00:32:38.649
do is you need to verify that the
 

00:32:38.649 --> 00:32:40.019
do is you need to verify that the
certificate chain is connected correctly

00:32:40.019 --> 00:32:40.029
certificate chain is connected correctly
 

00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:42.899
certificate chain is connected correctly
you need to verify that the root is the

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:42.909
you need to verify that the root is the
 

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:43.620
you need to verify that the root is the
trusted

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:43.630
trusted
 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.480
trusted
from Android things you need to verify

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:45.490
from Android things you need to verify
 

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.330
from Android things you need to verify
that it's your product ID you can verify

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:48.340
that it's your product ID you can verify
 

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.680
that it's your product ID you can verify
a 128-bit use UUID for the device this

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.030
a 128-bit use UUID for the device this
is something that at the factory you

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:54.040
is something that at the factory you
 

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.920
is something that at the factory you
could actually take and print on the box

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:55.930
could actually take and print on the box
 

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.290
could actually take and print on the box
with a code so that the user can verify

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:58.300
with a code so that the user can verify
 

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.610
with a code so that the user can verify
that they've actually matched it up

00:32:59.610 --> 00:32:59.620
that they've actually matched it up
 

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.400
that they've actually matched it up
against the one in front of them you can

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.410
against the one in front of them you can
 

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.170
against the one in front of them you can
verify the boot status when the key is

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:04.180
verify the boot status when the key is
 

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.420
verify the boot status when the key is
signed it sent over with a flag

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:06.430
signed it sent over with a flag
 

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.070
signed it sent over with a flag
indicating if the bootloader has been

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080
indicating if the bootloader has been
 

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.870
indicating if the bootloader has been
tampered with

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880
tampered with
 

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.280
tampered with
you verify the out of station challenge

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:11.290
you verify the out of station challenge
 

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.230
you verify the out of station challenge
which we'll talk about in a bit and then

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240
which we'll talk about in a bit and then
 

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.850
which we'll talk about in a bit and then
you end up with a public key that you

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:14.860
you end up with a public key that you
 

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.470
you end up with a public key that you
can save and it'll come in handy when we

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480
can save and it'll come in handy when we
 

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.850
can save and it'll come in handy when we
want to authenticate with cloud IOT

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:17.860
want to authenticate with cloud IOT
 

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.820
want to authenticate with cloud IOT
later on on the phone side we need to

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:20.830
later on on the phone side we need to
 

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.190
later on on the phone side we need to
verify that the attestation challenge is

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200
verify that the attestation challenge is
 

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.640
verify that the attestation challenge is
correct

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:23.650
correct
 

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.130
correct
so we extract the attestation from that

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.140
so we extract the attestation from that
 

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.160
so we extract the attestation from that
certificate and then we create a hash of

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.170
certificate and then we create a hash of
 

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.230
certificate and then we create a hash of
the authentication token from nearby and

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240
the authentication token from nearby and
 

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.490
the authentication token from nearby and
the random challenge are generated

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:32.500
the random challenge are generated
 

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.310
the random challenge are generated
earlier and we combine them together and

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320
earlier and we combine them together and
 

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.870
earlier and we combine them together and
we generate a hash and we check that it

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880
we generate a hash and we check that it
 

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.940
we generate a hash and we check that it
matches what came from the certificate

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:38.950
matches what came from the certificate
 

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.740
matches what came from the certificate
chain from the device and this sort of

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:40.750
chain from the device and this sort of
 

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.480
chain from the device and this sort of
verifies that this whole loop is

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:42.490
verifies that this whole loop is
 

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.640
verifies that this whole loop is
complete and secure and it's important

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:44.650
complete and secure and it's important
 

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.500
complete and secure and it's important
because we never actually sent the

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:46.510
because we never actually sent the
 

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.600
because we never actually sent the
authentication to the device directly it

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:48.610
authentication to the device directly it
 

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.820
authentication to the device directly it
was done by nearby and so this checks

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:50.830
was done by nearby and so this checks
 

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.620
was done by nearby and so this checks
that everything's done right and that

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:52.630
that everything's done right and that
 

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.790
that everything's done right and that
there's no man in the middle attack

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:53.800
there's no man in the middle attack
 

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.820
there's no man in the middle attack
happening along the way so now we know

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:56.830
happening along the way so now we know
 

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.670
happening along the way so now we know
the device is ours and it just sort of

00:33:59.670 --> 00:33:59.680
the device is ours and it just sort of
 

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.830
the device is ours and it just sort of
that helps to sort of deal with all

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840
that helps to sort of deal with all
 

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.960
that helps to sort of deal with all
these issues that we've identified so

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:03.970
these issues that we've identified so
 

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.580
these issues that we've identified so
now the phone has verified it can trust

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:05.590
now the phone has verified it can trust
 

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.620
now the phone has verified it can trust
tensor wash now we need to authorize the

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:07.630
tensor wash now we need to authorize the
 

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.690
tensor wash now we need to authorize the
device on our Wi-Fi network and the

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:09.700
device on our Wi-Fi network and the
 

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.110
device on our Wi-Fi network and the
quickest way is just to pop up a

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.120
quickest way is just to pop up a
 

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.129
quickest way is just to pop up a
activity on your phone and say what's

00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:14.139
activity on your phone and say what's
 

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.520
activity on your phone and say what's
the Wi-Fi SSID and password on't want to

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.530
the Wi-Fi SSID and password on't want to
 

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.320
the Wi-Fi SSID and password on't want to
do that it's not very user friendly and

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.330
do that it's not very user friendly and
 

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.210
do that it's not very user friendly and
it requires the user to enter their pass

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:21.220
it requires the user to enter their pass
 

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.550
it requires the user to enter their pass
phrase in and your app gets to see the

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560
phrase in and your app gets to see the
 

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.080
phrase in and your app gets to see the
passphrase while it's being sent over to

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:25.090
passphrase while it's being sent over to
 

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.619
passphrase while it's being sent over to
the device and the next thing you do is

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:28.629
the device and the next thing you do is
 

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:30.510
the device and the next thing you do is
on the device side you then need to use

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520
on the device side you then need to use
 

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.940
on the device side you then need to use
the Wi-Fi manager to set the SS ID and

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:32.950
the Wi-Fi manager to set the SS ID and
 

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:35.430
the Wi-Fi manager to set the SS ID and
passphrase so this is sort of a little

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440
passphrase so this is sort of a little
 

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.740
passphrase so this is sort of a little
code snippet that does it however Wi-Fi

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:37.750
code snippet that does it however Wi-Fi
 

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.030
code snippet that does it however Wi-Fi
manager is a little bit more complicated

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040
manager is a little bit more complicated
 

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.250
manager is a little bit more complicated
so if you look at the actual sample this

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:41.260
so if you look at the actual sample this
 

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.169
so if you look at the actual sample this
is the code you need to write to talk to

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:43.179
is the code you need to write to talk to
 

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.000
is the code you need to write to talk to
the Wi-Fi manager so this is something

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.010
the Wi-Fi manager so this is something
 

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.440
the Wi-Fi manager so this is something
that we're working on that we want to

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:46.450
that we're working on that we want to
 

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.510
that we're working on that we want to
make a small code library that you could

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520
make a small code library that you could
 

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.060
make a small code library that you could
use that skips all this to make it so

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.070
use that skips all this to make it so
 

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.080
use that skips all this to make it so
that you don't have to write that kind

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.090
that you don't have to write that kind
 

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.419
that you don't have to write that kind
of code and we have some more good news

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:54.429
of code and we have some more good news
 

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.450
of code and we have some more good news
in that we have a new API called nearby

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:57.460
in that we have a new API called nearby
 

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.190
in that we have a new API called nearby
setup that's coming to Google Play

00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200
setup that's coming to Google Play
 

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.710
setup that's coming to Google Play
services and the great thing about

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720
services and the great thing about
 

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.480
services and the great thing about
nearby setup which is coming soon is

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:03.490
nearby setup which is coming soon is
 

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.280
nearby setup which is coming soon is
that it has the ability to take the

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.290
that it has the ability to take the
 

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.780
that it has the ability to take the
Wi-Fi credentials stored on your phone

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:06.790
Wi-Fi credentials stored on your phone
 

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.079
Wi-Fi credentials stored on your phone
and pass them to another devices Google

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:10.089
and pass them to another devices Google
 

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:10.859
and pass them to another devices Google
Play services

00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:10.869
Play services
 

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:12.329
Play services
so Android things supports Google Play

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:12.339
so Android things supports Google Play
 

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:14.310
so Android things supports Google Play
services you can copy their credentials

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320
services you can copy their credentials
 

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.050
services you can copy their credentials
over without having to deal with

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.060
over without having to deal with
 

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.760
over without having to deal with
anything yourself the user doesn't need

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:17.770
anything yourself the user doesn't need
 

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.010
anything yourself the user doesn't need
to type them in and so this is great for

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.020
to type them in and so this is great for
 

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.599
to type them in and so this is great for
user convenience so this is coming soon

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:21.609
user convenience so this is coming soon
 

00:35:21.609 --> 00:35:23.839
user convenience so this is coming soon
and the details are going to be on

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:23.849
and the details are going to be on
 

00:35:23.849 --> 00:35:26.130
and the details are going to be on
developers.google.com/live I later on

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:26.140

when that's ready so we have internet

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200
when that's ready so we have internet
 

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200
when that's ready so we have internet
access on our device and we have a key

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.210
access on our device and we have a key
 

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.970
access on our device and we have a key
so now let's quickly talk about how

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:32.980
so now let's quickly talk about how
 

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.410
so now let's quickly talk about how
we're going to go about talking and

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:34.420
we're going to go about talking and
 

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.359
we're going to go about talking and
getting cloud services enabled on this

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:36.369
getting cloud services enabled on this
 

00:35:36.369 --> 00:35:37.650
getting cloud services enabled on this
device so we're going to talk about

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.660
device so we're going to talk about
 

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.800
device so we're going to talk about
firebase and cloud IOT so the first

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:40.810
firebase and cloud IOT so the first
 

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.810
firebase and cloud IOT so the first
thing we need to do is on the phone side

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:42.820
thing we need to do is on the phone side
 

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.640
thing we need to do is on the phone side
we need to set up firebase firebase is

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:44.650
we need to set up firebase firebase is
 

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.140
we need to set up firebase firebase is
great because it works on Android iOS

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.150
great because it works on Android iOS
 

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.230
great because it works on Android iOS
and web so the phone app could be on

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240
and web so the phone app could be on
 

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.180
and web so the phone app could be on
many kinds of devices you create a

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.190
many kinds of devices you create a
 

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.820
many kinds of devices you create a
firebase project ID and we're gonna use

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:53.830
firebase project ID and we're gonna use
 

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:54.990
firebase project ID and we're gonna use
that on both the phone and the device

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000
that on both the phone and the device
 

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.359
that on both the phone and the device
and then we ask the phone user to

00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:57.369
and then we ask the phone user to
 

00:35:57.369 --> 00:35:58.920
and then we ask the phone user to
authenticate with their username and

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:58.930
authenticate with their username and
 

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.920
authenticate with their username and
password pop up a dialog box and we'll

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:01.930
password pop up a dialog box and we'll
 

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.839
password pop up a dialog box and we'll
get a token that we then pass down the

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:03.849
get a token that we then pass down the
 

00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:05.190
get a token that we then pass down the
encrypted pipe that we created earlier

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200
encrypted pipe that we created earlier
 

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.410
encrypted pipe that we created earlier
so here is a bit of a code snippet for

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:07.420
so here is a bit of a code snippet for
 

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.180
so here is a bit of a code snippet for
it you can see at the top we're doing

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:09.190
it you can see at the top we're doing
 

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.250
it you can see at the top we're doing
the sign-in request and it's interesting

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:11.260
the sign-in request and it's interesting
 

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.130
the sign-in request and it's interesting
because we're only requesting scope for

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:14.140
because we're only requesting scope for
 

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.410
because we're only requesting scope for
the email ID so we don't want to have

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:16.420
the email ID so we don't want to have
 

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.320
the email ID so we don't want to have
full Google access or access to their

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.330
full Google access or access to their
 

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.210
full Google access or access to their
files or email or any thought that we're

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:21.220
files or email or any thought that we're
 

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.890
files or email or any thought that we're
just asking for their identification

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:22.900
just asking for their identification
 

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.470
just asking for their identification
details because we're trying to limit

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:25.480
details because we're trying to limit
 

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.000
details because we're trying to limit
the scope like what Darren talked about

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.010
the scope like what Darren talked about
 

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.670
the scope like what Darren talked about
earlier we end up getting a JSON web

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680
earlier we end up getting a JSON web
 

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.190
earlier we end up getting a JSON web
token that we can then pass in to sign

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200
token that we can then pass in to sign
 

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.109
token that we can then pass in to sign
in with firebase which then allows our

00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119
in with firebase which then allows our
 

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:37.770
in with firebase which then allows our
device to interact with firebase as well

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:37.780
device to interact with firebase as well
 

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.020
device to interact with firebase as well
but we shipped that token we shipped the

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.030
but we shipped that token we shipped the
 

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.730
but we shipped that token we shipped the
previous token off to the device so it

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:41.740
previous token off to the device so it
 

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.980
previous token off to the device so it
can login to firebase and do things with

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:43.990
can login to firebase and do things with
 

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.420
can login to firebase and do things with
that so on the other side we take the

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:48.430
that so on the other side we take the
 

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.730
that so on the other side we take the
Google token pass it a firebase and

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:50.740
Google token pass it a firebase and
 

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.650
Google token pass it a firebase and
authenticate with that and the device

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:52.660
authenticate with that and the device
 

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.859
authenticate with that and the device
now has access to the faith to the face

00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:55.869
now has access to the faith to the face
 

00:36:55.869 --> 00:36:58.859
now has access to the faith to the face
firebase real time database the code

00:36:58.859 --> 00:36:58.869
firebase real time database the code
 

00:36:58.869 --> 00:37:00.900
firebase real time database the code
snippet looks very similar on the device

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:00.910
snippet looks very similar on the device
 

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.579
snippet looks very similar on the device
as well because the Android things

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:02.589
as well because the Android things
 

00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:05.190
as well because the Android things
device is regular Android we use the

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200
device is regular Android we use the
 

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.079
device is regular Android we use the
same code just like we do on a phone we

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:07.089
same code just like we do on a phone we
 

00:37:07.089 --> 00:37:09.300
same code just like we do on a phone we
get the credential we pass it in to sign

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.310
get the credential we pass it in to sign
 

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.340
get the credential we pass it in to sign
in with credential to firebase off

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:11.350
in with credential to firebase off
 

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.390
in with credential to firebase off
and now we're done we now have a

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400
and now we're done we now have a
 

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.460
and now we're done we now have a
bi-directional authorization and our

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.470
bi-directional authorization and our
 

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.170
bi-directional authorization and our
tensor wash now can fully participate

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:16.180
tensor wash now can fully participate
 

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.410
tensor wash now can fully participate
with the firebase real-time database so

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:19.420
with the firebase real-time database so
 

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.480
with the firebase real-time database so
let's switch gears to finish up we can

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.490
let's switch gears to finish up we can
 

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.240
let's switch gears to finish up we can
also talk to cloud IT core so imagine

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.250
also talk to cloud IT core so imagine
 

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.350
also talk to cloud IT core so imagine
you're running a laundromat with

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:25.360
you're running a laundromat with
 

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.420
you're running a laundromat with
thousands of machines in thousands of

thousands of machines in thousands of
 

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.400
thousands of machines in thousands of
locations and you want to do predictive

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:29.410
locations and you want to do predictive
 

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.500
locations and you want to do predictive
breakdown analysis so we want to push

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:31.510
breakdown analysis so we want to push
 

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.590
breakdown analysis so we want to push
the data from these devices to cloud 80

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:34.600
the data from these devices to cloud 80
 

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.350
the data from these devices to cloud 80
for analysis so in cloud IT we register

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:37.360
for analysis so in cloud IT we register
 

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.690
for analysis so in cloud IT we register
the devices you'd have an app on your

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:39.700
the devices you'd have an app on your
 

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.730
the devices you'd have an app on your
phone with some credentials and you

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:41.740
phone with some credentials and you
 

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.920
phone with some credentials and you
would take that public certificate that

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:43.930
would take that public certificate that
 

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.660
would take that public certificate that
we've created earlier and you would give

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:45.670
we've created earlier and you would give
 

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.400
we've created earlier and you would give
that to cloud IOT so that it knows the

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.410
that to cloud IOT so that it knows the
 

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.220
that to cloud IOT so that it knows the
device and that it can trust it we then

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:50.230
device and that it can trust it we then
 

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.460
device and that it can trust it we then
use MQTT to send request to cloud IT

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.470
use MQTT to send request to cloud IT
 

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.340
use MQTT to send request to cloud IT
with our device ID and signed with our

legitimate by verifying this key and
checking it with what it received

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.130
checking it with what it received
 

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.090
checking it with what it received
earlier so then we send the mqt request

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:06.100
earlier so then we send the mqt request
 

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.210
earlier so then we send the mqt request
using TLS and we use TLS so that our

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:09.220
using TLS and we use TLS so that our
 

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.160
using TLS and we use TLS so that our
device knows that it can trust who it's

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.170
device knows that it can trust who it's
 

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.540
device knows that it can trust who it's
sending the data to because remember

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:12.550
sending the data to because remember
 

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.810
sending the data to because remember
both sides need to check the other side

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820
both sides need to check the other side
 

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.580
both sides need to check the other side
here's a very quick little snippet that

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:17.590
here's a very quick little snippet that
 

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.430
here's a very quick little snippet that
shows how we put in some of the project

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440
shows how we put in some of the project
 

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.840
shows how we put in some of the project
IDs and things like that and we're gonna

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:21.850
IDs and things like that and we're gonna
 

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.370
IDs and things like that and we're gonna
be releasing the sample too soon that

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:23.380
be releasing the sample too soon that
 

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.400
be releasing the sample too soon that
shows how to do cloud IT core on Android

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.410
shows how to do cloud IT core on Android
 

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.770
shows how to do cloud IT core on Android
things and so the nice thing is that

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:28.780
things and so the nice thing is that
 

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.210
things and so the nice thing is that
publish device State at the bottom

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:30.220
publish device State at the bottom
 

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.400
publish device State at the bottom
basically takes any binary blobs that

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:32.410
basically takes any binary blobs that
 

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.990
basically takes any binary blobs that
you want and sends it off to cloud 80

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000
you want and sends it off to cloud 80
 

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.010
you want and sends it off to cloud 80
and you don't have to worry about

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:35.020
and you don't have to worry about
 

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.040
and you don't have to worry about
generating any other messages so we

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:38.050
generating any other messages so we
 

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.810
generating any other messages so we
talked very quickly about cloud 80 and

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:39.820
talked very quickly about cloud 80 and
 

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.520
talked very quickly about cloud 80 and
firebase what are some other options of

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:41.530
firebase what are some other options of
 

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.870
firebase what are some other options of
things you can do well we also have

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880
things you can do well we also have
 

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.630
things you can do well we also have
smart home which is our new way of

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640
smart home which is our new way of
 

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.010
smart home which is our new way of
controlling devices from the Google

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:47.020
controlling devices from the Google
 

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.020
controlling devices from the Google
assistant so you can do things like if

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:49.030
assistant so you can do things like if
 

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.370
assistant so you can do things like if
you've got light bulbs you can say dim

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.380
you've got light bulbs you can say dim
 

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.110
you've got light bulbs you can say dim
the lights a little bit or in the case

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:52.120
the lights a little bit or in the case
 

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.640
the lights a little bit or in the case
of our washing machine if you implement

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:53.650
of our washing machine if you implement
 

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.440
of our washing machine if you implement
smart home you can do start my washing

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:55.450
smart home you can do start my washing
 

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.030
smart home you can do start my washing
machine and it'll kick off a load of

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040
machine and it'll kick off a load of
 

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.520
machine and it'll kick off a load of
laundry from the Google assistant and so

00:38:59.520 --> 00:38:59.530
laundry from the Google assistant and so
 

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.440
laundry from the Google assistant and so
by implementing firebase you write a

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:01.450
by implementing firebase you write a
 

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.300
by implementing firebase you write a
small web hook that plugs in a smart

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:03.310
small web hook that plugs in a smart
 

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.640
small web hook that plugs in a smart
home and then your device can be enabled

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:05.650
home and then your device can be enabled
 

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.680
home and then your device can be enabled
with the Google assistant and then

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.690
with the Google assistant and then
 

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.210
with the Google assistant and then
finally you can actually embed the

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:09.220
finally you can actually embed the
 

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.250
finally you can actually embed the
Google assistant SDK into your device

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:11.260
Google assistant SDK into your device
 

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.320
Google assistant SDK into your device
which means you can actually talk to the

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.330
which means you can actually talk to the
 

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.970
which means you can actually talk to the
washing machine and give it direct

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:14.980
washing machine and give it direct
 

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.890
washing machine and give it direct
commands to the machine directly which

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:16.900
commands to the machine directly which
 

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.340
commands to the machine directly which
is kind of cool so what's next we have a

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.350
is kind of cool so what's next we have a
 

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.620
is kind of cool so what's next we have a
factory key provisioning story coming

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:22.630
factory key provisioning story coming
 

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.150
factory key provisioning story coming
soon we're basically going to have a

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160
soon we're basically going to have a
 

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.230
soon we're basically going to have a
hardware device that's

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240
hardware device that's
 

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.420

things devices something you could do

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960
things devices something you could do
 

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.330
things devices something you could do
yourself or when they're being produced

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.340
yourself or when they're being produced
 

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.240
yourself or when they're being produced
and this is how this key is going to get

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.250
and this is how this key is going to get
 

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.890
and this is how this key is going to get
onto the device so if you have a

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:34.900
onto the device so if you have a
 

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.810
onto the device so if you have a
Developer Kit you won't be able to test

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:36.820

Developer Kit you won't be able to test
the key sign incorrectly because you

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.070
the key sign incorrectly because you
 

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.100
the key sign incorrectly because you
won't have an official key from Android

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.110
