00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.720
Thinking about the 2 x 2 matrix on the last slide, a real question for you is--

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.630
how does your product get to the customer?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.820
I think the real questions start with what type of product do I have.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.280
Do I have a product made out of bits that is--is it virtual or is my product a physical product.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.270
Now, I think that's a simple choice you need to make right now.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.050
Is your product physical or is it bits.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.690
The next thing you need to ask is what's going to be my distribution channel.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.170
Is it going to be direct--that is am I going to either offer it on a website AOL

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
or have direct sales people that work for me, or is it to be indirect.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.790
That is, am I going to put it on a third party website like an Amazon or a web aggregator,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.910
or physically, am I going to use system integrators or VARs

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750
or some other indirect channel like a retail store.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.820
Just select what you think will work for your product, and so later on in the lecture,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.790
we'll analyze the potential choices for you to pick for your product.
