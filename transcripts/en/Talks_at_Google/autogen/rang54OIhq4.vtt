HELEN RILEY: Well,
hello everyone.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.280
Thank you so much
for joining today.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.325
My name is Helen Riley,
and I work in finance.

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.630
And I support the Lorraine
on Global Marketing,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.330
as well as Patrick
and David Drummond.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.590
And one of the best
things about my job

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.870
is that I head up
developments together

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.040
with Lisa Gevelber
for Women at Google.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.940
And one of the new things that
we decided to launch this year

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.700
was a speaker series.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.550
And so I reached
out to my colleagues

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.910
in the People Dev
organization, and actually

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.140
one of the first names that
came up was Sally Hegelsen.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.680
And so I'm delighted to have
Sally come talk to us today.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.300
So Sally is an internationally
acclaimed author and speaker.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.370
She's done a number of
corporate leadership events

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.146
with a number of corporations--
well-known IBM, Microsoft, J&amp;J,

00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:55.520
HP, among others.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.360
And she's also the
author of six books.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.170
And her latest book is
called "The Female Vision."

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.670
I always mix up
feminine and female.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.620
"The Female Vision."

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.270
So she's here today to
talk to us about some

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.460
of the lessons from
that book, and talk

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.080
about what it is to
articulate a clear vision.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
How do we build allegiances
within an organization.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.710
How do we project presence
and a have executive presence.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.960
So a number of things she's
going to be talking about.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.086
So I'm delighted to
hand over to Sally.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.460
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.543
SALLY HELGESEN: Thank you.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.410
Thank you.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.350
Thank you so much.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.180
It is a pleasure
to be here, and I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.440
want to thank Helen
and Women at Google.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.640
It's my first visit
to the campus.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.704
And I love being here.

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:44.120
I love seeing all
the dogs around.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.800
It just puts you in a great
mood, and all the bikes.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.070
So it's a real pleasure.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.650
And what I want to
do today is to share

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.510
some of what I have learned
over 25 years of researching

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.390
and working with women
leaders in organizations

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.560
all around the world.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.620
And I want to focus
that on things

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.880
that you as women can do to
develop your own leadership

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.230
style, and for the men in the
audience-- both in the room

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.090
and out there in
different locations--

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.670
to also give you
some insights in ways

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.850
that you can drive some of
the best talent from the women

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.490
that you manage.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.870
So I'm going to be drawing
a lot of information here.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.870
I'm going to be focusing
on some of the things

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.620
that I learned both
in writing my most

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.490
recent book, "The Female Vision,
Women's Real Power at Work."

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.870
And some of the things that
I've learned in the years

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.750
since, because I've
worked with that material

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.330
to help women in hands-on
workshop and coaching

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.920
situations use the insights
and the research in that book

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.540
to strengthen their
own leadership style

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.202
and position themselves
well in their organization.

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:07.410
So that's what I'll be doing.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.610
I'm going to do this in
pretty much three parts.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.690
Briefly, I want to give
you a bit of background,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.590
so you can understand where
this focus comes from,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250
the kinds of experiences
that drove it.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.420
Then I want to
share with you what

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.970
I think of as two really red
hot insights from the book,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.590
"The Female Vision."

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.000
And then I want to have a
real discussion about how

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.750
those insights can
be applied to you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.100
in the management
of your own careers.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.750
So let me start by giving
you a bit of background.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.390
As I said, I've been
doing this for 25 years.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.630
And my journey working
with women leaders

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.370
and researching
women leaders began

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.310
when I did the research that
became the book published

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.140
in 1990, called "The
Female Advantage,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.810
Women's Ways of Leadership."

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.620
It has been continuously
in print, and was,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.800
I'm very proud to
say, the first book

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.519
that focused on what women had
to contribute to organizations,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.190
rather than how they
needed to change and adapt.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.020
That had not been
out there before.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.570
Like many books that really
hit a nerve with people--

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.830
I've never spoken, I once
had an Elvis impersonator

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.360
in the next room in Las Vegas--
but there's nothing we can do?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.440
We've just got the music?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.966
OK.

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:38.090
I'll try to groove with it.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.600
The book came from my
very personal experience.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.270
I had made a career shift
in the mid-late '80s.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.700
I'd moved from being an
independent journalist

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.520
and writer to working
with corporate executives

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.700
and helping them--
writing their speeches

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.030
and working with them to
deliver their speeches more

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.280
effectively.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.670
And in making that
change, I was concerned

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.400
about how I was going to be
perceived in the organization.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.870
I felt like a double outsider.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.660
There were very, very
few women at the level

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.250
that I was operating at.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.560
So I did two things.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.470
I studied the men around me.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.880
And I also read a lot
of books, because there

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.350
were books that were being
written at that time for women

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.470
coming into organizations
about what they

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.860
needed to do to be successful.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.200
And I got a lot from
what I was reading.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.300
It was quite helpful to me.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.800
But I noticed that
every single thing

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.190
I read focused on
how women needed

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.660
to change their
leadership style in order

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.710
to adapt to the workplace.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.740
There was nothing-- there
was no acknowledgement

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.730
that women might have
something to contribute,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.090
or that what they might
have to contribute

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.680
could be valuable
to organizations

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.160
in helping them
change and thrive

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.270
in a rapidly
changing environment.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.740
One thing I've learned
is women are really

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.310
avid consumers of books about
what is wrong with them.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.070
But it seemed to
be that there was

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.120
room to look at what
women could contribute,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.690
and that that would be helpful.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.770
So I decided to-- really
on my own initiative--

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.570
to start interviewing and
then doing diary studies-- so

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.070
shadowing-- some of
America's best women leaders,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.200
to try to define
what it was that they

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.200
did that could be powerful
for other women to learn from.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.680
And that could be
powerful for organizations

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.720
to understand what
they had to contribute.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.530
The woman I studied
were very different.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.330
Ethnically,
geographically, in terms

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.540
of what sector they were in.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.900
There was a big range.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.190
But what I found was there
were five characteristics

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.780
that these women, often very
different, had in common.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.640
First, the women placed
a very high value

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.110
on the quality of
the relationships

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.380
that they built, but
also the relationships

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.500
that people generally
in their organizations

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.460
were able to build
with one another.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.640
So they were very
relationship-focused.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.020
The women had a bias for
direct communication,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.980
rather than communication up
and down a chain of command.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.950
They wanted to talk directly to
whomever something concerned.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.690
The women liked
to put themselves

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.740
in the center of
things, and lead

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.660
from the center,
rather than the top.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.140
Some of them even
put their offices

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.410
in the center of
their organizations,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.860
and create what I
call webs of inclusion

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.440
to draw people in around them.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.790
The women were comfortable
with, as opposed to tolerant of,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.000
diversity.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.570
They themselves
had been outsiders,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.290
and had fresh eyes
for understanding

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.080
the kinds of things--
the kind of value

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.160
that an outsider
perspective could provide.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.090
And they also knew from
personal experience

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.530
what condescending
behavior felt like.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.830
And finally, the women
were skilled at integrating

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.000
their personal and their
professional lives,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.860
and drawing on--
a number of them

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.140
said to me, made a
point of saying--

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.340
I'm the same person at work
that I am at home as a mother,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.830
as a sister, as a wife, as
a member of my community.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.990
And that gives me a
real source of strength.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.790
And they were good at
drawing information

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.630
from their private life
and using it at work,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.850
and vice versa.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.850
Now what has been really
extraordinary in my experience,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.950
is to watch over the last--
that was put out there in 1990--

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.190
and those characteristics
have become in the years

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.470
since, really thought
of, and often defined

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.820
as women's leadership
characteristics.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.610
But what has been
amazing is to watch

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.610
the way in which those
characteristics have

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.730
become much more mainstream and
recognized as characteristics

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.240
of excellent leaders in general.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.510
I've been able to
witness that, and it

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.030
has been really extraordinary.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.520
And it is because
the environment,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.770
the economic environment that
we're part of, technology,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.550
and of course,
demographic change,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:53.560
have all supported the
recognition of those leadership

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.730
characteristics as important.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.252
As organizations have had
to connect more directly

00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:00.710
with customers and
clients, they've

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.070
gotten more focused
on relationships.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.430
I tell you when "The
Female Advantage" came out,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.540
and I talked about that
value the women placed

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.600
on relationships, I was
told, don't go there.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.710
Because talking about
relationships makes

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.750
it sound very soft.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.940
And it's not good for women.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.950
Now every bank wants to have
a relationship with you.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.900
There's a real emphasis on
the value of relationships.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.090
Obviously, comfort
with diversity,

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.760
more and more
important as we have

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.900
more diverse and
globalized workforce.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.760
The ability to put
yourself in the center

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.580
of things rather than the top.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.750
More adaptive as more work
gets done in teams and webs.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.510
The ability to integrate
personal and professional,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.230
again, more important,
more adaptive as we

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.950
move into a 24/7 environment.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.050
And obviously a bias
for direct communication

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.500
is more and more of a
necessary skill given

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500
the nature of
network technologies.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.070
So it has been extraordinary to
watch this sort of confluence

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:10.710
between what I saw women often
bringing to organizations where

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.660
these characteristics had not
been defined as leadership

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.760
characteristics, and the way
in which the environment was

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.170
demanding these qualities.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.820
In fact, it was so interesting
to me, a couple months ago,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.480
Tom Friedman, the New
York Times columnist,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.000
did a series called
what it takes work

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.950
at Google, in which he
interviewed Laszlo Bock,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.480
and talked about what leadership
characteristics Google was

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.550
looking for.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.350
And I wrote a blog about it--
because I blog for "Strategy

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.860
and Business" magazine--
the extraordinary overlap

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.820
between what Bock was describing
as desirable characteristics

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.980
for leaders, especially
collaborative skills,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.330
relationship
building, the ability

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.280
to work seamlessly
in webs and teams,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.100
and assume different
positions within them,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.060
putting yourself in the middle.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.820
And I thought it
is extraordinary

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.260
that what Bock is describing,
25 years ago, 20 years ago,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.540
were really considered
women's leadership strengths.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.360
And I think that has been very
much to the advantage-- not

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.290
only of many women,
but it has also

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.990
freed many men to explore
other sides of themselves,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.640
and recognized
that they could be

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.830
strong leaders while doing that.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.440
So I think it has been
a very good thing.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:42.550
That said, about
2006 or 2007, even

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.970
I, who tend to be a "glass
half full" type person,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.360
began to think, now there's
something amiss here.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.590
If women are bringing these
skills often to organizations,

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.390
and these skills are becoming
recognized more as mainstream

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.590
leadership skills, and
organizations are often

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:11.320
hiring women at 50%, and women
are becoming increasingly

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.590
represented at the top in terms
of business and professional

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.410
schools, why aren't
they are more women

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.640
at the very top, where they're
making the kinds of decisions

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.940
that have the real strategic
influence on the direction

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.040
of their organizations, and
on our society as a whole?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.420
Why is there a leadership
barrier, or gap, still

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.420
in place, especially
given this confluence

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.050
between what women bring and
what organizations increasingly

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.480
need?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.990
And what caught my
eye as I pondered

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.540
this-- and a lot of other people
who are in this field generally

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.360
were thinking about
that then, and still

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.130
are-- what struck me were two
studies that I came across,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.040
one down in Madrid, one
down at INSEAD, sort

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:08.770
of the HBS of France and
Europe generally, both of which

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.750
were big global studies,
and both of which

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.900
showed the same thing.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.550
What they showed is that when
interviewing senior leaders

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:26.520
in organizations about where
they saw women's strengths

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.810
and women's weaknesses, the
kinds of characteristics

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.090
we've been talking
about-- collaboration,

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.710
relationship building,
direct communication,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.130
negotiation-- the
senior leaders felt

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.000
that the women in
their organizations

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.900
demonstrated them.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.160
But consistently what
those senior leaders

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.360
said, point where they
felt women had a weakness

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.460
or needed to develop
more strength,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.640
was around the question
of vision, big picture

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.040
thinking, long-term focus.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.970
So the executives in these
two huge global studies

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.300
were critical of
their women in terms

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.840
of their capacity
for vision and this

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.170
was an impediment to women's
perception of being ready

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.030
for leadership.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.590
And what was fascinating
also in the study,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.610
because women often routinely
tend to under assess themselves

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.470
and their skills based on how
they're perceived by others,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.860
is the women didn't
see this gap at all.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.795
The women felt that they
had a strong vision.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.890
That they represented long-term
thinking and big picture

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.700
focus very well.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:57.160
So I thought, something
isn't translating here.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.030
Maybe it's time to
explore what vision really

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:08.040
is in organizations, and where
there may be a gap, where

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.340
women's vision may not be
translating in organizations,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.240
so that it can be understood
and recognized and valued

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.120
by senior leaders.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.810
Doing that seemed to me an
extremely worthwhile project,

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.380
because in doing so, I thought
there's an opportunity to,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.260
on one hand help women
to better understand

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.410
the nature of their
vision, and articulate it

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.600
in a way that can be
heard, and at the same time

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.560
there's an opportunity to
help organizations recognize

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.000
the power of vision that women
have the capacity to bring.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.840
So this became my quest.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.480
This became sort of in my
view, the next frontier

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.700
that we needed to research and
get some ideas and some answers

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.950
for, in terms of the next area
to think about development

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.200
of leadership
capacity for women.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.540
So that's what I
began focusing on.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.579
And I want to very briefly share
two insights from the really

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:24.210
huge research project that
I undertook with a team

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.850
to identify and articulate
what the female vision is,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.180
and where its
power could reside.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.620
And then we'll open
it up and start

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.350
to look at what does this
mean for you next Monday

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.080
morning, in terms of building a
leadership style that can lead

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.240
you to make a contribution
that really reflects your best

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.770
talents, your true talents, and
create a career for yourself

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.810
that's very satisfying in
the course of doing that.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.510
The two insights, so I
want to do this briefly.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:05.650
The first one-- and this I
think, is really a big deal.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.990
What we learned.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.490
Not just from doing
interviews and case studies,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:14.420
but also from working with some
neuroscientific labs at UCLA

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.320
and Columbia that
were doing research

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.320
on what happens when people's
brains are operating.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.320
What we learned is that--
now of course we're human,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.050
so there's always
a spectrum here,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.580
it's not all men are this way
and all women are that way.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.780
But what we learned is that
in general, women's attention

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.360
tends to operate in
some distinctive ways.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.030
What women notice, which is
a building block of vision.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.710
Think about, what is vision?

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.580
Vision is what you notice.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.450
Then it's what you value
about what you notice.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.840
And then it's the
story you tell yourself

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.780
about why what you're
noticing is important.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.600
So notice is really the
building block of vision.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.080
This primary building block.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:08.000
And what we found is that women
tend to notice a lot of things

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.670
at once.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.050
And this is verifiable
in neuroscientific labs

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.360
when they hook people
up to functional MRIs

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.440
and watch the
brain in operation.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.160
Women are noticing
all the time, they're

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.480
noticing different
things at once.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.460
Their attention is scanning and
operating kind of like a radar,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.380
and they're processing in
parallel a lot of information

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.860
from different sources.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.320
Whereas men tend to have a much
more focused style of noticing,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.530
looking at one thing
at a time, focusing in

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.510
on it, with their
attention operating

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.390
more like a laser,
rather than a radar.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.310
And this matters.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.390
This matters when we
think about leadership,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.130
because in many organizations,
in many organizations,

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:05.690
focused notice is perceived of
and privileged as a leadership

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:06.870
style.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.930
And those who have a more
broad spectrum notice,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.790
as we called it in the book,
are thought of sometimes

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.970
as being all over
the place by those

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.800
who have very focused notice.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.880
I can give you an example,
a day to day example

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.350
of how this operates and what
some of the consequences are.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.630
Right here in the Bay Area, I
spent some time with a woman--

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.210
Susan Bernstein,
she had got her MBA,

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.180
she joined a hotshot
consulting firm.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.110
And when she came in, she was
told, your first big client

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.220
case, your first proceeding,
I want you to go to that.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.860
Don't say anything.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.070
Just notice.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.690
Just notice what is
going on in that room.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.330
So Susan went to the
meeting, and she noticed.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:59.460
And what she noticed was
that the two chief clients

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.420
on this project couldn't
stand one another, nor could

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.920
their staffs.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.080
It was in their
body language, it

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.990
was a real feeling of
tension in the room.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.370
And when she came back to her
meeting and she was asked,

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.300
what did you notice?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.000
She said that.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.970
She said what I
noticed, the big thing

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.750
I noticed is that these
two guys seem to be at one

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.610
another's throats.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.790
And what she was
told was, that's

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.810
not what you were
supposed to notice.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.190
You're not there as
an HR consultant.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.420
You are there as a
business consultant.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.630
What you were supposed to
notice was the presentation

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.610
and the numbers.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.120
How did you think they added up?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.230
And she said, I went away from
that meeting thinking, boy

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.910
did I blow it.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.100
I will never do that again.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.340
And she said, I spent
the next seven years

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.150
in that organization
suppressing my capacity

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.390
to notice what was going
on among people, so

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.050
that I could better
fit the mold.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.550
She said, and the result of
that, the result of that,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.740
was that I lost my passion
for what I was doing.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.730
Because I felt inauthentic.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.120
I felt as if I was
constantly using energy

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.830
to suppress what my
best observations were.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.860
And she said, and oh
by the way, six months

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.290
after I joined that team,
that project blew up.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.970
And it blew up not because
the numbers were poor,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.470
but because these two guys
were at one another's throats,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.790
and ended up in a lawsuit
that, in fact, involved us.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.000
She said, so there
was a real consequence

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.910
for me suppressing that.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.210
But I still knew,
and I was given

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.170
to understand that that
information was not

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.070
what my company
wanted me to hear.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:57.470
So there's an
example of the cost

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.520
of suppressing the power
of what you notice.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.680
It seemed very,
very clear to me.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.300
And one of the things that
I have come to believe

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.500
is that this capacity
for broad spectrum notice

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.250
is something that
in 10 or 15 years,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.940
we will really recognize
as a leadership attribute,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.455
in the same way that we
have come to recognize skill

00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:27.430
at collaboration,
relationship building,

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.850
and direct communication as a
strong leadership attribute.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.440
I think that because
organizations

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.960
are changing so rapidly,
and innovation is so much

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.890
a part of where organizational
value gets defined,

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.920
that that capacity for
broad spectrum notice

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.890
will become more important.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.450
And the more prepared
we are to recognize

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.734
what it is, and articulate its
value in a way-- and this it

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.900
what we'll be getting to
int the sort of how to part

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.790
of this-- that laser-like
noticers can understand,

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:10.700
the more opportunity we'll
have to position ourselves

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.380
for leadership and for
being able to leverage

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.000
the power of that.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.150
I think that's going to happen.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.770
About a couple months after
the female vision came out,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.370
I read an interview with
Jeff Immelt, the chair

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.510
and CEO of GE.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.120
And he was asked, what is
the number one leadership

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.770
capability that GE is going
to be hiring for and training

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.290
for in the years ahead.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.170
And what he said
was, the capacity

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.790
to see around the
corners, because that's

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.620
what's needed in
today's environment.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.610
And I thought, how are you
going to see around the corners

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.500
unless you're skilled at
harnessing both broad spectrum

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.650
and focus notice.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.330
When they work together,
you've got an opportunity

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:05.060
to get more information than
you would if it were alone.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.550
So I'm going to
stop for a moment,

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.510
because that's a certain
amount of material.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.330
I do have one other
insight from the book,

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.060
and then we'll drill
down more on to asking

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.280
you to think about how
this might apply to you.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.300
But are there any questions
here on the question of notice,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.130
or on the leadership
capabilities that we've

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:32.850
been discussing, or the way
in which those have become

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.070
more recognized as mainstream?

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.210
Has that been your experience?

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.740
Do have anything that
you can share on that?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.700
AUDIENCE: It's actually
rather enlightening for you

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.890
to say that that
broad spectrum notice,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.940
or women aren't
considered to have

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.220
much vision is one of the
things you want to point out,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.890
because actually I left my
last role because my manager,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.780
a male manager, said I didn't
have any strategy or vision.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.807
And I said, well you're
ignoring the project

00:26:02.807 --> 00:26:04.390
I've been spending
most my time doing,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.050
which is a strategic
vision for the next step.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.810
And I came over here
to Google in order

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.120
to work for a woman
who I think thinks

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.250
I have strategy and vision.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.680
I think my question then is,
if you feel that you do have

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.230
strategy and vision, how do
you express that to someone who

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.205
thinks you don't?

00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:27.080
SALLY HELGESEN: Someone
who thinks you don't.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.550
So this will get
us a little more--

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:34.140
we can do this-- move
into some of the practices

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.750
that I've been talking about,
that we'll be focusing on here.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.150
So let me get into that
and answer your question.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.540
Because I think that's sort
of the key question here.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.520
How do you-- if you think,
like the women in the study--

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.800
if you think you've got strong
vision and a strategic way

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.570
of thinking, how do you--
as it were-- translate that

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.950
to somebody who may have
a very narrow noticing

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.090
style, and therefore is judging
you as someone who doesn't,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.350
because you're not
articulating it in ways

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.150
that they're comfortable with.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.060
How do you do that?

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.940
And most of this
I've really learned

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.630
since the book came out,
working with women to develop

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.460
their capacity to articulate and
translate what their vision is.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.330
A couple things that I think
are important, and some of them

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.880
come from talking to Susan
Bernstein afterwards,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.850
seven, eight years afterwards.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.280
One of the questions
I asked her is,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.250
what would you have
done differently,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.210
when you came into
that meeting and said,

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.250
I noticed these two guys were
at one another's throats?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.540
Is this is there a different
way you would have handled that?

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.340
And she said a
couple things that I

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.300
think are really helpful in
thinking about how to do this.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.540
How to translate this capacity.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.950
She said first of all,
these are real data guys.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:05.990
They're MBAs, they think,
live, breathe, eat numbers.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.672
She said, first of
all, I would have gone

00:28:08.672 --> 00:28:10.130
and in the first
thing I would have

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.800
done would be to address
what they were interested in,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.170
and show them I saw the numbers,
this is how I perceived them,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.300
whether than saying, this
is the main thing I noticed.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.790
She said because
right away, what I

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.590
learned with them
is they were going

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.710
to see that as, to
some degree, off topic.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.150
So getting out of
the way addressing

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.630
what I understood
was important to them

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.570
would have been helpful to me.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.350
She said, secondly,
I should have

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:46.310
been more data-like in my
presentation of what I noticed,

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.230
rather than just saying,
and I noticed this.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.815
And then trying to
give the details.

00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:57.800
You know, so and so's admin
seemed to sit in a place

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.040
that the other
admin-- you know, all

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.610
these kind of little details
that she was giving to justify

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.670
or explain what she noticed.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:10.160
She said, I wish I had presented
that more as data, going

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.480
in and saying
something like, here's

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.040
what I noticed
about the numbers.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.500
Here's what I think is
important about that.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.700
I will say that in order
for this to happen,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.660
and that to happen,
and that to happen,

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:30.090
we need to have a real strong
commitment from the two

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.410
principles, because here's
one way that could fall apart.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.580
Here's another way
that could fall apart.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.270
So that I was really explaining
to them why I thought

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.360
it was important for them,
for their bottom line,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.620
for what they were
concerned about.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.690
That these two principles
were on the same page.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.220
She said, and then
if I had said,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:57.210
and I have concerns about how
long-term their commitment

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.700
to one another is.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.080
And I can share with you the
reasons for those concerns

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.000
offline.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.970
She said, because
in a way, these guys

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.430
were a little bit uncomfortable
with that kind of material.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.660
So I can explain
that to you when

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.130
we're offline, if you'd like.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.680
But I have concerns.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.310
And here, I think, are some
of the potential consequences

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.110
for us, for our division,
if there are problems

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.250
down the line.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.520
Here are a couple scenarios.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.490
She said, I could have
even had a slide or two

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.860
about what these scenarios were.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.010
She said, in other words, if
I had really translated that

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:44.090
into a style of presentation
that they were comfortable

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:50.140
with, rather than presenting it
as very contextual and almost

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.880
as they would see
it, subjective,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.800
I think I would have
had a better shot.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.140
She said, but the
other thing I learned

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.660
is the big mistake I
made was to back off.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.560
And to immediately
think, oh boy, I blew it.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:14.080
And to take that to heart
and pull away from it.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.380
She said, I should have gone
in there really prepared

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.320
to not argue the case,
but present the case,

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.080
for why this was important,
and represent that.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.960
She said, because that's
really the vision part.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.260
She said, my vision here is we
needed to address this issue.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.750
We needed to
recognize this issue.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.000
We needed to be prepared
for the kinds of things that

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.300
could go wrong
because of this issue.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.400
That was my vision.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.170
That's what I saw.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:52.820
She said, I needed to explain it
in terms that they understood.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.260
And I needed to be
prepared to defend myself,

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.570
instead of just
quickly backing off.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:08.430
So I think that's sort of the
take away here, is be prepared

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.630
to-- I don't want to use
the word defend it-- but be

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.390
prepared to back it up
and stand your ground.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.730
But know that in presenting
what you have to present,

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:26.880
if you're presenting to a very
bottom-line, get the point,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.440
focused notice
boss, you want to be

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.660
able to articulate that in a way
that they are comfortable with.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.410
And where they're
not being asked

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.280
to imagine a situation
that they're not

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.220
very good at
noticing or judging.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.860
Because that's going to
then make them feel like,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.930
how did I miss that?

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.420
Is there something
wrong with me?

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.270
Clearly not.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.840
She's one of these
touchy-feely women who's

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.060
all concerned about what
people's relationships are

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.780
with one another.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.820
That's not really
what we're here for.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.400
We're business consultants.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.410
So she said she
could have really

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.610
handled that differently.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:13.750
And understood that
bringing both perspectives

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.450
together could be
really valuable.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.640
There's one other
thing I want to say,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.090
because I've gotten very aware
this of kind of presentation

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:24.720
since the book came
out and since I've

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.940
worked with some women, I worked
down in San Diego for a while

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.370
with women in a
biotech firm, who

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.480
were having real
problems presenting

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.300
what some of their
research points are,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.890
because they were
getting critiqued

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.640
as being all over the map.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.650
So we were really trying
to almost reverse engineer

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:47.240
and figure out what do you
need in this presentation

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.070
about this data?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.630
What is going to set
these guys at ease?

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.960
And in watching, because
I did some role playing.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.220
But in watching some
of the presentations,

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.940
here's one thing I
saw over and over.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.360
Women would often start
with a kind of back story

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.300
to let their listeners
know how they came up

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.870
with what they came up with.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.739
So they'd begin,
you know, I'm going

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.770
to tell you how I came
to this research point.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.871
And I'll tell you this
research point in a moment.

00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:16.370
But let me tell you
how I got there.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.860
Let me tell you the process
by which I got there.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.540
I was having a
conversation with so an

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.690
so-- you've lost them already.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.989
If you've got a really
tightly focused focus

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.719
noticer, a laser-light
guy, his mind

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:36.199
almost clicks off when
you start to tell him

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.889
what the back story is.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:41.880
Much more powerful-- because
we've gone through this,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.489
we've gone through this process
and watched it work-- much more

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.409
powerful, is to be
able to present it

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.659
in a very focused,
data-like way.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.520
And then say, if you're
interested at some point in how

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.130
I got to this, be glad
to share it with you.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.750
But not do it as the opener.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.500
Because often women
use personal stories

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.540
to establish relationship as
a way of sharing and preparing

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.170
to share information.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.400
And often, not
always, there are men

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.110
who are very
different than this.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.690
But often with men in
real business situations,

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.520
that's not cultural for them.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.020
And it's not something
they're comfortable with.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.200
So it can certainly
be surmounted.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.900
And this was one of my goals
in developing and looking

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.670
at what is a female vision?

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.590
How can that be incorporated?

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.100
Part of it is how
do we interpret it?

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.015
So, great question.

00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:42.030
Does that help?

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.570
Thanks.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.790
AUDIENCE: About describing
being things to an audience that

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.750
is more laser-like in their
focus, and starting with data

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.270
and then offering to
tell a personal story

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.710
if it would be
helpful at the end.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.710
SALLY HELGESEN: Correct.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.340
AUDIENCE: I feel like striking
that balance is really hard.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.690
I know that when I in
the past have started

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.740
with telling a personal story
or making a personal connection,

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.140
that it has been met at
times with skepticism,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.070
and then you lose your audience
and you can't get it back.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.290
And I feel like I've
over corrected now.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.914
Now I feel like I don't
talk about myself as often.

00:36:19.914 --> 00:36:21.580
I don't make those
personal connections.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.870
I don't share those
stories, because I've over

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.055
corrected after having been
met with this skepticism.

00:36:28.055 --> 00:36:28.930
SALLY HELGESEN: Yeah.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.540
AUDIENCE: And I do feel
like, especially at Google,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.570
it's helpful to tell
those personal stories

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.630
and make those personal
connections even

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.990
with people with the
laser-like focus.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.360
And so getting it right here,
I think, has been a challenge,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.170
because I understand what
you're talking about,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.120
but I feel like this environment
may be a little unique.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.200
At least on the legal team,
I think, where I work.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.060
SALLY HELGESEN: I love
that, because I have watched

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.810
women do this.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.320
And the biotech team
that I was working

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.950
with for a while,
that began to happen.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.790
They began to, OK
we're going to do this.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.220
We're going to do
the data thing.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.210
And suddenly they had
lost their personality.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.915
And women are often very
ripe to be criticized.

00:37:13.915 --> 00:37:17.430
And it was like,
well she's a robot.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.990
She doesn't seem to have
any warmth or personality.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.180
This is what happened
to Susan Bernstein.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.190
The woman up in the Bay
Area, up in the east bay.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.910
When she said, I lost who I was.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.490
I lost part of what my
authentic value was.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.340
And she said, I began
to-- I remember years ago

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.560
I read a fantastic quote
from a woman that just,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.620
to me, epitomized
what happens when

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.190
you lose your
authenticity at work.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:51.900
She said, sometimes I feel as
if my body is only a vehicle

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.330
to carry my head
to the computer.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.270
And to me, that sort of
encapsulates everything

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.860
we want to avoid as people.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.210
And I think that comes
when you suppress

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.450
what's good in yourself.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:15.950
So what you're doing, what
you're noticing, that you over

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.700
corrected, is part of
a process, I believe,

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:26.990
of coming to a very strong
and authentic way of being

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.520
in the world and
presenting yourself.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.810
On one hand, you have the
confidence and the humility

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.320
to notice that the way
you were presenting

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.820
wasn't necessarily landing
in the way you wanted.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.500
So you made correction.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.330
But then you're open
to also noticing

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.950
that you corrected
too far, and you're

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.680
searching to find
that balance point.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.190
But you can't search to find
that balance point unless you

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.350
are aware of what
both feel like.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.360
And it sounds as if you are.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.610
So I would say is
that this is really

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:06.090
part of this process to
getting toward a very

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:11.000
strong and authentic way of
presenting what your vision is.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.500
And that one of
the things, I hope,

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.510
is that being able to
recognize and articulate

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.460
some of these
differences-- putting it

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:25.430
in the frame of laser
and radar notice--

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.830
and recognizing where your
own capabilities and comfort

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.800
level lie, that
that in itself can

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:38.100
be helpful in identifying
what the issue is,

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.990
and then coming to understand
how to take action.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.360
OK.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.520
Let me go to the one other
quick insight from the book

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.060
that I'd like to share.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.830
And then we'll do
more of this in terms

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.930
of focusing on what
it means to you.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.400
We talk about vision
as what you notice,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.820
then the next step
is what you value.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.220
So one thing we
really wanted to learn

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.390
was what are the similarities
and differences in what men

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.580
and women really value
about their work,

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.560
about their experience in the
organizations they're part of.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.770
Where's that overlap?

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.090
How does that happen?

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.920
So we ran out a
big-- because when

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.620
you ask a question
about what you value,

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.050
it can be pretty abstract--
so what we did was

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:33.690
we ran out a big study looking
at similarities and differences

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:39.930
in how men and women perceive,
define, and pursue satisfaction

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.540
at work.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.290
And what we found--
so it was a big study,

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.410
we used Harris
Interactive to deliver it.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:50.240
It was a huge sample of
people in a variety of levels,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.920
director and above
in organizations.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.750
And what we found is that there
were some strong similarities

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.270
between what men
and women valued.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.160
They wanted to be recognized.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.480
They wanted to feel
authentic at work.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.780
They wanted to be recognized
for their real achievements.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.580
They took great
satisfaction in being

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.550
a part of a team
or leading a team.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.260
And they took great satisfaction
in achieving goals and being

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.600
able to check those off.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.860
But we found two areas
of significant difference

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.600
in terms of value.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.200
And I think this has
a real impact in terms

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.790
of how you think about your
vision and positioning yourself

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.470
in the organization.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.120
The two areas that
were different

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:46.900
were, first of all, women tended
to define their success based

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.410
on their own terms that
they had set for themselves.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.880
Whereas the men in
this study really

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.680
defined success
almost exclusively

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.940
in competitive terms.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.990
I came out ahead of him.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.530
And therefore I'm satisfied.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.560
So it was very
competitive in terms

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.890
of how they perceive
success, whereas women

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.090
were more likely to have their
own benchmarks for success.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.640
And the other thing was
that women were more

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:20.600
focused upon and tended
to judge as satisfying

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:26.350
the everyday experience
of work that they had.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:31.780
Whereas the men that we
studied were more likely to

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:38.550
perceive satisfaction based on
position and monetary reward.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.590
Position and monetary reward
were important for women,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.840
not saying that.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.520
But they were important to women
in the context of also having

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.160
a satisfying
experience of everyday.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.130
And that experience was
often defined by the ability

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:59.230
to develop high
quality relationships

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:04.650
and maintain them over time, and
by the capacity to some extent

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.520
control their own pace at work.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.140
And these differentials,
I think, really do matter.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.540
And when we think about it,
one of the things that we see

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.120
is that organizations,
given this,

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:27.680
often define motivation
or assume motivation

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.000
based on primarily
male criteria.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.760
The idea is competitive ranking
will be a spur to performance.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.440
Maybe.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.670
Maybe not.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.650
It's kind of a diversity issue.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.820
Competitive ranking
isn't going to be

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.290
a spur to performance
for everyone.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.230
And yet, we see, I mean we even
see organizations even now,

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.310
adopting these
competitive curves, which

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.420
can be very problematic.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.440
And then this strikes me as
not much of an issue here,

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.500
which makes my heart
sing, I will say.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.180
It seems that there's
real attention

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.220
here to what the quality
of people's experience

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.270
is, at least from the optics.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.590
And that is really important
for creating organizations

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.570
that really motivate women
to develop their best.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.810
What is the everyday experience.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.440
One thing we found when
we interviewed women

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.680
who had left high positions
they were very monetarily

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.230
satisfying, what we
found they tended to say

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.790
was, to do something else.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.090
They'd say, I decided
it just wasn't worth it.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.630
Meaning, while the money
and the position were great,

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.790
those weren't as
profoundly intrinsic

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:53.820
to what my values were, because
my every day experience was not

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.830
fulfilling.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.490
Because I didn't feel like I
had any control over my pace,

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.500
for example.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.420
I didn't feel that I
could tell value that.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.530
So I think it's really
important in organizations,

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:10.040
and this is something
for everybody

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.700
who's out there to think
about, to some extent,

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.990
we're looking at diversity
as an issue so often,

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.690
but motivation is a
diversity issue as well.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.800
People are motivated
by different things.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.270
And it's really helpful
for us as individuals

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.790
to recognize what
really motivates us,

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.470
and to share that information.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.770
Because that's helpful
to the organization.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.150
It's helpful to our bosses.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.510
What really gets us engaged?

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:43.060
And it's not going to be
the same for everyone.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.190
I think that's an
important point.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:49.750
Any question or
observation on this?

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.500
AUDIENCE: So in my old
job in public accounting,

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.860
I felt like every time
there was a happy hour

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.140
or an employee appreciation
thing, it was always like,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.945
here's a bunch of
food and alcohol.

00:45:58.945 --> 00:46:01.127
And it was like
that was kind of how

00:46:01.127 --> 00:46:03.710
they felt they were like paying
people back, or thanking them.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.690
And I tried multiple times
to talk to HR and say,

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:10.500
I would much more appreciate
a massage, or a spa day.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.890
Or something where
I could relax.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.765
That was what would make
me feel appreciated.

00:46:13.765 --> 00:46:17.280
As opposed to, here, you
just worked 80 hour weeks,

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.470
so drink all the
alcohol you want.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.100
Like get your money
back that way.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.420
So I think it was
never something

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.870
that they really valued,
or really tried to change.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.080
Or let's do a wine
tasting class.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.570
If you want to do alcohol,
let's do something a little bit

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.970
different than greasy
food and a happy hour.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.700
So that was just an
observation, for that.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.010
Like not listening
really, or really trying

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.670
to see what would
motivate people or make

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.700
them feel appreciated.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.530
SALLY HELGESEN: And
it sounds like there's

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.140
a reason you're
not there anymore.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:47.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.590
SALLY HELGESEN: And it's a
kind of mismatch of values.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.006
And I think more
and more, I mean,

00:46:51.006 --> 00:46:53.760
this is one of the
gifts that women

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.020
and also I think a younger
generation, which is well

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.910
represented here, of
workers, are bringing in.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.170
Being more in touch with
what really motivates them.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.370
A greater understanding
of that, and a willingness

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:13.110
to do what you did, which
was to try to tell them.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.650
There are people
here who find this

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.080
highly motivating and rewarding.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.205
Then there are people
like me, who don't find it

00:47:20.205 --> 00:47:21.060
that motivating.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.450
Why not look more
broadly to think

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.580
about what could engage people.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.120
And what I see
with organizations

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.680
is more focus on how do we
engage diverse employees?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.940
But often not thinking about
that in terms of motivation

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.940
and reward.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.850
And I believe that
is something that's

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:46.540
going to be changing
over the next 10 years,

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.970
that there's going to be a much
more recognition that-- I mean,

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:56.250
in the old days they'd give
recognition to a male executive

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.345
would be a mink
stole for his wife.

00:47:58.345 --> 00:48:00.250
You know, how
generic can you get?

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:05.020
So we're moving to something--
that's kind of the Madman era--

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.780
we're moving to something
that is much more customized.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.212
And we're really part of that.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.430
Three things.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:20.010
Looking at what this can
mean for those of you who

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.130
are here and out there,
in terms of how you think

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.670
about your own
leadership capacity.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.730
We've talked a bit
about how important

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:37.010
it is to articulate
what you see.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:38.850
The power of what you see.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:43.100
The value of what
you notice in a way

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.590
that those who have a
different spectrum of notice

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.130
can understand.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.390
The-- if you would,
responsibility

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.830
to think about how you're going
to translate that in order

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.350
to really stand
behind it strongly.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:03.010
But there's another aspect
of the notice duality

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:06.040
that I think is
important to understand.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.490
And it has to do
with not expecting

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:11.600
those who have a
very focused notice

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.150
to notice certain
things about you.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:18.300
Had a great example of it
right here in the Valley.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.550
Was a young woman
engineer-- was it

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.270
electronic arts, or something?

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.930
I'm not remembering because
it was a big workshop.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.310
Anyway, she-- Ellen Isaacs.

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.970
I do remember her name,
and I remember her face.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.020
And we were talking about
this noticing business

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.090
and what different
people notice.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.940
And she said, I had the
best example of that.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.470
This really helps me
understand something.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.960
She said, I've always
thought of myself

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.370
as a real go-to person
in the organization.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.070
People contact me about
things that might not even

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.470
relate directly to my job.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.860
I get lots of calls,
lots of emails, people

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.440
in and out of my office.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.290
She said, and a couple
weeks ago we went off site

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:06.110
on a retreat, where we had
our performance review done.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:09.090
She said, and my boss was there.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.770
My performance review came back.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:12.290
We had a talk about it.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:15.700
She said, and basically what
he said was, she's terrific.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.830
She does very high quality work.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:24.930
But she's not broadly enough
connected in the organization.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.010
She seems to spend a lot
of time in her office.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:29.590
And she thought, what?

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:34.220
The very thing I think I'm
best at, he doesn't notice?

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.110
How can that be possible?

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:41.630
And she said she spent some time
after that really feeling bad.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.610
Wondering if she should work
for the guy who she really

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:49.560
liked working for, and just
kind of taking it to heart.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.500
She said, I feel like I had
been punched in the stomach

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.420
to be criticized on the thing
I felt I was best about.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.490
She said, but listening
to this-- she said,

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.390
what I realized
is I was expecting

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:08.980
him to notice something that
may not be in his radar span

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.970
for noticing.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.130
How would he know how
broadly connected I am?

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.630
I never told him.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:20.090
He doesn't monitor my email,
see who comes into my office.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.880
He doesn't monitor
my phone calls.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.410
I had never told him.

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:26.890
She said, so what I
realized I had to do

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.920
was come up with a way to
share this information with him

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.050
explicitly.

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:37.910
So she began a kind of program
for herself where she--

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.740
every two weeks she sent
him an email saying,

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.730
talked to so and so, connected
these two people, et cetera,

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.230
et cetera.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.790
She said, I felt so
nervous about doing that.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.940
I feel so frightened
about doing that.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.740
I thought he was going
to say, why is she

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.650
wasting my time with this?

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.400
Why is she blowing her own
horn all of a sudden to me?

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.800
She said, his response was, this
is information I need to know,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.080
because what you're doing
is strengthening me.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.700
Because you work for me, you
are building my connections,

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.010
and I need to know
that information.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:20.420
So she had a real recognition
of the power of handling that

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.950
well, and getting past
this sort of shyness

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:26.850
about articulating what
she was doing to her boss.

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.640
But really also
recognizing, I went

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.940
in there expecting he
would just notice things

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.170
that I might notice, even though
I had plenty of information

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.750
to let me know that that's
not how he saw things.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:45.280
He wasn't-- I wonder
what Ellen's doing?

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.190
I wonder if Ellen
knows this person.

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:48.870
It wasn't on his radar screen.

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.040
It's not really how he thinks.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.570
So that's the other
side of the notice.

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:58.110
So you're thinking
about vision, and I

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.090
think it's really
important for us

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:05.230
to articulate and to
have in mind really

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:09.020
an idea for describing
what our vision is.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.740
Whenever we are
in a job, what is

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:14.750
my vision for what I could
be doing in this job,

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:17.050
and how does that
fit with the larger

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:20.880
vision I have of what could be
helpful for this organization?

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.610
The more you can articulate
that, and have it

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:27.870
almost in your back pocket,
the more powerful it will be.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.540
But also, what's
great about doing

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.470
that is you can use the
vision that you have

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:41.580
to begin to build allies
in a very strategic way.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.830
In organizations
today, there's so much

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:47.490
emphasis on getting a mentor,
and getting a sponsor, and all

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:47.990
that.

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:49.365
And I thought
Sheryl Sandberg did

00:53:49.365 --> 00:53:52.920
a great job of addressing
why that can sometimes

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.870
be problematic.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.050
Certainly I have
worked in organizations

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:58.720
where the women who are
in very senior positions

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:05.150
are besieged with requests to
be mentors and sponsors, often

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.440
in a way that's
somewhat inorganic.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.630
And I think that
the emphasis on it--

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.960
although it's a very, very
helpful and important,

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.140
and I've seen organizations
where women's opportunities are

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.320
transformed by mentoring
and sponsorship programs.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.220
But sponsors and mentors
are one kind of ally.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.630
And allies can be peers, they
can be people who report to us.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:34.730
They are people who are
engaged in helping you achieve

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:38.870
what you want, and who
recognize that in doing that,

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:42.180
they can strengthen
themselves as well.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.310
That's what an ally is.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:46.490
So it's not necessarily a level.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:51.640
And I believe that women can
really strengthen themselves

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.910
by using the vision that they
articulate to enlist allies.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:03.220
Women are great at building
relationships in general,

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:08.170
but they're not always as great
at leveraging relationships,

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:13.350
as making sure those
relationships help them achieve

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:17.100
what they're trying to achieve,
and helping the people who

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.290
are allied with
them also achieve

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:21.280
what their objectives are.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:28.600
Often we can be shy about saying
this is what I'm trying to do.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.210
This is how you can help me.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.400
And this is how you
can benefit from that.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.400
And, oh by the way,
what can I do for you?

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.980
One thing I've noticed, and
I've had this discussion

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.950
often with people
in HR, and I've

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:45.910
had this discussion with
headhunters as well.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.360
Women will come into
a position and think,

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.150
I need to get
really good at this.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.780
I'm going to keep my head
down for the next six months.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.210
And I'm going to
master this job.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:56:00.090
And then I can look up and start
to bring people in around me.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.830
Whereas often you'll find
a successful male will

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:06.190
go into a job, and
his first question is,

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.320
who do I need to
reach out to who

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.390
can help me make this a success?

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.050
So right away he's
engaging people,

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:18.000
who is going to help me
be successful at this?

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.450
And the result is that he
has more support and more

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.370
visibility for what he does.

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:27.130
That keeping your head down
and trying to become an expert

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.700
can cost you in terms of
visibility and support.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.620
So it's something that
I always have urged.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.590
And the reasons and the
techniques around it

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:41.650
change over time, but for
women, it's really important

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.720
to think once you have
articulated what you're

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.960
trying to do, who can
help me build this?

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.860
How can I bring people in?

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.200
How can I leverage their skills?

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:57.250
I did a program at a huge
global financial institution

00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:01.410
in DC-- DC-based, a
couple months ago.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:02.860
It was a big women's program.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.770
There were hundreds
of women there.

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:09.470
And they were in a place of
some degree of discouragement.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:14.830
And what I learned was that
the organization had recently

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:19.290
done a survey on who
people preferred as bosses.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:24.020
And men and women both perceived
that having a male boss

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.510
was more desirable.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.250
And I was fascinated by this.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.600
So once we had done
our program, I said,

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.240
can I do some
background in here?

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.910
Can I learn a little
more about why this was?

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:40.040
What it is in your culture
that was responsible for that?

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.850
What I learned were two things.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:43.900
First of all, in
that environment

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.290
where there were very few
women who were bosses,

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:49.070
women were often perceived
of as tougher bosses,

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.070
because they were
so invested in doing

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.350
things kind of
perfectly themselves.

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.160
But they seemed to
have less tolerance.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.960
But the other thing
which relates to this,

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.460
is that men were
perceived to have

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.130
better connections in the
organization as a whole.

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.460
And people wanted
to be on a team

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.570
where their boss had
a lot of connections,

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.290
because they understood
and recognized

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.450
that was going to be good
for them down the line.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:20.410
So to the extent that you're
not building alliances

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:24.910
and connections, that's going
to have an impact upon also

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.560
how your team perceives you.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.100
So I think it's something
really important.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.440
And again, building
relationships

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.580
is not always the same
thing as leveraging them.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.510
Remember we talked about
Susan Bernstein saying,

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:44.530
I wish I had been able to
stand up for what I saw.

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:50.560
And standing up is something
we need to think about.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.790
I have been asked
for 25 years what

00:58:55.790 --> 00:59:00.370
women need to do to
build a stronger,

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:04.020
more effective
leadership presence.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.900
Do women need to have
a firmer handshake?

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.220
Is it how we walk?

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.220
What we're wearing?

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.570
Should you carry a
purse into a meeting?

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:14.880
Are you making
yourself look weaker

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.720
if you're carrying a purse,
or encumbered in other ways?

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.070
It's always cosmetic
what the questions are.

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.270
But having spent
25 years working

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.155
with some of the
best women leaders--

00:59:29.155 --> 00:59:35.600
best leaders around the world,
I've come to the conclusion

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.340
that what really builds
leadership presence is

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:43.690
the capacity to be present.

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:48.010
To be present in the moment
for the person in front of you,

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:52.520
for the task in front of
you, for the actual situation

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.280
that you're in.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:58.310
And there is a reason that
the word presence and present

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.880
are essentially the same.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.010
Those are connected.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.170
And what's rather
daunting about this

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:11.300
is that in a 24/7 environment
that we're part of,

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.400
where technology is a part
of how we're interacting

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.720
all the time, it can be
difficult to build, to be

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.640
responsive, to do your
job, but in the course

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:29.250
of doing that, also build the
kind of leadership presence

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.380
that gives you real
strengths and makes

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.830
you perceived of as a leader.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.790
Because the
environment we're part

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:39.570
of is inherently distracting.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:43.100
Years ago, before I
got into this at all,

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.410
I said I had done a lot of
speech writing for executives.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.180
And it was so
fascinating because when

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.060
I'd go to conferences and
working with the executives,

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.740
you could always tell who the
executive was, because he--

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.019
never saw a woman in those
days-- he was unencumbered.

01:00:59.019 --> 01:01:01.060
And he didn't have anything
he was worried about.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.610
Everybody else was worried
about what was going on.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.020
But he didn't need to worry
about where are my notes?

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.040
Or what's happened?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.930
Or where is this?

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.165
Or, what's the right door?

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.199
Or oh, it's raining.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.615
How am I going to
get to the door?

01:01:11.615 --> 01:01:14.450
Or carrying a raincoat.

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:15.330
Fine.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:19.580
Things were taken care of
and he could be present.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.957
Sometimes he wasn't.

01:01:20.957 --> 01:01:23.540
Sometimes he was the kind of guy
who couldn't look at anybody,

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.190
couldn't look
anybody in the eye.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.440
But he had that capacity.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.500
And what's
fascinating is to look

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.700
at the extent to which the
environment we're part of

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.780
can undermine our
capacity to be present,

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.550
but even as it does so,
it weakens our ability

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.970
to really manifest to presence.

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:49.180
And I do think that
it can be harder

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.470
for women partly
because of our radar.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:58.090
That capacity to be noticing how
things are landing on somebody.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.970
Or how engaged someone is.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.420
Noticing what's
going on in the room.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.520
That radar-like capacity,
while it has a real strength,

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.060
also has the potential
to undermine our ability

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.740
to be fully present.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.170
So what I've seen are
a number of practices,

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.550
I share three today,
that really are

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:27.620
helpful in being able
to maintain the capacity

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.380
to be fully present,
which I believe

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.870
is absolutely
essential for sending

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.990
a message about your
potential as a leader.

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.090
People get that.

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.230
We get it at a level that's
here, rather than here.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:47.950
We understand when someone is
present, or when they're not.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:50.530
And we understand
it across cultures.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.310
That's something else I
think it really important.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.380
People can recognize.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.070
You have all these
training programs,

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.220
if you're in a meeting,
and someone's a Muslim,

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.310
don't show the
bottom of your shoe,

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.220
and all these kinds
of techniques.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:03.810
We get it.

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.310
Communicating across culture.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:10.430
But people understand
and recognize

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:13.180
if you are present
across cultures.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.260
That's something that
really translates.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:19.030
So I believe it is a tremendous
advantage to all of us

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.810
to think about what
do we need to do

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:24.100
to be as present as we can.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.930
What I've seen work is, number
one, be your own HR department.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.510
And by that I mean,
think through what

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:38.870
policies, what practices, do
you need to incorporate into how

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:42.460
you do things, that
protect your ability

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.730
to be thoughtful and effective
rather than constantly

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:47.910
responding.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.160
What works for you?

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.620
We're are all
different in this way.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.170
And that's why I say be your
own HR department, because this

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:57.160
isn't something that can
be handed down as policy.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.540
If we're really starting
from the point of what

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:02.600
is going to help me be present,
and be effective, and be

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.260
thoughtful, what do I need to
do to enable that to happen?

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.160
How do I need to use my
time, and my technology,

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.820
and my interactions in ways
that will really support that?

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.910
So some real mindfulness and
intention around doing that.

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.100
When we're going
into a new project,

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.610
negotiate our time
needs in advance.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.390
And as much as we can--
it's not an ideal world--

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.870
but negotiate that in time.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.720
And maybe sell up.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.170
I did some work at Microsoft
and this woman that

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:38.680
was a general manager there,
when I was talking about this,

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.210
she said, what I
did is I realized

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.490
that the constant
stream of tasks

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:46.510
was really undermining me.

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.050
And I talked to
my boss and said,

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:52.360
I'm going to do an experiment
where I turn this off

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.010
for a certain number
of hours a day.

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:58.150
And I will not be able
to necessarily respond.

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:01.150
She said, and I was able to
kind of sell that to him.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:04.170
And then I was able to--
speaking of data-- document

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:06.630
how it improved
my effectiveness.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:11.040
So that became part of my policy
for how I managed my time.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.760
So I think that's setting
policies is really important.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.310
The second thing-- and I think
this is particularly important

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:26.630
for women in my experience--
is to recognize and address

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:31.090
compulsive or
addicting multitasking.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:36.870
Women often take pride in
their capacity to multitask.

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:39.720
And the world we live
in, we all multitask.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.550
I'm not advocating--
sometimes I've given this talk

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.845
and I get into the
elevator, and some woman's

01:05:45.845 --> 01:05:47.220
in the elevator
on her cell phone

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.750
and she says, oh I-- I'm sorry.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.170
I'm sorry.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.545
She's almost defending me,
because she feels like, oh, she

01:05:55.545 --> 01:05:56.770
thinks I'm multitasking.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:59.490
We live in a world that
requires a certain degree

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.910
of multitasking, but it
is important to recognize

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:08.110
that while it is efficient,
there is always a cost.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.990
Because if you are doing
two things at once, you,

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:17.780
by definition, cannot be
present for both of them.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.860
Your attention is divided.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.960
Your attention is fractured.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.170
You're more likely
to make mistakes.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.840
And it is inherently
more stressful.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.230
Because stress is produced
when our attention is divided.

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.360
Not when we're working hard.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.960
That's what is stressful.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.890
I've gotta do this.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.889
Oh, what time is the
plane gonna come,

01:06:37.889 --> 01:06:39.680
and then I've got to
get there, and maybe I

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.510
should recalculate--
that's where stress lives.

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.870
Stress lives in
divided attention.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:48.900
And the more
present one can be--

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.450
and again, I feel that
I've watched this,

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:54.090
I've witnessed this
by being exposed

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:58.150
to highly effective
senior executives.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:02.150
They have the resources to
help them to be present,

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.790
because they're not
worrying about the details.

01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:09.240
Most of us don't
have that luxury.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.240
We have to sweat the details.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.650
But the more we can
do that in a way

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:17.110
where we are mindful of
where is this addictive?

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.480
Where is this habitual?

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.490
How important is it that I
respond to this right now?

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.570
The more we can protect
our effectiveness,

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:32.900
the more leadership presence
we will be able to effect,

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.570
and the more we'll be
able to represent and gain

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:41.620
respect for an understanding
of what our vision is.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.050
And the final thing is,
as Buddhists recognize,

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:48.480
presence is a practice.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.660
Being presence is a practice.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.760
And that's what meditation
and meditational

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.240
pursuits are about.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.700
They're a way of
practicing being present.

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.630
And presence is not something
you can just tell yourself,

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:07.000
I'm going to be present.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.600
I've decided, starting now.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.120
I'm going to be fully present.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.900
It doesn't work that way.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.600
It's something that you
incorporate into your being.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.040
And you do that
through practice.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.140
Thich Nat Hanh, the
Vietnamese monk,

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.270
has a wonderful
practice that he uses

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.380
when he works with
people in offices.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:32.170
He says, every time that phone
rings, every time you hear

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:36.300
that bell, use it like
monks in a monastery.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.830
Use a monastery bell.

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:47.120
Take one second to call yourself
to attention and to present.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.560
Take a breath when you hear it.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.250
Let your practice
be to remind you

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.689
when you hear a bell, when
you hear a text ping, whatever

01:08:56.689 --> 01:09:00.240
it is, I'm here now.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.100
I'm present.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.370
I'm in the moment.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.450
I am here.

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.660
And if you can do
that, you can begin

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:10.069
to develop that muscle that
enables you to be present.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.646
And by the way, you'll
be a lot more effective

01:09:12.646 --> 01:09:13.770
when you pick up the phone.

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:14.910
Rather than, yeah.

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.609
You'll be, can I help you?

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:21.630
That's much more present.

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:23.470
So thinking of it in
terms of presence.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:26.380
And I think this is something
that's very powerful.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.340
I said the presence
translates across culture.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:35.640
It even translates across
species, which is a big deal.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.090
Anybody watch Cesar?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.479
The Dog Whisperer.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.040
That's all he does.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.850
You know, the dog owners
walk into their house,

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.109
the dog goes nuts.

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:47.479
Cesar walks in, the
dog is total attention.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:52.410
And all it is, is he is
fully present and aware.

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:55.570
So that can translate
across species.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.410
Anybody who's tried
to ride a horse

01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:59.010
knows how effective
that is, if you're

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:01.320
thinking about 10
different things at once.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.650
So being able to bring
that practice into what

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:07.050
you do is going to
help you represent

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:11.350
your vision with real power,
and authority, and influence,

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:15.170
and, oh by the way, you'll
be much less stressed

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:18.520
and distracted in the process.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.490
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned Sheryl Sandberg.

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.460
I'm curious what are your--

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:22.770
SALLY HELGESEN: Mentioned what?

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:23.740
AUDIENCE: Sheryl
Sandberg's book.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.300
SALLY HELGESEN: Yeah.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.341
AUDIENCE: I was actually
curious on your thoughts

01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:28.904
in terms of the "lean in"
kind of decree for women.

01:10:28.904 --> 01:10:30.320
SALLY HELGESEN:
Well first of all,

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.940
I think Sheryl's book was one
of the great contributions

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.500
of the last 10 years.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:44.390
What I see is that it has
gotten companies thinking

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:46.540
at a much higher
level about what

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.190
they need to do to engage women.

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:53.880
And it's made it acceptable--
I did a program at a big energy

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.810
company that was very
traditional and top down.

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:59.730
And it had a male panel,
which I was moderating.

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:03.150
And all four men on the panel
showed up carrying her book.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.160
To show how on board they were.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.800
So it's kind of given men-- I
think because of her status--

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.000
permission to be interested
in this issue, which

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.770
is extremely important.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.890
And many, many of the
points she made, I thought,

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:21.420
were really very important.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.230
It doesn't just
happen-- leadership.

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:28.210
It involves that stepping up
and making that commitment

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:32.170
and saying, I really
want this to work.

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:33.620
This may not be the place.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.890
I may need to go
to another place,

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:39.800
but I really want to
invest in my career.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.160
And I think that's
what she was saying.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.820
And I so dislike the criticism
that-- well, easy for her

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.320
to say.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.050
She's got all these resources.

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:49.740
That that's not the point.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.290
The point is she was
encouraging and saying

01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:56.800
you can have a richer,
fuller, more meaningful life

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.220
if you invest yourself
in your career.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.540
On the other hand,
this propensity

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.410
of women to look at the
actual quality of their day

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:11.680
is something that is
pretty deeply ingrained.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.380
I don't think it has
to be an either/or.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:19.160
On one hand, it doesn't
have to be so non-strategic.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.230
Well, I'm not enjoying
this particular job.

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:24.337
I've had five bad days in a row.

01:12:24.337 --> 01:12:25.420
I think I'm going to quit.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.770
That is not leaning in.

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:29.490
That is not stepping up.

01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:31.320
That's getting discouraged.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:37.340
What we find is that over time,
if day after day after day,

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.900
the experience of work is
profoundly unsatisfying, women

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.900
are more likely to
say, that salary,

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:50.540
that position was not
worth it, because I am just

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.460
not enjoying my life.

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:55.240
I believe this is one
of the great gifts

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.100
that women have to
bring to the workplace.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.540
Because I've read
a lot of research

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:04.270
about the millennial
generation and what they value.

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:08.660
And it's much more similar
to what women value.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.500
It's that interest in what
is the quality of my life.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.890
I'm moving into organizations.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:19.110
I know I'm going to be
working 60 hours a week if I'm

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.450
going to get anywhere.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:24.760
I know how much my job is
going to be all-consuming.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.580
I need to be able to enjoy it.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:31.730
I need to be able to feel as
if my contribution is really

01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:32.690
valued.

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:35.300
I want to feel a part
of what I'm doing.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.720
And that's what we
hear from the men

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.670
and women of that
millennial generation, who

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.250
come in-- you know, people
say oh, they're so entitled.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:48.140
Well first of all,
their parents told

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:51.350
them, good job when they
picked up a quarter.

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:54.560
They've been told over
and over, you're terrific,

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560
you can do anything.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.270
And so of course they
have that attitude.

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.520
And I happen to
believe that attitude

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.770
can be very adaptive
in today's workplace,

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:07.020
because so much
is expected of us.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.790
But one of the
things I often say,

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:12.540
and I say to executives
who are saying,

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.460
women seem to feel like
work should be enjoyable.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.140
I say, be grateful.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.690
Because you have an
opportunity to think

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.500
through the experience
of work at this place.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:28.730
And prepare yourself for that
next generation, who's attitude

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:32.800
is much more likely to be
similar to that of women.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.720
So this is again, I
believe what happened--

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.170
like with those
leadership competencies--

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:44.000
is women are to a degree,
on the cutting edge

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.280
of how organizations
will need to adapt

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.220
to be able to really engage
their talent at the highest

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.110
level.

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:55.910
And that it is helpful.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:59.970
It behooves-- to use an old
fashioned word-- organizations

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:01.930
to be able to listen to that.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:06.360
And it's helpful for us in terms
of really making that case.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.180
I did not see in Sheryl's
book, this big divide

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:16.090
between stepping up and valuing
the quality of your every day.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:18.446
Obviously every day isn't
going to be a picnic.

01:15:18.446 --> 01:15:19.820
And there are days
that are going

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.150
to be extremely difficult.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:27.640
It's really over time when you
begin to perceive a missed it,

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.070
or mismatch.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:31.090
Like the woman
Susan Bernstein did,

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:36.250
as a result of feeling I cannot
be authentic in this job.

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:38.830
But it's also
possible-- I mean again,

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:43.100
that woman, Ellen Isaacs that
I met out here in the Valley,

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:47.080
who felt so discouraged
because she felt like her boss

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.840
didn't see what she really had,
what her best qualities were.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.740
There are ways we can
address that if we

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.480
have an awareness of it.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.760
There are ways we
can make that better.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.140
And she reported that this made
an enormous difference to her,

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:09.350
that she felt like her boss
really noticed her, and noticed

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:10.990
what was best about her.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:13.540
And that was profoundly
rewarding to her.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.610
And gave her much more
a feeling of freedom,

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:19.270
and much more feeling
like she really

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:21.580
fit with this organization.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.630
So I think the
message is hopeful.

01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:29.090
I felt Sheryl's message was
very hopeful and very hands-on

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:32.380
in terms of specific advice.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.080
And as I said, I've been
doing this 25 years.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.620
And one of the
advantages of that

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.980
is being able to take a
big picture long-term view.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.640
And I believe this is
the best time I have ever

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.670
seen in 25 years, for women
to be able to make an impact

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:57.310
and help their organizations
really use their best talents.

01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:00.740
It takes being able to
articulate and understand

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:04.020
the power of what
those best talents are.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.830
But I think we're in the
time where organizations

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:12.877
are certainly, in my view, more
ready to hear that than they

01:17:12.877 --> 01:17:13.751
have been in decades.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:17.810
So I wish you luck.

01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:20.240
And I thank you.
