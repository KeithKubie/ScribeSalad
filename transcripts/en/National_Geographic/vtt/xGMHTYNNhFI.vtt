00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:11.860
i'm doing a PhD in neuroscience under

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.380
the Department of Medicine and my main

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.230
focus of the investigation of the visual

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.060
aspects of psychedelics was a privilege

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.909
to be the other side to experience kind

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.329
of a subject side of things and I was

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:28.659
injected with LST 75 micrograms of Alice

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.939
T I didn't really know what I want to

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.710
expect being in the scanner is very it's

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.289
a very different situation

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.809
the experience was actually nice and

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.239
then after that they kind of saw that

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.039
I'm okay there's no drug effects and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.199
after that i went to the park and

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.199
afterglow of the drug bit in the park

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.670
so in addiction and also in depression

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.340
sometimes the patients are quite locked

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.350
in certain patterns of thought and maybe

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.780
this allows them in the moment of the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.570
therapy session to be more flexible and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.150
kind of investigated different parts of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830
their personality or their mind and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.530
through that and kind of learn new

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.680
things about himself from the therapy

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.680
session
