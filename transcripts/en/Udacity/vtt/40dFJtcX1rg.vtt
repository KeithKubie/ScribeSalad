00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.860
We've already seen the problems with callbacks.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.800
And, of course, object-oriented programming language can have lots of callbacks.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.375
And an object which has the ability to make calls to self or

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:17.510
this, which are self-referencing methods, compounds this problem.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.740
In general, with objects, it becomes much more difficult to guarantee contracts

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.440
in the face of object callbacks and inter-method calls.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.900
The problem is even worse in the presence of multi-threading.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.520
Other problems like inheritance and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.670
fragile base class definitions are discussed in the next few slides.
