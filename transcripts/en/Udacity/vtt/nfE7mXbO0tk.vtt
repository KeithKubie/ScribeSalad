00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.201
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Next, what is the y-intercept of this graph? You may notice that it's not

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.649
actually shown here because I cut the graph off above where it is. But you can

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.018
figure this out based on the equation alone. Remember what you know about the

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:16.918
coordinates of the y-intercept from the fact that it has to lie along the

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:17.458
y-axis.
