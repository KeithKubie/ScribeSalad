00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.280
Just as we learned very early in this course,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.740
I think in lesson three, structure is function. Not

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.300
only for proteins in our cells, but also in

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.923
the world of pharmacology. Remember that drugs bind to

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:16.160
proteins in your cells and in your body. And

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.340
if a protein has even a slight change in

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.580
its conformation or structure, it will likely change its

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.190
ability to interact with the drug, or the speed with

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.700
which it can interact with the drug. Structural variation

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.460
in pharmacodynamic proteins affects the target effects of the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.900
drug. For example, the drug here in red binds

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.810
the receptor here in this Y-shaped conformation. When it binds,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.070
there's a normal activity that happens, a target effect

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.370
if you will. But if we have a variation in

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.140
the structure of this receptor, now the drug can't

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.650
bind to it in the same way, so the activity

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.910
turns out to be reduced. A genetic variation that altered the structure of the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.730
protein resulted in a functional change for

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.610
the drug. Structural variation in pharmacokinetic proteins affects

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.030
the speed with which a drug is metabolized, or broken down. In this case the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270
drug is in red, being metabolized by

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.650
the purple protein, into these two smaller metabolites.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.440
This would be our normal drug metabolism. But we

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.540
could have a variant over here that changed the structure

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.150
of the enzyme that breaks down the drug. And

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.640
now, there's a reduced activity or no drug metabolism at

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.100
all. Let's see if you can pull in the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.270
information we've learned about up to this point in the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230
lesson. What do you think would result from a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.000
structural change of the GABA receptor, causing an increase in

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.140
the pharmacodynamic efficiency to bind alcohol?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.280
And a structural change of alcohol

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.330
dehydrogenase, or ADH, causing a decrease

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.090
in pharmacokinetic efficiency of alcohol metabolism?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.620
Would you expect extreme intoxication, moderate

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.770
intoxication, or minimal intoxication? Remember, this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.420
time we're combining what we know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.380
about the pharmacodynamic, and the pharmacokinetic pathways,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.280
at one time, to see the overall effect of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.640
the drug on your whole system, or your body.
