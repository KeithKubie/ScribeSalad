00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
PROFESSOR: So today we're going
to do two things in particular.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540
One is finish off
with the discussion

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.830
of this device, a shaker.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.640
This, by the way, this
is a commercial thing.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.120
And out of the catalog,
this is the littlest one.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.770
This is a 50 pound shaker.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.900
At full speed it actually
puts out 50 pounds.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.902
All it is is masses inside
going around and around.

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:53.636
AUDIENCE: What is its
commercial purpose?

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.510
PROFESSOR: Ah, what's
its commercial purpose?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.410
Well, the big ones that are
maybe 100 pounds of moving mass

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.650
are they bolt them to the
floor in nuclear power plants

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.390
and test them.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.745
Shake the buildings to
represent earthquake kind

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.770
of loads and things like that.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.690
And the smaller ones,
you can buy these for.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.860
This kind is actually
if you're running

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.330
an operation like
in a flour mill

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.600
and you've got particulate
stuff trying to get

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.310
it to slide through chutes.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.376
Does stuff slide down
chutes easier if the things

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:33.500
are vibrating a little bit?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.600
Have you ever
banged on something

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.870
to get stuff to come loose?

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.660
You can just stick one of these
on the side and let it run.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.620
Nothing sticks.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.150
So there's lots and lots of
purposes for shakers like this.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.340
So we were in the process of
analyzing how one of these

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.840
works.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.300
And I want to finish that.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.670
And then part two today is
we're going to-- we've only

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.760
really talked about angular
momentum with respect

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.010
to particles,
individual particles.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.240
And even in your
physics classes you

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.352
did things with mass
moment of inertia.

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:13.060
And so we're going to
make the connection

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.260
today between particles,
mass moment of inertia,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.520
unbalanced shakers.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.180
It all comes together in the
second part of today's lecture.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.230
So the problem we are analyzing,
literally that little shaker,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.100
can be modeled.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.480
Well, in that one
particular application

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.365
we can find that
thing on rollers.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.280
This is the problem
we are discussing.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
It has inside of it an
unbalanced rotating mass

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.110
with an arm that's E long.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.380
It's called the
eccentricity in the trade.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.580
And it has some mass m.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.440
And this body that it's in,
we'll call it mass of the body,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.870
mb.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.270
And this thing's going
around and round.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.050
So this is some angle theta
which is described as omega t.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.500
And they're constant
rotation rate devices.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.535
So theta dot equals omega
and that's a constant.

00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:22.280
That's how they're
basically designed.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.660
And we label this
point A. Over here we

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.820
have a inertial
coordinate system, xy.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.493
This point a, this point we've
called b in our analysis.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.740
And we set out to
find the equation

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.180
of motion of this thing
in the x direction.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.905
Has no movement in the y.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.860
It's confined in the y.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.090
It puts out lots of
force in the y direction.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.940
You really have to restrain
it to keep it from moving.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.200
But it doesn't move
in the y direction,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.426
but it will move in the x.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:03.925
OK.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.140
So we came to the
conclusion that we

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.690
could write for the
main body the summation

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.269
of the external forces on mb.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.062
It's mb times its acceleration.

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:26.520
And it's acceleration
is completely

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.985
defined by this coordinate.

00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:48.660
And if we draw a free
body diagram of this mass,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.630
you're going to have a
normal force I'll call n

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.280
in the y direction upwards.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.275
You're going to have
its weight downwards.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.540
And you're going to
have some force exerted

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.720
on it through this shaft that
comes from the little mass.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.750
So we're accounting for
everything the little mass,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.700
all its influence
on this big block

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.670
by the forces that are passed
through that rod, which

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.574
is hinged at the center.

00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:28.870
OK.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.750
And I'm going to call that f mb.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.640
OK, the force from
that little link.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.190
Now, that happens to be equal
to minus the forces on the mass

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.465
that this rod exerts.

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:46.965
It must exert some
force on the mass

00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:49.630
to make it go around and around.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.960
And because of
Newton's third law,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.280
those two forces have
to be equal and opposite

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.730
because they're operating
on the same massless

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.345
shaft for the purpose
of this example.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.030
OK, in order find that
equation of motion,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.810
the sum of the
external forces, these

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.420
are both in the y direction.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.970
So we just need to find
the horizontal component

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.240
of this force and we'll be
able to complete that equation.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.665
So the point of
the exercise here

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:26.030
is just is to find this
horizontal component.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.030
So to do that, let's move on to
thinking about the little mass,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.070
small mass, and what its
free body diagram looks like.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.380
So viewed from the
here's our rod.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.540
Here's the small mass.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.690
This is a side view.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.350
So there's the point
it's rotating about A.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.140
But I want to draw a free
body diagram of this rod.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.950
The rod puts a
force on this mass,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.090
which will have a
vertical component, fm.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.190
And I'll just call it y.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.680
And it'll put a force that's
in horizontal component fm x.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760
And I'm drawing
them both positive,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.709
because I don't know
which direction they act.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:19.500
And if the answer turns
out to be positive,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.360
then I guessed right.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.526
If it's negative, it means
it's going the other way.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.440
And what other forces
that are acting on this?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.720
Well, there is certainly
is an mg downwards

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.750
acting on that mass.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.190
OK.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.090
And there's no forces in
and out of the page on it.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.720
And this is operating
in the plane.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.900
So this is a planar
motion problem.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:56.549
And we note that in here r dot
equals r double dot equals 0.

00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:58.340
This thing doesn't
change in length at all.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.350
It's just going round
and round fixed length.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.290
So we can write, then,
that the summation

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.572
of the external forces
on this little mass

00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:17.800
had better equal its mass times
the acceleration of point A

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.854
with respect to
the inertial frame.

00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:22.440
And whoops.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.020
Not A, but what?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.370
B. The acceleration
of this point.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.280
This is B.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.360
We need to figure out what
the acceleration of that point

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.900
is in the inertial frame.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.730
But we've done enough
of these problems,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.290
so this should be pretty easy.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.430
This is the mass
times the acceleration

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.930
of point A with respect
to O plus the mass

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:59.020
times the acceleration of B
with respect to A. B and A.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:05.006
These are all vectors
until I break them down

00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:06.255
into their x and y components.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.140
So what's the acceleration
of A with respect

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.190
to O in the coordinate systems
that we have written here?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.610
So that's just kind of
our generic representation

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.140
of acceleration, right?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.592
But we've chosen some
coordinates here.

00:09:38.592 --> 00:09:40.050
Specifically have
a coordinate that

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.300
describes the motion of
the main mass, right?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.950
What is that?

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.620
So what's the
acceleration of point A?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.770
x double dot.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:57.060
So we know that this then
is m x double dot and plus.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.190
Now, it's easiest to
describe this in terms

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.030
of cylindrical coordinates.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.600
And we can then write
that, well, then this

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:18.600
must be a mass times the
terms in the r hat direction.

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:28.030
r hat.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:34.840
And then terms over here
in the theta hat direction.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.830
Theta double dot plus
2r dot theta dot.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.440
Now, which of these are 0?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.645
Does that arm change length?

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:49.145
No.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:52.710
So this is 0.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.700
Is the angular
acceleration constant?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.710
So this is 0.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.310
The arm doesn't change length.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.300
The Coriolis is 0.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.370
So there's no Coriolis
force, no [INAUDIBLE] force,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.480
no radial acceleration,
only a single term.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.550
Just the centrifugal.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:15.592
So this becomes a pretty
simple expression.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.250
So the summation of the external
forces on our little mass,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:35.092
then, we can write as mx double
dot in the i hat direction.

00:11:35.092 --> 00:11:37.710
I'm going to break it into
its vector components here.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.570
Minus m.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.210
And I know that r here equals e.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.630
That's the eccentricity.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.630
I'm going to start
using these terms.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.380
Minus me omega squared.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.460
r hat.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.450
But I'm going to break that r.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.680
Goes round and round.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.970
I need to break it into
x and y components,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.060
but we've done that
many times before.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.340
That looks like a cosine
omega t in the i hat

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:25.484
direction plus a sine omega
t in the j hat direction.

00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:27.150
So as this thing goes
around and around,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.699
it has a cosine term
and a sine term.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:31.740
And this is in the x
direction, this is in the y.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.150
So we're really interested
in the equation of motion

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.110
on small mass m in
the x direction.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.900
So we just need to pull out
the x components from this.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:13:03.420
So we have an m x double
dot i hat minus me

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.390
omega squared cosine
omega t i hat.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.990
And we can drop the i hats
now because we just have

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.400
one single component equation.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.540
And this is this
quantity I called fm.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.090
And fm x then is the x term in
my little free body diagram.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.810
And the force that it
exerts on the main mass

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.640
is in the x direction.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.950
So this is the
force that the rod

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.680
places on that little
mass in the x direction.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.480
What's the force
that the rod places

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.420
on the big mass in
the x direction?

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.580
Minus that.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:57.750
So this is minus f mb
in the x direction.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.060
That's what we're after.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.890
We need that force so we can go
back now and we'll finish out

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.310
are the equation
of motion that we

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.080
were after for the main mass.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.670
This up here.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.990
We need to sum the external
forces to get that,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.820
to fill out that expression.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.470
But while I'm here,
just to have it,

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.446
the summation of the forces
on the small mass in the y

00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:22.945
direction.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.250
Look at our free body diagram.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.780
It has a minus mg.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:43.520
And it then has this term, minus
me omega squared sine omega t.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.320
So just for completeness,
we have also the y component

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.020
of the force that the rod
places on the small mass.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.422
And minus this amount is what
it places on the main mass

00:14:53.422 --> 00:14:54.380
that it's connected to.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.540
So now let's go back to
our equation up here,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.650
the summation of the
forces on the main body.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.425
In the x direction.

00:15:16.425 --> 00:15:19.170
This is going to
be the main body.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.080
x double dot.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.440
And it's now the x
direction forces.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.830
There's only x
component of this force.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.700
And that's what we
have right here.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.835
It's minus that.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.010
And that's our
equation of motion.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.520
We can rearrange it a little bit
and it remarkably simplifies,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.540
actually.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.750
You end up, if you collect
the motion terms involving

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:32.510
x on the left hand side
equals an external excitation

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.160
on the right hand side.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.560
And I've been kind of following
the commentaries in mb.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.290
Little confusion
about some questions.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.400
When you're asked to find
an equation of motion,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.680
is that the same
thing as meaning

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.965
solve the equation of motion?

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:51.374
No, asking find the equation
of motion means get this far.

00:16:51.374 --> 00:16:53.540
Now, if I wanted to know a
solution for this, pretty

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.540
trivial in this case, it's going
to look like cosine omega t,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.210
but then I'd say solve
that equation of motion.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.630
OK, now let's see.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.599
We also know-- let's
just finish this--

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:11.869
that the summation of the forces
on this main body in the y

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.770
direction must be 0
because it can't move.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.479
No acceleration.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.660
And from the free
body diagram for that,

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:40.350
we can write that this
is n and y minus mmbg

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:55.400
minus mg from the
little mass plus me

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.302
omega squared sine omega t.

00:18:00.302 --> 00:18:02.700
That's the other phase of this.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:10.860
And the interesting thing here,
then, is to solve for the force

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.870
that it takes to hold
this thing in place.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:25.288
So you get mb plus m
times g plus or minus.

00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:26.252
All right, yeah.

00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:37.380
All right, so what's that?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.810
So just kind of step back
and look at these things

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.800
and say what's it telling us.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.830
So first of all, just
to keep this thing

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:49.040
from moving up and down,
there's a force on it

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.740
that has to support its weight.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.540
And it's the combined
weight of whatever's

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.350
inside that container.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.340
The weight of the rotating mass
and the weight of the object.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.320
They have to be supported
by a normal force, which

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.240
this is a constant term.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.220
Weight down, normal force up.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.700
And around that constant
force is an oscillating force.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.222
me omega squared sine omega t.

00:19:13.222 --> 00:19:15.520
e omega squared you
should recognize

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.530
as a centripetal acceleration.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.180
Mass times
acceleration to force.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.370
And because it goes
round and round, when

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.240
it's like this it's
pulling up and when

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.740
it's like this it's pulling
down and when it's like this is,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.150
it's only going to the sides.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.850
So sine omega t for the
vertical parts, cosine omega

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.935
t for the horizontal.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.550
And that's actually all
there is to the shake.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.610
That's all there
is to the shakers.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.740
The rotating mass inside.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.330
Now, in the homework, from
the second homework where

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.090
you had this thing, this
ball running around inside,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.640
where I posed the
question in a way

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.075
I didn't really quite intend.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:19.280
But I asked here's the track.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.790
And you had this roller
going around inside.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.900
And I asked to find the normal
force that the track exerts

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.420
on the roller.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.830
So it's an unknown.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:46.380
And there must also be a
tangential force on this thing.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.600
And there's also going to
be this thing certainly has

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.915
weight mg.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.460
And so that's the complete
free body diagram.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.370
Now, let's if this is
frictionless, which it won't

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.190
be in reality, but for
the purposes of analysis,

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.100
let's say it's frictionless,
it's only a normal force.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.800
Where does this tangential
force come from?

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.890
Why's it there in this problem?

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.010
There's a key piece of
information you're told,

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.400
and that is that the angular
acceleration of this thing

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.090
is constant.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.005
It's constant
speed going around.

00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:31.770
If you had a ball rolling
around there at constant speed,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.610
would it go constant
if you just pushed

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.679
it and it started rolling?

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.220
It would slowdown going up and
it would speed up coming down.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.920
Why?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.420
PROFESSOR: Gravity, right?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.490
So there must be something
that has to overcome gravity

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.140
going uphill and holding
it back coming downhill.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.010
So the way these
things actually work

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.999
is they've got ports pushing
compressed air in here.

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:54.790
And this is driven
around by compressed air

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.844
and there's a
pressure difference

00:21:56.844 --> 00:21:58.510
between this side and
that side and that

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.120
generates the necessary
tangential force to make

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.960
the thing go around and around.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.300
But they're really easy to make.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.980
You can imagine very
few moving parts.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.130
Just hook up a compressed
air hose to that

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.139
and it's just pushing
the ball around inside.

00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:11.180
You get the same outcome.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.280
On this ball, on
this roller, if there

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:29.190
is a-- the problem we
just solved is we found fm

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:34.980
in the y and fm in the x.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.400
And this problem said yeah, but
why can't we get the same thing

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:46.240
but have those coordinates
be f normal and f tangential?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.270
And sure, that's just
a coordinate rotation.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.960
So what can you say
about these forces?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:59.000
Well, one thing you could say
is fn squared plus ft squared

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.230
had better be equal to fmx
squared plus fmy squared,

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.040
right?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.410
And then just like
converting from polar

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.000
to Cartesian coordinates,
you can do these conversions.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.100
And you could find
out, for example,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:28.600
that fn is-- keep my
notation consistent

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:42.820
here. fn will be fm in the x
cosine omega t plus fm in the y

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.320
sine omega t.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.620
And so there's the answer.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.056
This is what you're asked
for in that problem set.

00:23:59.968 --> 00:24:02.470
OK.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:07.170
So all you need to
know about shakers.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.170
If you're ever confronted
with something like this,

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.410
what's the magnitude of the
force that the shaker puts out?

00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:25.049
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:26.090
PROFESSOR: Little louder?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.780
AUDIENCE: Is it
mr omega squared?

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.540
PROFESSOR: mr omega
squared, but substitute

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.920
for r the actual eccentricity.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.960
It's whatever that
mass in length

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960
out there that's
spinning around.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.300
me omega squared is the
magnitude of the force

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.710
and it's going to
oscillate up and down

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.070
and it's going to have
gravity that it adds to.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.910
But the important part
is me omega squared

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.480
is the magnitude of the force.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.730
OK, now we're going to
move on to the next topic.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.210
The next topic is mass
moments of inertia.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.360
And it has a strong
connection to these.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.640
And I'm going to use
this kind of analysis

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.470
as the transition to talking
about moments of inertia.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.170
Moments of inertia and
products of inertia.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.830
So any final questions
about this before we go on?

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.901
Yeah?

00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:21.727
AUDIENCE: Your summation
of [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:21.727 --> 00:25:24.082
why did you not include mg?

00:25:24.082 --> 00:25:25.530
PROFESSOR: Why didn't I include?

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.480
AUDIENCE: Mg.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.600
PROFESSOR: Mg.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.890
in the.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.875
AUDIENCE: First summation.

00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:32.374
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.380
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.000
Yeah, you're right.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.335
And where's my
free body diagram?

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.150
Has it on it, right?

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.660
Just didn't get it down into
the-- and what direction's

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.160
it in?

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.265
Because then we
did get it back in.

00:26:02.134 --> 00:26:04.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.540
PROFESSOR: Back in the last
line for the y component.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.334
Now, does it appear in this
one, this equation at all?

00:26:11.334 --> 00:26:13.000
It has absolutely
nothing to do with it.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.470
Gravity is in the
j hat direction.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.460
This is a force
equation in i hat.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.390
But it does appear in that
normal tangential expression

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.550
when you go look at the
solution for that problem,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:29.390
because it has compounds in
both of the i and j directions.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.960
And so it'll show up.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.730
Gravity will show up
in this expression.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.030
Right through this term.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.925
Yeah?

00:26:38.925 --> 00:26:42.725
AUDIENCE: In the bottom
equation on that middle board,

00:26:42.725 --> 00:26:48.340
you have my minus
mbg minus mg plus.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.274
I don't understand where
that last plus came from.

00:26:51.274 --> 00:26:53.719
Because in your
equation on the left

00:26:53.719 --> 00:26:57.142
you're using the force
of little f, correct?

00:26:57.142 --> 00:26:59.910
And you have two
negatives there.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.510
PROFESSOR: This is 0.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.720
I left the n where it
was and moved everything

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.840
to the other side.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.330
So that plus becomes a minus.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:13.070
AUDIENCE: No, from the board to
the left to the middle board.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.421
AUDIENCE: So down.

00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:18.343
So you have the
summation of the force

00:27:18.343 --> 00:27:25.585
on the little mass as negative
mg minus m-- yep, that one.

00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:28.495
And from what I can
understand, you just

00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:32.375
moved that force over
to the large force,

00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:34.315
but you [INAUDIBLE], correct?

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.000
PROFESSOR: It should
be minus this thing.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.180
The summation here.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.340
This force is minus
the little mass force.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.440
So that ought to become
a plus and a plus, right?

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.085
And so if I do that carefully.

00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:25.660
To this one is OK.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.815
But this one appears to
have a sign problem, right?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.470
But these two terms
have got to be the same.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.080
And so I've got a
mistake somewhere.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.790
And rather than spend 10
minutes fixing it on the fly,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.060
I'll take note of that.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.770
This should be OK.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.736
AUDIENCE: Yeah, intuitively
makes sense too,

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.235
I just don't
understand [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.680
PROFESSOR: Ah, wait a second.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.630
No, I'm not going to
try to fix it right now.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.120
I made a slip in
my notes somewhere.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.490
But I will repair that.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.466
Yeah?

00:29:16.466 --> 00:29:18.450
AUDIENCE: Why do
we need mg at all?

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.418
Because doesn't this force
the angular acceleration

00:29:22.418 --> 00:29:23.410
is constant?

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.386
Or the angular velocity
is constant, right?

00:29:26.386 --> 00:29:28.122
So the centrifugal
acceleration is

00:29:28.122 --> 00:29:32.834
going to be constant, which
means that the part that's

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:34.818
driven by the motor is
going to be changing

00:29:34.818 --> 00:29:36.802
to account for gravity.

00:29:36.802 --> 00:29:39.778
So isn't gravity
taking into account

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:44.738
that we have a constant
force or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're
asking if gravity is not

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.520
taken into account
somehow by that rotating.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:05.530
The gravitational force that
is on the main mass that

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.900
comes from the
little mass certainly

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.690
has to pass through the rod.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:17.535
It's got to be contained in the
forces in the connecting rod.

00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:19.960
So it's definitely there.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.510
But the force that causes
the centripetal acceleration

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:29.670
of that rotating
mass is completely

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.870
independent of gravity.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.700
With or without gravity,
it takes a particular force

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.640
to make that thing travel
in a circular path.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.340
And that's m minus mr
theta dot squared always.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.840
Yep?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.877
AUDIENCE: So doesn't that mean
that on your first expression

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:49.919
on that board, there
should be no mb?

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:51.210
PROFESSOR: On which expression?

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.127
AUDIENCE: That one.

00:30:52.127 --> 00:30:52.960
PROFESSOR: This one.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.593
OK, this is the total
forces on the little mass.

00:30:55.593 --> 00:30:56.509
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.520
PROFESSOR: We need
to back up to here.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.160
The total forces are mass
times the acceleration

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.180
of the main body it's
connected to plus the mass

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.940
times the acceleration
of B with respect to A.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.950
So we have to have that term.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.960
And we then go
into our four terms

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.190
here and find there's
only one left.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:34.580
So that's the force exerted
on the small mass by the rod.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:41.980
And that is positive mx double
dot minus mr theta dot squared.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.040
So we sum the forces
on that little mass.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.529
It has got to be
equal to-- ah, I

00:31:50.529 --> 00:31:51.820
know where we made the mistake.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.020
So we've just
discovered our mistake.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.640
This has got to be able to
mass times acceleration.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.450
And what are the forces?

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:04.150
The summation the forces
is mass times acceleration.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.220
So the acceleration
is this plus this.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.555
But the sum of the forces.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.260
The problem here is I've
used a notation where

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.820
this is very similar
looking to the forces

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.440
that I've noted here.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:09.260
So this is the actual force
in the y direction, j hat,

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:16.302
plus the actual force in the
x direction, i hat, minus mgi.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.670
So when I solve for
the i component,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:28.340
I'm going to get the i
pieces of that plus mgi.

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:33.310
I mean, excuse me, j component.

00:33:39.128 --> 00:33:40.535
Should it be like that?

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.990
The j component will have
this piece times sine omega

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.710
t with a minus.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:34:01.250
And you move the mgj to that
side and it becomes a plus.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.200
All right.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:02.965
That makes sense.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.710
The rod has to hold up the
weight of that little mass,

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.560
right?

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.760
The weight's down.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:19.340
But the rod has to push up
on it in the y direction.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.060
So the force the rod
puts on the little mass

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.880
has got to be equal to the
weight of the small mass

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.350
minus this me omega
squared term, which

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:37.530
is the force necessary to create
the centripetal acceleration.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.120
OK, so we've got this now fixed.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.450
This term is OK.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:01.730
And the minus that force is
then the force on the main body.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.545
So minus.

00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:09.220
Plus.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.020
Now I've got to figure
out what I did wrong here.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.620
You're doing what I said
I wasn't going to do.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.200
We're on the fly trying
to figure out where the.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.250
You're happy now.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.250
Good.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.294
OK.

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:30.710
All right, we're
going to move on.

00:35:39.474 --> 00:35:40.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.460
PROFESSOR: What
about the summation?

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.043
AUDIENCE: It's not
really a summation.

00:35:47.043 --> 00:35:51.340
It's just the force
that arm is [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.230
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.614
Fair enough.

00:35:58.614 --> 00:35:59.114
Yep.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.850
This is just minus f.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:08.570
This is on the little mass.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.950
This is the force on the
little mass from the free body

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.670
diagram.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.400
Right.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.660
And that helps.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.050
And that's different from
the summation one here.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.110
OK.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:23.610
All right.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.310
I think we've got it sorted out.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:34.170
Now, I've put on
the Stellar website

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.370
under readings a little
one page thing called

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.750
"Moments of Inertia."

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:42.360
It's two pages of information
taken from the Williams

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.120
textbook on dynamics.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:49.186
And it's going to
show some of what

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:51.060
I'm going to put on the
board, and especially

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.910
the detailed stuff you
don't have to copy.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.410
OK, we're going to come up with
some expressions for angular

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.050
momentum in terms of
particles and their positions.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.060
And this is now the
subject of mass and moments

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.945
of inertia and
products of inertia.

00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:07.320
And I'm going to put some of
these equations on the board

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.068
and you don't have
to copy them all.

00:37:10.068 --> 00:37:13.730
All these expressions
become the definitions

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.760
of mass moments of inertia
and products of inertia.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:21.130
And if you just drop
down one last little bit,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:24.050
we come up with an expression
for angular momentum.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:30.240
Three vector components look
like ixx omega x plus ixy omega

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.540
y and so forth.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.400
These compounds in terms of
particle masses and positions

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.630
are defined in these
final equations.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.370
So I'm going to tell you
what I'm going to tell you.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.990
We're going to
make the transition

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:55.000
from dealing with particles and
angular momentum of particles

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.200
to angular momentum
of rigid bodies.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200
OK?

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:07.450
And in my own experience
this is something

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.860
that is generally done badly.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.710
And I'm going to
try to do it well.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:17.240
I'm going to try to give you an
intuitive understanding of why

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:23.020
we have these diagonal terms
called the moments of inertia

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.420
and what they're
useful for and why

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.850
these off diagonal terms call
products of inertia turn up

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.470
and what they actually mean.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.970
When I was taught
the stuff, I never

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.370
got a gut feeling
for why or what

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.180
the off diagonal terms meant.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.494
You don't know it, but
we've been using them.

00:38:38.494 --> 00:38:39.910
And then I'll tell
you the answer.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:50.060
The answer is that when we
have a problem like well,

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:56.000
the motorcycle problem
were talking about is this.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.140
Basically here's the motorcycle
wheel spinning around

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:00.740
and round.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.920
And it has these two masses.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.650
This is set up B.
So one little mass

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.920
was off to the side
of the rim a bit.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.390
And the other mass
was off to the side.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.030
On the picture it
looked like this.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.680
Here's the axle,
motorcycle, and forks

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.350
would be coming down like this.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.090
And these two little masses.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.610
Equal distance but opposite
sides from one another.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.880
And if this spins, it
puts a heck of a wobble

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.560
into this thing.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:34.140
And this puts a moment
about this point.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.342
It tries to make this
thing rock back and forth

00:39:36.342 --> 00:39:37.050
as it's spinning.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.560
It's really hard to hold.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.996
You hold the axle there.

00:39:41.996 --> 00:39:43.370
And you got to do
it so you don't

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.870
get hit by the-- there you go.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.940
Now tell me if
you feel a moment.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.281
It's really hard to keep
that thing straight, right?

00:39:50.281 --> 00:39:52.780
Well that's what it's trying
to do to that motorcycle wheel.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.600
OK.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.870
For this problem, those
off diagonal terms,

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.110
those products of
inertia are not 0.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.440
The product of inertia
terms cause these things

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.380
called dynamic imbalances.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.940
It causes there to be angular--
makes the angular momentum

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.280
terms instead of
the angular momentum

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:25.672
being aligned with the axis of
rotation, the rotation vector,

00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:27.130
it's pointed off
in this direction.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.160
Anytime the angular momentum
vector and the rotation vector

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.280
are not aligned, you
have off diagonal terms

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.060
and you will have
dynamic imbalance.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.100
So there's a
physical consequence

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.000
of those off diagonal terms.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.580
And they explain the
dynamic imbalance.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:52.904
So let's see if we can't
make some headway on that.

00:40:52.904 --> 00:40:53.945
So you've seen the rotor.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.540
Let's look at two cases.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.830
One that looks like that, which
I just had set up a second ago.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.180
One that looks like that.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:29.710
Call this A, B.
And in both cases,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.990
the rotation is around
the vertical axis

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.455
and it's constant at omega.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:44.500
And I just mean these to
be two different cases.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.750
I'll make it lowercase
so I don't confuse it

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.520
with my coordinate
system notation.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.320
This is going to be point A
in both of these problems.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.560
And it's going to be the
origin of a coordinate system.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:14.144
So if you cause this to
spin, these both have--

00:42:14.144 --> 00:42:16.615
did I write these
masses as m over 2?

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.220
For a moment, let's just think
of these as being equal masses.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.860
If you do this problem, do you
think this one will wobble?

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.860
No, it's perfectly balanced.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.010
And it'll just spin
nice and smoothly.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:43.010
It has angular momentum around
the z-axis, the omega axis.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.490
It has angular momentum
in that direction,

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.570
certainly, when calculated.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:54.240
This one has same mass, same
distance away from this axis,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.830
but now one up and one down.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.870
This one wobbles.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.450
But this one has a component
of angular momentum

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.380
in this direction, which is
exactly equal to this one.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.340
But this also has a component
that's in this direction.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.570
And we're going take a
look and see what that is.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.678
So we're going to do
this problem here.

00:43:18.678 --> 00:43:29.450
We're going to analyze B. This
case B. And here's the goal.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:35.540
The goal is to show
you that the angular

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:42.850
momentum of this system
with respect to this point

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:47.500
can be written as a matrix
with constants in it,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.260
which you can call the mass
moment of inertia matrix.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:44:01.390
Times the vector components
of the rotation rate.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:06.060
Now, this problem,
the z-axis will be

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.440
upwards and will only have one
component one non 0 component.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.380
But in general, we want to be
able to express the angular

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.462
momentum as a product
of this inertia matrix.

00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:21.170
And these are the
inertias we'll find out

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:28.360
with respect to A. Times the
vector of angular velocities.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.860
We've got to be very careful
about some definitions.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.770
So we're going to do
this specific problem,

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.380
but we're going to use methods
that are completely general.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.410
So I want to describe
the general problem.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:45:07.420
Here is a inertial
coordinate system fixed.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:13.430
Here's a body out here in space.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:26.450
And it is rotating about
some point A. So point one

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:30.230
and the rotation
vector, the angular

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.260
rotation and some omega.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.100
And it's just in some direction.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.880
And that omega is with respect.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.670
We always in these
angular momentum problems

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.750
define rotation rate with
respect to an inertia

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.540
coordinate system.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.910
Now, this point A.
So first carefully

00:45:54.910 --> 00:46:00.865
define A is a fixed point.

00:46:04.867 --> 00:46:06.075
So is that an inertial point?

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:10.940
Yeah.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.780
You can do Newton's
laws from this point

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.370
just as well as you
could any fixed point

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.420
in this inertial reference
frame is an inertial point

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.040
and you can use Newton's laws.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.230
So this is a fixed point.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.970
I'm defining it that way.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:30.540
This body is rotating about that
point with this angular rate.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:45.220
But attached to the body
is a coordinate system

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.630
that rotates with the body.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.480
So this would be
some a xyz coordinate

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.640
system attached to the body.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.500
So it's like this
problem where I've

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.870
got a coordinate system
attached to my wheel.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.780
There's x, here's y,
z coming out of it.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.160
And in a really
simple case, it's

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.130
rotating around the z-axis.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:08.920
But I can make it rotate
around some other axis.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.997
I pushed a nail
through here and I'm

00:47:10.997 --> 00:47:12.330
trying to hold it constant here.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.520
And now it's rotating about
a different axis, right?

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.070
Same rotation rate,
but it doesn't

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.130
have to be lined up
in any pretty way.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.200
If I make that thing rotate
around that other axis,

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.530
it looks weird, but
we can define it.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.390
And that's what we're
talking about here.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:37.870
So this body is rotating
around, has some rotation

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.800
rate with respect to a reference
frame attached to the body.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:58.260
So A xyz is a frame that can't--
going to make this go up.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:02.500
Come on.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:11.770
This is attached to the body.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.530
And I've drawn them at
kind of funny angles here,

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.620
just to emphasize that
they're not necessarily

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.240
lined up with these.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.024
And it's going to rotate.

00:48:28.024 --> 00:48:28.524
OK.

00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:47.385
Omega.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.890
Just to emphasize.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.500
It's always in the
inertial frame.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:26.220
The last point may be
confusing to start with.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:37.770
Omega measured with
respect to O can

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:49.445
be expressed in terms of
the axyz unit vectors.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:57.870
We're going to do that.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.440
It turns out it vastly
simplifies the problem

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.100
to express the
rotation in the unit

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.600
vectors of the frame
attached to the body.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.190
Remember, that
frame is still fit.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:14.520
Its origin A is at a fixed
point in the inertial frame.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.360
So it's just the system's
going around and inside

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.090
of that system you
have a rotation

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.990
and you can break it
down into xyz components.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.520
Just a vector and you can
express it in those components.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.728
That's all we're saying here.

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:39.920
Now I want to do the
motorcycle problem.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.470
I'm going to just
turn it on its side.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:45.730
And the reason I'm going to
do this specific example,

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.580
the hope here is to
actually now give you

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.160
a physical feeling
for what's going on.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.250
We've done a lot of
illustrations of it.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.890
And you know that it
produces imbalances.

00:50:55.890 --> 00:51:01.530
So here's my z-axis
and my rotation rate.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:10.610
Omega with respect to O
is some omega in the k hat

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.370
direction in the fixed frame.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:19.540
And in this case, it's
going to be simpler

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.760
than the general case,
so that we can do it

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.660
in a reasonable length of time.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.195
So actually here's my rod.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:40.190
Here's my point A. This is
my coordinate system axyz.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.970
So this is now
attached to the body.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:53.102
My rigid body is a massless
rod with two masses on it.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.035
And this distance,
this is the x.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.310
Going that way will be a y,
which we have little use of.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.540
There's nothing happening
in that direction.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:16.770
So this distance
here I'll call x1.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:20.700
This distance here is z1.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:28.769
Over here, this is z2 and x2.

00:52:28.769 --> 00:52:30.310
Now we're going to
make this problem.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:31.680
We'll substitute a number.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.380
So this is symmetric.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.150
So x2 is going to be
minus x1 and so forth.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:40.400
But we want to keep them
separate for the moment

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.620
so you see what happens
to different terms.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.055
OK, so that defines a problem.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.080
So the coordinates.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.975
And we'll call this mass m1.

00:52:57.975 --> 00:52:59.950
I'll keep this a little
general for a moment.

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.750
And this is m2.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:14.800
So m1 is at the coordinates
x1, i, 0, and z1 k.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:24.640
And m2 is at x2, i, 0, and z2 k.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.280
Just points in a plane.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:39.040
And I want now to
compute the-- I

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:46.980
want to find the angular
momentum of this object

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.960
with respect to point a.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.620
Remember we compute angular
momentum in respect to points.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.120
So I'm going to do it
with respect to point A.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.640
And that's going to be
the sum of the angular

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.990
momentum of mass 1
with respect to A,

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:31.850
plus the angular momentum
of mass 2 with respect to A.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:37.410
So the angular momentum of any
particle i with respect to A

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.340
is r cross p.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.570
r cross the linear momentum.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:50.080
So it's r i with
respect to A cross p i.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.520
Now the p, this is the
momentum of the particle.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.170
That's always with respect
to what kind of frame.

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.820
When you compute
angular momentum.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.370
Must be the inertial
frame, right?

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:04.460
So technically to start with,
just remind you of that,

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.950
we'd say oh.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.760
But we've already
said our A is a fixed

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.430
point in an inertial frame.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:16.840
So it's OK to write r i
with respect to A cross,

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.610
in this case, p i with respect
to A. They're the same thing.

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.450
These two things are
exactly the same thing.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.230
The momentum measured
at any two fixed

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.422
points in an inertial
frame is the same.

00:55:26.422 --> 00:55:28.338
Doesn't matter where
you're measuring it from.

00:55:32.541 --> 00:55:33.040
OK.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:45.580
And we know that p
i with respect to A

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:51.940
now, we'll call it, is the
mass i times the velocity of i

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.650
with respect to A. That's
just ordinary linear momentum.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:06.700
So I need an expression for
the velocity of i with respect

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.860
to A. Any point.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.130
So these are fixed now.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.400
These are fixed length things.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.500
The velocity of a moving
point is just the derivative

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.940
of the position vector.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.170
But you have this equation
some people call a transport

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.172
equation.

00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:31.130
So the length of this
thing's not changing any,

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:32.750
so it's just going to
have one term in it.

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:33.625
So what's a velocity?

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:43.328
In vector notation, omega cross.

00:56:43.328 --> 00:56:43.828
All right.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.400
Right.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.970
And this could also.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:57.790
All right, these are vectors.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:10.350
And because I can say that, then
I can say hi with respect to A

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:19.835
is mi riA cross
omega with respect

00:57:19.835 --> 00:57:28.090
to O cross ri with
respect to A. OK.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:28.680
All vectors.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.472
So any rigid body.

00:57:36.472 --> 00:57:37.430
So here's the link now.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:44.010
Here's the jump from points
particles to rigid bodies.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.480
Any rigid body is made up of
the whole mess of particles,

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.410
connected rigidly together.

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:50.560
No relative motion.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.100
But a whole mass of particles.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:58:00.630
So I can compute the total
momentum of a rigid body

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:06.321
as the summation over all
the little particles in it.

00:58:06.321 --> 00:58:06.820
mi.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:17.680
riA cross omega with
respect to O cross riA.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.030
Just sum them all up.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.790
And when you have
continuous bodies,

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:28.110
these summations
turn into integrals.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:30.400
So you'll find definitions
for like there's

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.060
a mass moment of inertia
about this axis of this wheel.

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.750
It's mr squared over 2.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:42.960
And it comes from
the-- and that's

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.190
the number that you have
to multiply by omega

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:47.140
to get the angular momentum.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.880
So it comes from summing up
all these little particles

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.700
in this thing is the total
momentum, angular momentum,

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.530
of the object.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.310
All right, let's do that.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.940
We're going to do that
for our too little masses

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:07.265
here and see what kind
of things result. Oops.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:21.180
I want to get my h
with respect to A

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:26.630
is the sum of h1 with respect
to A plus h2 with respect to A.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.340
And I'm just going
to use that formula.

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:36.730
So it's m1.

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:39.890
So if I were just work out that
little vector products there.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.660
m1.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.270
here's riA.

00:59:45.270 --> 01:00:02.375
It's x1 i times z1k cross
omega zk cross x1i plus z1k.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.380
And then I have a second
term, the m2 term.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:27.650
x2i plus z2k omega
zk x2i plus z2k.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:30.740
So just a lot of
little vector terms.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.290
That is that expression for
our two little particles.

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:40.020
With their specific positions
at x1 and z1 and x2 and z2.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.630
So if I multiply all
that out, then I'll

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:52.445
get the following result.
An h with respect to A here.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:13.890
It's m1 x1 squared omega
zk minus m1 x1 z1 omega

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:25.100
z in the i hat direction
plus an m2 x2 squared omega

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:38.040
zk minus m2 x2 z2 omega
z in the i direction.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.110
So this is the angular
momentum of particle one.

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:42.940
This is angular momentum
of a particle two.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:49.340
And I'm going to
do a special case.

01:01:54.088 --> 01:01:59.950
And the special case
I'm going to let

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:07.280
m1 equal m2 equal m over 2.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.790
So they'll do sum to m.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:18.380
And x1 equals minus x2
and z1 equals minus z2.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:24.190
So they're nice and
symmetrically opposite

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.960
like drawn in the picture.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.600
That I'm making an equal
masses in equal distances

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.435
on either side of the origin.

01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:32.810
And that's going to make this
thing simplify quite a bit.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.870
This is of the form.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:42.480
This angular momentum
vector is of the form

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.740
has three vector components.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.410
In this particular
case, this one's 0.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:53.900
And we call the first component,
this one here will be hx.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:58.274
And this one here is
clearly hz, the component

01:03:58.274 --> 01:03:59.065
in the z direction.

01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:06.420
And if we draw,
here's our system.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.500
Here's our coordinate system.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.070
The coordinate system
attached to the body.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.165
It has a z component of angular
momentum positive upwards.

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:36.650
And it has an x component of
angular momentum in the minus

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.140
direction like that.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.650
When you add them
together, you get that.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:50.053
So this is h with respect to
A. This is hz, this is hx.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.702
Now, we found this before.

01:04:55.702 --> 01:04:58.160
We didn't talk anything about
moments of inertia, anything.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.350
We just deal in particles
earlier as we did problems.

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:04.830
We found out that when you
have this kind of unbalance,

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.790
the direction of the
angular momentum vector

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:11.140
is not in the same direction
as the rotation vector.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.060
In this case, the rotation
doesn't make a zk.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.200
It's like that.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.470
The vector is going around it.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:18.230
Angular momentum.

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.576
Now, in general
you would write hx.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.017
General case.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:56.350
And this is what you can pull
off, this little two sheet

01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:59.120
handout that you
can download and you

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.710
don't have to copy everything.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:04.500
This is going to look
like an ixx omega

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:13.505
x plus ixy omega y
plus ixz omega z.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.210
So if we look at
that and we look

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:30.780
at this, this particular case
the hx term is this, right?

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:46.110
So this is the general
expression for hx.

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.920
And in this
particular case, that

01:06:48.920 --> 01:07:00.140
will look like minus
m x1 z1 omega z.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.870
And this is the piece
that's in the i direction.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.610
That's why we call it hx.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:13.340
And this is then ixz omega z.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:19.440
So this piece here
is what we call ixz.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.910
It's where it comes from.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.380
And we can write it.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.346
So this is our particular case.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:45.784
Get this result. And we
find there's h in the h.

01:07:45.784 --> 01:07:48.350
y is 0.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:08:02.290
And hz is mx1 squared
omega z omega z.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:07.050
And that's got to be of
the form izz omega z.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:15.250
Now, how do you remember
what the subscripts mean?

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:23.050
ixz means this is
the h component

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:29.000
and this is the omega
component it's multiplied by.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.090
So ixz is the product
of inertia for hx.

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:39.970
It's related to rotation in
the z component rotation.

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:41.590
That's what the subscripts mean.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:53.888
Maybe I'll do this.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:40.770
So in general, if you know
what these constants are

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:46.460
for your rigid body and you
know your rotation rate,

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.680
you instantly know
your angular momentum.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.220
These things, the products
in moments of inertia,

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:57.080
are basically cataloged--
you'll find them

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.330
in the back of your
textbook-- for all sorts

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.090
of different objects.

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:11.620
So I know that if you have z in
this direction and this thing's

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:16.160
rotating around the z,
hz is the total mass

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.940
of the system times
the radius squared

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:24.890
divided by 2. mr squared over
2 would be izz for this object.

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.840
And for all sorts of objects.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.150
These are just cataloged values.

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:32.360
And then there's ways of
moving the axes, called

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.990
parallel axis theorems that
you've probably run into,

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:42.370
that allows you then to
construct these values from one

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:45.190
known point to moving the
point to someplace else

01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.930
and having it move around that.

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:51.650
So these values are
tabulated, calculated,

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:54.600
with respect to the
centers of mass.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.130
And if you want to have
the mass moments of inertia

01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:59.760
with respect to any
other point, then you

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.750
will use something which we call
a parallel axis theorem, which

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.520
we'll get to in due course.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:11.630
Pretty good on timing here.

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:14.700
A note about textbooks.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.895
Textbook conventions.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.820
This I matrix.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:41.501
In some they write it
ixx ixy ixz and so forth.

01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:42.000
ix.

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:46.180
No, iyx.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.670
iyy.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.170
iyz.

01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:57.500
cx.

01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:07.620
Some write it like that.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.897
And others write it with all
of these with minus signs

01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:11.980
on the off diagonal terms.

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:26.994
So Hibbler uses the minus signs.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.540
Williams does not.

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:40.032
So the diagonal terms
are always positive.

01:12:40.032 --> 01:12:41.024
Yeah?

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.840
PROFESSOR: All the off
diagonals are negative.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.020
So this is positive.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.290
Positive, positive,
positive and then

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:52.752
negative, negative,
negative, negative, negative.

01:12:52.752 --> 01:12:54.460
Now there are actually
negative-- they'll

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.040
be negative-- the numbers will
pop up negative and so forth.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.250
It's just that in the notation,
some authors have adopted

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.660
putting the minus signs here.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.690
Others have embedded
them in the value itself.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:15.220
So Williams' notation,
he would say that ixz

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.390
is minus m x1 z1 for this body.

01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:23.530
Hibbler would say it's plus
and he'd put the minus sign

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:26.250
in the notation.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:27.400
So just beware of that.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.430
Because all your
life you're going

01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.430
to run into people saying
the product of inertia

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:33.945
of this thing is and you got to
know which way they define it.

01:13:33.945 --> 01:13:34.445
All right.

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:44.850
Compute torques.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:48.290
You just take time to
[INAUDIBLE] angular momentum.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.590
And we'll do that as a
last little step next time.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:55.130
But you've got the
essence of the movement

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.700
from talking about
particles to how we're going

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.620
to talk about rigid bodies.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.830
So you have muddy cards.

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:03.600
You have two or three minutes.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.970
Write down what was
tough for you here.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:08.010
Write down what wasn't.

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.165
And see you next Tuesday.

01:14:11.165 --> 01:14:16.620
Oh, I must say, so this
stuff about-- the mass moment

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.570
of inertia matrix.

01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:20.600
That stuff is not on the exam.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:26.960
But knowing about particles and
particle moments of inertia is.
