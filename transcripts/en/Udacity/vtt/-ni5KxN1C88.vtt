00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.530
Tell us a bit more about how this sort of chip hybridazation works

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.400
for people who are unfamiliar. I hear chip, and I, well sometimes I

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.240
think potato chip. But I, I know in this case we're probably talking

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.514
about something more like maybe a computer chip. How does this work exactly?

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:20.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, the chip is really a glass slide that contains

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
an array of DNA. And those, and the DNA is bound to glass beads that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.558
are scattered on a regular pattern on the, on the chip. So then that DNA is

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:32.966
designed by us to bind to the parts

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.500
of the genome we're interested in. It's a process

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.820
I talked about a minute ago and it,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.420
it comes together through the process of base pairing

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.913
just like double helix space pairing. And then

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:51.380
either you have, let's say, an A at position,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.720
the position we're interested in or G. And

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.090
depending on which of those two you have, will

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.770
either light up green or light up red on

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.420
the chip. Have a specific position on the chip.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.730
&gt;&gt; I see. So you essentially have sort of a

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.080
discrete, or, or quantum unit for every little DNA molecule

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.300
that you're testing. You get a little signal that says,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.200
oh, you have an A, or you have a G here.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.890
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And because humans are diploid, you'll also get situations

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890
where you have A and G, one from mother,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.265
one from father. So then what we see at that

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.665
position on the chip is red and green or

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:26.515
kind of a yellow signalling you can think of it.

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:28.915
&gt;&gt; Oh that's really clever. So that allows you

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:32.091
to easily distinguish any given position that you're looking at.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:37.267
&gt;&gt; Yes. So when we get the data at 23andMe we actually can plot it on

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:42.327
a simple x y plot with the red on the y axis and green on the sorry

00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:45.012
on the x axis. And then we'll see three

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:48.224
clusters of people who are AA, AG, and GG, because

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:52.093
those are the three possible situations for this position

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:55.344
in your genome. Then we can say, well if you're

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.915
in this cluster. Just because the process is called

00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:00.883
clustering, and you're AG, and if you're in this cluster,

00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:03.030
then you're AA. So there's a kind of a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.310
simple analysis problem at the end of the output there.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.570
&gt;&gt; I see, and it sounds like you're

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.910
actually using, sort of, the information from a pooled

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.940
set of individuals. You know, you're sort of looking.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.190
So even though an individual call may be difficult

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.570
to know where on that graph you're, you're place

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.375
if you use this clustering like you said you

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.810
can more readily identify oh, you're part of this

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.880
group so you're AA, not AG kind of thing?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.170
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right and there are also situations you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.490
can imagine where we get even more information. So you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.040
could imagine a situation where you have a deletion of the part of the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.080
genome we're interested in. Then what we'll

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.635
see is a new cluster, another cluster

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:42.070
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.770
three, with lower intensity. Because there's less signal there because there are

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.610
fewer DNA molecules. So then, a new cluster could emerge. And it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.364
could be as infrequent as one in 10, 000 people, or one

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:59.010
in 100,000 people. But we'll see a little nucleus of samples there.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.100
&gt;&gt; Now in in lesson two of our course we actually talked for the first time

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.330
there about the idea of base pairing and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.420
we learned about the base pairing rules and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.280
how things fit together. What I find really interesting

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.011
is the idea that in a double stranded DNA

00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:16.100
you know of all these letters matching with each

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.200
other is, is what you're telling us the idea that,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.090
a single nucleotide variant is just one letter change

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.370
here, that if one letter doesn't match, then essentially

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.640
what's happening is that the strand can't actually hybridize

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.910
completely, it can't base pair completely, and that's why you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.610
you don't see the signal for one, but you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.010
do for another. Is that essentially what's going on?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.590
&gt;&gt; It's something very close to that. So what we expect is that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.080
all of the letters leading up to the letter we're interested in will bind.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.321
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:48.530
&gt;&gt; And like you say, if there is a an error there, one difference, then it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.410
won't bind or it will bind weakly. So the signal will be weak. But then the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.614
specific letter we're interested in, which will kind of come out one more base.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.978
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:04.635
&gt;&gt; Has, there's a pool of As, Gs, Cs and Ts floating around that

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:09.800
can bind there or not. They'll only bind. If it's the correct base pair.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.120
&gt;&gt; And it's unoccupied.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.630
&gt;&gt; And it's unoccupied. Then we'll see

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.050
the the extension happen. The reaction that leads

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.780
to the color, you know, the color that we can see in our imaging system.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.540
&gt;&gt; That's great. So essentially you have this,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.540
you said the chip is a slide, and you're looking at

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.230
a million bases in this one little chip? This one little space?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there're even more than that.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.080
There are more than a million beads per chip.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.810
Because, it's better to read the same variant many,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.250
many times just to get a good average signal.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.220
&gt;&gt;

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.510
&gt;&gt; The reason for that is that, if

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.390
you're in the corner, maybe you'll get slightly different

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.860
optics because the camera's looking at the center of the chip or

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100
so on, or something like that. So you just want some redundancy.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.350
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.870
&gt;&gt; So it's more than ten million beads per chip. And that process has

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.270
been improving over the years. The density

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.090
of the chips has been increasing a lot.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.410
&gt;&gt; How many chips, so, I mean, do you, have

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.050
you always used the same chip, or how do you

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.190
make changes. You know, if there's a new, I guess,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.540
I don't know, a new trade or a new a

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.010
new SNV that you become interested in, are you able

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.300
to change your chip so you can look at that?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we update the chip approximately every 18 months. we're on the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.570
third iteration right now. and we're constantly looking for new variants to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.960
add to the chip to improve the performance of it. So you can

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.640
imagine that if there's a paper published that says, this mutation and this

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.320
gene causes a disease and it's, you know, it's very interesting to

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.920
find that out. We can design what we call a probe for

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.770
that, just the base the sequence of DNA that's attached to the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.340
glass bead, and make sure it's on the next iteration of the chip.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.780
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the hybridization process is sort of

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.170
the, the longest part. so that happens over, over night?

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.810
&gt;&gt; What, I mean for those of us I mean, we've learned

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.700
conceptually about base pairing, but any technical insight you might

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.500
have. I mean what's Why is this an overnight process?

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.010
&gt;&gt; Essentially, it just takes time for the DNA in your

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.936
saliva, in your extracted saliva sample, to find the right feed. So

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:27.300
you want to give it time to just search around in the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.630
solution, find the right bead, and bind there and that takes time.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.870
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.370
&gt;&gt; It takes time, just based on how quickly

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.792
the DNA moves around and how tightly it binds.

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:43.480
&gt;&gt; and what do you use to measure the results? Are you, I

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.660
mean, are you just like snapping a

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.040
picture of the chip? What's actually happening?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's very close to that. in essence, you get what's called

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.710
a fluorophore attached to the, the bead. Because of the presence of the

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.480
A or the G at that position. that's the red or green signal. You,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.650
you shoot a laser at it to excite the fluorophore. And then you take a

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.190
photograph of it with a digital camera. So a lot of it is very

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.540
much, you know, digital camera based, which

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.160
is interesting, that that technology with our technology.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah that, and it also sounds like. I mean, I know how big

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.890
my digital camera picture files are that sounds like it's a lot of data,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.880
a lot of information that you end up with

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So all of that data from

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.210
this giant image files gets processed by software that's

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.000
actually run at our lab in Los Angeles and translated into the x, y plot that I

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.060
mentioned before. Because for each bead on the

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.580
chip, really all we're interested in is how much

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.090
red is there in there and how much

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.980
green. The photograph itself is not terribly useful after

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.060
we've extracted that data.
