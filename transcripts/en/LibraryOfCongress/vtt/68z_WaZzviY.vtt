00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.620
[silence]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.810
&gt;&gt; JOAN WEEKS: Good afternoon
Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.900
On behalf of my colleagues and
in particular Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.670
Chief of the African and
Middle East Division,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.060
I would like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.530
I'm Joan Weeks, Head of
the Near East section

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.560
and that is the sponsor
of today's program.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.070
We're very pleased to present
this program on the discovery

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.250
of the secret of the great pyramid
and the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.340 position:56%
And before we start today's program,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.330
we just like to give you a brief
overview, especially our newcomers

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.030
to our division in the hopes that
you'll come back and do research

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.590
with us or attend further programs.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.180
This is a custodial division and
it's got three sections that build

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.130
and serve collections for
researchers around the world.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.870
We cover over 78 countries
and two dozen languages.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.880 position:56%
The Africa section covers all of the
countries of South Saharan Africa.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.570
The Hebraic section is
responsible for Hebraica worldwide

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.060
and the Near East section
covers all of the Arab countries

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.030
of North Africa, all of the
Middle East of course, Turkey,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.290
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan, and the Muslims

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.000
in Western China, the Balkans,
and the peoples of the Caucuses.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So, it's a very wide region
of collection and expertise

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.540
in this reading room to
serve these collections.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.590
Now, just a few things we like
to always invite you to fill

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.200
in the evaluation form that
we've left in your seats

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.300 position:56%
that helps us design future programs

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.530
and we also have put this little
flyer about blog and Facebook.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.410
And if you subscribe to our
Facebook, you get announcements

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.840
of future programs and the blog has
some very very interesting articles

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.140
written by our curators.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.750 position:56%
So, we really invite you to do that.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.020
And we also say today that this
program is being videotaped,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.320
webcast.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.400
So, if you want to ask
questions at the end,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.950
you are implicitly
giving your permission

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.480
to be videotaped and recorded.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.390
Just to make sure you
understand that.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.800
And also we have a very special
booklet up here that- all

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.710
about the Library of Congress
and we laid out copies here

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.730
so you're welcome to take
those before you leave.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.220 position:56%
And for right now, I'll introduce
my dear colleague, Dr. Fawzi Tadros,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.510

[applause]

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.330
&gt;&gt;MAMDOUH ELDAMATY:
Thank you very much.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:55.380
Doctor Fawzi Tadros,
Mrs. Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.950
Dear colleagues, distinguished
guests, it is honor to me ...

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.310
Could I take it in
my hand like this?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.370
Actually it is a great pleasure and
honor to me to be with you today

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.620
in the Library of the Congress, and
thanks to the Department of African

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.430
and Eastern and Near East ...

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.730
Middle East, sorry.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.160
African and Middle East, and
thanks also to the Cultural Bureau

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.940
of the Egyptian Embassy for
inviting me for this event.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.080
To talk about the Egyptian
antiquities,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.020
especially the Great Pyramid
and the Tomb of Tutankhamun,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.640
it means we have to
talk about secrets.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.200
We couldn't maybe define
what we have there exact,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.640
until we discover all the secrets

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.430
of these two important
monuments of Egypt.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.020 position:56%
But actually it takes a lot of time.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.210
The Great Pyramid we can say it
is the wonder of the wonders,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.620
the most important wonder of the
world who stay until nowadays.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:26.340
The King Khufu, Cheops, is one
of the most important kings

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.650
who ruled Egypt about 23 years.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:39.000
Started from 2600 BC,
4,600 years now.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.650
Unfortunately we have for this king
only this statuette made of ivory,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.760
nine centimeter high, but we don't
have other sculpture for him,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.090
but we have the Great Pyramid.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.890
The first it started
with the Great Pyramid

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.110
and to make some research
it was from Richard Pococke,

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:07.120
and he did this sketch of the
pyramids, 1754, and as you see

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.670
above the burial chamber,
actually nowadays,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:15.990
by the new scholars we found five
chambers above the burial chamber.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.390
You cannot see them here because
it's not discovered until that day,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:27.880
but here we have these rooms
found by Howard Vyse, 1837.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.070
And in the top one of them we
found the name of King Khufu,

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.560 position:56%
the cartouche of King Khufu, Cheops.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.100
From this day we know that this
pyramid belonged to the King Khufu.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.740
Then later we have a most
important study of one

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.430
of the important scholar of
Egyptology, Flinders Petrie.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:01.470
He's England, a English person,
but he did a lot of work in Egypt

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.600
in several places,
especially in Giza.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.980
He wrote his book about
pyramids and temples of Giza.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.180
And he did the first accurate
measurements of the pyramids,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.950
which we use until nowadays.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.270
When he was in Giza in
that time, as you see,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.510
Sphinx was until that day covered
with sand, which removed now

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:30.390
and you can see also in front
of the pyramid big space, empty,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.580
free space, not full of houses
like what we have nowadays.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:45.310
The idea of the pyramid we can
talk about special architect

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:55.340
or a special wonder, which built
2600 BC, the high of the pyramid

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.440
in the time of King
Cheops, ancient 481 feet.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.600
Nowadays it is we lost
some meters from the top

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.650
and the high nowadays is 455 feet.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.450
The base of the pyramid: 756 feet.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:22.800
The volume: 91,227,778 cubic feet.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.520
Huge building.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.420
The mass of the pyramid
is 5.9 million tons,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.150
2.3 million blocks of sandstone.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:41.330
This huge work takes
time, about 20 years

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.690
to build this pyramid, but how?

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.010
We still have the secret.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:51.440
The famous architect of
the pyramid was Hamun.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.640
He was a cousin of King Khufu.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:01.110
Here the statue hosted now in the
Museum of Hildesheim in Germany,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.960
and if you look to this plan,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.010
you see that the pyramid take three
stages to build this Great Pyramid.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.470
The first stage on the top here,
when we had the real burial chamber

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.380
of the king under the ground in the
mother rock of the plateau of Giza.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.340
Then the architect changed his mind
to build another burial chamber

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.260
for the king on the top of
the ground in the building.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.740
This chamber called now the Room
of the Queen or the Queen Chamber,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.670
but actually did the second
chamber of King Khufu himself.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.280
Then for the last time or the
third time he changed again

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.360
and built the burial chamber
of the king in the first third

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.160
of the high of the pyramid.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.530
But how? Is the most
important question.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:00.180
How, it is one of the secrets
of the pyramid: how it's built.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:06.910
Some scholars thought about the
so-called causeways, it is ramp.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.770
The ramp goes to the pyramid
and they build the first layer,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:17.860
then extended their ramp until
we reach the top of the pyramid,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.860
but it could be 1.6 kilometer long.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:28.670 position:56%
It is very difficult, or we have to
make up with a very dangerous angle,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.460
also it is difficult to imagine.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.560
Then we stay by ramp, but
surrounding the pyramid

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.140
from outside until the top.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.440
It means it is 1.6
kilometer not in straight way,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.220
but surrounding the pyramid
from top to the bottom.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.920
And we can imagine it would work
like this to go around the pyramid

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.700
until reaching the
top of the pyramid.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.360
But, come for us special question
and very difficult question,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.970
because we know that the pyramid
after finishing will be covered

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.650
from outside making a casing of
the pyramid with white limestone.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.850
The main stones of the pyramid
come from the main quarry of Giza,

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:26.750
from the same plateau used to build
this pyramid, but the covering,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.170 position:56%
the case, casing of the pyramid
come from white limestone from Tora,

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.490
about 15 kilometers out of Cairo.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.330
Casing like this here,
we have this pyramid

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.310
of King Sneferu, the
father of Cheops.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:49.070
This pyramid in Dahshur, and
until now we have the casing

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.870
of the pyramid, as you see, this
very fine casing from outside.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.530
How we can do this by
the pyramid of Cheops

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.700
when we did the external ramp
round surrounding the pyramid?

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.480
It could be difficult.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:11.090
Then some French scholar,
1986, went to the pyramid

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:16.170
and they have a new
method of technology.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.960
It is microgravimetry.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.940
This method used to measure the
vibration and the mass and density

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.600
of the pyramid from inside.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.230
They spent about one month.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:39.230
They make more than 1,000 mass for
this, and they said at the end,

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.490
"We have so-called sub-density,"

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.030
or zone of empty spaces
inside the pyramid,

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.490
which you can see here
by white and green.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:58.290
It means we have swirl
inside the pyramid to show us

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.800
that we have maybe the
ramp inside the pyramid.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:09.860
The measuring tell us that the
pyramid itself lost about 15%

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.400
from its mass from
inside, or from the density

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.200
of the pyramid from inside.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.720
Then this work taken

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:24.470
by the architect Jean-Pierre
Houdin, he is French architect.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.590
His father also is architect.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:34.900
They discuss together
the results of 1986,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.150
and they try to make
imagination how it could be built.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:47.820
Then they thought that we have
two ramps, one from outside,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.110
external ramp until about
third of the pyramid,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.760
then we have another ramp, internal
ramp from inside the pyramid.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.570
And they think it should
be like this.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.370
Then we can build the
pyramid from the first layer

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.880
with its casing directly
together until the end.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:19.930
But, after they finished, they can
then close the way from outside.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:25.400
Here, as you see, how they put the
casing, and the casing from outside

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:33.810
from the beginning helps the
people to make sure from the angle

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.960
of the pyramid, and to protect
the measuring of the pyramid.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.070
They have to make it from outside,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.080
and then from inside
they put other blocks.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:53.590
Then he met with a
Egyptologist, Bob Brier, American,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.500
and they discussed
together what it should be,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.350
and they make together this book:
The Secret of the Great Pyramid,

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:09.940
published 2009, published 2009.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:18.330
Then we started now then to make
a new scan for the pyramids.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.190
Two of the projects under this
provision and the cooperation

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.770
of the Ministry of Antiquities
with the Cairo University Faculty

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.300
of Engineering with HIP,
Heritage, Innovation,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.430
and Preservation, an
institute from Paris.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.360
Here we announced it
in October 2015.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.640
I stay in the middle and the
colleagues to announce new project

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.750
of ScanPyramids to know
what we have exact.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:58.180
In this, we work also with Laval
University in Quebec, Canada,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.720
and Nagoya University of Japan.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.950
The goal of our team is to probe
the heart of the largest pyramids

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.410
of Egypt without drilling
the slightest opening.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.920
It means we have to
protect the building itself

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.550
until we're sure 100% we
have something inside.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.010
Then we can do the drilling.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.790
Before that, we cannot.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:31.660
What we did, we have to use new
technology to help for this scan.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.970
One of them is muon detection.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.640
Muon is some cosmic rays.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.550
We will talk about it.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.920
And the second one
infrared thermography

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.140
and reconstruction with 3D scan.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:52.810
These three methods we have to use
to solve this problem or to be sure

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.830
if we have something
inside, empty or not.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.480
Actually, we're sure
we have something.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.480 position:56%
We have new secrets in the
pyramids, but we cannot be accurate.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.850
Then we start with the
five great pyramids.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.560
As you know we have more
than 40 pyramids in Egypt,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.570
but the most important is the
pyramids of Giza and Dahshur,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:19.500
these five pyramids, three
in Giza and two in Dahshur.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.490
We start to make infrared
scan around the Great Pyramid

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:29.050 position:56%
from all sides, and all the time of
the days: in the morning, in midday,

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.020
the evening, through the night.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:39.120
This helps us to found thermal
anomaly in the north side

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.340
of the Great Pyramid, here,
by the first layer or first

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.310
and second layer of stones.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.740
What it should be?

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:54.660
We found here because the
infrared thermography measured the

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.660
temperature of the surface
of the sides of the pyramids.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:08.430
And here, we found, as you see
here, the red color, it means hot.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.660
We have always six degree
difference between these two blocks

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.910
and the other side of the pyramid.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.580
If we measure it in the morning,
in the midday, in the evening,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.760
we have always six
degree difference.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.930
It means we have here something
behind this red color stone,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.040
but what should be?

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.340
We don't know.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:42.170
But, if we look to the stones
here, it is totally different

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:49.270
by the design and construction
than the other of the other sides.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.820
It's totally different.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:21:01.480
That time when I announced
it in November 9, 2015,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.230
we did press conference in the
pyramid and we announce about it,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.570 position:56%
and I said in that time that this
picture should be the famous picture

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.840
or most important picture
of year 2015.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:21.640
It is the photo of Cheops,
here, we stand beside this area.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.710
Again, to show here exact ...

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.850
Look to the blocks beside.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.110
It is very different than this.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.790
It means it was here
a door, empty space,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.490
and covered with another
blocks later

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.850
after the finishing of the pyramid.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.110
We continue this.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.180
Two days later Zahi Hawass
went to the same area to share

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.670
with us what we have to do there.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:59.440
Then we know that Zahi Hawass had
started also before to search,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.670
to try to found also the
secret of the pyramid,

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:12.460
and he make drill inside
the pyramid,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.030
but unfortunately he
didn't found anything.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:21.620
That what led us to say we have
first to improve everything

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.170
to be sure before we drill again.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:30.490
The thermal anomalies in
Khufu, Cheops, we found more.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.270
We started with what I show you.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.270
It was number one here,
what I show you.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.920
But, we have another
places also to found.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.180
One, two, five, and
six, it is similar.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.110
Look at this here, it is by two.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.300
They have the same
construction of blocks

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.610
like what we had in the first one.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:02.600
It means here we have anomaly which
tell us we have something behind,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.780 position:56%
but unfortunately until nowadays we
cannot be sure exact what is behind,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:12.410
and we cannot do a drill to show.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:17.730
Then the second one,
it is muon radiography.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.740
Muon is currently the only
technology that can see

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:29.290
through all genetic objects
and it is used by the Japanese

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.960
to solve the problems in ...

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.790
They come from the earth,
actually, and millions of them

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:46.170
through the atmosphere of
the earth, from our bodies,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.860
through our- we have about
between two to three million

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.180
of these muons passing through
our body, but it is safe.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.930
Nothing happened with our
body, no side effects.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.130
The Japanese, as I told you,
they use it to know the secret

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:07.530
of volcano: when the
volcano could be active.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.900
They found what is
inside like this here.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:18.260
Then they try to use this
technology to make also a picture

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.290
of the pyramid from inside.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:30.810
We will use this technique for
the whole Great Pyramids, the two,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.530
one from Dahshur, first
one, Bent Pyramid.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.830
That's the north one of
Dahshur, the Great Pyramid

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.300
of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.620
We have to start with this one,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.330
because we know exact what is
behind, what's inside the pyramid,

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.970
and we would like to be sure
that this method is accurate

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.720
to find what we have inside.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.940
Then we using it.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.150
Now, here you see the
professional man.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:10.050
He is a genius person to 25
years old from Japan, Yoshimura.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.530
Doctor Yoshimura.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:19.320
I'm sorry, his name is difficult.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:29.430 position:56%
Yeah. He put here the plates inside
the down chamber of the Bent Pyramid

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:34.440
to collect the radius, and
after that they will take them

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.640
to develop these plates in
the Grand Egyptian Museum.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.150
We have a special lab in
the Grand Egyptian Museum

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.340
to make the development
of these plates.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:49.040
Then taken to Japan to
continue the analysis.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.070 position:56%
It takes inside the pyramid 80
days, and some days for development,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:01.160
and another two months
in Japan for analysis.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:09.600
They did it first a computer
simulation what we have to seen

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.250
after the analyses of these plates,

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.750
and it should be the
photo like this.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:22.700 position:56%
After that, sure, we compare between
what we have inside the simulation

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:29.460
of the computer and the result
what we read from muons.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.950
It is accurate and it is the same.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:38.920
Then it is new methods we have
to trust and we have to continue

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.580
with this method in
the Pyramid of Giza.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:48.500
Then we put them in two places
inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.890
one inside the second
chamber in the middle,

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.500
and we have to measure this area.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.480
The second one, on the
gallery directly some meters

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.330
after the main entrance
of the pyramid,

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.230
and to use and cover this area.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:15.830
We started already, and now the
plate's in Japan for the analysis.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:21.380
We wait for the result and we hope
that we have a good result there.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:29.280
The third method is the 3D scan to
make from outside accurate figures,

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.900
accurate pictures, 3D pictures like
this here by the main entrance.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:40.530
That by the Great Pyramid and
we have to wait for the results.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:46.380
Until now, we can say we
have to found something.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:52.690
We are sure to found something,
but exact where inside the pyramid,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:58.280
how it should be, this gallery,
this room, chamber, another chamber

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.010
with some furniture of
the king, we don't know.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.510
Then we have to wait, but also we
have to follow the new technology

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.630
and trust the technology.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:15.960
The second part is Tomb of
Tutankhamun radar survey.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.790
Actually, we had 1,000 of
visitors to visit the tomb of King

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:30.020
of Tutankhamun before 2011, and
to save the tombs from a lot

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:35.300
of visitors we had the project
to make facsimile for the tomb,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.750
exact one-to-one, to help
for us when we close the Tomb

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.550
of Tutankhamun for
restoration or conservation,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:49.070
then the visitors they can
visit the other facsimile

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.040
or copy of this tomb.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.080
It started by the work of Basel
University with Factum Arte

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.910
and the Factum Foundation,
and finished 2009.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:12.880 position:56%
They did a high resolution pictures,
laser pictures, which very important

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.730
for us to continue our search.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.350
As you see here it is the
new facsimile, and the person

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.950
who visit already the
tomb of King Tutankhamun,

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:28.090
he cannot found any difference.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.630
It is typical one-to-one.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:38.150
Then we took this high resolution
picture for another new search.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:43.600
Nicholas Reeves is one of
the scholar Egyptologists.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.920
He worked a lot in the
Valley of the Kings.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.460
We can say the man of the Valley
of the Kings is Nicholas Reeves,

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.080
and he did a search
with these pictures,

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.230
and after that he wrote
an article and he think

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.860
that we have the burial chamber

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:11.610
of Nefertiti behind the burial
chamber of King Tutankhamun.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:18.020
He published his article
in July 2015.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:25.270
Directly after that, it got a lot
of attack from many scholars: "No.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.380
It is dream of him.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.680
He is crazy.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.980
How it could be?"

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.370
And something like this.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:37.440
The media called me and they
would like to know my opinion

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.860
about the article about
what Reeves said,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.800
but until that time I didn't
read the article of him.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.820
I told them, "Stop.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.010
Reeves is a good scholar.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:58.130
He know what he does in the Valley
of the Kings, and it is his work,

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.630
and I have to read first the
article to know what he wrote,

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:08.450
and then I can say my opinion."

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:15.590 position:56%
I read the article, and I found a
lot of important things inside this,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.730
many points we have to
discuss and to be sure

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.550
of they are accurate or not.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:29.510
Then I called him by phone in
London, and when I told him,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.680
"I am Mamdouh Eldamaty, the
Minister of Antiquities,"

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.050
I said, he lost first the words.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:39.960
Then: "You are Eldamaty the
Egyptian Minister of Antiquities?"

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.160
"Yes. I am."

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.010
He was very happy that
we take it in mind.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:52.640
I asked him to come to Egypt to
discuss together about his points

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.160
in the Tomb of Tutankhamun
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.840
He accepted and in one week he
came to Egypt and we went together.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.980
He show us the article here-
the black and white down.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:11.650
It is the laser photo
from Factum Arte.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:18.450
And he compared it and he found
here these remains four, five,

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.240
six should be here in this area.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:30.720
He think it should be a door and
it's closed later by the finishing

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.230
of the Tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:42.280 position:56%
Reeves think also that this tomb
belong first to the Queen Nefertiti,

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:47.150
because normally when
we have tombs of queens,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.450
we found after the main
entrance and the gallery,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:56.940
we have here a special hall,
then the architect goes

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:02.710
to the right side, it is queen,
but when it goes to the left side

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.610
and it continued in the
left side, it is king.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.210
Then you think it is a queen,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.080
and at the beginning it should
be only the main gallery,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:20.150 position:56%
this gallery here, and went with
this door to another burial chamber.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:28.050
But, suddenly thought of suddenly
death of King Tutankhamen.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:33.270
He died suddenly when he
was 19-years-old and in

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.300
that time we didn't
have tomb for him.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.570
Then the Egyptian they have to
build for him a tomb to bury him.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:48.290
And they cut special part from the
tomb, from the oldest tomb, maybe,

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:55.550
as Reeves said, of Nefertiti or
of another person, and he used it

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.890
as the burial chamber and
tomb of King Tutankhamen.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:05.840
But, he has to make it as a tomb,
because they cut only place then.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:12.160
He make extension in the left side
after the entrance with magazine

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:19.210
and also another room in the east
side, and make the ground deep,

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:26.610
about 60 centimeter deep, and
extension to the west side,

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.800
to the left, this west side.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.090
Then continued the surfaces
of the burial chamber.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.590
Only this chamber is painted.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.850
The other chamber is not.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:46.530
Here he found also the
remains of the wall,

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:53.990
which is cut to make the
extension to that west side.

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.370
We went to the tomb together.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:03.380
Here Reeves in the middle, it's
me, here Doctor Khaled El-Anany,

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.040 position:56%
the new Minister of Antiquities
now, Mahmoud Afify, Sultan Muhammed,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.430
Mustafa Waziri, group
of people went together

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:17.920
to discuss the details
and what he did.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.320
There I found a new point to
add to the theory of Reeves.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.660 position:56%
It is we have here different
between the finishing of the surface

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:34.340
in the bottom part of the north
wall, east side, and the top

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.640
and the rest of the wall.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.370
Here is clear.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.830
You can see it is here
another plaster added,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.520
and the remain of brush.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:53.700
Then take a paint, a special
plaster and paint it later.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.670
On the top here, directly
you can see the different.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.520
Here it is the rock, the
main rock, the mother rock

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.290
of the tomb painted also
with yellow like this,

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.960
but you can see the
different of the surfaces.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.070
We had something like this
before by the beginning

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:16.990
and the discovery of
the tomb 2019 ...

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.070
1922 by Howard Carter.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:27.220
The burial chamber was closed
with the same plaster, this here.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.330
And you can see also the
remains of the brush.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.400
It means he used this and covered

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.810
with yellow color,
then painted the wall.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:43.050
Then we did press conference,
but Reeves decided

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.770
to say it is a tomb of Nefertiti.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.600
Actually, I agree with him,
we found something here,

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.780
but I disagree it is Nefertiti.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:01.640 position:56%
Why? Reeves is saying that Nefertiti
ruled Egypt directly after the death

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:08.100
of King Akhenaton, and she is
back from Tell el-Amarna to Luxor.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.200
She changed her name to be
Smenkhkare, to be a king,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:22.990
to be a queen to Egypt, and she did
for herself a burial chamber there

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.790
in the Tomb of Tutankhamun, behind
the tomb of King Tutankhamun,

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:32.300
and she brought with her the
mummy of her husband Akhenaton,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.850
and she did for him a burial
in the Valley of the Kings,

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:40.630
the so-called KV, Kings Valley, 55.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:46.430
But, my opinion said, yeah,
Doctor Zahi Hawass also tried

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:53.500
to found king, Queen Nefertiti
and he wrote this article in Horas

00:37:53.500 --> 00:38:03.130 position:56%
in January 2007, to search Nefertiti
in the Valley of the Kings,

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.010
after the theory of
Reeves in that time also.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:07.320
It means Reeves thought

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.490
that Nefertiti is there
since a long time.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.230
The City of Tell el-Amarna, which
built by Akhenaton and Nefertiti

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:23.120
in Minya mid-Egypt
surrounded by Boundary stele,

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.050
and here these red points.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.870
They have two of these
Boundary stele.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:35.140
On this Boundary stele, King
Akhenaton and Nefertiti swear

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:41.380
with the name of the God Atum they
will never leave Tell el-Amarna,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.430
living there, die there,
and buried there.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.930
And also, we found the real
tomb of Tell el-Amarna,

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:53.380
of Akhenaton and Nefertiti there.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:59.880 position:56%
Yeah. We found his tomb empty,
right, but this tomb built for them.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.450
It means, in my opinion she
must be there or buried there.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:10.330
We didn't found her
body, but it is its tomb.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.890
It's her tomb, not in
Valley of the Kings.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.050
Here the tomb KV55,
we found in KV55,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.150
remains of bones and skull of king.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:30.550
We think it is a king
called Smenkhkare,

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.420
the younger brother
of King Akhenaton.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:41.260
Reeves has said, no, it is
Akhenaton himself, and Smenkhkare,

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.620
it is another name of Nefertiti,
and she is not buried there

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.060
in this tomb, but behind the
burial chamber of King Tutankhamun.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.180
It is the two opinion: Akhenaton,
Smenkhkare; Smenkhkare, Nefertiti.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:40:02.450
And inside this tomb KV55, we found
here this canopic jar of Meritaten,

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:09.370
this daughter of Nefertiti and
sister of King Tutankhamun.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.350
We have some remains
belonging to Kiya.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.060
Kiya is the mother
of King Tutankhamun.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.660
We have also some pieces
to Queen Tiye,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.430 position:56%
the grandmother of King Tutankhamun.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:29.190
Then, we have things to tell
us that Kiya, Meritatun,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:33.310
and Tiye must be buried in
the Valley of the Kings,

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:36.930 position:56%
but we didn't have the tombs of
them, but we didn't have any remains

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.890
of Nefertiti inside this tomb.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.130
For this reason I think

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:47.090
when we found a burial
chamber behind the tomb

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:52.200
of Tutankhamen could be for
another lady, not for Nefertiti.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.030
Actually until now
we couldn't be sure

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.150
that is a burial chamber behind.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:03.180
What we did after that, we
started to make radar scan.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:11.030
We brought radar scan, radar from
Japan to 26-27 of November 2015,

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.540
and first we did the radar in KV5.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:22.690
KV5 it is the tomb of the
sons of King Ramesses II,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.860
because we know exact
the rooms inside.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.880
Then when we do radar, then the
result should tell us what we have

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.210
there to be sure, as a test
radar to make it first.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:38.570
Then also when we went to the Tomb
of Tutankhamun, we started also

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:44.210 position:56%
with the main side of the
antechamber of the King Tutankhamun,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.120
because we know in this side,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.500
to the east side behind it
also should be empty space

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.850
of the magazine of this annex,
and solid space of the rock,

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:59.100
the mother rock of the mountain
of the Valley of the Kings.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.530
Then, when we have the result here
is accurate with what we have,

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:08.400 position:56%
it means we have to trust the system
and we have to continue with it.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.060
Here Watanabe, Mister Watanabe
by working to make the radar scan

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.570
on the north wall of
the antechamber.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.440
And it is a result, as you see,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.500
you can see here the line
divided the two sides.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.650
Here's empty behind,
and here's solid behind.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:31.750
That tell us, yes, we can
follow and trust this system.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.750
We continue in other sides
of the burial chamber,

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:42.020
here at the north side, by
discussion about the results,

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.300
Watanabe, Reeves, his
assistant and me.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:53.210
Then, we found some very
important things like this picture

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.000
of the radar for the north
wall of the burial chamber.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.510
I think it is clear to see
that here by this stick

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:06.590
and down it is a different
between the two sides.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.050
It is very clear.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:14.200
Here we have a solid side
behind, and here it's empty space,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.950
and with this curve Mister
Watanabe said it could be a curve

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.270
of a door lintel.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.660
Yeah. Like this.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:33.970
But, also, the end he said,

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:40.120
"We can see that we have
something behind the north wall

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.880
and the west wall of
the burial chamber."

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:51.930 position:56%
He thought maybe it is another
chamber, and give also this picture.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:58.880
And he said, "Could be we have
something solid or metal inside,

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.250
and something soft
inside these two rooms."

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:08.240
That means we have some furniture,
but it is also difficult to say.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.230
For this reason we would like
to make another radar scan.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.950
We thought about three
types of radar scan to do,

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.930
and also one infrared thermography.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.160
The second one we did,
the infrared thermography.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:31.530
But, unfortunately we do it in
small place on the north wall,

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:37.710
only in the space where we thought
that we have here a door lintel,

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.870
to know exact if we have
here something or not.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:43.380
But, actually, we have to
repeat it for the whole side

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:50.340
of the north side of
the burial chamber.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:57.200
Here the result is similar to
what we had before by Factum Arte.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.760
Maybe here a little bit
clearer than before,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.090
but we have to repeat this again.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:15.570
We did another radar with the
help of National Geographic,

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:27.060
but after that we sent this radar
to two types of analyzed scan data

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.380
by GPR and here by RADAN.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.880
They are two types of analyze
system, and the results

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:46.190
by GPR come by Goodman and Dash.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.950
Goodman said we didn't have
anything behind the north wall.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:54.130
It means we have nothing behind.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:59.660
But, Dash said, "No, we cannot read
or do any analyze for this data,

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.800
because we have a lot of noise,
and noisy is difficult to read."

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.800
Then we have to repeat this again.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:15.020
Also, by RADAN the two person,
Waters said the same, like Dash.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.250
We have to repeat it again
because we have noisy.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.960
But, Abassid, we don't
have anything.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.730
It means two persons said
we don't have anything.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.100
The other two persons said we have
to repeat it because we have noisy.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.380
It is not accurate
read, accurate data.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.980
Then it means we have to repeat
it again, because Watanabe, Japan,

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.230
said we have something here.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.810
Here, we have nothing,
or we have to repeat.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:50.750
The work is continued now,
and at the end of this month,

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:57.430 position:56%
or in April now, next month, we have
to repeat the radar scan this time

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.120
from the top of the tomb.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.080
Then we have to do it
another time from inside

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.460
with infrared scan from inside.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.040
Then we can say what we have.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.840
Thank you very much.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:27.660
[applause]

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:39.740
&gt;&gt;FAWZI TADROS: Dr. Robert, please.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.040
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:51.910
&gt;&gt;ALDAMATY: Actually, JAM is one
of the modern museum in the world.

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:59.360
We have very high standard lab
there and we built special section

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:04.580
to develop the rajas there
but not to analyze them

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:10.960
because to analyze it needs more
technique, more money, more place

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:17.130
and the technique we have in Japan
we develop it in JAM and send it

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.680
to Japan to continue the work.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.650
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.960
&gt;&gt;ALDAMATY: Actually, I hope
Reeves is right and I'm wrong.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.160
To find Nefertiti- it
is more fascinating.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.460
The relationship.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:18.670 position:56%
Akhenaton, the father of Tutankhamun

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:24.500
and Nefertiti's step
mother and yeah.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.320
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:32.620
&gt;&gt;ALDAMATY: Kaya, yeah,
but also not 100%

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:37.320
because you didn't have any
documents which tell us exact

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.330
that Tutankhamun is the
son of Kaya and Akhenaton.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:47.300
We know exact that Akhenaton and
Nefertiti had 6 daughters, not boy.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.650
But, we have a boy that is
the son of Akhenaton then

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:57.900 position:56%
from the other lady and we know that
Akhenaton married also with Kaya.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:02.740
Probably she was the
mother of him...

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.040
Please.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.500
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.370
&gt;&gt;ALDAMATY: Actually, as
you said, Akhenaton lived

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:04.700
in Egypt he left Luxor
and went to Tell Aman,

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.100
built his new city surrounded
by his (inaudible) would

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:13.980
like to be a new place
without other cuts except Atun.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:17.910
Tutankhamun, he was
born in Tell Aman.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:23.940
His name actually was Tutank Atun,
the living image of the God, Atun.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.610
2 years later he came to
Luxor and he changed his name

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:34.010
to be Tutankhamun and he made
the decree to continue the work,

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.660 position:56%
but started already before Akhenaton

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.210
and he worshipped the
God Amun again.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.970
But, in the same time we have
some opinion from some scholar

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:53.030
that before him, maybe Nefertiti
came to Luxor or King Samakare.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:59.030
For this reason, we have
the tomb KV55 there.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.430
To find the tomb or the burial
chamber behind the burial chamber

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:08.420 position:56%
of Tutankhamun as I said is not till
now true because it could be old

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.590
so that when the architect
built the tomb of Tutankhamun,

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.830
he tried to continue with
another chamber in the north side.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.760
But, he stopped directly after
the death of King Tutankhamun

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.120
and he covered this maybe short
cave or some we don't know.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.740
If it is only this or special
room burial chamber empty space,

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.040
we don't know.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.840
We have to be sure.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:45.670
[applause]

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:55.810
