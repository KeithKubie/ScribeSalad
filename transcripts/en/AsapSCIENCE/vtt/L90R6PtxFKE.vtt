00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.460
Do you ever get the sense that rich people are more likely to be rude or self-centered?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.940
Well we decided it was time to find out whether or not rich people are actually more likely to be jerks.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.760
Ever been cut off while driving? It was more likely by a Mercedes than a 20 year old junker.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.380
Multiple studies have found that the more expensive your car is the more likely you are to not only cut in front of other vehicles

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.029
But also drive through crosswalks when a pedestrian is waiting to cross. In one study those with the most expensive cars cut pedestrians off

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.390
42% of the time. Now, imagine you waited in a line for 10 minutes to buy a coffee and a muffin at Starbucks

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
But when you're a couple of blocks away you realize that the clerk gave you change for $20 rather than for the $10 you gave him

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.480
Do you A) savour your coffee and the free $10 or B) go back and return the change?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.600
It turns out those with more money are more likely to respond that they would keep it and the amount of money you have also

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.489
Affects how much you look at people. Using Google glass to track eye movements of people in a study walking around the block

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.500
Wealthy people spend significantly less time in social gazes in other words

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.409
They're more likely to straight-up ignore other people

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.980
But certainly the rich are more generous in the poor right though the rich may cut a bigger check in the u.s.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.480
Nationwide survey data shows that the wealthy contribute a lower percentage of their household income for example a household that makes under

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.880
$25,000 in the u.s.. Donate around 4.2% of their earnings, but those making

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.299
$100,000 or more only contribute 2.7%.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.659
Even when people are arbitrarily put in charge or given power. It makes them more selfish.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.380
Imagine you're put into a group of 3 people to make some important policy recommendations and you're told you're in charge of the group.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.480
A plate of 5 yummy cookies gets put in front of you. And naturally everybody takes one. Do you take another?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.480
it turns out in studies the person in charge is most likely to take the fourth cookie while everybody leaves the last one on the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.689
Plate to be polite so our rude people just more likely to become rich

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.149
Or does being rich make you worse?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.860
counter to what we might believe people who are the most likely to gain power in a group are actually the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.540
emotionally intelligent ones who focus on others practice generosity and aren't the bullies

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.440
Studies even find that college students at the top of the social hierarchy tend to be the most

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.780
Pro-social and compassionate versus selfish it all goes back to our hunter-gatherer roots where individuals who share food and resources

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.189
Rise in ranks, but this leads to the power paradox. To gain power you need empathy

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.749
But once you feel powerful you become more self focused you can even see this in the brain when using fMRI scans

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.540
Areas like the prefrontal cortex that activate when understanding mental states or considering the thoughts of others,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.959
Show less activity in those with a higher social class

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.070
Poor people also have a greater ability to assess the emotional states of others have more interpersonal interactions greater

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.649
Eye contact head nodding and laughing compared to richer people who are more likely to self groom fidget

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.910
Or doodle one possible explanation for this is that people with less materials

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.480
Resources and privilege rely more on others to meet their needs and this creates a pressure to be more emotionally intelligent

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.839
So of course not all rich people are jerks

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.900
But in general as your wealth increases your empathy decreases making rich people

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.820
Statistically more likely to be jerks

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.260
