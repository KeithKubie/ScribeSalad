00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.486
So my name's Rif-- CEO
and founder of Foodit.

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:11.860
And Google asked
me to talk today

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.960
a bit about how we're
using their Cloud Platform.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.550
And I wanted to talk to you a
little bit about our journey,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.700
about getting to where we are
today, and about platforms,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.920
and what we're all about.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.760
And I read a book,
"Lean Startup,"

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.450
and it talked a lot
about MVPs all the time.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.409
And when I actually look back
over the last 12 months-- yes,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.670
we're going out there
trying to test our products,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.270
but also test the people and
the platform at the same time.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000
So, just my background.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.820
I was a CEO and a developer for
12 years-- a food distribution

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.070
company that sells
food to 45,000

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.890
restaurants across the UK.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.610
So I'm a bit technical.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.870
I had experiences doing
stuff, building stuff.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.354
I had a great team.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.770
But it got to a
point in my career

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.436
where I just wanted
to do something else

00:00:57.436 --> 00:01:00.650
and JJs wanted to support
me in that process.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.300
So I had already
funding, which is great.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.160
But I wanted to build something.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.820
And day one I had no team.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.389
I had no idea what
I wanted to build.

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.930
I just finished reading "Lean
Startup" and I was ready to go,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.540
I was ready to start testing.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.930
And I didn't want to do things
the way I used to do them.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.971
I didn't want to deal with
servers, and patching,

00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:21.760
and networks, and
all the other stuff.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.190
So I was trying to
figure out that, hey I've

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.320
got all this money now how am
I going to get the product out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.180
of the door as fast as
possible and start testing it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760
real restaurants.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.240
So I went out to
market and thought

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
about if I could come up
with what my MVP looked

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.875
like-- or my product
looked like-- maybe I

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.450
could go and work with a
couple different companies.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230
And I thought, well because
I've got all this money let

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.057
me try and do this
all at the same time.

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.140
And one of the other things
I did at the same time

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.240
was I used 99designs.com
to start picking logos.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.376
We got like 2,500 entries.

00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:56.750
It's once of the
nice, fun things

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.730
to do when you're
starting a startup.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.400
So that's me, I guess,
standing on the US.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.180
And we have three
development teams

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.090
in different parts
of the world building

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.097
the same minimal,
viable product.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:11.180
And we picked-- I picked
three different platforms

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.910
to do that on, to test out
three different things.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.220
The first thing while doing
this I knew after reading "Lean

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.080
Startup" is I wasn't testing how
to build a restaurant website.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.244
So Foodit was to do a whole
bunch of things of restaurants.

00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:29.910
But the main thing I
wasn't trying to do

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.220
was learn how to build
a restaurant website.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.760
What I was trying
to learn how to do

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.810
was get a restaurant website
to be found on Google as

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.540
quickly as possible,
learn if restaurants

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.710
are willing to pay
for the service,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.210
and also understand if people
would trust a restaurant

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.320
website as a place
to order food.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.610
And those are the three
things I was trying to test.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.320
So how I was going
to build the website,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.540
all those things I didn't think
was going to affect my startup.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.020
So I thought, what's the
risk of doing this three

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.240
times with three
different companies?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.990
So I found the company
to build themselves

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.170
up a product called Magento.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.306
Magento is an
e-commerce platform.

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:03.680
And I thought the
reason I'd want

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.940
to do that would
be if I could get

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.680
to use the power of Magento I
could get stuff like billing,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.890
pricing, vouchers--
and all the stuff

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.540
that a normal e-commerce
platform would have--

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.820
into my product as
quickly as possible.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.510
And the thing I
was trying to test

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.690
by building on top
of Magento was,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.610
would I get into
issues or constraints

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.700
that-- hey, I've got 200,000
restaurants across the world.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.147
Would Magento scale?

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:29.480
Would I have to do really
horrible things to the product

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.200
to make it work the way
I wanted it to work?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.600
Because Magento is typically
designed for an e-commerce site

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.030
that has just one store--
or just one web page--

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.790
not 200,000 web pages.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.410
So I found the company and
we went on this journey

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.760
to try and build up.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.120
At the same time, I'm
a big fan of Microsoft

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.530
and I wanted to see if I could
find a low-cost team in India--

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.250
or anywhere else-- that
could build on top of Azure,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.215
like some Azure platform,
to build this same product.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.440
And I was always a big fan of
Google App Engine since 2008,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.810
even though my previous
job was all Microsoft.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.410
And I wanted to see if we could
use Google App Engine, which--

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.400
just as the talk showed
before-- gives you

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.260
a lot of the tools
out of the box,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.050
preconfigured, preset,
to build what you want.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.040
And I found a team
in Australia--

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.664
who were also very much into
"Lean Startup"-- to do that.

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.330
The cool thing about
the Australian team

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.990
is they're called Three Weeks.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.698
And the reason they're
called Three Weeks

00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:30.190
is that they will get your
MVP built in three weeks time.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.900
So that set the actual pace
for the other three teams

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.920
around the world to
build the product.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.810
And the good thing was it
made me focus on those things

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.920
that I wanted to learn.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.530
Would restaurants pay for it?

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.780
Would this happen,
would that happen?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.460
And not focus on which
database I'm going to pick

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.590
and which Memcache served
them, which RESTful API,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.590
and how are we going to
lay out the load balancers.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.350
In my previous role
as a CIO I found

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.270
that we would waste
huge amounts of time

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.007
debating pros, and cons, and ifs
for the future 12, 24 months.

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:03.840
And when you're in an
enterprise environment

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.240
you have that luxury.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.410
And when you're in a
position where you already

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.100
have like 200 million
pounds worth of orders

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.610
going through a
platform then you

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.990
have to debate
stuff to make sure

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.640
that you don't just
break it the next day.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.832
But I didn't want to get
back into that world.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.290
So I really want to something
like Google App Engine, which

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.210
says this is the database
you're going to use,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.020
this is how you're
going to build stuff.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.830
You have a certain amount
of choice and flexibility

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.270
but you're going to remove
that away from the developer.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.920
Otherwise you could
spend a little time

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.570
fighting and arguing about
what is the best choice.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.250
But the reality is
that's probably not

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.390
going to make you win or
lose the startup you're

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.610
trying to build.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.560
You have a bunch of
things you need to learn,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.018
and unless your
startup is actually

00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.762
building a platform
for developers

00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:44.220
you probably want
to focus on, what

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.220
is the thing I need to
learn and which platform

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.230
is going to get me there
as quickly as possible.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.750
So I went out there
and tried those three

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.780
different platforms.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.920
Magento, it was just
too much for me.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.670
I had to break it too much to
make it work for my startup.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.650
And I felt like within
a couple of months

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.690
I would be rewriting
everything again.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.740
So it didn't work.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.577
But it would have given
us a lot of features

00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:07.910
as quickly as possible-- good
lot of features as quickly

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.410
as possible.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.300
But 12 months past that now
I've still not used any of those

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.810
features in my startup.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.320
So they would have
been redundant.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.236
And everything that I've
needed has been stuff

00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:19.510
that we had to build
in a custom way.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.370
The Azure team-- Azure
as a platform was great.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.230
But the team itself,
they were just too much--

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.194
too developer-focused.

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:28.360
They needed to take too
much of my time and too much

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.439
specifications.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.230
And the team in Australia,
those developers

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.480
are willing to go out to see
restaurants and get feedback,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.650
and I needed to spend
little time with them.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.340
And the thing I liked
about App Engine

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.680
was that there was a
preset way of doing things.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.810
So that as I moved that team
from using an external company

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.650
in-house-- those
developers-- there's

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.597
a set way of using
Google BigQuery,

00:06:49.597 --> 00:06:51.430
there's a set way of
using Google Datastore,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.680
and there's a set pattern.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.560
So this team in Australia
is not deciding,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.920
oh were going to have 20 servers
doing this and 10 servers

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.420
doing that.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.670
They just write the code.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.730
And Google App Engine deals
with how many boxes are needed

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.320
and the pattern.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.030
of doing it.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.080
So in summary, food is yummy.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.900
I would argue that if you
look at Myspace and Facebook--

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.750
one was written in Coldfusion,
one was written in PHP.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.980
Did it matter to the success or
the failures of either company?

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.072
I would always, always
say, look at your start up.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.280
What are you trying to build?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.290
What are you trying to learn?

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.240
And how much
technology is a factor

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.450
for if you're going
to win or lose?

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.030
So today we're talking
about some web platforms.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.830
But part of our
technology is running

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.340
a printer in the
kitchen of restaurants.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.090
And we picked Android to do that
because Android-- unlike iOS--

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.800
allows you to control the
USB port of the device.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.220
So I can plug a printer in
without using Bluetooth.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.890
So I could not do that on iOS.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.890
So look at the thing
you're trying to build.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.220
I would say if you want
to build something that's

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.296
very heavy orientated
to Facebook,

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:01.670
or if you want to
build something

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.400
for people that use
Microsoft Office,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.066
there might be other
platforms out there

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:09.520
that have features that might
work better for your startup.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.031
Do you need low-level access
to your operating system?

00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:13.530
If you're not
developers yourselves,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.946
you're going to
have a hard time--

00:08:14.946 --> 00:08:17.580
or an enjoyable time--
trying to figure out

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.984
is what your developer
saying actually important.

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:21.900
Like they're saying, oh
we should use MongoDB,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.566
or we should use this
or we should that,

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:26.054
and it's going to make it
great because xx,y, and zed.

00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:27.720
But is that what
you're trying to learn?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.380
So try and stay focused on
what's important to be learned.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.929
And if your developer
feels comfortable

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.590
building fast on this platform
then maybe go down that route.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.460
Trying to get them to switch
something and learn something

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.879
new might take more time.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.420
Do you trust what
you're building on?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.000
There's hundreds and
hundreds of platforms

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.445
to build out there on.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.570
If one of them just goes
bankrupt tomorrow than you

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.790
might have a hard time.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.030
So I trust the Google App Engine
is going to be there tomorrow.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.280
I trust that Google is going
to keep developing on it,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.905
and building it, and
making it better--

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.920
which they have
proven to have done.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.600
And just stay focused on
what you're trying to learn.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.830
And make sure that the
platform you picked

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.124
is aligned with those things.

00:09:09.124 --> 00:09:11.290
I'm going to be around here
for the rest of the day.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.450
I'm also a Google Developer
Expert for Cloud,--

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.380
like Steve-- for Maps.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.980
And that's it.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.480
Thank you.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.430
