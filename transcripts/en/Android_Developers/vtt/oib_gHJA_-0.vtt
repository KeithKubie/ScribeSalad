00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.220
TOM GRINSTED: My name is Tom.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.870
I'm product manager on
the Google Play Console.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.440
And I'm joined onstage by
my good friend, Tamzin--

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.300
she is head of
Business Development

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.350
for Western Europe--

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.440
and also, Dario, who is a
lead engineer on the Console

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920
as well.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.360
Now, the three of
us represent teams

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.730
who really have only one job.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.290
And that job is to build
products to help people

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.360
just like you build better apps,
better games and, ultimately,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.770
better businesses on Android
and with Google Play.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.740
That's what we and our teams
think about, literally,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.520
every day.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.850
I think it's worth
saying what that actually

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.460
looks like for a second.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.471
At its heart, what it looks like
is talking to people like you--

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.970
find out what your needs are,
find out what kind of insights

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.210
you want, take it
back to the teams,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.709
and then pausing over
3 billion events a day

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.786
that are generated
by Google Play,

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:08.410
and turning all of
these events and all

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.990
of this amazing data into
metrics, insights, and tools

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
that you can use to
make better decisions.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.460
Because at the
heart of the job--

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.250
and what all of you do
on a day-to-day basis

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090
is make loads and loads of
decisions about your business,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.790
about your acquisition,
about your development,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.720
and about your
product road maps.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.470
And it's our job to get you
the information you need

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.550
to make those decisions well.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.330
Because a good
decision is founded

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.540
on good insights and good data.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.882
This is a really big job.

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:43.090
The 3 billion should give
you a good idea about that.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.460
But there are loads and
loads of different ways

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.470
you can go about it
and loads of ways

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770
you can think about it as well.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.640
Now, I'm sure all of
you in your companies

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.710
think about this kind
of challenge every day.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.230
And you'll have your own
unique ways to do it.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.960
Now, the way that Tamzin,
Dario, and I think about it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.050
is around a mental model
of a user lifecycle.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.720
It's probably quite
familiar to a few of you.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.340
Now, the user lifecycle starts
with discovery and acquisition.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.169
The first phase of
building a business

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.450
and getting a user
onto your app or game

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.259
is to get them aware of
you in the first place.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.550
Discovery and acquisition is
all about getting in front

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.520
of the user, persuading them
that you've got a really

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.130
interesting game or app-- that
you've got a really interesting

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.080
product they want to use--

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.020
and eventually persuading
them to tap on that button--

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.660
and installing it.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.535
After the install, I feel,
is where the fun begins.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:35.910
Because after the
install you get

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.471
engagement and monetization.

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:38.970
This is where people
are coming back

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.580
to your products every day.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.560
They're opening them.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.570
They're loving them.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.153
They're loving all the work that
you and your teams have done.

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:47.460
And hopefully, they're
also paying you as well.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.530
You're monetizing.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.840
It would be great if this
were the end of the story,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520
if everybody you acquired
just used you again and again

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.860
and again, and that was it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.480
But unfortunately, it's not.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.940
Because very often, for almost
every user at some point

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.090
in the user lifecycle,
there's also the uninstall,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.160
the point where someone--
for whatever reason--

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.590
decides to remove you from
their phone or tablet.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710
And then they
become a lost user.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.660
It would be really sad if
this was the end of the story

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.750
as well.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.820
But increasingly,
the user lifecycle

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.895
ends like this, with persuading
people to come back again,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.710
persuading them to give you
a second or a third chance,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.960
telling them about the
wonderful new features you have

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.890
that they want to try again.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.650
This, as a sketch, is
how us and our teams

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.696
think about the
challenge in front of us.

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:34.070
How do we get you
the information

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.580
you need to be able to
optimize each parts of this?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.320
As a sketch, it's
also very simple.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.990
And it's worth saying that there
are also quite negative parts

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.340
of it as well.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.920
So for every person
who discovers you,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.930
there's somebody who
doesn't come across you,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.720
who doesn't find you.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.040
And for every person who
finds you and installs you,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.200
there's another who--
for whatever reason--

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.300
choose not to install.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.390
And even after that, for every
person who becomes engaged,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.850
there's another who installs
you and doesn't use you

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.270
all the time or someone who
does but, eventually, doesn't

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.920
monetize.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.140
And then, lastly,
for everybody who

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.850
you lose but choose
to come back,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.180
there's another one who is
not convinced to give you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.730
a second chance.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.670
Now, the way to win
at this game, the way

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.130
to really optimize
your business,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.210
is to minimize all of the bad
parts of the user lifecycle

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.480
and maximize all
of the good parts.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.580
And that's what us
and our teams do.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.830
We build tools and
insights to help

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.760
you make decisions to
maximize the good parts

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.801
and minimize the bad parts.

00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:40.550
Now, the reason the
three of us are really

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
excited to be here today
and to talk to all of you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.850
is because, over the last
year, since the last I/O,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.380
our teams have been building
successively more tools, more

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.760
insights, and more
metrics to help

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.930
you build more
successful businesses

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.170
on Play and on Android.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.390
And that's what we're going
to talk about today, some

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.580
of the exciting launches
we've made recently,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.220
that we made this week,
and that are coming up,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.430
to help you optimize
your user lifecycles.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.400
So without further
ado, we're going

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.644
to start at the beginning
of the user lifecycle.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:14.810
We're going to start with
discovery and acquisition.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.930
And for that, I'm really
happy to welcome Tamzin.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.910
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Thanks, Tom.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.270
Hi, everyone.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.610
My name is Tamzin Taylor.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.560
And I work in the
Business Development

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.990
Team for Western Europe.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.777
Now, sorry, guys.

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:30.860
But I think I'm actually
the luckiest person here,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.610
because I get paid to work with
developers just like yourselves

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.110
every day.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.960
I get to help them understand
their businesses better, help

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.410
them identify opportunities
and improve their business.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.180
In a way, as a former
product manager,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.150
I'm living vicariously
through their success.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.990
But one thing which often
comes up with these partners

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.090
is the same question--

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.760
how can I improve
my discoverability?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.935
How can I get in
front of more users?

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:01.010
And how can I stand
out from the crowd?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.290
In a nutshell, how can
I get more installs?

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.400
Does this sound like something
you're interested in?

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.260
Excellent-- lots of
nodding of heads.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.510
Well, you're in the right
spot because, in the next 15

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.330
minutes, I'm going to
cover some of the things

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.520
that we're doing
to make or maximize

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.840
your opportunities to be found.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.920
And I'm going to go deeper
to help you understand

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.594
how your different user
acquisition channels

00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:26.510
are making a contribution
to your bottom line.

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:30.650
Now, if everyone
watched the keynote,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.650
you would have heard
David Burke talk about how

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.480
Android has billions of users.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.320
What you might not know
is, in the last 12 months,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.360
the number of Android
users who downloaded

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.642
a game more than doubled.

00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:44.620
And so what?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.620
What does this mean for you?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.090
It means there's a huge
potential demand for your app

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.360
or game.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.280
The question is, how do you
get in front of those users?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.470
So we've been
working really hard

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.870
to make your app even more
discoverable and accessible.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.860
Now, when we think
about installs,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.090
you might think about loading
your app into the Play Store

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.120
once it's in production
and hoping for the best.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.370
Well, what if users could
download your app or game

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.580
while you were
still building it?

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.490
What if users could tell
you that they really

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.060
wanted to download your app
or game that didn't currently

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.874
exist in the Play Store?

00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:29.540
Well, we're working
on a couple of tools

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.980
to answer these questions.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.110
The first is Early Access.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.860
So Early Access is a
collection in the Play

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.080
Store of brand new Android
titles running open beta.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.410
Those billions of users
I spoke about earlier--

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.822
they can all download apps and
games from this collection.

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:49.280
And the great news
is that they can

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.880
give private and actionable
feedback to the developer

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.470
before you go live.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.300
So you can really
tweak and optimize

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.810
your app to really maximize
your chance of success

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.430
when you do go live.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.340
The second is Pre-Registration.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.130
With Pre-Registration, you
can put your app or game

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.990
into the Play Store.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.090
But instead of the
Install button,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.572
it has a
Pre-Registration button.

00:08:14.572 --> 00:08:15.530
Now, this is fantastic.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.080
Because that means
users can opt in

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.440
to have you tell them when your
app or game is ready and goes

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.870
into production.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.950
So it's Pre-Registration.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.950
We're helping support your
efforts to start marketing

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.290
before you even go live.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.789
And it's been instrumental
for top publishers like Rovio,

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.929
who've been able to
get their fans really

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.890
excited about an
upcoming release.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.690
Now, if any of you were
here last year at I/O,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.960
you might recall, we
launched Instant Apps.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.760
Instant Apps help
get your app in front

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.130
of people in more
places, more quickly,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.920
and with less friction.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.990
In March, at the Game
Developer Conference,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.330
we launched Google Play Instant.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.670
So Google Play Instant--

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.320
where users see
Google Play Instant,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.680
they can download or
access your Instant App,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.350
whether it's the Try
Now on the Play Store,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.110
through browsing,
searching, or--

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.790
ah!

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.540
Thanks, Tom.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.040
Candy Crush Saga--

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.480
I'll try that in a second.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.320
So with Google Play Instant,
you can just tap and try a game

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.330
without having to install
the entire package.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.750
So whether you're looking
to storm a castle with Clash

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.350
Royale or become a word master
with Words with Friends 2,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.360
it's just a really
great way to help

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.660
users try your app or game
without the full commitment

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.610
of downloading it.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.200
So in this way, we're trying
to help your accessibility

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.300
and your discoverability.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.220
And it really worked
for Hothead Games.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.300
They actually saw a 19% lift
in the number of acquisitions

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.110
after launching with
Google Play Instant.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.000
So you can see, we're
really trying hard

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.360
to make it easier for users
to try before they buy,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.300
improve your discoverability
and your accessibility.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.162
But that's all well and good.

00:10:05.162 --> 00:10:06.370
And you're in the right room.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.494
And we might be bit biased.

00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:11.710
But we think you can only
manage what you measure, which

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.500
is why to support the launch
of Google Play Instant

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.450
and to help you understand
the contribution

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.200
that this marketing channel
is having to your bottom line,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.020
we're really proud to announce
brand new stats in the Play

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.840
Console, to help you measure
the success of your Instant App.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.740
Feedback from developers
has been fantastic.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.990
But we did get some messages
that you wanted the stats

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.470
to be more easily discoverable.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.084
So we've put them front and
center in the Play Console.

00:10:40.084 --> 00:10:41.500
And so now, you
can see the number

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.990
of launches and conversions
that your Instant App has had.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.190
What's a conversion?

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.110
A conversion are
the number of times

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.110
a user who's launched
the Instant App then

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.370
goes on to download it.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.189
And because the stats
are in the Play Console--

00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:00.730
if you love playing
with data, you'll

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.430
love this-- it means
you can slice and dice

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.470
this information with
your other key metrics,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.810
like installs and revenue.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.180
So it's pretty exciting.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.870
So you can now easily track
the success of your Instant App

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.090
on your overall growth.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.280
And today, I'm really excited to
announce brand new capabilities

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.900
in this reporting.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.170
You can now track which
products-- across browsers,

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.565
Search, and Play Store-- are
driving most of your Instant

00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:30.135
App success.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.190
So you've got Instant Apps.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.380
And now you've got the
fantastic reporting.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.444
Go ahead and use it.

00:11:39.444 --> 00:11:40.860
Now, there is so
much more you can

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.590
do to increase your
discoverability on Android.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.450
But I'm going to stop there and
say, if you want to learn more,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.282
there's an AdWords session
on the amphitheater stage

00:11:49.282 --> 00:11:49.990
right after this.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.360
So I think you'll all
agree that not all

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.360
acquired users are the same.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.820
It's really important to
acquire the right user

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.460
for your business,
the one that's

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.810
going to stick around
for a long time,

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.530
the one who's going to spend
a lot of time in the app,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.010
and maybe the one who's going
to share your app with lots

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.220
of friends and spend money.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.540
So it's really important
to capture the right users

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.840
for your business.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.170
But how do you
know whether you're

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.990
attracting the right users?

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.970
How do you know whether you're
spending your time, money,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.190
and resources in the right
places to attract those users?

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.710
And once you've
got the users, how

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.320
do you know that you're
actually doing a good job?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.540
How do you know you're
delivering them value?

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.640
And where can you improve?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.160
These questions sound familiar?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.310
I hope so.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.970
Because the great news
is, we have some updates

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.220
to the Acquisition
reports that will

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.130
help answer these questions.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.200
They'll help you
interrogate, understand,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.969
and optimize your user
acquisition strategies

00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:01.010
to help your bottom line.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.810
So let's take a look.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.810
So when we think
about these updates

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.060
to the Acquisition
reports, we've

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.550
really tackled the
three core questions

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:16.040
that both myself, Tom, and Dario
hear from developers every day.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.540
And I know some of
you have asked me

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.930
these questions quite a lot.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.280
So the first one is, how do
people find my app or game

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.520
on the Play Store?

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.080
How valuable are
the users that I

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.640
acquire through different
marketing channels?

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.810
And how am I doing?

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.010
Can I improve?

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.420
So let's tackle the first one.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.950
How do people find my app
or game in the Play Store?

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.260
Now, I know I've got some
partners in the audience who

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.040
I've worked with quite a lot.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.020
And one of the questions I get
about this User Acquisition

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.370
report is, hey, Tamzin,
you know that line

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.200
that says "organic traffic"?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.987
What is that?

00:13:55.987 --> 00:13:56.820
Who are these users?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.920
Where are they coming from?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.760
Now, organic traffic-- people
who've come to your store

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.460
listing page not
through deep links--

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.220
but they might be
browsing the Play Store,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.660
checking out Collections,
seeing new games and apps.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.210
Or they might be looking
for a specific use case.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.380
Like, Tom here might be looking
for apps with museum guides.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.971
So we understand that this
is a really important channel

00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:24.470
for you.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.720
And for the majority
of you, it makes up

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.770
the lion's share of visitors
to your store listing page.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.000
We also understand that
at-store optimization

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.810
is really important.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.430
But developers like
you haven't been

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.920
able to do much with
this information to date.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.049
It's nice to see,
but you don't really

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:43.340
know where they're coming from.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.840
And you can't really
optimize for it, until now.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.540
So in response to
all your requests,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.170
I'm super excited to announce
the launch of Organic

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.780
Breakdowns in the User
Acquisition report

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.930
in the Play Console.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:01.794 --> 00:15:02.730
Yay!

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.680
Well done.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.220
So now, you can see, for
users who've never installed

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.940
your app before, which ones are
coming from browsing the store

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.970
and which ones are searching.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.910
Now, just imagine how
your growth or marketing

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.630
teams can leverage this
data to better present

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.628
your app or game.

00:15:22.628 --> 00:15:23.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:23.504 --> 00:15:26.045
TAMZIN TAYLOR: In fact, Scopely
found the breakdown gave them

00:15:26.045 --> 00:15:28.670
the ability to focus on
the acquisition areas that

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.200
mattered.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.300
So what does this mean?

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.410
OK, well, let's take an example.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.270
Let's say you all, after
this, open your laptops--

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.630
not now, I'm speaking.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.180
And you go to the User
Acquisition report.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.710
And you click on this Breakdown.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.450
And you say, oh my god!

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.110
90% of my organic traffic
is coming from browse.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.487
What should I be doing?

00:15:49.487 --> 00:15:52.070
Well, you could probably imagine
that some of these people who

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.486
are coming from
browsing might not

00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:56.650
be familiar with your brand,
your value proposition,

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.469
or what makes you different
from your competition.

00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:01.010
So there's a great
opportunity there,

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.652
once you know this, to
optimize your store listing.

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:07.350
I'll talk more about
that in just a second.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.900
The other great
news with this data

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.270
is that we've extended it
so you can track the users

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.860
across the whole funnel--

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.730
across subscriptions, buyers,
and retained installers.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.530
So this really gives
you more insights

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.220
into how those two channels
are driving traffic

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.460
and what kind of users they are.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.470
And it gets even better.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.830
And if you're a marketing
person in the room,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.660
I think you'll be super
excited about this.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.770
You can now click
through and see

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.550
which search terms are driving
the most visitors to your store

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.654
listing and which convert best.

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:45.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.419
So that is super exciting.

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:54.460
It's a view into the Play
Store which we've never

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.630
been able to share before.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.910
And it's something
you've asked us for--

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.340
let me think-- at least
3 and 1/2 years that I've

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.650
been working in this team.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.160
So thank you to the
guys who built it.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.579
And I really hope you find
it useful because, certainly,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.176
our other pilot partners have.

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:11.050
One thing we try and do
with this information

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.510
we share with you is
make it actionable

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.180
and give you insights that
help you make better decisions,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.619
as Tom mentioned earlier.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.359
So we were really
happy to get feedback

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.000
from Fun Games for Free
about the relevance

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.419
of the long tail searches.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.960
And what I love to
hear from Evernote

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.950
is how they found their
data really actionable.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.790
Because again, we
want to give you

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.550
data that's going to help
you make better decisions

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.790
to grow your business on Play.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.810
So developers said that
they loved this new feature.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.630
And because we tested it
with quite a few partners,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.640
I thought, given that
you're here today

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.110
and made the effort
to come along,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.234
I'd share with you some of
the things which they're

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.100
going to use this
information for,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.650
in case it sparks some
ideas in your own head.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.650
So the majority of the
developers we tested with

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.750
said they would use
this data to evaluate

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.266
their user-acquisition
strategies.

00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:03.765
A lot of them said they would
use it to optimize their store

00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:04.630
listing--

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.690
so changing their descriptions,
their screenshots.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.720
And some even said they would
redesign their on-boarding flow

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.220
so that the features, benefits,
and whatever else people are

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.850
searching for are reflected
in that first-time user

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.780
experience, to make it even
more relevant for that person

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.067
when they install the app.

00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:30.650
So we're really pleased that our
developers found this useful.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.540
And I hope you will as well.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.670
And I hope that
answers your question,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:40.080
how do people find my app
or game in the Play Store?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.580
Now, the marketeers in
the room might have found

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.550
that to be super exciting.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.900
But the next part's my favorite.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.840
So if you care about
paying people on time,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.970
if you care about
running a good business,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.290
if you're a CFO or
a product manager,

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.119
you probably care about
acquiring valuable users.

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:01.535
Which is why we'll tackle the
next question-- how valuable

00:19:01.535 --> 00:19:05.120
are the users that I'm acquiring
through different marketing

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.304
channels?

00:19:07.304 --> 00:19:09.470
Now, a lot of the developers
I speak to tell me they

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.230
love the User
Acquisition report.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.610
But installs are only
part of the story.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.670
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.840
They tell me that retention,
purchases, and subscriptions

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.440
are leading critical indicators
of that one metric you

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.020
all care about--

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.970
revenue.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.840
So today, we're launching a
brand new item in the Buyer

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.440
Acquisition report--

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.670
ARPU, Average Revenue Per User.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.460
So now, you can see exactly how
much average revenue per user

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.602
you're getting from
different marketing channels.

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.560
And that includes the
organic traffic breakdown

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.350
I spoke about earlier,
Google Search,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.060
and third-party traffic.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.950
So if you're
responsible for setting

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.020
the user-acquisition
strategies in your business,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.300
or you're responsible
for making sure you have

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.000
a profitable company,
this information

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.440
will help you make
the right decisions.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.710
So no matter whether you're
running a classical CPM

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.090
model, Cost-per-Install
model, or you're driving value

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.790
further down the
funnel, we really

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.940
think this information will
help you evaluate your existing

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.650
strategies and make better
decisions moving forward.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.487
Now, lastly on acquisition--

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.570
I know there's a few of
you in the room who always

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.480
say to me, hey, Tamzin,
how am I performing

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.510
against my competition?

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.290
How can I do better?

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.560
How can I improve?

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.850
Now, benchmarks are
really important.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.650
And we totally
understand they're really

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.310
valuable to help you identify
where the room for opportunity

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.940
is versus the market and where
you're already smashing it out

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.650
of the park and
doing a great job.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.620
In other words,
benchmarks are great,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.574
because they can help
you focus your investment

00:20:57.574 --> 00:20:59.615
on the items which will
give you the best return.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.650
So for all these
reasons, we were

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.160
really happy a month ago to
launch the Retained Installers

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.470
benchmarks in the User
Acquisition funnel.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.250
So now, for all
organic traffic, you

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.650
can easily see, throughout
the user journey,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.930
from in-store
conversion all the way

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.680
through to 30-day retention,
exactly where the opportunities

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.790
are for you to improve or
where the efforts you've had

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.396
have really paid off.

00:21:28.396 --> 00:21:30.020
And we've got a lot
of happy developers

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.250
who've tested this with
us, including Intuit

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.030
and Not Doppler, who've
used it to really tweak

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.730
their conversion and
get improvements there

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.800
or, in the case of Not
Doppler, finding out

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.960
that, actually, all the
efforts that they put in

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.120
have really paid off.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.620
One thing I mentioned
earlier that I

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.510
love about this feature and all
these User Acquisition reports

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.250
is that they're not
just here to tell you

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.291
where you're going wrong.

00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:57.280
They're here to give
you a reference point

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.760
and give you confidence in
your decision-making, which

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.730
is why I was really happy to
see the quote from Playdots, who

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.670
told us that they love the extra
validation and confidence they

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.872
get on their own
decision-making.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.260
So the new tools that
we've launched help you get

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.640
discovered.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.860
Instant Apps and
Pre-Registration

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.640
get your apps in front of
users like never before.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.122
And if you talk
to us, we'll say,

00:22:22.122 --> 00:22:23.580
the most important
thing about this

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.920
is we've launched new reporting
to help you optimize for it.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.610
Updates to the User
Acquisition reports

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.080
give you the data
that you've never

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.270
had before to make
much better informed

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.530
decisions around your app store
optimization, your acquisition

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.710
investment, and to really
help you drive and acquire

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.970
more valuable users.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.630
Right-- so now you
have the right users.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.330
But how are you going
to keep them engaged?

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.850
And how are you going
to monetize them?

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.710
Well for this exciting
part of the talk,

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.365
let me hand over to my
esteemed colleague, Dario.

00:22:58.365 --> 00:22:59.928
DARIO FRENI: Thanks, Tamzin.

00:22:59.928 --> 00:23:01.332
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:02.268 --> 00:23:04.850
It's great to be here.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.700
So new tools help
you get discovered.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.420
And the acquisition
insights help

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.360
you find and acquire more
and more valuable users.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.900
But what about helping you
in the next stage of the user

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.390
lifecycle journey, like
engagement or monetization?

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.710
How can we help you engage your
user more and earn more money

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.850
from them?

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.980
I'm glad to say that
we have some new tools

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.780
to help with that.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.200
So first off,
earlier this year, we

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.320
launched the Events timeline.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.620
The Events timeline gives you
contextual information close

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.980
to Charts in the
statistics page,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.010
in the Android Vitals dashboard,
in the Subscription dashboard,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.740
and other Chart surfaces
on the Play Console,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.590
showing you key events
that may affect your apps,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.030
such as-- for example--

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.820
the rolling out
of a new release.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.940
This way, you can quickly spot
correlations between changes

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.020
in metrics and such key events.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.750
For example, you can
understand whether a changing

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.340
average rating correlates with
a rollout of a new release

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.920
or whether a price
change is affecting

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.650
and how it's affecting the
average revenue-per-user.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.060
Or if you use Instant App--

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.100
if an Instant App
configuration change,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.770
such as mobile holdback,
is affecting your sessions

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.700
positively or negatively.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.310
Early adopters of these
features loved it.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.900
One developer in
particular told us

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.350
that they were able
to quickly understand

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.160
why a certain metric spiked
in a certain country.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.030
So the Events timeline helps
you solving these mysteries

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.550
quicker, without having to
dig into other dashboard

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.660
or other data.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.200
Once you have
acquired your user,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.090
you might want to
check how users

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.923
are engaging with your app.

00:24:52.923 --> 00:24:57.940
Firebase offers great tools
specifically for this purpose.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.140
In particular, Google
Analytics for Firebase

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.910
can be enabled just by linking
the analytics SDK to your app

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.920
and signing up to the
service, of course.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.830
And out of the box, it
will give you, already,

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.380
meaningful metrics about
engagement and retention

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.670
of the users.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.410
What's also
interesting is that you

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.900
can instrument your app,
instrument your code

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.010
to track the features that
matter the most to your app.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.700
Another really cool feature
that the Firebase team

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.800
launched earlier this year
is Firebase Predictions.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.100
Firebase Predictions
uses data coming

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.650
from analytics and our
machine-learning knowledge

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.990
and tools to give
you predictions

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:41.960
about how your users are
going to behave in your app.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.160
And like Google Analytics, just
by enabling, out of the box,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.560
you will get predictions about
a user's spend and user churn.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.930
And you can take some
actions on these predictions.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.180
And similarly, you can
also instrument your app

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.510
to get more personalized
prediction that you care about.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.260
If you want to learn more about
Google Analytics for Firebase,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.090
you can check out the session
later today on stage 6.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:10.244
So our friends Steve, Mai, and
Russ from the Firebase team

00:26:10.244 --> 00:26:12.410
will present the latest
features of Google Analytics

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.720
for Firebase.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.597
There is an entire truck
for Firebase tools.

00:26:15.597 --> 00:26:17.930
So I encourage you to check
it out if you're interested.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.120
In particular, for
Firebase Prediction,

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.740
there were two
sessions yesterday

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.300
that, in case you've
missed, they are already

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.174
available on YouTube.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.440
Right-- so the Events
timeline gives you key events

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.400
and lets you correlate
them with your metrics.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.130
Firebase gives you insight
and machine-learning

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.330
driven predictions about
behavior of your user.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.180
Let's dive more now into
the monetization phase

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.809
which, after all, is probably
the most critical phase,

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:46.100
because it's where you earn
the money and your business

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.450
actually starts succeeding.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.550
We've done a lot
of work recently,

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.120
especially on subscriptions.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.040
So I'm going to
present the latest

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.790
things that we launched there.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.140
Last year, at I/O, we launched
the Subscription dashboard.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.170
Loads of developers use
the Subscription dashboard

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.740
on a regular basis.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.980
We are, in fact, really
proud that the majority

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.590
of top-earning
subscription businesses

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.890
actually use this dashboard
on a regular basis, too.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.820
But we heard that
you wanted more.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.840
So this is why, yesterday, we
launched additional features

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.430
in their Retention and in
the Cancellation reports.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.430
Let's take a quick look.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.860
So in the new
Retention report, we

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.240
have re-designed it to make it
super easy to compare cohorts;

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.210
evaluate key features,
like free trials;

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.370
and also track the data
that are important to you,

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.400
like renewals.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.180
The new Cohort selector allows
you to pick groups of users,

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:52.040
selecting them by SKUs,
date, and/or country.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.340
So you can really concentrate
on a group of subscribers

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.730
and analyze their performance.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.490
For example, you can pick
SKU with a free trial

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.380
and compare it with an SKU
with an introductory price

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.300
and see which one
of the two earns you

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.400
more revenue over time.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.805
Or you can also focus on last
year's big marketing push

00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:12.680
and compare it with this
year's and see which

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.730
one performed better for you.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.290
Advanced Cohort
Comparison enables

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.740
you to explore all of
these kind of intricacies.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.740
That's not all, though.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.790
We've extracted key
data that we know

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.280
you're interested in to
make it easier than ever

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.240
to track conversion.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.460
Because conversion-- that's
actually what matters to you.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.480
So free trial success
rate and other information

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.110
about performance are
available right there

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.850
on the Subscription dashboard.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.450
And because you know that
subscription businesses live

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.880
on repeated payments,
we also tell you,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.070
for each cohort
you selected, which

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.630
billing periods they reach.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.290
On today-- Cancellation report.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.800
We also made major
updates there to help you

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.530
reduce your subscription churn.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.390
So users can cancel
for many reasons.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.640
And we extracted the
key technical ones out.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.160
But as we announced yesterday,
we now show the users a survey

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.010
when they cancel, so
that they can explain why

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.204
they're cancelling.

00:29:16.204 --> 00:29:17.620
And the results
of this survey are

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.660
available on the
Subscription dashboard.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.970
So you will have more
qualitative insights

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.950
directly from the
users about why

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.390
they are canceling their
subscription with your service.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.700
Lastly, we're reporting
on win-back features,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.097
like Account Hold and Grace
Period which, by the way,

00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:36.930
you should check out
if you haven't already.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.810
Because we heard from
developers that it really helped

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:46.030
them and increased their
retention of their subscribers.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.700
So these major updates help
your subscription businesses,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.710
like hopefully some of
you here in the audience,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.360
to better understand
and optimize

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.480
monetization, such a key
part of the user lifecycle.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.790
There was a session
yesterday by our friends

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:07.890
Larry, Angela, and Nico about
the newest advanced Google Play

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.790
features for subscriptions,
specifically.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.670
So if you are
interested, you might

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.650
want to check that
as well on YouTube.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.156
So lastly, as Tom
introduced at the beginning,

00:30:20.156 --> 00:30:21.905
the last two phases
of the user lifecycles

00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:24.980
are uninstall and win-back.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.320
Play Console provides you
with reports about uninstall.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.090
So for example, daily uninstall
metrics or the uninstall events

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:33.870
metrics.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.210
Or the Retained Installers
acquisition report,

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.800
in which you can check how long
users keep your app installed

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.120
before uninstalling.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.764
But we heard you want more.

00:30:43.764 --> 00:30:44.680
And we understand why.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.660
Because this is such
a critical phase,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.050
especially as your
business grows.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.860
And also, we don't have
enough information for you,

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.250
at the moment, for win-back.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.460
So I'm happy to say that we are
working hard on this aspect.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.850
And we will introduce,
later this year,

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.020
some more [INAUDIBLE]
specifically

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.500
for these steps of the
user lifecycle journey.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.350
So for example, you
will be able to analyze

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.600
how many unique users
are uninstalling

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.960
your app over a certain
selected time period

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.810
and also how many users are
installing your app again,

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.880
after having uninstalled it
at some point in the past.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.590
So stay tuned for more updates.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.230
So this concludes our
overviews of how Play Console

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.250
and Firebase can help you
analyzing your user lifecycle

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.980
journey.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.940
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.984
And now, back to Tom.

00:31:31.984 --> 00:31:33.150
TOM GRINSTED: Thanks, Dario.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.640
Hello, again.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.210
So as Dario and Tamzin
shared, the teams

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.240
have been working really hard
to build more tools, more

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.990
insights, and more metrics to
help you run better businesses,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.210
build larger apps,
and have happier

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.330
and larger number of gamers.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.250
All of this work, I
think it's fair to say,

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.780
we're extremely proud of--

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.420
deeply proud of the
teams who delivered it.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.500
But all of this work also, in
some ways, causes a problem.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.070
Because we also understand that
all of you are really busy.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.340
You've got so many tools, both
provided by us and others.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.210
There are loads of
different places you can go

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.700
and loads and loads
of calls on your time.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.050
We understand that you're busy.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.466
And we understand
that you need it

00:32:20.466 --> 00:32:23.335
to be easy to see what the
Console has to offer you

00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:26.850
and what's important and
what can be passed over.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.860
We understand this problem.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.170
That's why I'm really happy
to say that yesterday we

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.790
launched the new Apps dashboard
in the Google Play Console.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.360
Let's take a really quick
look at what it's like.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.240
The Apps dashboard
is the landing page.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.870
You sign into the Console.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.140
You land here if
you select an app.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.290
It gives you an overview
of all of your key data.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.050
Now, previously, there
wasn't quite enough data.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.550
We heard that from all of you.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.320
And it wasn't really
well-organized.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.260
And we've changed all of that.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.010
To start with, we've introduced
really, really easy-to-see

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.339
trending information.

00:33:03.339 --> 00:33:05.130
So if you want to know
if your installs are

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.660
moving in the right
direction, it's

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.361
now super easy to see that.

00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.985
If you want to take
a quick look to see

00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:11.776
if your technical
performance is going well

00:33:11.776 --> 00:33:14.100
and your crashes are reducing,
you can see that really

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.630
easily as well.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.640
So trends-- first thing--

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.080
really easy to glance at.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.770
Secondly, we understand
and we heard from you

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.380
that a lot of data
belongs together.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.750
Installs and uninstalls
should be displayed together.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.210
You might want to take a look
at your revenue and your RPU

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.040
at the same time.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.410
To answer that challenge, we've
sectionalized the dashboard.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.680
We've added a load
more information.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.880
But we've also put
it into context.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.360
So if any of the questions
down the left-hand side

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.280
of the screens feel
familiar, these

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.320
are the questions the
dashboard specifically

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.650
asks and specifically answers.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.350
Now, I'm sure that many of you
are reading these and thinking,

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.400
you know what?

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.140
That one's really
important to me.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.010
I don't know--

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.090
I'm a QA.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.490
And I really, really
want to understand

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.410
what people think of
my app through reviews

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.260
and how my technical performance
with [INAUDIBLE] is going.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.170
But maybe you care slightly less
about how your preregistration

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.310
campaign is going.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.299
Or maybe, on a day-to-day basis,
you don't look at revenue.

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:13.590
We understand that having
all of this on your dashboard

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.730
is sometimes overwhelming.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.980
And sometimes,
frankly, not all of it

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.350
is relevant to all of you.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.800
That's why the new dashboard
is also customizable.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.409
Because every section you
see on the dashboard can now

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.020
be expanded or collapsed.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.348
So if you're specifically
interested in your revenue,

00:34:31.348 --> 00:34:32.639
you can have that section open.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.429
And it will give you
more useful information.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.010
And if you're less interested
in preregistration,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.704
you can have that
section collapsed.

00:34:39.704 --> 00:34:40.980
We remember your preferences.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.230
So it stays exactly
as you leave it.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.030
It's a really
lightweight way of making

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.049
the dashboard work for each and
every one of you personally.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.489
We've been testing this,
as we test everything.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.690
And a lot of the developers
who we've been working with

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.690
were really happy
with the changes.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.280
I think, if I'm honest, as
a PM, I'm not sure quite

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.840
how to take this quote.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.600
But the lead engineer
from Blue Apron

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.230
was really, really happy
that there was a simple place

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.410
to direct their product
manager so they could

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.020
see the questions that they
always ask really easily

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.210
answered by the dashboard.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.760
And similarly, DocuSign--
very busy people--

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.540
were really happy with the
customization that we give--

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.850
customization that doesn't
completely remove things.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.290
There's no fear of missing out.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.206
But it does mean that
the dashboard is focused

00:35:30.206 --> 00:35:32.520
for what you need right now.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.070
That's a really short
overview of all of the changes

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.360
we made to the App dash.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.020
And hopefully, when
you log in today

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.480
and you see the
new board, you'll

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.150
be able to see all of
that and how it helps you

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.130
in your day-to-day
lives and, frankly,

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.245
how it helps you see
the metrics and insights

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:50.530
that the Console has to
offer to really help you.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.270
So just to round up
about where we are,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.460
Dario, Tamzin,
myself, and our teams

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.080
think about the user lifecycle.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.940
And we think about all
the different tools

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.890
that we can build
to help you optimize

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.320
every stage, from
Instant Apps and Pre-reg

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.280
for discovery and
acquisition through to brand

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.520
new subscription reports,
enhanced acquisition

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.980
reports, the new Events
timeline, and even

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.830
the uninstall stats and
more information coming soon

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.280
about win-back.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.310
We think that all of
this taken together

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.890
will really help
drive your success.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.630
And ultimately, your success
is what we work towards.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.600
That's what we're here to help.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.745
And all of this--

00:36:26.745 --> 00:36:28.870
and other things, like your
technical performance--

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.810
are wrapped together with
the App dashboard as well.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.270
So we're almost at the
end of our time together.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.310
And there are just a couple
of more things to say.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.140
First off, we really
want your feedback.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.410
So if you liked the session--

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.900
and even if you didn't--

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.654
then log onto the
URL and tell us

00:36:45.654 --> 00:36:47.070
what you thought,
because it helps

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.010
us make these sessions better
year after year after year.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.300
And lastly, thank you
so much for listening.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.460
From Tamzin, Dario,
the teams, and myself,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.200
it's great see so
many of you here.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.507
And thank you very much.

00:36:59.507 --> 00:37:00.995
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:05.230
