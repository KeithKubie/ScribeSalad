00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the unit we learned about quartiles.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here we have a set of 8 numbers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'd like you to tell me between which numbers the quartile boundaries occur.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That is, on this side of the boundary the number is in one quartile--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
say the first quartile--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and on this side it's in the second.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check each box at which there is a quartile boundary.
