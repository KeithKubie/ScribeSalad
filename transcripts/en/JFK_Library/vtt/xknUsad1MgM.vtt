00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.052
- Throughout his presidency,

00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:03.840
my grandfather made it clear that he alone

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.885
could fix nothing,

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:07.904
that he alone had no answers.

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.622
He had the courage to plainly admit

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:11.155
America's own shortcomings,

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.291
to then lay out bold plans
to address those problems

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.845
and to ask his fellow Americans for help

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:17.261
in solving them.

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.376
And in doing so,

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:21.023
he inspired a generation
to enter public service

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:23.508
and to ask what they could
do for their country.

00:00:23.508 --> 00:00:26.921
President Barack Obama
inspired me in the same way.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.800
My life changed in 2008
because a young candidate

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.888
was fired up and ready to
go and said that yes we can.

00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:35.280
From his first days in
office until his last,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.788
the President consistently
put the national interest

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.947
above his own political interest,

00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:41.735
while resisting the politics of cynicism

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.684
in a system that all
too often encourages it.

00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:46.240
He showed me and my generation

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.306
what is possible from politics

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.791
and gave us a new standard
of political courage

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.858
to guide us going forward.

00:00:52.858 --> 00:00:54.831
He connected us to one
another with his hope

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.805
and his determination.

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:58.477
We all, especially young Americans,

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:00.530
owe a great debt to this
courageous president.
