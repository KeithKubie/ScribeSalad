KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.775 --> 00:00:04.160
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.890
Joining me in this
video today is

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.620
Tim Draper, founder of
Draper University, DFJ,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.360
and Draper Associates.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.536
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:11.974
TIM DRAPER: Terrific.

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:12.850
Thanks for having me.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.820
KORY JEFFREY: So let's start
with Draper University.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.419
What was the impetus to
start the university?

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.210
TIM DRAPER: So I started
Draper University,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.670
because in 2008, the financial
world was collapsing.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.630
And I was looking for heroes.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.480
And I was thinking, wait,
where are the heroes?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.130
And I thought, the
world needs more heroes.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.780
And heroes can come in any form.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990
They can come as
revolutionaries,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.220
as entrepreneurs, as artists.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.910
But the thinking was that I
could actually help with that.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.780
And so I started a
school to train heroes.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.540
And people go in
for about six weeks.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.700
And it's totally immersive.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.970
And they come out.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.650
And they have this incredible
enthusiasm and gusto

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.930
for whatever it
is they're doing.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.050
And I think we've accomplished
that goal in some ways.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.489
I think the school is working.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.030
KORY JEFFREY: And so could we
talk a little bit about impact?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.260
Because just earlier today,
I had two of your alumni,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.550
I suppose, in the chair.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.910
So obviously, very
prominent in the ecosystem.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.236
Have you seen a lot of
success stories come out?

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:21.850
TIM DRAPER: Yeah.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.770
We've had about 500
students that have come.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.510
They come from about
60 different countries.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.260
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.650
TIM DRAPER: And they've
started about 220 companies.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.370
And some of those
companies now have built--

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.113
some have gone out of business.

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:41.040
Some have built kind of
nice bases of support.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.790
And I think what they
learn at Draper University

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.238
a lot is persistence.

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:50.683
They keep at it,
and they keep at it,

00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:53.128
and they keep tweaking
their business.

00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:56.062
And eventually, great
things are going to happen.

00:01:56.062 --> 00:01:58.507
And I think that's
been the case.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:01.930
And there are probably
10 real standouts

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.842
that look like they have
the potential to be unicorns

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:06.720
or whatever.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.220
Yeah.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.880
KORY JEFFREY: And so
is this all tech focus?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.330
Or is it just a process of
entrepreneurship that kind of--

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.288
TIM DRAPER: It's a process
of entrepreneurship.

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:17.110
But most of the students that
come to Draper University

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.010
are focused on
technology in some way

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.101
as it will transform an
industry, something like that.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:23.809
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.980
And so in the university
space in the world,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.390
do you see this as a disruptive
model for a certain segment

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.666
of how to do entrepreneurship?

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.540
Are you going head to
head with universities?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.090
How do you see
yourself in that space?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.048
TIM DRAPER: Well, I think
we're fitting in well

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:39.020
with universities.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.450
We're only six to eight weeks.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.198
So Stanford has given
some students credit

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.720
to come to Draper University.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
We have a whole program with
San Luis Obispo Cal Poly.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.518
They come.

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:56.500
A group of them come
to Draper University

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.820
at one of our sessions.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.160
And so I think
we're playing nice.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.862
And it ends up working out quite
well for those universities.

00:03:06.862 --> 00:03:11.240
We can be their
entrepreneur program.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.480
And we really do know
how to train heroes.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.830
So people are enjoying it.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.890
As to the first part
of your question,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.800
yes, we are looking for new ways
to transform, and accelerate

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.080
people, and get them
to where they're going

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.340
in a faster and better way.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.870
And the school also
is a lead-in to people

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.430
who might want to
go to the Boost

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.600
accelerator, boost.vc
accelerator, or to Hero City,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.750
or get funded by
Draper Associates.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.417
It's sort of a
natural progression.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.250
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.440
TIM DRAPER: And it
may be a new way

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.150
of educating, at least for
these extraordinary individuals.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.941
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.105
So bringing people in and
then finding the ramp for them

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:02.450
to continue to be successful.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.710
TIM DRAPER: Yeah.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.793
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:07.240
So have you made investments
from Draper Associates

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.785
into entrepreneurs
in the school?

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:10.660
TIM DRAPER: Oh, yeah.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.010
And quite a few Draper
University students

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.829
have gotten Draper
Associates money.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.510
They pay tuition to
go, but some of them

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.378
end up getting an
awful lot more back.

00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:24.334
KORY JEFFREY: [LAUGHS]

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:25.768
TIM DRAPER: --when they
build their businesses.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:26.560
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.142
TIM DRAPER: And
hopefully, I'll end up

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:30.070
getting even more back
after that. [LAUGHS]

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.490
KORY JEFFREY: After that.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.330
Right.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.350
So when your investing,
what's the investment thesis

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.830
of Draper Associates?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.609
What are you looking for?

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.650
TIM DRAPER: So I'm looking
for things that really

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.500
will transform industries.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.480
Industries occasionally
get to the point

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.770
where they're oligopolies
and they're dominated

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.030
by just 2 or 3 or 10 companies.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.915
And when you know you've got
an oligopoly or a monopoly

00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:01.700
is when you know the service
isn't as good as it used to be

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.920
and the price keeps going up.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.390
And so I'm always
looking for opportunities

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.680
where that price-to-service
ratio has expanded

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.240
and there's an
opportunity for a startup

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.402
to serve that population better
than they're being served now.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.402
KORY JEFFREY: Excellent.

00:05:20.402 --> 00:05:21.809
That's interesting.

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:27.210
So I guess my next question
would be, obviously, you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.730
get quite a large
breadth of-- looks

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.522
at different types of
technologies, people pitching

00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:31.528
you all the time.

00:05:31.528 --> 00:05:33.967
Is there a certain
technology space

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.800
that's really interesting
for you right now,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.280
something that gets you excited?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.750
TIM DRAPER: Yeah.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.220
I'm really interested in these
industries that haven't yet

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.750
been transformed, where
over the last 15, 20 years,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.120
you've seen information,
communications, entertainment,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.740
music, taxis all transformed.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.160
In the future, I can see
finance, banking transform.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.380
Education, I think,
is on its way

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.550
to getting some sort
of transformation.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.930
Medical technologies are coming
along that are more data-based

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.790
than doctor-to-patient-based.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.350
And that could end up
being a real transformation

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.880
in health care.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.505
And then I think governments are
going through a transformation

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:27.720
now.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.000
We had the prime
minister of Estonia come

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.140
to Draper University and speak.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.890
And he said, just by
instituting digital signatures,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.930
I saved 2% of the GDP.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.910
And so it made me think that,
hey, maybe these governments

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.870
are looking for
entrepreneurs to kind of help

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.830
them better serve
their citizens.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.790
And he also said that just by
instituting digital voting,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.760
all the young people
started to vote.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.010
And digital identity has
improved their business

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.180
climate, but it's also
lowered their crime rate.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.380
So interesting
things are happening

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.940
in government technology.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.910
And I'm looking for
those companies, too.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.660
KORY JEFFREY: Oh, that's
really fascinating.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.420
TIM DRAPER: Yeah.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.100
KORY JEFFREY: So you
clearly get pitched a lot.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.500
Obviously, even
just coming here,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.000
there was a lineup
of people walking

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.620
behind you trying to pitch you.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.270
What are the things
that you look

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.760
for in somebody that makes you
receptive to hearing a pitch?

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.025
What are the things
that you don't like?

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:27.900
What's the best way to
get in touch with you?

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.740
TIM DRAPER: I think the
best way to connect with me

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.880
is through your initial idea.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.790
Is it transformative?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.260
Does it pass my 15-year test.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.180
My 15-year test is in 15 years,
is this a possibility or is it

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.690
sort of going to come and
go in the next six months

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.820
by something that
improves on it?

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.600
And so if you're really
thinking 15 years out, I mean,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.520
we're going to
have self-driving,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.600
flying cars in 15 years.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.550
So does your plan
relate to that?

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:16.990
Or are we going to have drone
delivery on anticipated needs?

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.510
Where before you even know your
blood glucose level is low,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.000
a drone shows up with a taco.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.670
So in that world, does
your business make sense?

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.309
And that's kind of what
we're really looking for.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.850
And then I would want to
know how well versed are you

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.890
on that industry?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.990
And how do you know
your competition?

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.720
And do you have a rational
approach at your business?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.490
And is the business model
one where the customers

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.870
become the sales force?

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.396
So that'll help.

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:53.520
KORY JEFFREY: That'll help.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.950
So a lot of what you just
painted-- self-driving cars,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.600
glucose levels, drone
deliveries, this

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.319
is the Google
channel-- a lot of that

00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:04.985
is stuff that we're
publicly working on.

00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:08.070
Is there anything at Google
that makes you excited?

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.436
Is there any favorite Google
technology or anything

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:13.280
that you think is interesting?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.980
TIM DRAPER: You know, I like
all those interesting ideas that

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.860
come out of the
Google's 20% rule, where

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:25.210
they-- engineers have 20% to
go do the thing that they like,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.640
they want to do themselves.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.360
Because those are the
things that are on the edge.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.610
And engineers are kind of
looking for things that

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.610
are more exciting to work on.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.790
And those edge
products are really

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.690
what the engineers
are really into.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.480
And I think when an engineer's
really into something,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.680
it's usually novel
enough for me to want

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.610
to be interested in it, too.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.120
So if you're a part of the
Google Developers community,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.050
you're probably developing
something pretty interesting

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.600
that you love that's not just
the 20%, but your whole 100%

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.240
is focused on
something you love.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.490
And in that case,
I think if you've

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.610
got any kind of a
futuristic approach at all,

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.380
I think I'd be
interested in hearing

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.714
what it is you're working on.

00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:18.714
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:20.570
Well, thank you very
much for joining us, Tim.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.930
TIM DRAPER: Good.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.580
My pleasure.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.746
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
guys for joining us at home.

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:26.140
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.
