Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So if you think about it, for thousands of years people have verbally

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.020
skipped along or passed down through generations the art of skipping

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.040
stones, and today it's my turn to do the same. So when you throw it,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.070
you hold it on the side like this, and then when you throw it you spin it. You remember how

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
you didn't think you could skip and then I taught you how? But now you can right?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.120
Are you a good skipper?
- Yes.
- Do you think you can do this?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
- Yes.
- OK here we go. Ready? Watch. 3..2..1..

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.170
Did that work?
- Yeah

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.180
OK. ... What just happened?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
- Skip.
- Yep. High five.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.220
We're gonna have to wait a little bit before you learn buddy. So obviously

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.260
the shape is important. You want something wide and flat.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.280
So now we've got four variables. The first one is the velocity of the rock. We want to keep

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.310
it as fast as possible so kinetic energy stays in the system. The second one is the angle of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.340
attack. You want that rock to be twenty degrees with respect to the surface of the water.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.370
Scientists in France determined that that is the optimum angle at which a rock will keep

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.390
skipping, so keep that at twenty degrees, not twenty-five, not fifteen, as best you can

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.410
to twenty. OK the third one is the angle of impact of the rock

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.430
to the water. You want to keep it as low as possible so it'll skim along the surface because if you get much higher

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.490
than forty-five it's impossible for it to skip. So you want to keep it down so it'll skim.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.590
And the last variable is the rotational velocity. You want to spin it as fast as you can.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.640
That way it acts like a gyroscope and it doesn't dip down when it nutates

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.640
and dip into the water because the angle of attack is all wrong. Angle of attack twenty,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.650
and...

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.690
Alright it's about eight. My personal best is twelve so that's pretty good. You've done that a time or

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.730
two haven't you?
- It's the third time today.
- [laugh] You're living right.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.760
Alright, so I asked you guys to send me postcards because I'm

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.800
covering a room in my house that we're adding onto. Basically we closed a patio in.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.850
And several of you sent postcards and I'm very very excited about it.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.890
To the point where I've got to show you. So I'm gonna show you who all sent me postcards. T.S.Davis

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.930
from Austin Texas. Saywen Wells. Saywen must be like three or four.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.950
That's pretty awesome. Alberto from Spain. My first one. Mr Coma sent me

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.010
one, a fossil. Another one from Spain. A fossil? No way!

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.050
Oh that's right, a fossil.
- I found it.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.070
- A fossil, very good. See if you can skip it. I've never skipped a fossil.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.110
1.. 2.. Fossils are not good at it.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.150
Luke sent one from London. He's not in London now. Paris from Canada

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.180
Dory sent me a fractal from California. Roman, his wife and two cats

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.250
sent me this one. He walks there. Diego from Maryland.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.280
Michael sent me an Einstein. Jake from Port Townsend. This one's from Seattle. I love it.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.300
It says, Hi Smarter Every Day. I like your videos.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.310
This is John, he's got a daughter named Sadie. Say hey.
- Hey.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.340
- Go skip rocks. You're supposed to be learning how to skip rocks.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.360
Max sent me a Giblonski diagram. Giblonski? Giblowski?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.380
[Splash] Hey! You're getting wet! No, no. Go skip rocks. Don't throw big ones.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.400
Do you understand?
- Yes sir.
- OK. This is by far my favorite.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.420
Sequoia National Park California. However this is from

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.460
1939. Howdy y'all. Found a stack of these in a box after my dad

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
passed away. I've been watching your channel since you gave your dad a chicken for fathers day.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.540
Thank you. I really appreciate that Andy. I will not

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.550
put a staple through this I promise. Logan from Pensacola.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.560
Axel from the Netherlands. Mary Elizabeth from New York.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.570
That's pretty awesome. This is a gator from Ty. Pasan from Atlanta.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.580
Cliff and Lily sent me a really big post card from Nebraska. Nathan says

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
Hay. [laugh] This is Casha from southern California and she says here's to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.630
your postcard wall. So this is Jonathan. He went to Peru after he saw the macaw video

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.660
Claire from Boston. She's from Chicago originally. She sent two

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
and she gets the award for the most beautiful handwriting.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.710
It's insanity. It's very very good. This is JV.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.740
He sent me a dinosaur. OK James from Minnesota are you near Lake Wobegon?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.770
Kal or Kale, I don't know how to say it, excuse me, from Sweden.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.800
He stop. He made this himself. It's kind of similar to what we're doing

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.820
right now. That's pretty cool. He made it at cardsinthepost.com.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.860
That's pretty smart. So if you don't have a postcard you make your own. And this is from Beaumont. He's in

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.900
the UK. It's pretty cool. Hey I'm making a video! You're supposed to be skipping

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920
rocks, there's a test later. This is Jack,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.970
or Jaques from Paris. That's a pretty one. Very nice.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.000
He says some very nice things on the back. I'm going to staple them up here.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.040
But clearly we have nowhere near enough postcards, so

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.080
please send me more. I'll leave the address in the video description. As long as the address is there

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.110
I still need postcards, cause I've got to cover this whole room.
- We need some more postcards.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.160
I do not want to paint up there.
- So if you want to see how I'm doing on the postcard project

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.210
check out the second channel Funner Every Day, I'll keep it up to date with info. Thank you very much for

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.195
your support it means a lot. I appreciate it. Have a good one.
