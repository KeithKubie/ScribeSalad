00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:13.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There is an
extraordinary community center

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:15.266
in the heart of New York City.

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:20.126
It offers a complete
range of medical services,

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.836
from dental and medical checkups.

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:26.666
&gt;&gt;To mental health counseling.

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:33.546
There are adult education classes,
and computer training courses,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.296
a basketball program,
and a bicycle shop,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:42.866
a dance company, and
a string ensemble.

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:47.516
Those are just a few of the
activities offered after school

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:52.466
at IS 218, a public intermediate
school, designed from the beginning

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:54.916
to meet the needs of
the entire community.

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:58.466
&gt;&gt;Jane: When I first came to this
school, I noticed two things.

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:00.906
I noticed that the
children seemed happy,

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.036
and I noticed that there were
a lot of extra adults around.

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:06.706
And I wanted to know
what was happening here,

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:09.256
and how we could make it
happen in more places.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:10.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You want to
spell this one first?

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:16.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: IS 218 is open six days
a week from 7:00 in the morning

00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:18.126
to 9:00 at night, all year long.

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:21.756
It's the product of a partnership
between the New York City Board

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:25.756
of Education and the Children's
Aid Society, which pays for

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:28.206
and administers the
extra-curricular programs.

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So I think that's
comforting for the parents

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:31.926
to see what type of stuff we have.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.116
&gt;&gt;Jane: We have been doing this work

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:36.046
in ten public schools
for about then years.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.616
Really joining forces with the
New York City Board of Education,

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.366
and bringing into the
public schools all

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.916
of the things that we know how to do.

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:47.746
Which include before and after
school programs, summer camps,

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:51.576
medical/dental/mental
health and social services.

00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:54.436
&gt;&gt;Dentist: Number 27, number 28.

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.496
&gt;&gt;Scott: When you first
walk through the door,

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.786
the first thing you're going to
see is the Children's Aid clinics,

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:03.866
our medical clinic, our mental
health clinic, our parent room,

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:05.416
our administrative offices.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:06.176
We're right there.

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.586
In many cases families will come
to us even before they even go

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:09.676
to the principal's office.

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:11.686
Because we've developed
that kind of trust

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:12.936
with the community and the parents.

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.041
&gt;&gt;Dr. Hugh: [speaks Spanish]

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.856
&gt;&gt;Dr. Hugh: There's a little bit
of this flu bug going around again.

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:18.976
And this child came in
and was checked by me.

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:22.586
&gt;&gt;Dr. Hugh: [speaks Spanish]

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:24.646
&gt;&gt;Dr. Hugh: And the mom came
in to talk about it with me,

00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:26.576
and the mom asked me,
she said, "Well,

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:27.836
should I take him to a doctor?"

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:28.386
And I said.

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:31.336
"Well, I am the doctor, I
happen to be in the school."

00:02:31.656 --> 00:02:35.986
And she was so happy to realize that
she now could go back home and know

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:39.166
that her child was okay, and didn't
have to make a whole separate visit,

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.136
and wait a couple of
hours in emergency room,

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.496
or their doctor takes
a long time, too.

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.976
So our goal here really is to
provide comprehensive medical care

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:48.936
to our students in the school.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.026
&gt;&gt;Woman: He was referred to
me after the plane crashed.

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:53.846
The plane going to the
Dominican Republic.

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:55.886
&gt;&gt;Scott: Right, it's Flight 587.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:56.696
&gt;&gt;Woman: Yes, Flight 587.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:57.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The mental health team

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:01.926
at IS 218 played a crucial role
during the World Trade Center

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:06.906
tragedy, and the subsequent crash of
Flight 587, which claimed the lives

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:08.526
of several area residents.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:11.166
&gt;&gt;Woman: So I contacted mom, and
she came in, and I took some more

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.896
of the-- psycho-social
history from mom.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:14.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But beyond
crisis counseling,

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.196
the mental health team helps
students overcome their daily dreads.

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:21.716
&gt;&gt;Scott: I heard on
the news last night,

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:24.176
another airline crash
is going to happen here.

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:27.476
"Am I going to be safe, or is my
mom and dad going to be safe?"

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:31.166
That ability to have somebody
right there, you know the next day

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.706
when you go to school that your
social worker will be there,

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:38.446
and will make time to see you, I
think is very positive for the kids,

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:40.846
and something that I
think they count on.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do you
get along with them?

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.926
&gt;&gt;Student: We argue and
everything, but it's okay.

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:50.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Other Children's
Aid Society programs kick

00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:53.626
in after school, beginning
with a homework help sessions.

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have to
lower case all your letters.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:59.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students participate in
a wide range of clubs and activities

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:02.396
which augment core
curriculum subjects,

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:04.546
and provide social enrichment.

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:09.996
The school's string ensemble
has achieved a remarkable level

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:12.456
of musicianship in a short timeframe.

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:16.156
&gt;&gt;Enrique: And I think that's the
key to this program, the success.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.106
As you can tell, they play very well.

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:24.156
Most of them-- good-- most of
them have been playing just

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.176
under two years, two-and-a-half
years,

00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:31.976
but because there's an everyday
instruction on these instruments,

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.696
they progress at a much faster rate.

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:36.886
&gt;&gt;Bianca: I remember when
they first started here.

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.856
My son was in sixth grade, and that
was the first time we've had a music

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:41.836
program in this school.

00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:44.236
And now, listening to
what they're playing now,

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:47.056
it is a gigantic difference.

00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:49.126
It is such an improvement.

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:52.116
They've just grown as musicians.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.766
And a lot of them are
applying and looking

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:57.516
into arts as one of their careers.

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.986
&gt;&gt;Enrique: They're held
accountable, as performers

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:01.896
and as students in school.

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:06.896
And they're given a lot of
opportunities to shine like this.

00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:09.386
And they go for it.

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:13.966
&gt;&gt;Jim: We call basketball the magnet
or the draw that brings the kids in.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:17.166
and then from there we get
them to do other things

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.226
that are part of the program.

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:20.846
We have career readiness,
and job preparation.

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:24.056
We have family life and
sex ed for boys and girls.

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:28.616
And then we also do some work
with them around self-development

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:30.706
and setting goals and making sure

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:33.496
that they continue
to do well in school.

00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:37.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In another after
school club, kids learn a bit

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:39.916
about recycling and
mechanical engineering,

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:42.346
and a lot about building
their own bicycle.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:46.006
&gt;&gt;Audrey: If they volunteer 18
hours at a time working in the shop

00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:48.966
like it's their job,
then they can pick a bike

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:50.636
and start to work on that bike.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:54.606
They work another six hours, and
they can take that bike home as long

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:56.156
as it passes our safety exam.

00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:00.466
And so far this year, the kids
have earned 40 bicycles already,

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:03.476
which is a record for a school year.

00:06:03.726 --> 00:06:06.826
&gt;&gt;Student: It's kind of cool,
because we're building our own bikes,

00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:09.936
and we got the opportunity
to experience everything.

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:14.076
And mostly I come on Saturdays,
Fridays and Wednesdays.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:15.786
I like being here.

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:18.666
&gt;&gt;Audrey: I try and get the
kids thinking mechanically,

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:21.586
which is something that isn't
exactly taught during the school day.

00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:25.596
So I try and get them to ask
questions about what is friction,

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.676
how does ball bearings
reduce the friction.

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:29.796
And so I always try and let them know

00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:33.036
that they can ask these questions
back in their science classrooms

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:37.726
and their math classrooms.

00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:40.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:06:41.486 --> 00:06:43.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Learning the
joy and discipline of dance,

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.826
many students come to see
themselves in a new light.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:50.486
&gt;&gt;Frances: As far as body image,
it's so important for young ladies

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.586
and young men to look at
themselves in a positive way

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:54.606
in this community,
especially, I think.

00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:59.156
And I think that once they accept
themselves, and they love themselves,

00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:00.646
anything is possible, and I think

00:07:01.056 --> 00:07:03.396
that self-esteem is
what builds them up.

00:07:04.076 --> 00:07:06.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And seven,
improvise your way out.

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:08.786
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:09.736
And more, and one...

00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:12.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And so we take
the verb to be at the front.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:15.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the evening,
classes in computer training

00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:18.916
and English are offered to parents.

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.686
&gt;&gt;Regina: Through Children's
Aid Society, we have a bridge

00:07:21.686 --> 00:07:23.106
to the parents in the community.

00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:27.826
Not only because of the services
they provide to their children,

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:29.996
but to the parents themselves.

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:33.916
GED courses, computer courses.

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:38.266
Parents know that they can go into
any of those rooms downstairs,

00:07:38.606 --> 00:07:41.336
and they will be accepted,
they will be supported,

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:45.496
and there's always a helping hand.

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:48.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When they come to share
the traditional art of flower-making,

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:51.566
parents are exposed
to other services.

00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:55.616
&gt;&gt;Lidia: They come for
flower, but at the same time,

00:07:55.616 --> 00:07:59.276
I want them to have some
idea about something else,

00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:03.256
like victim services,
domestic violence, AIDS.

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:08.666
And one of the things that I'm
planning is to bring some type of way

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.476
that they start to feel relax.

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:14.736
And it's beautiful things
to teach our children.

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:17.726
&gt;&gt;Principal: The next
thing is the planning

00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:19.706
for the extended day
program next year.

00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:23.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Integrating the education
curriculum with the social services

00:08:23.516 --> 00:08:27.016
and enrichment programs
requires a constant dialogue

00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:30.096
between the school's principal
and the Children's Aid Society.

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:32.106
&gt;&gt;Rosa: There has to be
definitely an openness

00:08:32.106 --> 00:08:34.076
about the things that we both bring.

00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:37.616
There's an understanding of
the principal's experience

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:40.356
as an educator; there's an
understanding of my experience

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.906
as social worker, and
how do the two combine.

00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:44.536
And that's very important.

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:48.326
That's going to allow for our kids to
have a rounder, fuller understanding

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:49.966
of their own life experiences.

00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:51.506
&gt;&gt;Teacher: No, you did good.

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:52.096
That was good.

00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:54.046
The way you're doing
it is okay, because...

00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:57.086
&gt;&gt;Jane: There have been some dramatic
gains in academic achievement

00:08:57.546 --> 00:08:59.966
in this school and in our
other community schools

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:03.076
on the standardized tests
as well as on teachers,

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.806
observations and on grades.

00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:09.216
The researchers were able to
document higher student attendance,

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:13.026
and higher teacher attendance
at the Community Schools.

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While there are
significant challenges involved

00:09:15.786 --> 00:09:22.516
in developing community schools,
the rewards seem worth the effort.

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:24.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The needs are always
greater than the resources

00:09:24.936 --> 00:09:27.296
that we can bring to the
table, even collectively.

00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:31.906
But I think that we have found
that if you have the word, "Yes,"

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.536
written in your heart, you can
make almost anything happen.

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:36.806
And I think that we're
living proof of that

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.766
in our schools in New York City.

00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:43.716
&gt;&gt;Class: Hooray!

00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:49.876
