00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.299
And so maternal mortality in Haiti

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.980
is really high, I mean it's on par with

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.949
Sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.379
and countries that are in a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.519
really bad state. It's really

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.369
very very bad.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.109
And there are a lot of reasons

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.199
why that's so

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.269
one is just

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019
the general level of poor health care like
lack

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.429
of health infrastructure so there are no places

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.410
for women to actually

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.839
go to get health care

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.059
the second issue is having to pay for health
care 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.780
so user fees

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420
are a major obstacle for

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.080
most women to actually come to the health center 
and get seen

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.030
transportation is really difficult, it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850
you know mostly on donkeys or bare foot

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.320
over mountainous areas

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.270
and women, it's really difficult especially when you're
pregnant and probably anemic

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.330
to try to walk in out of the clinic 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.970
to be seen for

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.140
you antenatal care then when you're actually in labor

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.870
that's the last time you want to like on a horse 
and come down to the clinic

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.870
especially in the rainy season, 
in the rainy season it’s muddy and really difficult to do it.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
This  is Fond Enfer,in French translation means 'the deep hell'.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.300
It's really strange to see it now

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
it's just like a tiny little creek

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
but it really has a major impact on, you know

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.300
not just health but also on all the economic 
on the other side of the river

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.300
because what happens in the rainy season is, 
every afternoon around 3 or 4 o'clock it rains

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
and I think in part because of the erosion and the lack of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.300
good soil in there up in the mountains,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
the water rises really rapidly so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
you can be standing here and it will start to rain, 
within 20 or 30 minutes

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.300
there's a flash flood and the water rises up really high.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300
I've personally seen two women who have died

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
because we weren't able to get them across the river

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.300
in time to have cesarean sections.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
We have a lot of community will, like people will carry you,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
people will carry the women across, but at a certain point 
it's just too dangerous for anyone to cross

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.300
so we can't do it.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.130
Cange is a referral center for all of our other sites

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.989
so in Boucan Carré if we need a C-section we send then here.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.409
So she knew she was going to have twins, they had told her

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.199
this makes six, she now has six children, she's twenty-eight.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.339
The average birthrate

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.230
is about four or five and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.550
the issues are really complicated

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.329
because women

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.740
don't always have

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.999
real control

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.319
socially over their fertility.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.119
They're really highly dependent on men

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.089
for their economic standing.

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.939
And in unions

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:43.900
between men and women

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.049
it's pretty much expected from 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.329
the man that there will be a child,

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.109
that the woman will have a child for him.

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.159
So I've had women who have had 10 children already who come

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.529
and when I council them about family planning

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.879
they say well

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.629
I don't really want to do it yet, and when I delve a bit deeper 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.229
it's because maybe their previous partner died 
or their previous partner left them

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:08.259
and they're with a new partner and that new partner 
really wants to have a child with them

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:12.369
and so their option is to either not do 
that and risk him leaving

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.609
or do that, have a child with him,

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.699
and then have 11 children

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.509
but at least she hopes

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.469
that he will help to support those other children

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.809
so it's really quite complicated.

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.260
I think those are kind of the list of reasons of 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.959
why it's so hard for women

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.969
hard for women.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.719
One of the ways that we've addressed it is obviously by

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.879
having no user fees for pregnant women so
pregnant women in Zanmi Lasante don't even

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.059
pay the sixty cent

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:45.789
requirement that some people pay, so they're excluded from
any fees whatsoever
