00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The next part of this question involves the humiliation that a competitive cyclist feels

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when they're passed by an ambitious runner.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So let's say we have a cyclist and he is just hanging out standing by his bicycle.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And this runner over here, well, she's running along at a velocity of 6 m/s.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The instant she passes the cyclist, well of course he is upset that he got passed by a runner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Runners aren't supposed to be faster than bicyclists.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So he hops on his bike and starts accelerating.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And just like in the last problem, he can accelerate at 3 m/sÂ² up to a maximum velocity of 12 m/s.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The runner is going at 6. How long will it take the bicyclist to catch the runner?
