00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.450
Elephants have earned a crazy reputation for
being able to remember places, migratory patterns

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.190
and voice differences… in fact there’s
some evidence to show that they can even hold

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.260
a grudge.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.440
But is it true they really NEVER forget?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.630
Elephants have arguably one of the most intelligent
brains in the animal kingdom; scientists often

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.570
place them up there with dolphins and even
apes.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.789
Even though we think of elephants as just
one animal, there are actually three distinct

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.570
living species of elephant, two in Africa
and one in Asia.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.180
Each species have different advantages and
disadvantages, but for this piece we’re

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.870
going to try and keep it simple…

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.879
On average, elephant brains are 3 times the
size of human brains.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.129
Like us, they have complex neural networks
and actually have MORE neurons than humans

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.979
do ––257 billion to our mere 86 billion.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.729
Though size alone doesn’t actually predict
intelligence or memory -- because it depends

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.050
on where in the brain the neurons are.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.100
In the case of elephants almost 98% of their
neurons, are stored in their cerebellum.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.679
This region sits in the back of the brain
and is thought to be linked to motor skills

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.759
and sensory input, meaning it’s in charge
of handling all the massiveness that is an

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:06.759
elephant.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.130
Which makes sense––their trunks alone
have over one hundred thousand bundles of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.500
muscle fibers I can’t even imagine controlling
something like that.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.189
A larger animal often requires a larger brain
-- there’s more skin, more muscle, more

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.649
of everything!Outside of their impressive
cerebellum … Elephants actually DON’T

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.650
have a very robust cerebral cortex (an area
of the brain often linked to higher intelligence),

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.689
but some have the ability to problem-solve
with tools, and still others have even been

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.250
observed to recognize friends, family, food
routes, and enemies.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.990
And Asian elephants, specifically, have been
known to exhibit self-awareness in mirrors.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.149
Which is huge!

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.609
In fact, both African and Indian elephants
have a unique set of neurons called VENs that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.890
are believed to mediate social-empathic behaviors
-- and humans also have these these!

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.079
But even though elephants are incredible animals,
a human brain is FAR more densely populated

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.079
with neural networks.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.950
It’s possible that we can’t use our models
for elephants.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.299
They could represent a different type of cognitive
structure.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.979
Scientists speculate the elephant brain favors
“widespread interconnectivity” of distant

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.290
regions rather than proximity of clustered
ones.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.860
Their neurons are farther apart than ours,
and while we don’t know exactly why.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.390
So even though we understand a lot about the
structure of elephant brains, we still haven’t

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.420
grasped their long memory, but we KNOW they
have it from observing their behavior.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.439
Some elephants travel in packs as small as
8 or as large as 100 individuals.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.630
And the experiences of a herd make them wiser.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.200
And that wisdom is passed on to younger generations.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.690
Herds are made up of a matriarchy, meaning
the group is led by female elephants, usually

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.710
the eldest.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.470
And since elephants can reach the age of 60
to 80 years old, that many years of information

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.470
can come in handy.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.450
For example, in 1993, Tanzania had one of
the worst droughts in their recent history.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.409
Places where water was normally abundant,
dried up… and groups with older females,

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.110
who had lived through previous droughts, moved
to locations with a greater chance of water,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.290
while those headed by younger matriarchs stayed
behind.The younger herds lost more calves

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.610
within 9 months than elder’s groups.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.300
But memory of droughts isn’t the only thing…
elephants can also remember friends and foes.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.110
Another study was conducted where elephants
listened to recordings of men from the Masai

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.769
(a group that has been known to kill elephants
to protect grazing land) and then recordings

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.569
from the Kamba tribe, who don’t bother elephants
much at all.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.379
Even though both tribes repeated the same
phrase in the recording, a majority of elephants

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.910
acted much more defensively when the Masai
recording was played!

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.390
So a herd with a matriarch that has experience
with Masai might turn her herd away if she

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.510
recognizes their language, ultimately saving
her herd from harm.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.400
In the end, we understand more about elephants
and their long memories than we did decades

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.970
ago, but with regard to HOW they can remember
things like water holes or voices from their

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.090
youth… we’re still working on it.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.579
More research is of course needed.

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.900
They’re clearly wise creatures, and hopefully
one day we’ll better understand what goes

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.099
on in that massive brain of theirs.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.730
You probably love elephants if you’re still
watching -- so you’ll love this special

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.010
episode of Dodo Heroes.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.000
This family rehabilitates and rewilds elephants
saved from Thailand’s tourism industry!

Don’t forget to look out for the hashtag
Dodo Heroes. :D

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.800
Determining how smart animals are is really
hard… know why?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.530
Check out Maren’s video about it here.

science in your day.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.100
And one last elefact before you go, elephants
have very poor eyesight!

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.530
They primarily rely on odor to learn about
one another and the world around them.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.640
They can even smell water from several miles
away!

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.620
Thanks for watching everyone.
