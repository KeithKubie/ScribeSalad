00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.760
- Part of our focus in terms of SEL

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.460
is to become more aware of
our emotions and reactions.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.070
So Rashad is the character who gets--

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.830
- Abused by the police officer

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.620
- Do you see these things happening?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.340
- I've seen it happen to others.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.960
- [Narrator] Because our kids
participate in daily advisory

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410
they feel more connected
to our school community,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.310
they feel like they know themselves

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.120
and others around them better,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.410
and we have huge accomplishments

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.960
in our kids' learning outcomes.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.971
- We're gonna begin just with
two minutes of mindfulness

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:41.400
(chiming)

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.910
- [Narrator] The nest
is our daily advisory.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.710
- Think about inhaling and exhaling.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.810
- We're really reflecting
on what we are proud

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.470
of about ourselves.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.190
- [Narrator] We're really
focused on two things.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.400
One is literacy.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.160
- Right after this part right here.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.110
- [Narrator] And the other one
is social emotional learning.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.300
- [Student] I know, I did
I was like super excited.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960
- I really want you to
think on who you are,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.490
what you represent, things
that you're going through.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.630
- At Pearl-Cohn we want to increase

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.560
a discussion based classroom.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800
A class is never going
to look discussion based

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.700
if the kids aren't comfortable talking

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:19.523
in front of each other because

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:20.570
they're worried they'll be made fun of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.940
or they're worried that
they'll have the wrong answer.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.510
So we build family mindset,
getting to know each other,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.110
talking through goals,
talking through setbacks.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.460
The good things of life,
the hardships of life.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.560
Y'all just put it in your own words that's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.393
like the best part.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.683
- How I'm supposed to explain something

00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:37.180
I don't know how to do?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.160
- We can talk about anything we want,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.700
tell our teacher just everything.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.100
You get to know other students better

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.600
and create a bond with each other.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.250
- I'm proud to be a strong woman,

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.220
I'm proud of being a volleyball player

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.950
and I am proud of Miss
Tilley and her hard work

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980
- And then the second part of the nest

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.760
is spent reading a novel together.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.340
- We are going to dig back into this book

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.110
- Really great novels lead
to great conversations

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.910
and they perfectly align with
social emotional learning.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.840
I believe literacy is a civil
rights issue in this country.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.350
We consider our citizens
literate at ninth grade or higher

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.050
and the vast majority of
my kids are below that

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:22.100
and that means they're
not engaging our society,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.780
our democracy in a way that is empowering

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.160
and participatory.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.642
So if there is one thing we
put a lot of energy around

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:34.440
it is trying to help
our kids become readers.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.380
- We are reading a book
called All-American Boys.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.920
- I didn't want to hear my father preach

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.230
about how young black people lack pride

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.280
and integrity and making us easy targets.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.610
- We wanna to broaden kids'
capacity to enjoy reading

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580
by having deep conversations

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.632
about the subjects and
themes the kids live out.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.710
- [Student] The first story
was about a kid accused

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.840
of stealing from a store on the west side.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.230
- So on the middle of page a hundred

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.530
you've got this cop who
represents this abusive authority.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.360
You had a reaction to that.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.030
- People abuse their
authority when they get it.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.260
- [Chad] Conversation
today was about mistrust

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
between authority and community.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.550
When our kids read that
there's a guttural reaction

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.550
that takes place.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.470
- Like, I just got so mad.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.100
This boy, he got beat
up by a police officer.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.830
When I heard that I instantly,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.530
it just draw me into it
because that's something I see,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.053
I go through everyday.

00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:35.093
- [Student] Like a lot of this
stuff has actually happened.

00:03:35.093 --> 00:03:37.370
- There's a lot of police
brutality going on.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.740
Sometimes it kind of releases some rage.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.360
- That still goes on, I mean...

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.240
- [Sonia] So it's access to text

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:45.855
and giving them the ability

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:47.050
to face each other, look
each other in the eye

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.240
and have conversations
around significant topics.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.040
- I want to say altercation, but then--

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.040
- The nest lays the ground
for academic learning.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.020
It holds kids to higher standards

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.410
and to higher expectations.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.090
- It's a time to build community

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:01.880
and to make certain that each kid has

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.030
at least one individual in the building

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.620
that invests personally
in his or her best.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.304
- [Arshon] Our nest is a family.

00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:09.454
- [Chad] Somos familia.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.790
- I feel like I can talk
about anything I need to here.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.490
- We're sitting silently,
we'll start by focusing--

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.450
- Looking at the data,
they've grown in learning

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.150
and have become people that
are increasingly more aware

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.330
of who they are and care for others.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.240
All of that is directly linked
to social emotional learning

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.270
and the work that happens in the nest.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.070
- You guys have changed and
grown up so much this year

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.690
and I'm so lucky to know you.
