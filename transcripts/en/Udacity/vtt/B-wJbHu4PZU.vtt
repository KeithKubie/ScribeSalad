00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.000
Some of the exercises in this
course will require the use

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.970
of a wonderful tool called Mathquill.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.140
Mathquill is an equation editor,
which means that it allows us to type

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.410
things that normal keyboards don't
usually allow, like exponent.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.380
To type an exponent in
Mathquill you use a caret.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.770
Let me show you on my keyboard.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.230
This is a caret, so to get this,
I would hold down Shift and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.180
hit the 6, but
your keyboard might be different.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.190
Still, most keyboards will
have a caret on them.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.912
So to type x to the sixth,

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:41.115
what you would need to
type would be x caret six.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:45.067
After you type the caret,
you'll see your cursor move up into

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:49.628
the superscript area, and then you
can proceed typing your exponent.

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:53.780
To type something after the exponent
you would hit the right arrow key.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.060
So that's what it looks
like on my keyboard.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.900
So after you hit the right arrow key,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.040
the cursor will then return
to the normal position,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.330
out of the superscript position,
and you can continue typing.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.912
So for example,
if you wanted to type x squared y,

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:17.383
what you would hit would be x caret 2,
right arrow key, y.

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:19.890
Now you try entering these yourself, and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.870
here are a couple of other expressions
for you to try and practice as well.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.650
Try using Mathquill to type
out x cubed y squared plus 4z,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.870
as well as 7a squared b- c to the fifth,
and enter your answers in the boxes.
