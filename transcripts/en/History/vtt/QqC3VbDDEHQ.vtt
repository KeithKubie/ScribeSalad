00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.540
NARRATOR: To get a firsthand
look into this continued search

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.500
for extraterrestrial
life, in March of 2016,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.620
researcher and publisher
Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.960
traveled to the
Allen Telescope Array

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.500
in Hat Creek California,
where he met with the director

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.170
for SETI research, Seth Shostak.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.580
This is truly amazing.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.330
What can you tell
me about this place?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.880
Well, this place
is an observatory,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.250
but it's a radio observatory.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.380
So these things around
us, these 42 antennas,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.080
they pick up radio waves.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.420
And we're trying to pick up very
special sort of radio waves,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080
namely some that would tell
us somebody's out there.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.920
By having lots of
these dishes here,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.080
we can look at more
of the sky at once.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.250
We can look at multiple
star systems at once.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.080
Why radio waves?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.000
What's so significant
about radio waves?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880
SETH SHOSTAK: Radio waves
go at the speed of light.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.580
And they also, by the way, go
through all the gas and dust

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.330
that's between the stars.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.210
So you know, if you
want to communicate

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.670
from one part of the
galaxy to another,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.790
radio waves are a
great way to do it.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.290
So the way this works is
actually kind of simple.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.710
I mean, the cosmic radio static,
it comes in from the sky,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620
and it bounces off that
big reflector there,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.880
that first one.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.290
OK, that's a mirror
for radio waves.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.420
And that redirects them to this
secondary reflector on the end,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.120
on the nose there.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.790
And then they're directed to
the receiver, and that's inside.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.040
That information goes
through a fiber optic

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.540
over to the control room.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.420
So this is where the data
coming through the fiber optic

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.460
kind of ends up, after
it's been processed

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.290
in a display like this.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.210
And what are we
looking at right here?

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.620
So we're looking,
in this case, at three

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.920
star systems at once, OK.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.460
So that speeds up the search.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.500
It also allows us to
determine whether we're really

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.750
seeing ET or just interference.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.250
The data from one of
these star systems

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.750
is being displayed on this
part of the screen here.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.960
This is called a waterfall plot.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.500
That, can you see that line of--

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.330
This right here, yes.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.920
--brighter dots there?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.460
Yeah, that's a slightly more
static at that frequency

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.830
slowly going down the dot.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.500
That's the kind of
thing we're looking for.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.750
So then if this here
were an actual ET signal,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.670
how would it
differentiate itself?

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.120
Would it be a bit thicker, a bit
more pronounced, a bit longer?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.750
Or what are you looking for?

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.290
It could be all
of those things.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.080
So what you'd do is when
you find a signal like this,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.460
you make a test.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.830
You'll just move the
antennas a little bit

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.830
and see if the signal
goes away, and then

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.080
point it back at the star
and see if it comes back.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.790
You'd say, well, that's
looking promising.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.790
You do that again, go
off, go on, go off, go on.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.960
If you do that five or 10
times, you start to get excited.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.960
I hope that that day
will come very soon.
