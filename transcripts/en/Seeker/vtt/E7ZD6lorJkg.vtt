00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.780
Eggs come in a variety of colours -- white,
brown, blue, green, and speckled.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.700
The difference in shell pigmentation is superficial,
but the reasons are genetic and evolutionary,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.970
dating all the way back to dinosaurs.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.140
Let’s start with the familiar white and
brown chicken eggs.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.429
You might have a preference, but one doesn’t
have more protein or a better taste than the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.699
other, though brown eggs tend to have slightly
more Omega-3 fatty acids.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.479
Brown eggs also come from larger chickens
that cost more to maintain, which is why those

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.130
eggs are a little more expensive.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339
It’s not because they’re way better.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.840
Brown eggs get their color from a biochemical
pigment called protoporphyrin formed by blood

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.380
cells breaking down.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.700
And of course biochemical pigments are due
to genetics.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.600
White-feathered chickens with white earlobes
called Leghorn chickens lay white eggs while

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020
one type of red or brown chickens with red
earlobes called Orpingtons lay brown eggs.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.580
But, it gets weirder.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.660
The Ameraucana breed lays blue eggs, giving
it the nickname of the Easter egg chicken.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.510
Olive Eggers, a cross between a hen and rooster
that are from a brown egg and a blue egg laying

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.770
breed, lays olive green eggs.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.909
In each case, the pigment is deposited on
the egg as it moves through the hen’s oviduct,

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.319
fairly late in the shell-forming process -- the
last 3 to 6 hours of a 20 to 26 hour process

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.079
-- so the color doesn’t actually pass through
the shell.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.100
If you look at the inside of the shell of
a brown egg after you crack it, the inside

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520
is white, not brown like the outside.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.860
But aside from genetics, there are other factors
that can influence an individual egg’s pigment.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.299
A bigger egg would need more pigment to cover
it, so if the hen only releases a set amount,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.799
that egg can be lighter.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.429
An older hen will generally lay lighter eggs.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.670
The egg can rotate as it moves through the
hen, too, meaning pigment can be unevenly

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670
distributed.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.090
Stress on the hen can lead to less pigment
and a lighter egg as well.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.320
As for the more interesting colors we see,
such as the blue eggs, the color comes from

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.090
a pigment called oocyanin, a by-product of
bile production.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.630
But there's an evolutionary advantage to blue
eggs, since birds like robins and emus lay

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.710
their eggs in an open nest.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.759
The blue pigment filters out UV light, protecting
the egg from sunlight and stopping it from

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.759
overheating.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.350
The darker blue eggs are generally found in
environments where there’s less direct sunlight;

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.670
the darker pigment absorbs more sunlight to
warm the egg.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.290
Speckled eggs, meanwhile, have inherent protection
from predators, offering a bit of camouflage

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.060
while they sit in a nest.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.190
This explains why other egg-laying animals
lay unpigmented eggs, like turtles.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.070
Turtles bury their eggs in a protected nest
so don’t need the UV protection or camouflage.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.800
This all has led scientist to conclude that
egg colours came about around the time that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.890
species starting laying eggs in uncovered
nests rather than bury them, something dinosaurs

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.790
species like Ovirapt--- like these were known
to do.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.480
So which ever eggs you choose to buy, you’re
making an egg-cellent choice.

Speaking of dinosaur eggs, Trace can tell
you what we can learn from them in this video

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.540
right here.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.340
Thanks for sticking around till the end!

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.720
Speaking of sticking and egg colours, fish
eggs are coloured depending on the female,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.319
not the species!
