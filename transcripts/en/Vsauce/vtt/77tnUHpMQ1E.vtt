00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.300
Here's a guy whose mouth can sound like
an engine.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.600
And this woman can be a human

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.760
car alarm.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
But are those the best mouth noises

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.200
of all-time?
And better yet, what happened to my beard?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.050
Well, to figure out the answer to this one,
you'll have to wait for 'The Key of Awesome's'

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.759
new music video on Thursday.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.050
But don't let it distract you, ladies.
Let's focus on the mouth

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.370
and mouth noises and the best of all time.
All aboard the boat.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.989
Here's an old man who can do a monkey and

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.600
a horse.
On the aquatic side, here's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.060
a dolphin woman.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.690
This guy can mimic the sound of a pistol reloading.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040
And if you want something wetter,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.530
this kid opens and pours a can of coke.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.600
When things get awkward, call over Fletcher901

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.740
who can give you some great cricket
noises to fill the silence.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.760
Competitive whistelers

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.050
are incredible.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.380
One of the neatest

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.510
whistle tricks I've seen is the ability
to whistle through two or more

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.720
openings in your mouth, so you can make
multiple tones and harmonize

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.160
with yourself.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.540
Of course, beat boxers are some of the most famous
noisemakers on YouTube.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.659
Some newer clips

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.979
show beat boxers during dub step sounds,
like Reeps One.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.499
Links, by the way, to all these noises are in 
the description below.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.110
Also worth a listen is Mastamicbeatbox.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.300
And Slizzer.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.430
I mean, look how much fun this guy's having.
While you're jamming to that, I wanna

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.560
invite you into my own little

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560
experiment. On Thursday, the next Vsauce video
on this channel will come out at

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.540
exactly

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.970
6 p.m. Eastern.
The first 100 people to get there and comment the word

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.010
"Boooyerz" will get a YouTube message specially

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.800
from me.
So you have to be there right at 6 p.m.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.840
Let's see what happens.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.720
And as always,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.800
thanks for watching.
