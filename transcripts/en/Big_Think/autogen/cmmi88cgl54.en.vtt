contractile activity of our gut changes

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230
contractile activity of our gut changes
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.980
contractile activity of our gut changes
to a very unique pattern it's a

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.310
contractions migrate from the esophagus
all the way down to the end of our large

all the way down to the end of our large
 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.480
all the way down to the end of our large
intestine and there they move very

intestine and there they move very
 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.339
intestine and there they move very
slowly

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349

they've have been so this has been

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850
they've have been so this has been
 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.400
they've have been so this has been
referred to as the intestinal

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410
referred to as the intestinal

referred to as the intestinal
housekeeper that sort of cleans the gut

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079
housekeeper that sort of cleans the gut
 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.930
housekeeper that sort of cleans the gut
from any residue that's present and the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940
from any residue that's present and the
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.939
from any residue that's present and the
rhythm for that is generated by the

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949
rhythm for that is generated by the
 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.889
rhythm for that is generated by the
brain so it's dependent on the input of

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899
brain so it's dependent on the input of
 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.349
brain so it's dependent on the input of
the vagus nerve on the on the second

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359
the vagus nerve on the on the second
 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.629
the vagus nerve on the on the second
brain and in the gut and this has been

brain and in the gut and this has been
 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.849
brain and in the gut and this has been
something that also should occur when

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859
something that also should occur when
 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.639
something that also should occur when
during daytime when in between meals

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649
during daytime when in between meals
 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.799
during daytime when in between meals
when our stomach and intestinal system

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809
when our stomach and intestinal system
 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.859
when our stomach and intestinal system
is is empty however with the sort of

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869
is is empty however with the sort of
 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.940
is is empty however with the sort of
modern habit of snacking between meals

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
modern habit of snacking between meals
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.840
modern habit of snacking between meals
so a lot of people don't have that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
so a lot of people don't have that
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.280
so a lot of people don't have that
during the day but have it during sleep

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
during the day but have it during sleep
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.580
during the day but have it during sleep
if you add the microbes into this now

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
if you add the microbes into this now
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.670
if you add the microbes into this now
it's it's quite likely I'm not really

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680
it's it's quite likely I'm not really
 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.760
it's it's quite likely I'm not really
proving it I mean the microbes obey some

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770
proving it I mean the microbes obey some
 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.810
proving it I mean the microbes obey some
kind of a circadian rhythm by themselves

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820
kind of a circadian rhythm by themselves
 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.580
kind of a circadian rhythm by themselves
so they're different during sleep and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
so they're different during sleep and
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.080
so they're different during sleep and
during daytime but it's it's quite

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
during daytime but it's it's quite
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.240
during daytime but it's it's quite
plausible to assume that this powerful

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250
plausible to assume that this powerful
 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.800
plausible to assume that this powerful
wave that sort of cleans everything out

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
wave that sort of cleans everything out
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.140
wave that sort of cleans everything out
will also affect the microbes the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150
will also affect the microbes the
 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.410
will also affect the microbes the
composition of the microbes because if

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420
composition of the microbes because if
 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.970
composition of the microbes because if
we don't have it so people that don't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980
we don't have it so people that don't
 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.890
we don't have it so people that don't
have that for some for some reason they

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900
have that for some for some reason they
 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.840
have that for some for some reason they
will develop abnormal quona sation for

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
will develop abnormal quona sation for
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.550
will develop abnormal quona sation for
example of their small bowel with a lot

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
example of their small bowel with a lot
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320
example of their small bowel with a lot
of microbes that don't really belong

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330
of microbes that don't really belong
 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.649
of microbes that don't really belong
there so clearly an important role in

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659
there so clearly an important role in
 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.560
there so clearly an important role in
regulating the populations and the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
regulating the populations and the
 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.690
regulating the populations and the
regional distribution of these microbes

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
regional distribution of these microbes
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.809
regional distribution of these microbes
now God what happens to in sleeps are

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819
now God what happens to in sleeps are
 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.259
now God what happens to in sleeps are
doing during REM sleep and so when we

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269
doing during REM sleep and so when we
 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.089
doing during REM sleep and so when we
have

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099
 
 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.580
 
in a lot of activity going on within the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
in a lot of activity going on within the
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100
in a lot of activity going on within the
autonomic nervous system circuits within

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
autonomic nervous system circuits within
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.949
autonomic nervous system circuits within
the brain and the signals are being sent

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
the brain and the signals are being sent
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.040
the brain and the signals are being sent
to the gut so our body is inhibited but

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
to the gut so our body is inhibited but
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.660
to the gut so our body is inhibited but
not not our intestinal activity so in in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
not not our intestinal activity so in in
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.839
not not our intestinal activity so in in
in many ways emotions that we see

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849
in many ways emotions that we see
 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.870
in many ways emotions that we see
visually that we experience visually in

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
visually that we experience visually in
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.900
visually that we experience visually in
our dreams have their mirror image in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
our dreams have their mirror image in
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.440
our dreams have their mirror image in
terms of got activity contractions

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450
terms of got activity contractions
 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.660
terms of got activity contractions
secretions and again I mean this like

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
secretions and again I mean this like
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.220
secretions and again I mean this like
everything that goes on within our brain

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
everything that goes on within our brain
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.949
everything that goes on within our brain
emotionally always is reflected just

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
emotionally always is reflected just
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.900
emotionally always is reflected just
like our facial expression reflects our

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
like our facial expression reflects our
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.220
like our facial expression reflects our
emotions everything if reflects our

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230
emotions everything if reflects our
 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.660
emotions everything if reflects our
emotional state either during waking

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
emotional state either during waking
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.030
emotional state either during waking
time or sleep time at the gut level and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
time or sleep time at the gut level and
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.140
time or sleep time at the gut level and
the microbes will live in that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
the microbes will live in that
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.350
the microbes will live in that
environment or affected by it so it's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
environment or affected by it so it's
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.780
environment or affected by it so it's
it's an area that's not studied in great

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
it's an area that's not studied in great
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.920
it's an area that's not studied in great
detail but probably very important for

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930
detail but probably very important for
 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.729
detail but probably very important for
an understanding of how the microbes the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
an understanding of how the microbes the
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.940
an understanding of how the microbes the
gut and the brain interact and maintain

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
gut and the brain interact and maintain
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.879
gut and the brain interact and maintain
health so sleep is a very important

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889
health so sleep is a very important
 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.190
health so sleep is a very important
ingredient for for health regulation of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200
ingredient for for health regulation of
 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.449
ingredient for for health regulation of
the immune system but probably also

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459
the immune system but probably also
 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.979
the immune system but probably also
regulation of the of gut function and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
regulation of the of gut function and
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.300
regulation of the of gut function and
particularly got microbial integrity and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
particularly got microbial integrity and
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.960
particularly got microbial integrity and
well-being we know quite a bit about

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970
well-being we know quite a bit about
 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.569
well-being we know quite a bit about
what happens during sleep and then

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579
what happens during sleep and then
 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.030
what happens during sleep and then
during dreaming you know in

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
during dreaming you know in
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.009
during dreaming you know in
psychoanalysis this is a big window into

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019
psychoanalysis this is a big window into
 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.910
psychoanalysis this is a big window into
our emotional life so you know union or

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920
our emotional life so you know union or
 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.030
our emotional life so you know union or
in Freudian psychoanalysis have spent a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
in Freudian psychoanalysis have spent a
 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.830
in Freudian psychoanalysis have spent a
lot of time interpreting dreams and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840
lot of time interpreting dreams and
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.050
lot of time interpreting dreams and
getting an access to this to this

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060
getting an access to this to this
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.660
getting an access to this to this
process a big portion is probably the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670
process a big portion is probably the
 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.410
process a big portion is probably the
the processing and consolidation of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420
the processing and consolidation of
 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.839
the processing and consolidation of
memories that have been experienced

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849
memories that have been experienced
 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.190
memories that have been experienced
during the day many of these of these

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
during the day many of these of these
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.009
during the day many of these of these
memories have a gut feeling component so

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
memories have a gut feeling component so
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.110
memories have a gut feeling component so
because every time we have an emotion

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
because every time we have an emotion
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.990
because every time we have an emotion
during the day there's always a

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000
during the day there's always a
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.279
during the day there's always a
counterpart at the gut level that is

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289
counterpart at the gut level that is
 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.980
counterpart at the gut level that is
then through these sensory pathways goes

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
then through these sensory pathways goes
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.930
then through these sensory pathways goes
back to the brain we may not experience

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
back to the brain we may not experience
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.680
back to the brain we may not experience
it during the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
it during the
 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.930
it during the
a time but it's encoded in this vast

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
a time but it's encoded in this vast
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.090
a time but it's encoded in this vast
database within the brain so what

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100
database within the brain so what
 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.210
