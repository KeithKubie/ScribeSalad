00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:02.880
- [Voiceover] "Kaylee wants
to do well in her classes,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.678
"so she is budgeting her
time carefully to decide the

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.965
"number of classes, c,
she will take this year.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:11.101
"For each class that she takes,

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.923
"she expects to spend two and a half hours

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:17.142
"each week working on homework.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.463
"She expects to spend an
additional six and a half

00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:22.481
"hours each week completing
the assigned reading

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.140
"for all of her classes together.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.599
"If Kaylee has 19 hours
available each week

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.279
"to complete homework and
reading for her classes,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.937
"which equation best
models the situation?"

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:39.697
Alright, so she has a total
of 19 hours available.

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:42.878
She has 19 hours available,
and she needs to...

00:00:42.878 --> 00:00:45.200
She has 19 hours available each week

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.861
to complete homework.

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.099
To complete homework and
reading for her classes.

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:51.597
So how much time is it going to take her

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:53.397
to complete the homework?

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:55.369
Well it says that she expects
to spend two and a half

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.179
hours each week working on homework,

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.874
well actually I should say over here,

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:03.089
for each class that she
takes she expects to spend

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.899
two and a half hours each
week working on homework.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.768
Let me underline that.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.508
For each class that she takes

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:12.970
she expects to spend two
and a half hours each week

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.315
working on homework.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.695
So it's going to be two and a half,

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:21.695
two and a half hours each week per class.

00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:23.418
Now how many classes is she taking?

00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:25.553
Well she's gonna take c classes.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:26.911
She's gonna take c classes,

00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.187
so the total amount that
she spends on homework.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:32.611
So the amount that she spends on homework

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.432
is going to be two and a half times c.

00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:36.988
I'll put it in parenthesis
just to make it clear

00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:38.916
what I'm doing here, so
it's gonna be two and a half

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.854
times c is the amount
she spends on homework.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.327
And how much is she
gonna spend on reading?

00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:46.496
Well, it says over...

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:49.491
Says over here she expects
to spend an additional

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.650
six and a half hours each week,

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:54.646
completing the assigned
reading for all of her

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:55.900
classes together.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.421
So this sentence says it
doesn't matter how many

00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.126
classes she takes, she's
gonna spend six and a half

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:01.578
hours reading.

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:04.224
So, it's not dependent on the number

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.559
of classes she takes.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.103
So this is the amount of time

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:09.285
she's just gonna spend reading.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.980
And so the amount she spends on homework

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.676
plus the amount she spends on reading

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.660
need to add up to 19 hours.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.879
So which of these choices are what I just

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.225
wrote over here?

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.616
So let's see, they have
the 19 on the other side.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:23.299
Let's see, they have two and one half c

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.516
minus six and half.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:26.120
No that's not this right over here.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.964
Two and one half c plus six and a half.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:30.496
Yep, that's what we have over here

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:31.761
is equal to 19.

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.665
Yep, that's this choice.

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.533
The only difference between this and what

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.784
I wrote is they just swapped the two sides

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.222
of the equality, which you can always do.

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:42.813
These other choices let's see.

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.681
Six and a half times c.

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:45.912
Well this would imply
they're just spending

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:48.454
six and a half hours per
class so that's not right.

00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:50.532
And then this is also
six and a half times c,

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:52.907
so that's not gonna work out either.
