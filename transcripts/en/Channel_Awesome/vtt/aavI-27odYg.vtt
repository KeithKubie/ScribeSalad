"Lady and the Tramp" was one of the first movies I ever saw in theaters.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.500
So naturally, I loved it when I was a little kid.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.220
The story of an upper-class female dog that comes across a lowdown, scroungy male dog is about as typical as it gets.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.800
At first, they don't like each other, but a few situations force them together, and as they get to hang out more, they really decide that they're meant for each other.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.600
There's some differences to this usual story that I like.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.580
Like the fact that I enjoy when they first see each other, it's not love at first sight, like so many other Disney films.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.920
If anything, he just sees her in passing and just strikes up a conversation.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.900
And it's not even a pleasant conversation.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.920
He's talkin' about how a baby's gonna take over her life and that she's never gonna be the center of attention anymore.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.260
And then he just leaves.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.040
Honestly, if you didn't know the story going in, you probably wouldn't have guessed they'd be together by the end.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.360
I sort of liked that.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.260
There's also a bunch of clever little touches, too, like I enjoy how the dogs interpret everything.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.940
Like how the main character thinks that the name of her owners are "Jim Dear" and "Darling."

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120
Simply because that's what they call each other all the time.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.960
-"Oh, darling!"
-"In the kitchen, Jim, dear."

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.000
-As Disney films go, it's cute.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.500
Nothing that spectacular.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.280
It keeps your interest, you wanna know what's gonna happen, but there's no real big surprises or any phenomenal bits of animation or--

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.800
well, just anything that really stands out that much.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.260
But for what it is, it's a decent film.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.280
It did give us that great Siamese song--though, I don't know, is that racist...now...too--I'm not sure.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
But it's the one song everybody hums when they're leaving the theater, so that's gotta count for something.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.160
-[singing] "We are Siamese if you please. *purrs*
"We are Siamese if you don't please. *low purr*"

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.680
-It is nice that they don't go for a straight-up villain in the movie or any of those forced story cliches.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.340
Well, except maybe one or two.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.740
But they're pretty downplayed.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.180
The movie's pretty much just a series of moments.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.520
But they're nice moments, and I don't recall them ever being really boring.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.340
So overall, I think it's okay.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.920
I don't think it's one I'll be watching over and over like the other Disney films, but it holds up decent.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.700
If you're a dog lover--or if even not--check it out. It's worth an hour and a half of your time.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.180
-[singing] "On this lovely bella notte."
