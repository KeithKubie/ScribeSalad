00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.837
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.090
<i>- Protecting a pope who wants
to be accessible to the public</i>

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.550
is never an easy task.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.260
<i>Unlike other world leaders</i>

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.220
<i>who are very conscious
of their threat,</i>

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.556
<i>the pope feels
that it's part of his mission</i>

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.141
<i>to be a man of the people,</i>

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.392
especially this pope.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.852
- The security
is given the task

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.103
of protecting him,
and they're saying,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.604
"Well, how can we protect you

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.440
<i>if you get out of that car?"</i>

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.608
<i>And he's saying, "Well,
how can I be with the people</i>

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.777
<i>unless I do get out
of the car?"</i>

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:31.614
- The protection of the pope
has a rich history to it.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.867
<i>During the assassination
attempt of John Paul II,</i>

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.412
<i>the popemobile was simply
a jeep-type vehicle</i>

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.997
<i>with a roll bar,
and the pope</i>

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.458
<i>would stand on a platform
and wave.</i>

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.959
<i>[gunshot]</i>

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.711
<i>Because of the assassination
attempt,</i>

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.671
<i>they built a vehicle that,
one, was armored;</i>

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.841
<i>two, rose him on a platform
surrounded by plexiglass.</i>

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.676
<i>So he was still
in an open top,</i>

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.178
<i>but if shots rang out,</i>

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.305
<i>they'd be likely
to shoot from below,</i>

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.265
<i>and they'd be hitting
the plexi.</i>

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.184
It would give the Swiss Guard
the opportunity

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:03.313
<i>to pull him down off the steps
and protect him.</i>

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.440
This would be great if Francis
was willing to use it.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.487

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.988
<i>- Pope Francis didn't want</i>

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.532
<i>to be behind
bulletproof glass,</i>

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.534
so his popemobile is often

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.329
<i>just in the back of kind of
a pickup truck, essentially,</i>

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.080
<i>going through the crowds.</i>

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.792
When he travels, Pope Francis
likes to be in a FIAT

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.544
or in sort of
a cheap moderate car

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.380
<i>because he doesn't want
to be seen in a fancy car.</i>

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.381
- So the United States
Secret Service

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.549
had a challenge in this.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.384
<i>The pope visited us in 2015,</i>

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.638
<i>the first stop being
Washington, D.C.</i>

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.223
<i>Protecting the president
of the United States,</i>

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.058
<i>of course,
is a very complicated job.</i>

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.851
<i>But in a lot of ways,</i>

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.395
<i>protecting the pope
is a lot more complicated.</i>

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:47.857
<i>The FIAT in question that
he rode in was not armored.</i>

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.401
<i>Matter of fact, it was donated
by a local dealer.</i>

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.239
<i>It's a small FIAT 500
four-door hatchback,</i>

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.409
which is not the norm
in a Secret Service motorcade.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.828
Therefore, what they had to do

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:02.080
was flank the vehicle
on either side

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.999
<i>by armored
Secret Service SUVs.</i>

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.085
<i>They were Chevy Suburbans.</i>

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.588
<i>And in doing so,
they created, basically,</i>

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.842
a block that, if someone
was to attack the motorcade,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.094
they could converge on
and get him out of there.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.554
<i>- As long as he can
touch the people,</i>

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.013
<i>as long as he can
kiss the babies,</i>

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:20.723
<i>as long as he can
shake the hands</i>

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:23.017
<i>of the elderly
and of the disabled people,</i>

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:26.229
he really doesn't care
if he's safe or not.
