1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.810
Well,
it's,

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.930
that's another thing about having the limited amount of weight classes when you

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.720
jump up your chances.
Crazy man.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.640
He's like one 74 one 75 on fight day.
Yeah.
If I can guys one 90 yeah.

5
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.760
But with a lot of energy.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Is it his age?

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.740
I think it's probably good meals.
Yeah.

7
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.040
I think it's probably a good move though at his age.
You know,

8
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.170
I think he's back from UFC ultimate fighter one inside.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.600
We knew though,
like on the show that he was the one they would go forever.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.690
We'd be with a house that I know he's just crazy.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.150
Tuesday ASM still very gotta stop.

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.120
I mean when w when he beat Micky Gall that way I was,

13
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.380
I was incredibly impressed when I'm like,
this kid might test him.

14
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:41.130
He didn't test him at all.
I mean it was amazing.

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.660
So Prime Diego Sanchez performance 15 years into the game.

16
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
I mean just even,
not even just into,
that's just into the UFC.

17
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.040
He had an amateur fights and our professional fights,
rather before the UFC,

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.710
he spent in the UFC for 15 years,
or at least 14.
Right?

19
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
2004.
2005 was season one.
We shot it 2004.

20
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.980
2005 so yeah.
What's up?
Get somewhere somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years.

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.910
Just amazing that he's so enthusiastic about it still.
Yeah.

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.360
They'll give them a vase for his top of his mantle piece on it.

23
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.280
But this fire or something,

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.770
carriage clock or something just to recognize the 15 years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
um,

25
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
that's a long time in a combat sport.
Long time.

26
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.410
So that's the other thing,
man,
that is not the norm.
That's a deviation,
right.

27
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.940
Either you got it for,
I made it nine years in the UFC,
eight years actually.

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.900
And you know,
I didn't have that many fights.
I broke down.
I fall apart.

29
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.660
It's pretty average,
you know,
I was like,
Whoa,
is me?

30
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:43.860
And then when you look at the data,
it's like,
oh no,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm just average 35.

31
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.930
That's when you start fall apart when you.
