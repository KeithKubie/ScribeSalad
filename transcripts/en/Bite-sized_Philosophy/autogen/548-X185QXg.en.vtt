something well you know there there is
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.830
something well you know there there is
of course decent evidence that there are

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
of course decent evidence that there are
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
of course decent evidence that there are
socio-cultural effects on IQ I mean the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
socio-cultural effects on IQ I mean the
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660
socio-cultural effects on IQ I mean the
Flynn effect which is named after the

man who described the the phenomena
indicates that the average IQ has been

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740
indicates that the average IQ has been
 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.990
indicates that the average IQ has been
increasing quite substantially over the

increasing quite substantially over the
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.459
increasing quite substantially over the
last hundred years and the reason for

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
last hundred years and the reason for
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.789
last hundred years and the reason for
that no one knows for sure but one of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
that no one knows for sure but one of
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.650
that no one knows for sure but one of
the putative reasons for that is that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
the putative reasons for that is that
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080
the putative reasons for that is that
we've lifted the bottom out of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
we've lifted the bottom out of
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.110
we've lifted the bottom out of

so there aren't people whose IQs are

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489
so there aren't people whose IQs are
 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.229
so there aren't people whose IQs are
stunted by my exposure to zero

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239

malnutrition everybody zero information

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010

yeah exactly so we've we've wiped out in

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
yeah exactly so we've we've wiped out in
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.119
yeah exactly so we've we've wiped out in
many ways we've wiped out the worst

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129
many ways we've wiped out the worst
 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.369
many ways we've wiped out the worst
effects of privation and that's

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379
effects of privation and that's
 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.009
effects of privation and that's
increasingly true as well on on the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019
increasingly true as well on on the
 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.630
increasingly true as well on on the
worldwide scale world stage you know

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640
worldwide scale world stage you know
 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.920
worldwide scale world stage you know
there's about a hundred and fifty

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
there's about a hundred and fifty
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.690
there's about a hundred and fifty
thousand people a day right now being

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
thousand people a day right now being
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.150
thousand people a day right now being
lifted out of absolute poverty by UN

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160
lifted out of absolute poverty by UN
 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.339
lifted out of absolute poverty by UN
standards the fastest improvement in the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.819
history of the world by a huge margin
and also about three hundred thousand

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829
and also about three hundred thousand
 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.650
and also about three hundred thousand
people a day being hooked up to the

people a day being hooked up to the
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.960
people a day being hooked up to the
electrical grid so we are making some

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
electrical grid so we are making some
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.460

removing the absolute privation problem

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629
removing the absolute privation problem
 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.080
removing the absolute privation problem
which is an oath reveal problem the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
which is an oath reveal problem the
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.910
which is an oath reveal problem the
problem with most of the attempts to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920
problem with most of the attempts to
 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.490
problem with most of the attempts to
raise IQ is that they don't change the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
raise IQ is that they don't change the
 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.650
raise IQ is that they don't change the
variance in IQ they tend to raise the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
variance in IQ they tend to raise the
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.600
variance in IQ they tend to raise the
average IQ across the population and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610
average IQ across the population and
 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.509
average IQ across the population and
that leaves the inequality I I Q

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
that leaves the inequality I I Q
 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.340
that leaves the inequality I I Q
inequality problem basically untouched

so there have been studies trying to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
so there have been studies trying to
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.729
so there have been studies trying to
estimate how much socio-economic

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739
estimate how much socio-economic
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.500
estimate how much socio-economic
pressure let's say you have to place on

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510
pressure let's say you have to place on
 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.069
pressure let's say you have to place on
an individual to raise their IQ lowering

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079
an individual to raise their IQ lowering
 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.379
an individual to raise their IQ lowering
it's easy right because make them

from the 5th percentile of socioeconomic
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.559
from the 5th percentile of socioeconomic
status to the 95th percentile so you

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.509

so it makes it difficult to look

let me get what about the video gaming I
 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.450
let me get what about the video gaming I
mean I know there has been this

now why that is and even this it's even
