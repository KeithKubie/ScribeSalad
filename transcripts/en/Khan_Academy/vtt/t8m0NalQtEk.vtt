00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.250
Let's start with a warm-up
problem to avoid getting

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.050
any mental cramps as
we learn new things.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.490
So this is a problem that
hopefully, if you understood

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.400
what we did in the last video,
you can kind of understand what

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.800
we're about to do right now.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.320
And I'm going to
escalate it even more.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.590
In the last video I think
we finished what a

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.420
four-digit number times
a one-digit number.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's up the stakes to
a five-digit number.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.940
Let's do 64,329 times-- let
me think of a nice number.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.140
Times 4.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.770
I'm going to show you right now
that we're going to do the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.740
exact same process that we
did in the last video.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.260
We just have to do it a little
bit longer than we did before.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.100
So we just start off saying,
OK, what's 4 times 9?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.260
4 times 9 is equal to 36.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.560
Right?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.410
18 times 2.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.420
Yep, 36.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.280
So we write the 6 down here,
carry the 3 up there.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
Just put the 3 up there,
then you got 4 times 2.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.930
And they're going to
have to add the 3.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.110
So let me just
write that there.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.590
Plus 3 is equal to-- you do
the multiplication first.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.990
You can even think of it as
order of operations, but you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.050
just should know that you do
the multiplication first.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.310
So 4 times 2 is 8.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
Plus 3 is equal to 11.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.370
Put this 1 down here and put
the one 10 and 11 up there.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.080
Then you got 4 times 3.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.440
You got that one up there, so
you're going to have to add

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.740
that plus 1 is equal to--
that's going to equal 12.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.750
Plus 1, which is equal to 13.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.120
So it's 13.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.190
Then you have 4 times 4.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.270
You have this little one
hanging out here from the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.650
previous multiplications,
so you're going to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.850
to have to add that.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.060
And that's equal to 16 plus 1.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.310
It's equal to 17.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.680
Stick the 7 down here,
put the 1 up there.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.040
We're almost done.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.650
And then we have 4 times 6.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.640
Plus 1.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.310
What is that?

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.740
4 times 6 is 24.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.930
Plus 1 is 25.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.330
Put the 5 down here.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.630
There's no where to put the 2.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200
There's no more multiplications
to do, so we just put

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.680
the 2 down there.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:44.940
So 64,329 is 257,316.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.660
And in case you're wondering,
these commas don't mean much.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.460
They just help me
read the number.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.210
So I put it after every 3
digits, so I know that for

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.435
example, that everything
after this-- so s is 7,000.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.920
If I had another comma
here, this is millions.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.050
So it just helps me read
the problem a bit.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.330
So if you got that you're now
ready to escalate to a slightly

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.840
more complicated situation.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.650
Although the first way that
we're going to do it it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.270
actually not going to look
any more complicated.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.790
It's just going to
involve one more step.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.140
So everything we've done so
far are a bunch of digits

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.090
times a one-digit number.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.910
Now let's do a bunch of digits
times a two-digit number.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.450
So let's say we want to
multiply 36 times-- instead of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.920
putting a one-digit number here
I'm going to put a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.140
two-digit number.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.305
So times 23.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.380
So you start off doing this
problem exactly the way you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.250
would have done it if there
was just a 3 down here.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.190
You can kind of ignore
the 2 for a little bit.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.270
So 3 times 6 is equal to 18.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.070
So you just put the 8 here, put
the 10 there, or the 1 there

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.890
because it's 10 plus 8.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.160
3 times 3 is 9.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.640
Plus 1, so 3 times 3 plus
1 is equal to-- that's 9

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.102
plus 1 is equal to 10.

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:08.080
So you put the 10 there.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.200
There's nothing left.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.060
You put the 0 there.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.700
There's nothing left to put the
1, so you put the 10 there.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.300
So you essentially have solved
the problem that 36-- let me

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.930
do this is another color.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.500
That 36 times 3
is equal to 108.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.360
That's what we've solved
so far, but we have this

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360
20 sitting out here.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.100
We have this 20.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.950
We have to figure out
what 20 times 360 is.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.880
Or sorry, what 20 times 36 is.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.660
This 2 is really a 20.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.730
And to make it all work out
like that, what we do is

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.200
we throw a 0 down here.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.180
We throw a 0 right there.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.140
In a second I'm going
to explain why

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.680
exactly we did that.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.620
So let's just do the
same process as we did

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.280
before with the 3.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.460
Now we do it with a 2, but
we start filling up here

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.110
and move to the left.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.510
So 2 times 6.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.730
That's easy.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.640
That's 12.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.460
So 2 times 6 is 12.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.370
We put the 1 up here and we
have to be very careful because

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.570
we had this 1 from our previous
problem, which doesn't

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.460
apply anymore.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.210
So we could erase it or that
1 we could get rid of.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.170
If you have an eraser get rid
of it, or you can just keep

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.810
track in your head that the 1
you're about to write

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.130
is a different 1.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.440
So what were we doing?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.970
We wrote 2 times 6 is 12.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.070
Put the 2 here.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.460
Put the 1 up here.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.210
And I got rid of the previous
1 because that would've

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.630
just messed me up.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.160
Now I have 2 times 3.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.620
2 times 3 is equal to 6.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.030
But then I have this plus 1 up
here, so I have to add plus 1.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.550
So I get 7.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.560
So that is equal to 7.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.440
2 times 3 plus 1 is equal to 7.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.250
So this 720 we just solved,
that's literally-- let

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.100
me write that down.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.710
What is that?

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.910
That is 36 times 20.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.100
36 times 20 is equal to 720.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.740
And hopefully that should
explain why we had to

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.470
throw this 0 here.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.390
If we didn't throw that 0 here
we would have just a 2--

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.810
we would just have a 72
here, instead of 720.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.640
And 72 is 36 times 2.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.990
But this isn't a 2.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.920
This is a 2 in the 10's place.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.110
This is a 20.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.270
So we have to multiply
36 times 20, and that's

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.150
why we got 720 there.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.810
So 36 times 23.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.790
Let's write it this way.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.560
Let me get some space up here.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.770
So we could write 30-- well,
actually, let me just finish

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.400
the problem and then I'll
explain to you why it worked.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.000
So now to finish it up
we just add 108 to 720.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.300
So 8 plus 0 is 8.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.970
0 plus 2 is 2.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.650
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.350
So 36 times 23 is 828.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.740
Now you're saying Sal,
why did that work?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.720
why were we able to figure out
separately 36 times 3 is equal

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.190
to 108, and then 36 times 20 is
equal to 720, and then

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.110
add them up like that?

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.340
Because we could have rewritten
the problem like this.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.670
We could have rewritten
the problem as 36-- the

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.320
original problem was this.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.770
We could have rewritten this
as 36 times 20 plus 3.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.560
And this, and I don't know if
you've learned the distributive

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.150
property yet, but this is just
the distributive property.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:38.630
This is just the same thing as
36 times 20 plus 36 times 3.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.720
If that confuses you, then you
don't have to worry about it.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.740
But if it doesn't,
then this is good.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.330
It's actually teaching
you something.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.450
36 times 20 we saw was 720.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.520
We learned that 36
times 3 was 108.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.460
And when you added them
together we got what?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.150
828?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.720
Is that what we got?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.320
We got 828.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.060
And you could expand it
even more like we did

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.020
in the previous video.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:07.010
You could write this out as
30 plus 6 times 20 plus 3.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.350
Actually, let me just do it
that way because I think

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.100
that could help you
out a little bit.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.790
If it confuses you, ignore it.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.720
If it doesn't, that's good.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.160
So we could do it 3 times 6.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.570
3 times 6 is 18.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.450
18 is just 10 plus 8.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.670
So it's 8, then we
put a 10 up here.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.490
And ignore all this up here.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.450
3 times 30.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.580
3 times 30 is 90.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.890
90 plus 10 is 100.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.910
So 100 is zero 10's plus 100.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.510
I don't know if this
confuses you or not.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.750
If it does, ignore it.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.160
If it doesn't, well I don't
want to complicate the issue.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.430
And now we can multiply 20.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.110
We can ignore this thing
that we had before.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.680
20 times 6 is 120.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.950
So that's 20 plus 100.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.040
So I'll put that 100 up here.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.490
20 times 30 is 2 times 3 and
you have two 0's there.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.390
And I think I'm maybe jumping
the gun a little bit, assuming

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.240
a little bit too much of what
you may or may not know.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.010
But 20 times 30 is
going to be 600.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.350
and you add another hundred
there, that's 700.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.490
And then you add them all up.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.960
You get 800.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.480
100 plus 700.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.520
Plus 20 plus 8, which
is equal to 828.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.860
My point here is to show you
why that system we did worked.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.120
Why we added a 0
here to begin with.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.330
But if it confuses you, don't
worry about that right now.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.560
Learn how to do it and then
maybe re-watch this video.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.570
Let's just do a bunch of more
examples because I think the

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.460
examples are what really,
hopefully, explain

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.240
the situation.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.250
So let's do 77.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.910
Let's do a fun one.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.940
77 times 77.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.596
7 times 7 is 49.

00:09:59.596 --> 00:10:00.990
Put the 1 up here.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.300
7 times 7, well, that's 49.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.260
Plus 4 is 53.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.190
There's no where to put the
5, so we put it down here.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.980
7 times 7 is 49.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.600
Plus 4 is 53.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.680
Stick a 0 here.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.350
Now we're going to do this 7.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.910
So stick a 0 here.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.270
Let's get rid of this right
there because that'll

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.340
just mess us up.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.460
7 times 7 is 49.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.130
Stick a 9 there.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.670
Put a 4 there.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.140
7 times 7 is 49.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.620
Plus 4, which is 53.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.880
So notice, when we multiplied
7 times 77 we got 539.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.500
When we multiplied 70
times 77 we got 5,390.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.870
And it makes sense.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.750
They just differ by a 0.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.630
By a factor of 10.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.190
And now we can just add them
up, and what do we get?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.060
9 plus 0 is 9.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.950
3 plus 9 is 12.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.360
Carry the 1.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.050
1 plus 5 is 6.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.150
6 plus 3 is 9.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.750
Then we have this 5.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.660
So it's 5,929.
