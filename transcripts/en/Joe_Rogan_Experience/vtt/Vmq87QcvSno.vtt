00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.483
[inaudible]

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.920
<v 1>is it actually happening? Should it be all right ladies. Gentlemen,</v>

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.550
flight companion and started Brian couns in route. Brendan shops in the house.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.130
Eddie motherfucking bravo with the new haircut. Yep. I like it dude.

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.550
You're going straight up Tom Po as you grow up.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.540
Ponytail on the back of that motherfucker. All right.

7
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.130
If you've never listened to this before,

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.480
this is a podcast where we watched the fights and we talk. Shit,

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.130
we're day drinking. It's 11:15 AM Eddie Bravo hasn't cracked open one yet.

10
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:36.010
Here you go. I'm scared. I'm scared.

11
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.340
Especially Post Epstein is a lot of conspiracy. Glen in the circle.

12
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.560
What's the big deal? That's what I've been telling everybody. [inaudible] Tyson.

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.190
Mom's a fucking beast and he's about to fight Diego for Hara.

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.560
And that is an excellent fight. So if you never heard these before, we're just,

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.470
we talked shit while the fights are going on.

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.220
We kind of commentate on the fights, but not really. Let's be honest.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.300
It depends. Most of it's not. There's a very good fight. Um,

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.550
mayor back tie some off is a fucking killer.

19
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.390
Diego Ferera is a very good fighter too. So this is a,

20
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:13.570
this is a good fight and they're in Abu Dhabi. So you know,

21
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:16.240
when you think about a guy like tie some off, who's Muslim,

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.530
you gotta think that there's a lot of, lot of pride him fighting there,

23
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:23.320
but maybe a little bit of extra pressure home field advantage. Right.

24
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
So I don't know about home field advantage man.

25
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.260
Cause sometimes guys don't fight well when they're fighting in front of everyone

26
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:32.800
that they love and care for too much pressure and there's a lot more to worry

27
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:37.090
about. Did you hear, I forget what journalists is, cage side, but I guess the,

28
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.560
around the cage and the mat, it's hot as fuck. Oh, it's hot dude. No,

29
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.140
but they're saying it's like unheard of hot around there.

30
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.520
So as the rounds getting going, yeah, I think,

31
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.880
I think it could affect some of the fights. Most,

32
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.750
most people in most teams do play better with home field advantage.

33
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.580
It's kind of like, yeah, it's like you have no choice. You can't, you can't,

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.530
uh, crumble under the pressure.

35
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.920
It's like there's too many of your loved ones watching. You have no choice.

36
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:06.790
It's like some people just fold man tie some. I was looking good though.

37
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:11.100
Just landed a good left leg kick and a good one too. He's,

38
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.230
he's a solid fighter man, but he's one of those guys who's had a hard time.

39
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.430
I think he's had a hard time getting into the u s I think that's,

40
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.890
I think he was denied visas or something like that.

41
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.450
I would imagine a lot of these guys on this car did like Khabib's dad can't get

42
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.500
in, but he's in his corner for this site. Crazy.

43
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.230
What do they think he's going to do?

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.060
But the problem is he's got a tie to that guy from Chechnya. Tough. Yeah.

45
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.700
Oh Diego forever. Just cracked him.

46
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.220
Tossed him off as the St Barbara's Brian Callan.

47
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.800
Can we get the fights on this TV too? So Iris, cause I don't have to.

48
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.090
So you have to [inaudible] no, it's on apple TV

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.330
and my neck, Bro. You don't know where we're lying. I'm looking right now.

50
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:55.700
It says there's people watching, but I can't find it. So, but looking,

51
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.560
I'm looking. Are you watching it? Can you see it? I can see it on my thing.

52
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.130
My having

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.930
<v 2>a little bit of an issue with Youtube, ladies and gentlemen. Um,</v>

54
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.920
when you get it to me, uh, get it. Do me a favor. Um, give me a link. Just,

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.610
just, uh, tweet it or something and I'll retweet it.

56
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.260
Something, something, something. When I was over there, uh,

57
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.770
when Anderson Silva fought Damien Maya, it was hot as fuck. And it was outdoors.

58
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.450
So you, you were there. That's right. You went to, that was fun. That was

59
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.870
[inaudible] man. We for the UFC we had no choice. Yeah.

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.601
And you have to go at all.

61
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:33.100
Did you have to go to Oregon back then about it though? We were like, damn,

62
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.800
it's going to be honest. We were pumped, but bro,

63
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:36.850
there were bugs the size of dogs flat

64
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.270
like bugs I'd never saw before. Like I didn't even know existed.

65
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.510
I heard it's cool out there though. I heard it's a great, well,

66
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
Dubai is gorgeous and there's so much money.

67
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.680
Henslowe said it's like Las Vegas on steroids. He's hurt, he's hurt.

68
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
It's over for era's hurt. Oh really? Hurt. He's really hurt.

69
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
He's a smart dude though. He's, he's gonna, he's gonna stay away. Look,

70
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:03.390
he's popping out just to make sure that, uh,

71
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.340
he knows it's okay that he's, uh,

72
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.820
still still a dangerous fighter, but he's in, he's in real bad.

73
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.330
[inaudible] Baxter's 45 or 55 55 I believe.

74
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.290
I might be wrong, Jamie and find out for us.

75
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.790
I think Tyson, Mt. 50 55 for sure. Lightweight. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.870
55 Diego though. His Diego fought at 45 before.

77
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.313
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

78
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.290
<v 2>maybe I'm wrong. It's hard to tell man. There's so many fighters in the UFC now.</v>

79
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:38.580
It's just, it's so difficult to keep tracks on all, dude. How about Nate miles,

80
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.660
but all woo secured the bag. It's happening. Yeah.

81
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.370
Was it November 2nd Madison Square Garden November 2nd.

82
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.240
And they're still working on Colby and smog, but they're not though.

83
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.720
Cause they want to pay. Well they are trust don't they?

84
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.450
They don't want to pay Colby with Colby wants. Oh we cracked them again but did,

85
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.860
but the Dana said that that will be the main event.

86
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.550
They don't want to put a title fight above that. So then so, so there,

87
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:06.720
there's no way you'd make Kobe, you so Mazda, don't Nate Diaz is the main event.

88
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.780
Is that I'm almost positive Jim. That's,

89
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:12.720
I mean it's five rounds and Dana said he doesn't want to put a title fight above

90
00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:15.710
that. Well, if that's the case, then I figured it out. They're going to,

91
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.470
we are alive. They changed the fucking way it works now. Okay,

92
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:22.020
so is it Joe Rogan. Dot Live. Okay.

93
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.340
And Dana's making a belt for just for that. Like the people's champ belt. Oh,

94
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.390
like the streets not, well,

95
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.130
Nate says it's the baddest motherfucker in the game belt. Yeah, that's what,

96
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.640
that's what he's making. You got to say that on TV.

97
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.400
You can't say bad ass motherfucker in the game.

98
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.460
Maybe it's just like the hardcores belt, you know? That's the,

99
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:43.830
that's the fucking, I'm so happy they made that fight.

100
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.480
I didn't think it was going to happen. Dude. I got,

101
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.720
I didn't think was going to happen when I saw it on my Instagram feed this

102
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.730
morning. I threw my arms up in the air, like somebody got knocked out.

103
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:53.490
I was like, I want to sell you at the Improv. I was like,

104
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.260
I don't think it's going to happen. Then I was like,

105
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.090
I feel like Nate needs too much. It's just

106
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 1>too much. It's been cases, it's worth money. Well, you know,</v>

107
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.660
Dana said something, you know,

108
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.780
I'd said that I think that that Nate Diaz is one of the biggest superstars in

109
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:10.320
the game right up there with everybody. Z top five. Yes. And then Nate and Da,

110
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.160
I guess there was some negotiations or something cause Dana refuted. I goes,

111
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.180
well I don't think that Nate Diaz in our longterm plans and Nate fights once

112
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.390
every three years. And I'm like, don't say that.

113
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.330
That could be him playing the game though. Still trying to learn Nate out.

114
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.940
I'm just like, come on Nate. And also let them know that look,

115
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.120
we've got other plans. There's other shit we're doing. I just retweeted that.

116
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.830
Oh, you did? Okay. All right. What is the link? I don't know.

117
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.180
Is it the powerful Jerry Page? Yeah, it's on there,

118
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:39.710
but it's not that link we have. All right, hold on a second. Young Jane.

119
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.730
Um, I'm just excited, but I want Uzman versus uh,

120
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.070
versus Colby. That's the fight to make. Oh, 100%. That card stack though,

121
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.280
even without loosening Kobe,

122
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:56.540
I hope they worked that out cause I want to see that. But Mossville Nate,

123
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.900
you can just, I'll just buy that fight. I don't care who it, those two guys,

124
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.900
not only are the two the baddest motherfuckers ever, but they're funny as fuck.

125
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.420
They're both great. They're funny. They're both super necessary. Yeah.

126
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.220
All that shit. Three piece and a soda. I haven't, I named a move,

127
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.960
a transition three piece into such brilliant after Hamp, it's sober. It's,

128
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.100
and I showed it to him to learn this. I got to know that it's, yeah,

129
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:23.780
he's got to know three piece with the soda. That guy is so good. He's so good.

130
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.060
And so he's so clever. You know,

131
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.760
that's one of the best things to say about Matsuda.

132
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.620
And the thing is people don't necessarily associate him with knockout power for

133
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.880
some reason, but yet the guy knocked out Eve Edwards with a head kick.

134
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.130
He knocked out Darren tail cowboy Serone tell Ben asked grand and put him in

135
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:47.900
another dimension with a flying knee world record. Fastest knockout. I mean,

136
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.520
it's weird that people don't associate Mazda doll with the knockout artist

137
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.020
because he doesn't have, he doesn't necessarily have the most power,

138
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:00.770
but he's so good. It's so calculated the way he set up that knee.

139
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.060
Is this the the car? Yes. The Kelvin versa. Dan till's. Interesting.

140
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.940
Derek Lewis Lewis versa, a blog,

141
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.220
knee eve novel of Johnny Walker. Corey Anderson. Boy,

142
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.580
I forget, I forget how to say that guy's name. Blank goal. Have enough even off.

143
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.520
I think it's even even off. He's a scary dude.

144
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.220
He is that kind of scary yet staffed yet in the heart.

145
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.950
So he stabbed in a hurt coriander and Johnny Walker's a good fight. But dude,

146
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:28.820
Johnny Walker shoulder's still fucked up.

147
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.830
I just sent you that video of him working out. He's mobility's not great,

148
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.290
but he's also, he's throwing punches with only one arm.

149
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.240
He's not in the videos of him working out.

150
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:42.980
And then there's other videos of him going through strength and conditioning and

151
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.630
you see what he's doing with his left arm. And I'm like, Jesus crisis.

152
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.660
Like he's not lifting any weight with his left arm. Yeah,

153
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.880
hopefully he's all right. How Bout fricking a Kelvin verse till Oh, that's good.

154
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.190
Fight Hill was like, Nah

155
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 2>man, let me just go after these fucking monsters.</v>

156
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.310
Well he legitimately is a middle weight. I mean he,

157
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.510
that guy was killing himself making one 79 creed but y but the coming off the

158
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:08.690
two losses that he suffered and then you know, obviously the,

159
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.110
he had some issues while in Alabama and Liverpool and wherever Bali or whether

160
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:14.040
he ruined that hotel.

161
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.940
So he's going through something and then they just give him Frickin,

162
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.640
well I think he asked for Kelvin. I don't care. I'm a fan. I'm a fan too.

163
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:27.450
Fucking crazy. Both. Both those guys. Oh Kelvin's so good.

164
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:30.720
I think Kimber's style bender was my favorite. Middleweight fight of all time.

165
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.390
Just rock ties him off Bro. Tyson mops in a little bit of trouble right here

166
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.420
for Harris solid man. He solid. Oh, oh, tie some off. Might be in trouble.

167
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.440
Oh my God. He's winging shots at his face to that right and just barely missed.

168
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.260
Some guy gets starched on the prelims. Do ties him off.

169
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.080
It's in a little trouble here right now. He's laughing and puffing. Flat footed,

170
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.990
huffing and puffing. They said to him 99 degrees in there right now.

171
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.010
That is so ridiculous. Now is this had an outdoor arena? No,

172
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.550
I thought they built it for this. Right? Are they saving money on AC?

173
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:08.730
What the fuck? The first one? Yeah. This is the first event in the arena.

174
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.390
I believe the AC broke. Someone's going to get hanged. Yeah, someone's dying

175
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.150
so that oil money, they'll fuck around. They're not fucking around. Oh my God.

176
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.220
Is it really 99 degrees in that Saul thing?

177
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.600
He said 99 to dead is so bad to fight at 99 degrees.

178
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.170
You've got to be acclimated to that shit and even then you're still gonna have a

179
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.680
performance hit. You're gonna definitely have a performance hit.

180
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.810
Probably similar to fighting at very high altitude like Mexico City type deal.

181
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.190
They don't look that sweaty though, do they? Well, it's hard to tell. You know?

182
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:44.580
I mean we're, we're not in there. They look sweaty as fuck you sweat.

183
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.210
It's fuck you thing sweating. But I mean they just fought two rounds.

184
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.620
I mean this was during the second round.

185
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.020
Oh was a big mouse into the left I have for Hara. God,

186
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.030
we haven't done one of these in a long time. It's been a hot second.

187
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.400
When was the last one we did a, I couldn't even tell you. It's been months.

188
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.260
Callen is in his gym shorts right now filming his television show.

189
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.094
But he's on the way.

190
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.200
You think it'd be possible to do team MMA like Americans versus Brazilians Bro

191
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.340
Rush. But like for countries like you take Olympics like the Olympics,

192
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.750
but you do it in the UFC.

193
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.490
You take the best guy at 35 best guy at 45 like the ultimate Russian's about to

194
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.150
run the table except for heavy,

195
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.010
late February you put off everybody could be everybody.

196
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:33.720
All the lessons are taken over everything. Look at what they're doing in boxing.

197
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.590
It's Russians and black guys rushing and black guys are owning the fight world.

198
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.710
But Russians like the whole light heavyweight division.

199
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:44.820
I had Andre Ward on the other day, he's brilliant. He is every champion,

200
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.230
all these two contenders, like 78% of them are rushing. It's crazy.

201
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.130
There's so many killer Russians when we think about the champs and now,

202
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 4>I mean it's either, well, shit, it's either Russian or black, right?</v>

203
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.350
Except for [inaudible]. The winning team gets $1 billion.

204
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.090
I did get to for hair. I just cracked it and I hand tied some ops in trouble.

205
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:11.440
Man. He's bleeding too. He's bleeding out of his nose called the UFC Olympics.

206
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.700
That'd be pretty bad ass dude. If you got pseudo at a what? Oh no,

207
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.890
he didn't, he wasn't born in Mexico. What did you say?

208
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:24.910
Heat index is one 23 in there. Dominic Cruz, which is quoted as saying,

209
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.170
I'm cooking like a biscuit in here.

210
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.190
The heat index is one 23 so it feels like 120 it's not gonna be good for

211
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:32.560
performance. That's ridiculous. Imagine the third,

212
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.970
fourth round for could be even dusted. Ooh, dude, that's nice. Kiss.

213
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.770
I feel like advantage.

214
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.100
The court K I'm no really training in Florida. I don't think any,

215
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.183
how does fudge,

216
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.880
<v 1>well, they're in the air conditioned environment. They don't trade outside.</v>

217
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.220
I mean he's not training too in his,

218
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.390
I mean maybe the new ward that Jim in New Orleans had no AC. Right.

219
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.830
Maybe advantage poor yet. Yeah, maybe. I mean, I wouldn't bank on it though.

220
00:12:57.831 --> 00:13:02.570
I think Beverly is going to be compromised. The fact that it's that hot.

221
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.800
I'm gonna,

222
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.800
I'm gonna text Dominick just cause I can see what's going on.

223
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.570
<v 4>How do they know that that should happen? Well, you got,</v>

224
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.600
you got Joshua Verse Ruiz in Saudi Arabia and they're building just a fucking

225
00:13:17.241 --> 00:13:19.370
arena for it. Just for that one fight.

226
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.600
<v 5>Sure. Trying to find,</v>

227
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.900
<v 4>they built this arena just for this fight. No, for Joshua Ruiz and December.</v>

228
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.360
I'm just, I'm in the middle of texting because it,

229
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.390
this is only the second event in this one though. Maybe fuck the pope. Pour.

230
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.670
Pour. Yay. Finally your title shot. Here you go. When this one though,

231
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.320
we're coming back to New Orleans, I'd imagine.

232
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.390
<v 1>All right. I just sent him a text.</v>

233
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.630
He might respond in between rounds if he has a time.

234
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.150
[inaudible] a little Dominic Cruz.

235
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:51.151
Shout out to Dominick Cruz right hand to the back of the head for hair.

236
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.700
It looks better and you got to think for Hara is trained in Brazil, right?

237
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.270
Is he in Brazil right now? Training and he's from Brazil. I know,

238
00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.150
I don't know screening,

239
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.610
but Brazil obviously gets very hot and a lot of gyms in Brazil are open air

240
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:04.444
gyms,

241
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.620
but he looks to me better like physically the way he's moving and Tyson him off.

242
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.630
Looks like he's just trying to get his, his wind back.

243
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.180
And he had a really good first round,

244
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:18.880
so he might have emptied out a little bit in that first round.

245
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.610
Who I like for heroin here.

246
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.570
If I was walking in right now and somebody wanted to bet cash for Harris looking

247
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:30.460
good. He's looking real good man. He's, Oh look at that man.

248
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.840
So He's, he's fighting at a real good pace. Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.

249
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.960
Ooh Elbow. Ooh, right hand. Damn. You know what?

250
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.310
I've been watching a lot lately on youtube. I've been watching left way.

251
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.790
You know what that is? No,

252
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.190
that set a Moitai with no gloves and headbutts

253
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.960
Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's crazy.

254
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.930
There's this Guy David Ledoux and he's like the king of lifeway and he's a

255
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.050
friends with Robin black like Robyn Blackston breakdowns of his stuff and Robin

256
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:06.970
has done some commentary for left way wild shit to watch man. Where did,

257
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.510
where are they do a man not here, I think. I don't know where he lives.

258
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.130
You watch that bare knuckle boxing.

259
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.520
SAS changed my opinion on whether or not MMA should be bear now. Fellows.

260
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.380
I knew you'd come around huts. I knew you'd come rounds.

261
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.010
The cuts are too much clear.

262
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.730
Chris leaving his whole face is like a an ax murderer.

263
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.570
You got hit in the head with patch. You see it's a big foot for skin saga. Yeah.

264
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:31.820
I don't like that. I don't like that makes me sad.

265
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.830
That's a big foot on the see it seems like, uh,

266
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.400
what's, what's the name of the show?

267
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.150
The event did not go fighting championship, B. K, f.

268
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:46.490
C it just seems like it's blowing up. Right. It is blown up.

269
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.250
I mean people are Naji fighting Artem low.

270
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:52.190
Bob got people excited about you see the numbers though. What kind of,

271
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:53.750
what kind of blown up ups all relative.

272
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.320
What's the numbers bringing that shit up. Jamie is, it's not great.

273
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.940
He said over 200 something thousand but it came out it was like 11,000 or

274
00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:04.250
something so it wasn't crazy.

275
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:08.060
Like the pay per view numbers to Diego for heroin is putting it on Tice him off.

276
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.250
I'm Arabic Tyson monks in real trouble right now.

277
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.480
He just got hit with a big right hand and he's not offering any offense right

278
00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:17.420
now. He's just trying to gather his shit and just moving away.

279
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:19.880
Like even when he's throwing punches it's like they're not dangerous.

280
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.200
So you like right here. Reminds me of Tony Ferguson here. Yup.

281
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.090
This just some chop. Just stocking him down or just do still numbers on Tony.

282
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.800
Tony Ferguson has changed the game in terms of like a guy who has the ability to

283
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:37.610
put it on you and doesn't get tired. He is at the top of the fucking list.

284
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:41.840
I've never seen anybody like him that you know when he's going to do the next

285
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:44.630
project, he's going to open up a 10th planet and big bear.

286
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.200
He wants to live in big bear. I like it. He's good.

287
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.150
That's got us some impact on,

288
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.580
it says just 18,000 people downloaded it.

289
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.400
They said 200,000 but then there's ways to count them. Shutters reporting.

290
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.600
Maltsters a pretty solid source. Yeah, he's legit. Legit journalists.

291
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.630
18,000 that's not a lot.

292
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.840
18,000 I would say I was a no, that that Logan Paul Ksi too.

293
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.710
That's going to be under zone will get fucking 7 million or some shit like that.

294
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.300
Joe Saunders is on the undercard of that, which is so ridiculous. What?

295
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.830
What? What? Billy Joe Saunders is fighting on the undercard of Logan.

296
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.300
Paul's one of the top 20 fighters on the planet earth. I would say kickboxing.

297
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.830
No boxing. Oh, it's to youtube as you fought before. Wow.

298
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.370
Well now it's a different game, isn't it?

299
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.850
I was on board when they were just fighting each other.

300
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.500
Billy Joe Saunders is a fucking, he's an artist. Heavyweight. No,

301
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:45.380
Billy Joe is a middleweight right? No, he, yeah, he could probably,

302
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:46.640
I'd love to see him, but against Cornell,

303
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:50.540
I think you'd give Canelo some Fritz my favorites is everybody's Tyson fury.

304
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.650
His best friend. Yeah, he's hilarious.

305
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.470
They pope and match and Ferrari's all the time. They're great.

306
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.260
He fights like them too in a lot of ways. They're very mobile.

307
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:02.880
He's a bad ass man. Very Mobile. Um, wow. I bet it's embarrassing.

308
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.970
That's a better, oh, another head kit, bro.

309
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.450
T entice him off is not offering anything dangerous in return.

310
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.140
I think he's like severely compromised right now. Cracked again.

311
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.450
Who are the judges? Um, that's a good question. Adelaide,

312
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.980
Adelaide bird. See peoples. Who else? Uh,

313
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.560
I don't know who's like, who do you get excited about for judges?

314
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.830
Judge Adelaide. Burt. Cause I know it's gonna be chaos. Yeah, I see.

315
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.900
You're really, you Doug Crosby like for real. Who is?

316
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.290
Um, oh look at that. That's the end of the house. There's no way.

317
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:44.370
You don't tell him there's no one that fight another country.

318
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:46.960
You don't know what the fuck's going to happen. Absolutely man.

319
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.020
They can't do it would be an embarrassment for them if they gave that to Tyson.

320
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.680
You don't give [inaudible] face got beat up. She loses early in the fight.

321
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.720
Tyson mom cracked him. Why are they showing just his highlight? Hey,

322
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.800
that could sway judges. Why are they showing justice at the end of the fight?

323
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.640
That's the end. The fight is the first round.

324
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.760
You see Tice them off coming onto you. They're just showing, okay.

325
00:19:08.761 --> 00:19:11.940
They showed that. No, but then as the fight wears on,

326
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.240
then you see Diego come on strong. Listen, I work in that fucking production.

327
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.100
They showed the first round and then second,

328
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.470
the first round was all tie some off,

329
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.100
but then the second and third they see now they're showing for heroin.

330
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.870
Put your draw him ten eight that first SRE. Do you look at this crack?

331
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.740
It's fair. It was a beast, man. Look at the numbers though. Come on.

332
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:34.200
Even round one. The numbers are crazy. Well,

333
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:37.260
the thing is like Tyson off hit him with big shots and round one.

334
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.610
That's terrible for Tyson off because Tyson off has not fought in the UFC in

335
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:46.110
quite awhile. And for him to come back to the UFC, he,

336
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:50.580
Jamie on the other screen, can you pull up Diego for heroes a record?

337
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.040
He's a fucking good fighter, man. He's a good fighter. But again,

338
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.440
the endurance thing, nobody's like Tony.

339
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.600
I mean literally like he's like a superhuman.

340
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.460
I've never seen anybody that can sustain an attack like Ferguson.

341
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.030
No one. So what does he got here? You lost a Dustin. He lost a Banio.

342
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.610
[inaudible] you got Dustin Kao. Dustin's a monster,

343
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:17.250
but he beat a Olivier. Obama merciay.

344
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.530
He beat Reus Dom Kabulov. Those are good fighters, man. Really good.

345
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.910
Yeah, he's a, he's the best father fucker. If he, if he fucking loses. Oh,

346
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.900
that he won. He Won. Maribel went down.

347
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:33.540
And what did he thought he was gonna win and no, no,

348
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.760
he didn't think he's going to win. I think that she's praying. Yeah,

349
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:38.790
I think he's praying and then he kind of got to pray in front of those people.

350
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.110
You never know. Yeah, no fucking way, dude. If he won that fight,

351
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:45.450
it would've been a horrible travesty of justice.

352
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.040
How do you remember Alessio Sakara versus Tallis

353
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.020
<v 6>latest? No. Don't you don't remember that one? No. What happened? That one,</v>

354
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.280
uh, Sakara got the decision but um,

355
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.880
Talis latest took them down over and over. Never really got hit standing and uh,

356
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.240
took his back like two or three times and Sacara escaped all the back attempts

357
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:10.840
and then got back to his feet.

358
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.140
So the replays were all Sakara his escapes back escapes.

359
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.640
Where was it? Guess who won was a car? Yeah. Really?

360
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.780
Cause the replays influenced the judges, man. You think so? I know. So dude,

361
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.300
I was in the truck doing not a hell.

362
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.410
<v 1>Wow. What did you say? Hey,</v>

363
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:31.960
how come you guys aren't showing the replays of the take downs in the back

364
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.794
control?

365
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.900
<v 6>I don't remember what happened. Watch that fight.</v>

366
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:41.160
And then you'll see at the end all the replays are Sacara escaping back control.

367
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:43.440
And he won. Was this back in the day? When was this?

368
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.560
This was probably about 12 years ago. Oh Wow. Yeah.

369
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.530
They don't know what the fuck they was going to throw in chicken bones to

370
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.590
decide. Watch that fight and then tell me who won, who won it on? No. Wow.

371
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.750
It's amazing that you brought that up. That's a crazy fight.

372
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.960
I'll never forget that one. That's how I know that sticks in my brain.

373
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:01.830
Like those replays. That's, that's why I thought I'll replay,

374
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.220
cause the judges are sitting there going, oh my God, what do I do? What do I do?

375
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.720
So they look at the replays and if the replays are showing one guy is getting

376
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:13.380
the better, the other guy, then they go, okay, if they in the truck,

377
00:22:13.381 --> 00:22:15.300
they think he's winning. So then okay, he's winning.

378
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.100
You know what's crazy is that that's what happens. Nothing.

379
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.580
<v 1>Nothing really significant has changed in terms of like the,</v>

380
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.060
the w who judges fights.

381
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.200
It's like basically the same kind of people. The same people. You don't,

382
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:32.950
you're not seeing, look you, Ricardo Almeda as a judge in New York,

383
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:35.740
which is a great thing, but you're not seeing a lot of that.

384
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.790
You're not seeing a lot of fights. Ricardo made a type job. Yes, yes.

385
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.360
Either form of fighters or martial arts experts.

386
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.500
Like if you say that you want to be a judge, I w I want to see you.

387
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.200
Show me how you apply. Doris chokes.

388
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:53.110
Show me what's different between the Anaconda choke and the dark chokes.

389
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:57.370
Show me when you know, show me how, how, how do you do a 10 finger guillotine?

390
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.280
Show me. Show me. If you don't know what that is.

391
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.121
If you don't know how to do it,

392
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:02.860
how are you going to know whether or not someone's in danger,

393
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.060
whether in the middle of a fight.

394
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.040
I'd also show him fights like the one you were talking about with Sakara and

395
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.030
ladies and be like, how do you score this kind of thing to me.

396
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.423
You guys are talking,

397
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.370
you guys are talking all sorts of fucking common sense dude. What it's about.

398
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.940
Just hit me back. Right? Dominick Cruz. Well, I don't want to say that,

399
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.270
but he says so fucking hot. Part of what he said, I will not repeat. Yeah,

400
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.140
he says fucking hot. You can't say fuck that fee. I can say that.

401
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:34.150
I can't say what he say. I'll show you. He wants to do it. Yes sir. A racist?

402
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.650
No, no, no. Dominic's not racist at all. No.

403
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.650
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Show that to Brendan.

404
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:44.650
But tell him to shut the fuck up about it on your pod.

405
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.580
I'm a, we should all go to New York.

406
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:56.840
I'm not doing a show in New York because I'm going to do Madison Square Garden

407
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.990
afterwards. I'm going to do with a far afterward. What show is that?

408
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.990
I'm going to do Madison Square Garden in 2020.

409
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.440
So with Chappelle? No, by myself.

410
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.820
You're doing Madison Square Garden. Stand up style. You're somebody.

411
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.250
You've done it before though, Joe? No, not the big one, right?

412
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.630
I did the little arena before. Wait a minute by yourself. Jim Does big,

413
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.120
big guys places. It's fun. So what were you going to say Joe Though?

414
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:26.990
That's November 2nd. So you're looking to do one before then? Um, yeah,

415
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:29.390
I'm not doing a show on November 2nd you know, we should,

416
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.500
we should do a podcast in New York. How about we all fly down in New York.

417
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.770
I'll get you guys seats ringside and the night before we just do a talk and shit

418
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.490
podcast. Free flight card. A pregame wait,

419
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.670
there's going to be a UFC and then you're going to do Madison Square Garden. No,

420
00:24:44.671 --> 00:24:47.690
no, no. I'm doing Madison Square Garden a couple months later.

421
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.640
So you're not talking about that show? No,

422
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:51.620
quite about actually watch a few months later.

423
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.010
So it's like November is when the UFC is there.

424
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.720
I'm not doing a show there until 2020. What show is a Madison Square Garden?

425
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:02.980
That's the big one. That's Nate Diaz. Mazda dog. That's November. Yeah,

426
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.470
November six. Garren til November 2nd. Calvin gas alum.

427
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.000
How about if we did that? We did a, uh, like a fight companion preview.

428
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.380
Get drunk talk shit. My hotel room on November 2nd.

429
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:22.470
I'm free that weekend. Oh, I mean if you want to do it, we could do it. Hold.

430
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.360
That'd be so much fun.

431
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.910
This fight style bender style bender versus Robert Whittaker. Oh my goodness.

432
00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:36.110
That's going to be a big fight. I can't wait for that fight. I'm in town too.

433
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.470
And so only weekend. I'm not on the road. Ooh, look at us dude. I'm,

434
00:25:41.471 --> 00:25:44.880
I'm really excited about this. Whitaker versus style benders.

435
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.010
My big fight for the year. I think that's my big fight. I can't wait for that.

436
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.330
Not Sorry. Adam Green Tree. Not Big enough for get me to fly to Australia.

437
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.600
They try to get me to fly over there for this one too. I'm like, hmm.

438
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.720
Rather be here rather be here folks.

439
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.670
But style bender versus Whitaker's to fight mass fight. That's the fight.

440
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.670
Just so they're both in their prime dude. Then. How about uh, Kosta,

441
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.720
now he's ranked what? He's two now. I think he's right there, man.

442
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.770
He's so scary. They're all scared. He ate everything. John Jones,

443
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:21.380
is that what you're thinking? No, he's nothing. Weight class. What?

444
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.190
He's easy to coast a style bender. But you know, they want a,

445
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.430
they want coaster to move up. California does. California is like, Hey man,

446
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.840
you're cutting too much fucking weight.

447
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.260
California is not going to eliminating those only fought once in California

448
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:36.800
though. So if California says he miss, wait, no, he made weight. But,

449
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.150
and here's the thing that they said.

450
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.260
They say you can't gain more than 15 pounds. What does that say?

451
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.310
56 seating capacity.

452
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.941
<v 4>40,000,</v>

453
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:49.050
40,000 tickets already sold in Australia for Whitaker versus out of Sanya.

454
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:51.030
Holy Shit. Oh my goodness.

455
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.090
October 6th in the month of [inaudible] Marvel Stadium.

456
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:58.380
I like how Marvel Comic Stadium do the underwriting Ronda Rousey home holds the

457
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:02.330
record. Does it, did they just said that? Oh Wow.

458
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.660
Oh Wow. That was the whole state record for MMA in Australia saying,

459
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.160
I remember being there. That was crazy. And you think Rhonda let her come back?

460
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.330
Nope. No, I don't think she wants to. I think Rhonda is a strong woman.

461
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.150
You know, she decides she's done. She's done. She's going to move on.

462
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.990
I don't think she wanted to, you know, to keep doing it. I just think,

463
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.080
you know,

464
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.100
making money off when she came back and fought Amanda and then Amanda knocked

465
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:33.330
her out, um, that must have like really fucked her up, Matt mentally.

466
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.340
But like now looking back like Amanda's the, she fucked up Cyborg.

467
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.910
Like she would've fucked up anybody. So I'm thinking that Rhonda is,

468
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:44.890
feels a little bit better about that. Amanda fight, right?

469
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.460
Maybe she got knocked out by Holly before that though.

470
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.660
And they got starched by Amanda. Yeah.

471
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.370
But then Amanda just knocked out Holly with a fucking still,

472
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.130
even today they weren't competitive. Even today. Still,

473
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.080
even today if the fights on the ground, you got to give it to Rhonda.

474
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.170
Rhonda, I don't feel I'm better than you. I don't know about that with Amanda

475
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.490
[inaudible] Jujitsu. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:13.150
But men is the owned everybody on the ground with arm bars,

477
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.900
but she's had a very singular attack.

478
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.720
Armbars it was all armed bars and she was at fighting great competitions saying

479
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:24.730
if she just focused on her judo and, and her arm bars and, and,

480
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:29.100
and didn't try to be a striker, um, you think she'd be like, it could beep now.

481
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.270
I think if she went to American top teams, you lose a couple. Everyone loses.

482
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.970
You just, you lose, you come back, everyone loses and they come back. You know,

483
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.850
I think Rhonda would still be in the mix 100%.

484
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:42.030
She would have to separate and move to a real camp.

485
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.920
She would have to train with real trainers, like a real group of killers,

486
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.630
grappling trainers, wrestling trainers,

487
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.100
make sure she's got the best barring partners and more importantly coach a real

488
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:56.970
mind. A real like, like fuck Ross for us.

489
00:28:56.971 --> 00:29:01.971
The hobby like selling like that or you know Mike Brown or you know Duke Roufus.

490
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.770
Someone top of the food chain person. Matt, Matt Hume, right.

491
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.580
A top of the food chain coach. Why would she just gonna break? She wouldn't,

492
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.240
that's why she's killing it and she wants to Travis.

493
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.560
Oh this fucking back. This was crazy shit watching Steve Page just knock out DC.

494
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:20.760
It was crazy dude.

495
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.950
Those Kush blades on now dude steeping.

496
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.010
How much money is Ronda make it in the WWE millions.

497
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.180
Millions of money making million, million more money than she's ever met. No,

498
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.700
she, she's getting paid to pretend.

499
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.210
So why the fuck would you risk all that and go back to UFC?

500
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.180
What do you think about king the last,

501
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.190
cause you think he's going to stick with it? You see

502
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.610
<v 7>him? He's good. It's, I mean, he is on the flip down and shit.</v>

503
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.990
He put that mask on and with the Mexican Lucci I leave it a fucking crew dude.

504
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:53.280
He could be huge. Instead, he loves you. He could be huge into,

505
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:58.390
he's doing flips and shit and counts the people's legs and throwing Nacho is

506
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.620
Kinda fucked up back. How can he do all that Shit [inaudible] back? Oh he does.

507
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.350
Or does he have a fucked up? You know, he just over it and like,

508
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:08.490
I'm gonna go put this mask on and get paid not to get punched in the face.

509
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.650
A big difference between a flip that you orchestrate yourself versus someone

510
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:14.750
fucking picking you on the claim and you're on the ground and the right training

511
00:30:14.751 --> 00:30:15.310
and you know,

512
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.310
wrestling with how crazy is it that people are into fake fighting fucking they

513
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:23.920
love it. They love, they're passionate about it too. And if you talk shit about,

514
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:28.420
they come at you in a row. Trust me. I know. Trust me. I know.

515
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.590
But look, Tony Hinchcliffe, who I love to death, that fucking kid lives for it.

516
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.660
He lives for fake friends. Billy Corgan from smashing punk. People love.

517
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.060
It's one of the organizations. Yeah. Billy loves one. Yeah.

518
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:45.070
They might as well make movies and TV shows while they're at it now they want to

519
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:48.700
see it live. They want to see like a live play. It's like a live wild,

520
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:52.390
crazy play. I respect it. Look, it's like they, they grind, they grind.

521
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:57.370
It's hard. It falls into other shit like video games, cartoons, comic books,

522
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:58.061
nerd culture.

523
00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:01.420
It's like stuff that you enjoyed when you were a kid and these guys embrace it

524
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:06.190
deep into adulthood. It's fun for them. I get it. I don't mind it. They always,

525
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.400
they always like compare it to Guac. Jones. They do make movies.

526
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:12.000
I don't know if you knew that. That's a no WWE movie.

527
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.430
Hold on a second. Either WWE movies,

528
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.350
they make movies. No, these are wrestlers are starring in movies. No. Look,

529
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.050
WWE studio. There's whole shit. I didn't know that. Oh Damn.

530
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:29.080
They are making movies. Oh yeah. Oh Wow. Okay.

531
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.400
Has anybody heard of any of these movies? Hey, watch your mouth. No Man.

532
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.250
I've heard of the marine. I've heard of them. Or, oh,

533
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:40.120
fighting with family with the rock. I heard decent. How dare you.

534
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:47.810
Okay. Okay. How dare you jingle all the way to sandals. Little hell suck this.

535
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:50.590
Change this right now. I don't want to look at this.

536
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.070
Get that off the air to the hose. Hey Dude. Hey real quick though.

537
00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:57.010
Those were terrible. They might've been

538
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.510
go to her. All you gotta do. If I come and watch one of those movies

539
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.620
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

540
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.460
<v 7>that and all the Tyler Perry's movies will please a woman. Yeah,</v>

541
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.060
Jesus Christ. He's done like 18 of those. Oh, we get it. We get it.

542
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.880
[inaudible] a woman. Was he dressed like a woman in real life?

543
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.150
You'd have to ask him a gun to the head.

544
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.283
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

545
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.720
<v 7>Got into the head one time. His dog pops at least one time. If I had a bet,</v>

546
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.510
everything closed off on his own. Is He ever put pumps off?

547
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.040
Does he have a size

548
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.390
<v 4>14 pump? It is from, yeah, I listen. You gotta respect,</v>

549
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.550
respect transgenders 1000% you know what I mean? You got to,

550
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.870
but I think like after 16 like after 60 stop,

551
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.990
if you keep wearing makeup and wigs at 60

552
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.600
you should about for ladies like Christie Brinkley's over 60 hey listen,

553
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:07.250
but still wearing makeup. But if your health, Cindy Crawford,

554
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.430
if you're a transgender and you're over 60 you should probably dress like old

555
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:15.770
ladies. Right? And with the,

556
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.490
with the gray wig [inaudible] there's different ladies like look,

557
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.680
Christie Brinkley of, you've seen what she looks like now.

558
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:26.060
I think she's 64 she's still Huston. Stunning. Huh?

559
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.030
No filter. Not long legs. No. No. Little bit earlier. Hurley,

560
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.320
Elizabeth Hurley's Instagram has goddamned hilarious.

561
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.380
It is all her and her underwear. Every picture, all the shape. 85 years old.

562
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:39.890
[inaudible] picture.

563
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:44.450
She's only in eight 52 she's like 54 or 55 that would have been Clinton

564
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.040

565
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.130
Every picture of her is her and her underwear and her Instagram.

566
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.930
She's so bad looking. Good Dude. Look good.

567
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.520
[inaudible] filter she does is eat.

568
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.910
Go to the gym and take pictures in her underwear. I think that's all she does.

569
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.010
She's earned it. Yeah, man. Look,

570
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:04.040
she's letting everybody know like while she's still got this body,

571
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.600
she's putting that motherfucker front and center all this shit.

572
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.000
She's 85 years old.

573
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.800
85 for 50 54 Christie Brinkley's 65 God damn sick to,

574
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:16.870
how does she do it? Early 54 yes, dude. She's hot as fuck.

575
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.380
I think that if you saw her to club,

576
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:21.650
you think that's a 35 year old smoking shit. Look at that smoke show.

577
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.960
That's a serious, no, that's a competition. Janie,

578
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.040
how dare you introduce the songs. The first picture without a filter.

579
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.170
I'm just clicking. No, show me the full screen her. Yes dude.

580
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.680
She's hot as fuck her in 1998 no, no, no, no. Sorry. Last week.

581
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:38.060
Turner Pool Dude.

582
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.750
When you got that kind of Elizabeth Hurley cash the pig picture right there with

583
00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:44.690
her in the Bikini on the floaty thing on the, on the pink Flamingo.

584
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.690
Every bitch pink hot as fuck. Lunar body man. She keeps it. Tone does.

585
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.030
She has a like a 30 year old son. She has kids. Imagine being her son,

586
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.610
her kids 50 she let us in a new world.

587
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.730
We live in a new world,

588
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:03.440
a woman like her with massive amounts of resources and she can go to all the

589
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:07.910
best doctors, hormone replacement, all the best. Like, look, look at that.

590
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:12.320
That's her and her daughter. Dude, she's hot as fuck. She's 65 years old.

591
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:15.350
Look at her. Come on son. Daughter looking like ugly friend.

592
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:20.030
Your mom's hot kid up. [inaudible] though. Yeah.

593
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.680
If you do see any ash ash, Elizabeth Hurley has ashots.

594
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.750
Elizabeth Hurley's as hard for me to believe.

595
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.920
I think at 50 your ass guys can do it. Guys can do it though.

596
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.300
Guys have different kinds of assets. They've longer asses. Hips are narrow,

597
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.100
holds the butt. You can get ass jobs these

598
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v 7>days. You can get the</v>

599
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.510
troubles out there thinking about, look, no guys like ass implants. No guys, no,

600
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.470
no, no god, no, no guys. Well, here's the thing.

601
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:51.600
Girls are starting to develop ass cancer.

602
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.260
They're starting to develop cancer in the same areas were women where some women

603
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:59.700
are getting breast cancer from implants. It's not always to getting asked. Yes,

604
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.270
sir. Yes, but she cancer. But from the implants,

605
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.720
are they doing the Brazilian both, which is fat. Let me answer.

606
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.790
It's a reaction to the implants.

607
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.610
Your body doesn't want foreign substances in its body.

608
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.280
If you put something in your body, a piece of plastic,

609
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.280
and then your body like has to go, why is this here? What the fuck is this?

610
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:21.000
And your body starts to fight it and reject it and then you develop scar tissue

611
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:24.120
around it. That's why a lot of older ladies that got boob jobs,

612
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.260
if you hug them there,

613
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:28.500
it feels like they've got two basketballs in their chest and it's fucking weird

614
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:32.290
because it's all scar tissue. But here we go.

615
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.840
Curtis blades and what his homeboys name. Say that name Brendan. No Dude.

616
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:41.600
Come on dude. Come up. [inaudible] come up up.

617
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.020
Dura came off. Ooh. Big Fellow Curtis blades with a big shot.

618
00:36:46.021 --> 00:36:50.490
The deep shot and his mugshot is out over there. Richard Pryor. Oh Shit.

619
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.530
<v 9>To go look at this. [inaudible]</v>

620
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.380
<v 7>crazy. Curtis plays already on his back.</v>

621
00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.830
<v 9>My Boys Harry.</v>

622
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.750
<v 7>So you've got a good picture of Christie Brinkley's ass.</v>

623
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.230
There must be one out there. I don't think siloed to them. A turn around it

624
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.940
[inaudible] around. It's impossible unless you're doing,

625
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.030
unless she's doing squats every other day at the Olympic training center in

626
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:19.020
Colorado, it ain't happen. I'm telling you man, you guys are hating on implants.

627
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:21.690
But there's, there's, there's the Brazilian butt lift, which is an implant.

628
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.570
It's fat from your body into your tolerable. If you got time,

629
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.190
that's what they're doing.

630
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.040
You've got gotta fucking put something in your ass to make it round.

631
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:33.300
That means you've never worked out and your legs are not going to match that

632
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:34.134
ass.

633
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.020
But that doesn't work on some girls cause they don't have enough fat for it.

634
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:40.260
So what they do is they put plastic in there. Those are the implants.

635
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.460
Carol's ass implants do not count. I agree. I would rather,

636
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.670
I would rather marry a chick with a flat out no chick with no a million percent,

637
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.670
no way. Never Fucker doggy style. No, let's go missionary,

638
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.860
go old fashion style.

639
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.420
Never flip her old fashion style. You never flip them in television

640
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:07.440
style like golden days. Who Do you think was the first guy to fuck a girl?

641
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.840
Doggy style. Like what year Adam

642
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.170
[inaudible] eating an apple. He put the apple on her apple.

643
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.200
Are you kidding? Missionary cabling.

644
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:30.660
I think missionary started like 200 years ago from the Vatican.

645
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.190
It was like missionary

646
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.750
<v 2>Curtis Blades Wrestle fucking, I'm gonna die. He can wrestle.</v>

647
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.500
He's a great wrestler. Think about blades. It's like in Ganas. Beat him twice.

648
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.060
The last time he stopped him. You know he stopped him both times.

649
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.490
The last time you stopped him quick.

650
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:56.670
I feel like a guy like him is in this spot where it's like Kenny ever beat in

651
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.040
Gunno right me. He's a really good wrestler. He's strong as fuck. He's beaten.

652
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.290
A lot of people beat the shit out of Alister over him.

653
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.760
I mean Curtis Blade's a tough, tough dude. Did he play football? No.

654
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.440
Russell Juco. National Champion. Oh yeah. Superstud he's a team. Elevate guy.

655
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:16.300
Right? Elevation elevation.

656
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:22.390
So with he a NCAA Division One national champion, a Juco national champion.

657
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.880
What the hell is that? Junior. Junior college. Junior college.

658
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.670
John Jones was juco national champ. Rumble Johnson.

659
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:31.840
I think a was high up there too. How about rumble Johnson making that come back?

660
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.170
Who? The male handlers? Francis sign me up right now.

661
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.880
That poster would be so sad.

662
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.210
I don't want him to fight someone like Francis and the first fight back.

663
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.510
I want him to make a big statement. It's coming back for sure. Yup. Yup.

664
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.553
That's training.

665
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.790
[inaudible] just posted a video said first time hitting pads in two years. Okay.

666
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.120
Yeah. Don't, don't get him friends. It's ready. One cabin.

667
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.130
I have a feeling like he was itching and then he uh,

668
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.680
did a grappling match against Craig Jones. He got leg locked with the quickness.

669
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.450
Craig Jones locked him up quick.

670
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.520
It probably got real mad and then probably said you didn't want,

671
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:08.740
I ain't going out like that. Maybe like retired life maybe.

672
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:11.830
And then the [inaudible] he was like an ambassador for bare knuckle and maybe

673
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:14.830
just retired. He's like, this shit is boring. I can find a heavyweight.

674
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.360
Well he's in the weed game too.

675
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.770
He's involved somehow or another in some legal marijuana enterprise

676
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.570
that's not going to get your rocks off when people retire.

677
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:29.110
Like in boxing when people retire, they are like, I got enough money.

678
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:31.270
All of a sudden I got a couple of Mil, I'll retire.

679
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:33.850
But then you get used to that couple mil and you're like, damn,

680
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:37.360
I'm running out of fucking money. I got 700,000 left. Yeah, you're right.

681
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.230
You know what I mean? I got, I got to take another fight. They all come back.

682
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.070
Yeah. [inaudible] still doing the damn thing. Yup.

683
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.860
Fighting for one FC. [inaudible] are they going to drug test him at all? No,

684
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:54.220
they should. Just to make sure he's on drugs. Just to make sure.

685
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.020
Get your money's worth. We're fighting in the middle of nowhere. Come on man.

686
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:03.150
There's no way Dana thing give Curtis a title fight. We would fight like this.

687
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.880
Fight fighting my cubby. What's the difference? Well, he's gotta beat Francis.

688
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.610
Francis beat him twice. I mean the only way he's getting a title.

689
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:14.611
Pfizer Francis wins the title and nobody wants to fight Francis and you look at

690
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:18.970
those elbows from the Ma [inaudible] Roche.

691
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.700
It's over kid a wrestler and the match is really just,

692
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.560
Oh shit, let's do it. Just like Scott Morris.

693
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:29.640
Patrick says Shit's rap. His ground pounders.

694
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.010
Phil ferocious too. I don't know if they stopped the fighter though. Oh really?

695
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.910
<v 4>Yeah. Oh, I thought, oh no, that this is going to go on to say ground. I bet.</v>

696
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.360
Oh, what's that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah.

697
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:43.560
They're bringing them to this corner. All,

698
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.470
all these Russians have terrible haircuts, right? They, none of them have here.

699
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.560
A lot of fucking testosterone. Correct. A lot of hair on the body. Not on top.

700
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.400
Boom. You know he's got the craziest is, what's that guy's name? Bruce.

701
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.910
Tom Chev with the guy's name, the wrestler. The grappler dude. He Start

702
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.540
Russ Down Chessy of Chessie f.

703
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.220
That guy is the hairiest man on the face of the planet.

704
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.370
He looks like a bear is one of the beastliness grapplers.

705
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.960
Really killer killer rust of picks people up and throws in Lacrosse Hill and

706
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.760
learn all the terms. He's like a giant Khabib. He's exactly,

707
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.930
exactly covered in hair. Is he doing MMA? He does MMA, but he does.

708
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.070
I don't know exactly what he's doing now. He's fucking Ebi.

709
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.310
He got to the finals and then what happened last at Gordon Ryan,

710
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:33.020
and over time he got to the finals with Gordon lost in overtime.

711
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:35.870
Rustam is no joke, but pull up a picture of that dude.

712
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:40.190
He's literally the hairiest man you're ever gonna see in your life outside of

713
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:43.790
George, the animal Steele, his name, his arrest them Rustam Chits,

714
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.500
h. I. E. V, I think.

715
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.240
Yeah, he's got a lot of hair on his back. He's a beast,

716
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:57.290
but Curtis strikings in a lot better too. Ooh. Oh,

717
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.970
we got caught with the upper cut. Just trying to get in there.

718
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.590
Just trying to get to that same position again once he realized he could hold

719
00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:06.860
that guy down and beat the fuck out of him. Played for Steve Pay. Be Fun.

720
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.400
Be Interesting. Steve Bay deals with the Strip melts back in Cleveland.

721
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:14.200
Now everything's in Cleveland now. Take a picture of

722
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.990
the Cleveland Tobacco June. Are you kidding me? That guy's body.

723
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.710
He looks like a where? Holy Shit. Shit. Find a better picture of him.

724
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.200
There's better pictures. That's nothing. Right. That's certainly shaved.

725
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.290
Tim Clipped. How dare you. Shame. How about that one? There we go.

726
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.050
That's the Russian Russian bear right there. Serious man.

727
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:35.060
I've ever seen serious grappler.

728
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.570
Holy Shit. I'm trying to get them to do combat Jujitsu. Oh my God.

729
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:45.530
Look at the hair on it. Up his arms. Good for him.

730
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.900
How many MMA guys who've gotten into combat Jujitsu?

731
00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.870
Jesse Taylor,

732
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.650
Josh neer up much near most.

733
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.810
I would say 98% of the guys that do combat Jujitsu have MMA experience.

734
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.720
They're pure Jujitsu.

735
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.650
Grapplers they don't want to have anything to do with combat Jujitsu and that

736
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.433
bad shit.

737
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.370
99% of the guys that I have all have MMA experience.

738
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.970
When did Josh near compete? He was a, when we did, um,

739
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.160
Ebi 17, it was a, the first 16 man Combat Jujitsu tournament we did.

740
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.390
And um, I think, I think he got taken out in the first round.

741
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:28.280
He's coming back though. He's doing the next one. The next show.

742
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:34.050
Next Combat Jujitsu is November 24th in it's the middleweights John Thor blank

743
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:36.030
is the, is a, he won that tournament.

744
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:40.920
The Josh neer did Josh [inaudible] coming back. John Thor's coming back. Um,

745
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.970
Jesse Taylor's going to do it. The leap of Focalin W it's,

746
00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.980
it's going to be an insane November 24th in Mexico and we're on Mexico,

747
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.930
Monterrey, Josh. And here's like one of the forgotten pioneers was killed.

748
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.900
The dentist killer. Yeah. Yeah.

749
00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.210
Like when was the last time you found MMA though? It's been a long time, right?

750
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:04.170
Yeah. So he just decided to compete again. But yeah, combat you get, oh,

751
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.280
it's okay to look at that and said, boy, Curtis is beating the shit out of him.

752
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.500
Last combat you get to show. I did not. You didn't say, oh,

753
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.950
did you guys go get on UFC fight pass and watch the last one, dude, dude,

754
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.090
it was insane. It's a great [inaudible] saying.

755
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.140
It's a great step for guys who are thinking about fighting and MMA and to go

756
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.990
from Jujitsu, MMA or Jujitsu combat, you know,

757
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.410
there's a lot of different ways to look at it. You know, it,

758
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.440
you could look at it as if you're planning on transitioning into MMA and you're

759
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:40.140
a grappler, it's a great sport.

760
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.430
Or if you're done with MMA and it's too brutal but you still want to compete,

761
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.990
that's a, that's another way to look at it.

762
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.890
I look at it as just the most gangster form of Jujitsu.

763
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.740
Like when you just look at you just to forget about him and that you just look

764
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:57.480
at Jujitsu and all the different formats. Combat. Jujitsu is the most gangster.

765
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.710
It's the most scary. It's the scariest one. And like I said,

766
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.140
pure Jujitsu grapplers don't want to have anything to do with combat.

767
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:10.820
Jujitsu was all guys from MMA. They're like, oh sorry. I was going to say that.

768
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.400
All the guys in MMA and the heavyweight division does Curtis blades have the

769
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:18.270
best ground and pound by fire club by far, by far.

770
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.600
Smashing with specializes up in there.

771
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.800
Katie has a masculine forgot takes right now. So it's still,

772
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:28.440
he's still in the mix, right? Is he in the middle? He just got, you know,

773
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.120
he came back and got starched [inaudible] no contract. But does he done,

774
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.000
I don't know. He said right now he's focused on a,

775
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:39.510
the natural Libris stuff and then he's gonna, you know, watch your mouth man.

776
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.490
Is that what's called natural Libra? I'm not, I'm trying to be funny.

777
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.000
Naturally braised the movie. Yeah, that's a Jack Black.

778
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:47.820
You're going to get online. You Better Watch out. They're coming for you bro.

779
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.390
Oh No. Bring it up bro. Nah, Curtis Moods.

780
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:55.080
I like his haircut too. You'll hit potholes on the sun to speed them,

781
00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:58.680
knocked him out. Starched him both times. Stopped him in the first fight. No,

782
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.650
he did crazy. Right,

783
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.050
Dr Stoppage that you got a crazy swelling in his,

784
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:08.100
that was Curtis blades trying to take them down the whole fight. Yes, he was.

785
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.680
And then then the second fight he got starts right away,

786
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.360
frank just swollen and just clipped him.

787
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:16.530
And that was a big fight for friends looking at me still fives number number

788
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:21.060
four. Oh yeah, he's, he's right in the mix. I think he knows now more than ever.

789
00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:21.811
I'm just going to guess.

790
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:25.890
But I think based on his experience in those fights with Francis,

791
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.220
that he realizes, you know what, I just got to be the heavyweight. Could be,

792
00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.190
I got to take people

793
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.740
<v 6>down and smash them on the ground for Steve Bay's very interesting.</v>

794
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.940
It's just hard when he guys stopped you a couple of times in a row, you know,

795
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.790
to these huge giant, I mean, John's tiny though.

796
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.520
Annex freaking tiny. Is He? Yeah, he's, how tall is he? How tall is I in a row?

797
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.300
He's my height. So He's five. No, maybe he's five. Seven. No, he's shorter.

798
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:55.330
He's shorter than you. Maybe five, seven, five, eight. I'm kidding.

799
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.830
It was in the neighborhood. Your height. When people say you're short, I'm like,

800
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:03.730
damn, I'm Joe Rogan sign. I'm right there with short five,

801
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:08.290
nine or nine. He is his back surgery game. An inch type move.

802
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.800
Three quarter inch. I swear to God, I went to the doctor and the fucking,

803
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:16.060
I had a physical and they measured with [inaudible]. How are you? How is it now?

804
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.180
Not Good. That's a big sign. It's not good. Not, look, I'm not liking that,

805
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.530
you know? Um, before my back surgery,

806
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.160
the pain came from inflammation. So my bad,

807
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:34.270
no disc and my bones were rubbing together. My l five s one,

808
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:36.640
or whatever the fuck they call it. So what ends up happening,

809
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:40.870
there's a problem there and my back. So My, my body, uh,

810
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.170
it inflames the whole lower back just so it's like sore.

811
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:48.640
So I was living life with just a stiff, frozen back all the time.

812
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.870
Finally got an MRI after years and years, finally got the back surgery.

813
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:57.790
So now there's a titanium disk in between the two vertebrae,

814
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:01.640
but my body is still, you know,

815
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.430
cause I'm rolling now and I don't think I'm supposed to,

816
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:06.250
but I gotta fucking lose weights and I don't know any other way.

817
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:09.190
I think you're supposed to roll. My Doc,

818
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.690
my doctor told me he doesn't know anything about Jujitsu and he said, he goes,

819
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.530
you okay? What are you doing exactly in this Jujitsu thing? I go, here.

820
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.750
He goes, are people picking you up and slamming you? I said, no, no, no, no, no,

821
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:24.780
no. They're not picking me up because I'm always pulling guard, you know?

822
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.040
I didn't want to explain that to him because he didn't know what pulling out.

823
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:29.320
I go, no, no, no, no one's picking me up and slam. And he goes, okay,

824
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:34.030
that's good, but you're not like twisting or anything, are you? And I said,

825
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:37.330
twisting. Well my nickname's the twister.

826
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.950
No, we're not twisting. So he goes, as long as you don't twist,

827
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:42.850
you don't want to do anything.

828
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:46.600
You don't want to go to the gym and twist your back at all. No twisting at all.

829
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.880
You can't. You can't. No running, no twisting and no snot running,

830
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.540
no running, no squatting, no squatting, no deadlifts. They go you.

831
00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.250
We don't want any compression going on in your spine at all.

832
00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:03.250
And no twisting and Jesus.

833
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:08.850
So what's happening is I'm rolling and my back feels the same.

834
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:12.100
Like before surgery, like it still hurts. It's still in Flint.

835
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:15.700
It's still inflamed. So it's my body's going, something's wrong with your back.

836
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.760
What do you think would happen if you got like Regena keen down there?

837
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.440
Right there? I did that. Dude, you have a before, before the surgery you did.

838
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.650
But what about now? That's another 10 K I ain't gonna do that shit again. Yeah,

839
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.633
yeah.

840
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.150
<v 2>You know what? I'm just, I'm rolling with Limu.</v>

841
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.870
This is the fight Islamic pocket chef.

842
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.670
This is on the fucking Ramos.

843
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.240
This is the fight I'm looking forward to almost as much as the main event. Yeah.

844
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.970
Davi Ramos is, he is the shit and but so is Islam. Islam is a beast. Man.

845
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.990
That guy's so good. DC said he's the heir apparent. He said,

846
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:54.830
if you see him go with Khabib. He said that motherfucker is a future champion.

847
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:59.120
I've heard he's an absolute monster in the gym. He's so complete.

848
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.280
Every really striking bunch about Dobie Ramos standup skills.

849
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:09.350
But if the fight gets on the ground, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna go ahead.

850
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.330
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's going to be over. Question.

851
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.120
I don't know. It's not that easy with Davina. I know Davi is, he's a monster.

852
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.510
I don't think it's gonna be that easy though. He's one decisions.

853
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.250
Eddie Dobie Ramos is one decisions against guys who are not as good as Islam.

854
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.110
Okay. Okay. Is this a straight savage? Maybe I'm wrong about Dumbass Davi.

855
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.280
Ramos's record is up. He's a combat sports, uh, you know, world champion.

856
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.840
So He's bursting grappling. Well, he's so good to the Islam as Jujitsu doubt.

857
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.560
No, that could be wrong. It's not anything about his legs. So solid dude,

858
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.530
he's so solid. Like across might be hard to finish. I'll take that back.

859
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.990
I'll take that back. But I just want her to, you know,

860
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:51.500
say that I'm a giant fan of Davi Ramas Jujitsu.

861
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.980
What he's done in Abu Dhabi's insane. Yeah. So see he's got,

862
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.180
he's got one decision against Austin Hubbard in his last fight.

863
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.600
Who's this drama or eyes. Yeah.

864
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:06.200
But Sergio MRIs is Shitty fucking Jujitsu fighter.

865
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.240
And Sergio is actually a larger guy. Sergio's Sergio's fighting at one 85.

866
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.940
Was he fighting one 85 or one 70 now?

867
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:18.860
No 70 but he fought at 85 and the final decisions he find in the finals of the

868
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:20.300
ultimate fighter Brazil,

869
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.430
he fought 85 against [inaudible] say's are for Hammer.

870
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.900
That was 85 when they fought 70 [inaudible] Neil magni and you guys will choke

871
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.810
the OMEGAMON starts by wrong some arm bar.

872
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.060
I'm going to say Dobby Ramos arm bar right now.

873
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.970
All I'm saying is he's won a bunch of submissions,

874
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:40.600
but he submission Nick Piedmont, you know,

875
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.510
he'd decision Nick Piedmont decision and this Austin Hubbard character in those

876
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:47.930
last fight so that he went three rounds with that cat.

877
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.190
That was a good fight to Austin. Hubbard's a good fighter.

878
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.910
That was a really good fight. Half-Full Rick Lee in the back. Um,

879
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.080
so I don't know if he's going to submit them quick.

880
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.260
I think my coach has the best fighter. He's fought. Yeah, I really do.

881
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:05.120
I would assume he's in your boys and underdog Eddie. Goddammit.

882
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:10.570
Brendan. So you got to Piss on my, I'm not dude that hey, I'm,

883
00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.450
how's Victor's back? Cause Victor had the same surgery as you, right? Yeah,

884
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:18.620
he came in last week. How's his back? Uh, his was a little different than mine.

885
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.770
Right. You'd be surprised that like when you, when you, um,

886
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.040
when I went to have back surgery, my doctor showed me

887
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.630
<v 6>X-ray's of all these different backs. He goes, do they all look way different?</v>

888
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:34.050
Like everyone's back is so different and some people have fucked up backs.

889
00:53:34.051 --> 00:53:37.980
They never done anything athletically their whole life. So it's like, uh,

890
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.060
his was different than mine. Mine, Mine, mine was worse than,

891
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.370
but Islams of 400 minus 400 favorite. He's,

892
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.960
I think he's the biggest favorite on the card. Decides can dammit.

893
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.520
I didn't know anything about Islam. Oh Dude, he's so good.

894
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.550
If you talk to anyone who's in like the circles, he's like the next,

895
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:56.940
I think he's the Barry Parent. God Damn, he's a fucking nightmare.

896
00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.720
So I can I take back my prediction? No, no. Take it back. No, no, no, no.

897
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.140
I gotta commit to it once you say something, you stick with it for life.

898
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:07.350
And we didn't bet on this. We didn't bet on it. We could've hustled

899
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.400
Callan, Callan Shop Bucks, 20 bucks. He might not never be here.

900
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.400
He said he was going to be done at 11,

901
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:16.740
but he's probably the one shop right now picking up vintages

902
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.430
when they say you're done at 11, when you're filming a TV show. I bet you,

903
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.490
I bet you he doesn't make it. I bet she doesn't make it. So what,

904
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.320
let me ask you this. What was the difference from Victor's back in your back?

905
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:29.990
It just looked different. My,

906
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:35.040
you had to qualify physically for this to,

907
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:39.930
for, um, disc replacement. If you don't qualify for district placement,

908
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:42.330
your bones gotta be a certain way. Then they just fuse it.

909
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.680
Then they just fucking put like a metal cage in your spine and just screw it

910
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:51.490
all. That's what cane got. Yeah. So fusion is, that's hardcore. Uh, but the,

911
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.730
the alternative is dis replacement. It all depends how your bone sit.

912
00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.210
And I was right, dude. I was right. He was showing me, my doctor said, dude,

913
00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.870
your bear, you're barely qualifying for district placement. You want to do it.

914
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:07.650
It's on you. I, it was dude, it was a game time decision. Um,

915
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:12.950
I decided whether I was going to go fusion or disk right before surgery.

916
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.800
Right before they put me out. Oh my God, that's coming to dead right.

917
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.860
Sorry to interrupt you guys. Is your decision not mine. Cause I was on the,

918
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:20.610
on the fence.

919
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.450
I was like on the borderline and I decided to go with the [inaudible]

920
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.650
replacement. So there's a risk.

921
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.300
There's a risk of if you're not qualified physically and you'd go ahead and do

922
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:32.310
it, shit could fall apart.

923
00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:35.760
Like what is the qualification though?

924
00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:38.250
That's what I'm confused on what your bones are sitting like. If your,

925
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.050
if your vertebrae are like,

926
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.040
I'm like a horizontal, then you're good.

927
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.250
But if you're like this, if your vertebrate it, some people are like,

928
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:47.491
they're like,

929
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:50.160
no we got a fuse that motherfucker cause it's slipping off your shit.

930
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.450
Oh so it's so, so cockeyed that it's like poking into the side of your body.

931
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:56.790
It's simplified.

932
00:55:56.791 --> 00:56:00.540
It's just if you're horizontal and there's something that it's laying on,

933
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:03.150
it's good. But if you're like this, mine was like this.

934
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.600
My back was like they were ready to just fuse it.

935
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.770
But the problem with it, if you get fusion in five years,

936
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.670
you've got to fuse the vertebrae on top of it five years later.

937
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.420
We've got a few of the other ones, so your back's just going to be metal.

938
00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:21.450
I know a girl, she used to work at the store. A whole back's fused. Yeah.

939
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.430
She had some something fucked with it and you go fusion.

940
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.150
<v 1>You just get it every five years. You got to get more bro. She walked like this.</v>

941
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.590
Yeah. Everything was like this. It was like she had a pole from her head.

942
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:37.200
She still did, but no, she was like this so,

943
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.860
but other than my back did,

944
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:42.520
I had shoulder surgery and knee surgery and those motherfuckers aren't 100%

945
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:43.010
either. I don't.

946
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:47.650
I think at 50 when you're 50 I don't think you'll ever recover 100% you still on

947
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:52.060
the TRT? A little bit. What about stems? You say you're doing stem cell too?

948
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:55.500
No, no, no, no, no, no. You got to do that. I'm not thinking.

949
00:56:55.501 --> 00:56:56.800
I guarantee you you did that.

950
00:56:56.801 --> 00:57:00.400
That fixed that shoulder guaranteed you about to get in my foot for my planner.

951
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.930
You still have plantar fasciitis horribly. You still running? Yeah, I'd have to.

952
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.110
You have to. I just love it. Why don't you get one of them? Zero runners.

953
00:57:08.111 --> 00:57:11.920
Have you seen nothing that I have out here is a Woodway. No, no, no. It's a,

954
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:15.340
it's like a weird sort of like an a lip. Sorry,

955
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.970
sorta like an elliptical machine, but you, you're, it's,

956
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.670
you're actually doing it as a run. The movement.

957
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:25.660
The movement is the same as running. It'd be cool. I swim. I just got it here.

958
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.560
Try it. Try it. Try it. I like to run outside though. I like hiking. I do too,

959
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:33.490
but I mix it up. I mix it up with that. I mix it up with the air runner,

960
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:35.930
which is a runner that you push yourself. You, you.

961
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:41.050
That's how it's like a tank tire. I'm back tank track now. Swimming,

962
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:44.570
swimming every week, man. You go somewhere to do that or do you have a baby?

963
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.600
Do you go back? I'm sorry. Back.

964
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:52.180
I'm doing the exact same routine I did for the metamorris fight to try and lose

965
00:57:52.181 --> 00:57:56.020
weight. Trying to lose weight, trying to get my cardio together, dude, dude,

966
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:59.740
my cardio is the worst. But what about exercises on your back?

967
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:02.120
What about using like a reverse hyper I do.

968
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.800
And all these different things up your back. No, I do. You Go, here we go.

969
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:10.300
I do back extensions. $20 a day. Regularly. You guys, Bam.

970
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:14.350
And the last one, it's my guys a minus 400 look,

971
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.320
Dhabi Ramos can win this fight 100% anything can happen, man.

972
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:22.180
Dhabi Ramos gets you on the ground. He's a legit multiple time world champion,

973
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:25.720
legit. And he's got real fucking power in his hands.

974
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.740
Dobie Ramos is a dangerous striker. He really is. I mean,

975
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:31.810
he's not like a helpless guy on his feet.

976
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:34.450
He's explosive will fuck you up on the feet.

977
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:39.490
I just think that market chef is by far the most complete fighter he's ever

978
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:44.350
faced. A motherfucker, man. He's so technically proficient.

979
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.680
Who is he? Who is he beat? What are his biggest wins? Well that last guy,

980
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:52.240
Armando tarts. Sorry. Yuki and that guy that he beat is a really young kid.

981
00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:55.360
He's like 20 and he's a fucking phenom too.

982
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.540
That guy is a future world champion as well. You talked to anyone around AK.

983
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.510
They'll, they'll tell you this guys that a k two oh,

984
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.550
trains could be right here and yeah, him and could be. Go at it, dude.

985
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:09.580
I've called some of his fights before. Man. I'm super impressed with him, dude.

986
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:13.920
He's 20 take Davi down. Yeah, good idea. At least threatening, right?

987
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:16.250
The Samba combat world champion. Yeah,

988
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.840
but you don't want to take it down or you want to stay on your feet with Davi.

989
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.100
Think about big mistake Javi

990
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.020
<v 4>too. Is Dhabi is a Goddamn tank. I mean that guy's so strong. He's explosive,</v>

991
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:30.590
man. Look in the back on that motherfucker. To me, this is the best fight.

992
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:34.010
Besides the main event. The most intriguing fight. Yes. I've been looking at,

993
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:35.870
when I found out this was signed, I was like, Oh,

994
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:40.220
you guys did we talk about his armbar and Abu Dhabi that flying armbar he did.

995
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.960
No, I've seen it though. It's amazing. Filthy dude. He's so good.

996
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:50.240
He's so good and he's so dynamic, so explosive. Who, who's the best right now?

997
00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:55.310
And I didn't like straight Brazilian Jujitsu like Dre Shesha Still Marcella

998
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:59.300
Garcia is still the best. He's still training and fighting competition.

999
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.750
Guys that are competing like is Boucher or like Cyborg?

1000
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.840
Are those guys still doing the dish and shuts fucking everybody up?

1001
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.410
I'm such good. Felipe at Penn Yad Gordon Ryan.

1002
01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:12.500
I Love Gordon Ryan back from his knee surgery. Yup.

1003
01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:14.090
I love going competing already.

1004
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:19.450
He just competed in some new quintet type of [inaudible] he's called to his leg

1005
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:25.700
was ripped apart just like four months ago and then amazing. Oh Shit.

1006
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:30.510
Damn. There's so many good guys right now. Dude.

1007
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.180
There's so many fucking [inaudible].

1008
01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:36.470
Has there ever been a better time for grappling? Oh, that's really incredible,

1009
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.860
man. He could guys, dude,

1010
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.420
they're all over the place and Craig Jones is not doing MMA right?

1011
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.720
He's just fighting a Jujitsu tournaments. Is that correct? Yes. He's not doing,

1012
01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:49.650
I remember he's one of the best two Craig Jones doing of course Geo Martinez,

1013
01:00:49.651 --> 01:00:54.150
right? Tom PJ Barsh is one of my guys. Barch sorry.

1014
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:58.710
I would say blowers. Lucky is fighting. Um, Rafael Lovato. Phil Lavato.

1015
01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.810
Ooh, wow. That's good. We got a lot of bad motherfuckers at 10 planet

1016
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.690
that was just a super brown belt,

1017
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.500
absolute tournament yesterday with all the best brown belts from around the

1018
01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.140
world. And in the finals, both guys were turned planet guys,

1019
01:01:13.141 --> 01:01:17.490
Kyle bame and Chase Hannah. So Woo. 10th Pine in the home.

1020
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.550
We may not be the best, but we're trying.

1021
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:25.500
Look at this fucking did you know who nobody wants to fuck with and you don't

1022
01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:29.010
hear much about him cause he just steamrolls everyone's Ryan Hall. Oh,

1023
01:01:29.011 --> 01:01:30.060
it looks like an accountant,

1024
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:32.970
but no one wants to fuck this manager's trying to get them on the podcast where,

1025
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.260
you know, he's a smart dude. Until when he was great. Eric Ryan Hall. Ryan Hall.

1026
01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:41.670
It's fuck with reminds me a lot of fabrics. River doom in the sense that,

1027
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:45.240
um, a lot of Jujitsu guys, a lot of high level Jujitsu guys,

1028
01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:48.930
when they make the transition to MMA, um, you know, it,

1029
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.060
it's gonna take a while to get your striking together.

1030
01:01:51.061 --> 01:01:54.780
So a lot of guys come in and they, they get, it's just too rough.

1031
01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:57.690
And the striking is just, they're just too far behind. So they just say,

1032
01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:00.030
you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to dip out and focus on Jujitsu.

1033
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:02.730
I've got plenty, there's plenty of money and running Jujitsu schools.

1034
01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.120
But then there's guys that stay and they get their strike and together,

1035
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.410
cause if you don't, if you remember when Barb Isa for doom,

1036
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.330
when he first started, he wasn't that great or this awkward.

1037
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.760
It wasn't that great. He wasn't that great of an MMA fighter,

1038
01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:16.830
but he stuck it out. He's so,

1039
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.840
he stuck it out and then little by dude, his striking becomes legit.

1040
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:24.420
And that's what's going on with Ryan Hall. Ryan Hall.

1041
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.340
He doesn't read any vertical and fuck.

1042
01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.520
But that's why he's so good because his striking is they can't get a matchup.

1043
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.580
They can get close to Ryan Hall because he's [inaudible],

1044
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.180
he'll throw head kicks at you and he's throwing shit and staying on the outside.

1045
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.550
So Ryan Hall stuck it out. He didn't quit.

1046
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.910
He could have easily quit MMA and just said, fuck it.

1047
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.960
I'm running my Jujitsu school. I had made 50 k a month. You know what I mean?

1048
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.360
But stuck it out. He stuck it out and now it's happening.

1049
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:51.390
You're seeing the rise of Ryan Hall, right? Kind of. They can't get the matches.

1050
01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.710
He, there's no marketing used to. It's too scary. It's,

1051
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.650
you know your kids rip your fucking ankle off. Yeah,

1052
01:02:55.651 --> 01:02:58.200
because he does hate to take you there. This fight is heating up.

1053
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.490
Dobby Ramos is clipped Islam with a big right hand. Oh duty. Yeah,

1054
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:07.170
he's dangerous man. Hey, back the volume though for doom top five of all time.

1055
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:09.870
I think if you look at his record, what he's done on top five,

1056
01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.420
you'll get enough credit before his last few fights.

1057
01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.360
I would have put him in number one. I had him number one until he lost,

1058
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.560
when he beat, when he beat Cain Velasquez. You got to think, okay,

1059
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:23.850
here's the guy who beat fade or Noguera n Cain Velasquez,

1060
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:27.540
three of the greatest of all times submitted all of them. I mean, how do you,

1061
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.090
how do you not have that guy? Now people forget too,

1062
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.010
when he fought Travis Brown on Fox.

1063
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:35.610
It was like the third or fourth big Fox fight that was Travis brown in his

1064
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:38.130
prime. I think Travis ranked like three in the world and

1065
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.010
[inaudible] let's Travis done. Have you talked to him? No,

1066
01:03:42.011 --> 01:03:44.310
I don't mean him don't speak. No, I, I dunno,

1067
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.290
I would that I think he worked for Rhonda. I think he did like, man,

1068
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.660
it helps her with like our merchant stuff. Who they're good man.

1069
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.200
You know what I'm saying? I think, yeah, there's plenty of money.

1070
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:58.010
There's no need to fight. No, don't need to get punched in the face. But I,

1071
01:03:58.011 --> 01:04:01.920
I think with Verdo man, he was people. He was so good.

1072
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.400
He's my favorite man. I just got his love for doing this car.

1073
01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:08.300
He was so nice to come a while to get going. It took him a while.

1074
01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.340
It was a hard transition cause when he first started [inaudible] doom was like,

1075
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.030
his striking was like, oh shit, I got it. I got to get this fight to the ground.

1076
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:19.020
Well he came in, now he's a legit movie. Ty. Are you kidding me?

1077
01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:23.380
Some amazing Mark Hunt. He's amazing.

1078
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.870
But you remember when Julia knocked him out?

1079
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:26.590
Remember junior k owed him with an uppercut.

1080
01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.440
That's when junior like burst on the scene. Yeah. Oh God.

1081
01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:32.460
I forgot about that uppercut.

1082
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:35.740
That was junior was an assassin when he was first fighting.

1083
01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.760
Then you're seeing that. You're seeing that too.

1084
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:42.540
Another guy who didn't give up and it keeps pushing and little by little that

1085
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:45.780
strikings gang deadly. Vinny Maga last CJ pen on this job.

1086
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:50.320
Don't forget about big Vinny. Mines the less cause that guy dude, he's,

1087
01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.480
Oh look at this. Oh Shit. Dobby Ramos is throwing some heats on.

1088
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.420
He's looking for the take down. Kenny. Get it dude.

1089
01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.920
Vinnie Michael as the guard twice in the same night and and with two victories

1090
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.460
in that PFL visa freak man.

1091
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.830
The World Guard twice in one night and two victories. Yeah, he's good.

1092
01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:12.440
Lost in that finals. You know what? That million dollar,

1093
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:15.720
if you know what he learned a lot from that dude. He's, he's any dude.

1094
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:18.190
Have you seen him lately? Did he show

1095
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.730
<v 1>Bratty, shredded? He got his cardio to be this scary dude. He got it and he's,</v>

1096
01:05:23.731 --> 01:05:25.540
he's like [inaudible]. He just keeps going.

1097
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:28.360
He doesn't give up and little by little he's fucking knocking dudes.

1098
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:32.260
I would head kicks. You can't sleep on Vinny? No, he's elite.

1099
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.340
How old is Vinnie now?

1100
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.510
I would say 34 so he's right there.

1101
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.390
He bursts on the UFC and just wasn't ready. Wasn't ready yet.

1102
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:42.400
Striking wasn't ready. It is.

1103
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.630
His problem has always been cardio once and I always tell him, I go, dude,

1104
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:49.450
once you, you conquer your cardio problem,

1105
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.180
you're going to be fucking hard to deal with for anybody.

1106
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:57.030
That was a good left-hand of the body by Mokatrov. He's mixing it up. That was,

1107
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.090
that was a slick move.

1108
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.420
He's been throwing them all the head and dobby put his hands up and he went

1109
01:06:01.421 --> 01:06:02.470
right to the rib cage.

1110
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.350
This is a interesting fight, man. Very interesting. Cakewalk is,

1111
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.840
is this the second round? Yes. I haven't been on the ground at all. Right? No,

1112
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:20.290
no. I'd love for it to go to the ground though. No, I mean,

1113
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:22.600
both guys have tried too, which is interesting that my coach,

1114
01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:23.800
I've tried to bring it to the ground.

1115
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:29.000
Is it just anneken Dominick Cruz doing the chemistry? Yeah. Yeah.

1116
01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:31.670
Just two man crew. God [inaudible] go home.

1117
01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:38.000
They got that guy going everywhere. Kids go home to give them a break.

1118
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:42.290
This his Gig, man, now he loves it. I don't think he was in China for,

1119
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.800
for John Wailey didn't want him.

1120
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:50.040
Did he catch him or was he going for a take down? It's hard to tell.

1121
01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:54.370
I was hard to tell there. Um,

1122
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.720
how about Wally? John or John Whaley? They like to check. Yeah.

1123
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.970
The one who fucked up starts on drudge. I didn't see the fight.

1124
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:08.290
Was it legit or low? Beat the shit out. Easily. Shit over 40 seconds.

1125
01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.400
[inaudible] Stryker or what? Killer man. Just fucking straight 2020 and one.

1126
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:15.580
She's like 20 in a row. She's a monster. She caught her with a right hand,

1127
01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.360
hurt her and then finish her while she in one FC. Um,

1128
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:22.930
she's beating bitches up somewhere, but she, uh, maybe, maybe,

1129
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.550
I gotta be honest. I'd never heard of her until that and I was like, oh,

1130
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.930
[inaudible] going to steamroll. Oh really? No, her never seen her fight.

1131
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:32.290
I don't thought women's fighting that dude. She's fucking like,

1132
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.750
you need to change that. Then you get a d, people get mad at you,

1133
01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.200
but you're talking shit about the strawweight division. I don't know.

1134
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.430
I'm sure I don't care.

1135
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.600
I have a fight show and then if it's kind of, I have a fight.

1136
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.970
It's like a lifestyle show. Not like others fights this weekend.

1137
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.910
I know she is on draws for the win. That's how cover it. This is a dobby.

1138
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:52.480
Ramos is pushing the pace here.

1139
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:56.260
I mean Davi is the one who's constantly moving forward here and he's,

1140
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.780
he's trying to counter and throw these explosive bombs,

1141
01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:03.000
but Islam is using good footwork and good movement. You know what dive is,

1142
01:08:03.001 --> 01:08:05.800
right? Eyes Cut. Yep. Nice movement there in the clench,

1143
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.540
obviously just coming up short.

1144
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.730
He's throwing that jab and then the big right hand,

1145
01:08:11.731 --> 01:08:16.370
but [inaudible] Chavez moving just enough away. That's slight fight IQ

1146
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:20.780
<v 2>and he's popping that jab at him. It's real technical fight very well.</v>

1147
01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:24.280
That's how Maka Chubb fights man, his, his whole game is to,

1148
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:27.250
and he's only 27 that's the other thing about Mokatrov dude.

1149
01:08:27.251 --> 01:08:28.910
That's why I think in the main event with Khabib,

1150
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:31.400
you know it could be we'll fuck around a little bit and play the ego game and

1151
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:34.820
strike with you. I think his dad's in his corner now. He's, he like,

1152
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.310
we ain't doing that. We're not taking any of these risks.

1153
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.360
And he listened to his dad.

1154
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.510
Well I think you can get a full onslaught of could be grappling.

1155
01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.680
It's also this fucking heat man. Dominic Cruz says the hottest place on earth.

1156
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:49.670
That's not exactly what he said. John. Let's be honest.

1157
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.180
Something that Matt saw that arena

1158
01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.290
[inaudible] something like that.

1159
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:05.150
Look at, see Davi, he's swinging these punches but his entry is short.

1160
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.600
He landed a hammer fist on his forehead. How old is Ramos?

1161
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.920
32 so Islam's 27 Davi started to,

1162
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:16.280
he's just like in his entry, it's,

1163
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.770
it's a lot of these guys particularly like Jujitsu guys, the,

1164
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.620
even though they are developed power,

1165
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.740
they don't necessarily spend a lot of time on footwork.

1166
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:28.160
Footwork is so crucial for your ability to move in and move out.

1167
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:32.330
Did you see Campbell vs Lama? Chanko? Yes. Woo.

1168
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.720
That's all foot wear baby. Good fight though. Yeah.

1169
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.680
Campbell brought him as he did. That wasn't a cakewalk. Work is overrated. Ha.

1170
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.900
That's hilarious. It took you to something.

1171
01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.450
I was like, what's happening right now?

1172
01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:50.570
That dude brought about foot work. Dude foot works everything, man.

1173
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.790
Footwork's everything. You know,

1174
01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.430
one of the interesting things about watching a guy with really good footwork is

1175
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.890
you could see his opponent like doesn't necessarily know what,

1176
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:05.370
how he caught him on, dude. It dropped him and then he,

1177
01:10:05.371 --> 01:10:09.650
he went for a take down. It was like a good acting. Yeah. He,

1178
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.250
well he was in the area. It was like survival. Yeah. Reaction.

1179
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.280
But Maka Cheff definitely landed more. That was a big shot though.

1180
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.600
Dhabi's fucking dangerous man. But look, it's becoming more of a striking fight.

1181
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.020
Look out fucking, he's Ah, he's got his mouth open too, man.

1182
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:25.550
That's how hot it is in that joint.

1183
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.830
I'd love to see him just grappling and understand why they don't have better ac.

1184
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.730
The musters that they have at like a universal studios while you're waiting in

1185
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.180
line. How cool would that be? Well then everybody be greasy as it would be wet.

1186
01:10:38.181 --> 01:10:41.600
That'd be tear people slapping. Fuck, they're all sweaty anyway, man.

1187
01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:43.580
I mean how much wet are you going to get?

1188
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:45.830
Nobody wants to see that shit on the ground anyways.

1189
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.560
You approach through the burn. Oh,

1190
01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.980
it's so [inaudible].

1191
01:10:55.150 --> 01:11:00.110
Oh Shit. Oh Wow.

1192
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:04.430
I got some times. Cat Graham, Helen, right. That's that combat thumb.

1193
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:08.640
Low ground and pound on. Damn son. Dad, look, he's calling.

1194
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.350
He's blessed London. He's busted up. He's going to London right there.

1195
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.070
Look at that. Let's see if he could pull anything off,

1196
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.310
<v 1>man. I mean he's gotta be exhausted right here. Yeah, look,</v>

1197
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:21.150
mock chap pulls right out. Pops right out of there. So Greasy. Yeah, so greasy.

1198
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:22.970
Let's see if Debbie could pull something off though. Dude,

1199
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.860
he's going to go for a truck. How many of these these guys,

1200
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:28.380
traditional Jujitsu guys who are embracing rubber guard,

1201
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.370
how many of them come to you to try to learn some of this stuff because of the

1202
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.280
fact it's like the best thing to do when you're in a position where someone's

1203
01:11:35.281 --> 01:11:36.114
really greasy,

1204
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:40.620
you actually have control of your own leg and you can control someone's body and

1205
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:44.840
you know still it helps if they're [inaudible]. People are coming to me crazy.

1206
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.560
I'm not that man. I would imagine like this. This is a not a bad idea,

1207
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.040
but it's not as good. Yeah. If you, if you're still doubting,

1208
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:57.060
if rubber guard is the jet guy, go to the Instagram rubber guard assassins,

1209
01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:01.200
go to that and then just look at those clips and then tell me if it's

1210
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.410
legitimate. That's a dope Instagram page. Rubber guard assassins.

1211
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.110
I'm there every day, every day. It's just a reminder.

1212
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:11.970
That's one of my spots I go to every day to see what's up a calendar on its way.

1213
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:16.870
By the way, allegedly count up the cheese store right now, sniffing a dress,

1214
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.640
helping these, helping them right now. Dude, Jamie.

1215
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.360
Oh, was that an early knockout?

1216
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:25.710
That was that guy who I said got to start legs were shaking.

1217
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.080
Did you see his legs? He hit him right behind the air, dude,

1218
01:12:28.081 --> 01:12:30.270
his legs were vibrating. Yeah, man. Let him run.

1219
01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:34.830
The equilibrium that happens on [inaudible] does filthy though.

1220
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:40.080
You know when Valentina Shevchenko head kicked Jessica, I dude,

1221
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:44.070
she was down and out for so long and her legs were doing this little twitching

1222
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:47.640
thing like this here sound like a bat. Woo.

1223
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:53.550
That girl Valentine. Shevchenko you know, uh, I was talking to gas, Tom Bolanos.

1224
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.300
He came backstage to my show in San Francisco and we were talking and he said

1225
01:12:57.301 --> 01:12:58.530
something that I totally agree with.

1226
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.720
He said she might have one of the highest iqs fight Iqs in any division.

1227
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:07.410
Oh No. Female. A hundred percent a hundred percent she's so good.

1228
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.970
She's so goddamn good. She's setting her up with that body kick, whack, whack,

1229
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:14.100
and then dawn at, Ooh,

1230
01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:17.220
right off the coconut bar on that left arm.

1231
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:22.050
But look at the Russians left elbow. Not In a good spot for dobby.

1232
01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:25.980
He needs to get that elbow in before he goes to Davi. A good guard player.

1233
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.140
You know what I don't know. Yeah. He's,

1234
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:35.850
I'm known for strangling people and arm bars and shit. His top games like high,

1235
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.300
super high level, but I haven't really seen him fight off his back.

1236
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.510
Yeah. He's, he's struggling here. Little risk control. Let's see.

1237
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.820
He was guy looking for the Camorra oh leg going through.

1238
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:52.800
Uh Oh that was sneaky. I liked that.

1239
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:55.440
Setting them up for the camera and the right arm but going for the arm bar on

1240
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:59.730
the left. Hey Joe, has a dumb Cruz talked to you about coming back and fighting.

1241
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.250
Yes. He's on his way. Yeah, he's coming back.

1242
01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:06.210
He's trying to get a fight with south udo triple cs. Great fight. Yeah.

1243
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.350
And they're talking a lot of shit to each other, but they're making that fight.

1244
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:14.790
That's fight Benevidez he does. That's what Dana said. 25 yeah.

1245
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.090
Or vacate did.

1246
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.730
The only problem with that is like what if someone gets injured would've

1247
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.670
benefited as he gets injured. True. So this is interesting right here.

1248
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:26.630
Cause Davi has control of his leg and Islam is on top of him.

1249
01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.790
Not much time to work for Davi, man. Not looking good. Yeah. I think,

1250
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:31.250
I think the decision was,

1251
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:35.570
well this is why you realize why Islam is a 401 I don't have to pay your 20

1252
01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:39.320
bucks to 20 down. It's just kind of fun in the moment.

1253
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:43.220
[inaudible] pay the money, Bro. This is nonsense. It's not fair.

1254
01:14:43.221 --> 01:14:47.480
People are watching minus 400 people are watching like you really,

1255
01:14:47.481 --> 01:14:52.460
I don't have to pay it. Let's just keep tabs. What? What does Dhabi do here?

1256
01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.890
Eddie? Tell me what to do. If you were in Dhabi's corner,

1257
01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:58.700
we should control that orchard. That orchard really

1258
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.340
<v 6>is that harder to do on slippery folk? Dude,</v>

1259
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:07.700
dead orchard is the most common submission in Jujitsu history.

1260
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:14.070
A submission from your back in the history of Jujitsu.

1261
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.160
Really there's more dead orchard armbars than any other kind of Armbar from the

1262
01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:22.920
garden. Any kind of style of grappling. Where's dead?

1263
01:15:22.921 --> 01:15:26.460
Orchard armbars going on all day.

1264
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:31.050
Everywhere around the world there's a Instagram called dead Orchard Society.

1265
01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.630
Dude, they're everywhere and you don't see like regular,

1266
01:15:33.631 --> 01:15:35.910
traditional armbars anywhere these days.

1267
01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.810
When was the last time you seen an Armbar from the guard in Abu Dhabi?

1268
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:44.100
I could think of to Shante. Roberto. He's got a good close guard.

1269
01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.520
Armbar and chrome. Gracie. That's it. That's it.

1270
01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:49.320
You never see armbars from the garden.

1271
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:54.880
<v 1>Nathan Orchard's invention. Did he get really good at it? He invented it. Yep.</v>

1272
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:55.803
That's amazing.

1273
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.980
It's amazing when one guy finds a move that's so effective.

1274
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.510
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1275
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.820
<v 6>Nathan Orchard is a bad motherfucker,</v>

1276
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.140
<v 1>dude. 29 28 bang. Look at that.</v>

1277
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:11.920
So pretty clearly Islam on this fight. Yeah. Yeah.

1278
01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:15.430
<v 6>That's my most excited. Seattle. Nathan Orchard. Just a little shout out.</v>

1279
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.570
Sorry about that. And so who's running Portland? That's Phil Schwartz.

1280
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:23.980
That's another fucking monster do we got monsters everywhere, dude.

1281
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:26.290
All over the world. Isn't it crazy? Love all that shit.

1282
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:30.280
Started out the bomb squad. Yeah, Dude. Memorizing back in the day.

1283
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:35.410
I got killers all over the goddamn world. Every day I wake up,

1284
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:39.490
I'm like, how the fuck did that happen? You know who looks fucking great, Ralph.

1285
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.090
Ralph tearing. Look at you falling Ralph.

1286
01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:47.290
I've talked to 10 plant a borough in old school. Dude,

1287
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:51.130
I used to hate rolling with that guy. He was way bigger back then too.

1288
01:16:51.131 --> 01:16:54.190
It was really like he's, he's leaned out. He's shredded.

1289
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.910
If you see the picture that he posted, 55 years old. Yeah. Full six pack.

1290
01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.160
Shred it back. He's a super athlete and constantly working. Constantly training,

1291
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:08.020
you know, Rout Ralph was before the whole leg lock revolution.

1292
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:12.830
Ralph Victor, um, and Amir,

1293
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:14.810
they were all training with um,

1294
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.620
CSW and Josh Barnett and Eric Paulson.

1295
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.580
They were my leg lock guys. I like, I like what crew? My leg block cruel.

1296
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:25.700
I thought I was balls deepen the last time victor caught me.

1297
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:29.810
He caught me with a heel hook. Yeah, those are my black guys.

1298
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.080
And then when the leg lock revolution busted out, I realized shit,

1299
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:37.460
I'm not doing enough. Like I thought I was doing plenty with leg locks. We were,

1300
01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:39.560
he looking all the Goddamn time and 10th planet.

1301
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.240
But then once Ebi took off and we re, I realize, Oh shit,

1302
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.650
I'm not doing enough leg locks. I thought I was, but I'm not.

1303
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.780
So I fixed that shit. Was I do telling them what to say.

1304
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.030
Call somebody up. Probably.

1305
01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.410
Probably don't forget to thank the prime paying you shit Brendan. No,

1306
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:02.840
you don't owe me shit man. You owe him 20 bucks.

1307
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.340
I don't give a fuck about that shit.

1308
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.360
How come you're so aggressive about not paying? I don't pay bets.

1309
01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:11.080
What do you want to do? Nothing.

1310
01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.000
Let me get back to you back since this is over ready cause I'm very curious

1311
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:15.400
about, I'm gonna poke you in the it has,

1312
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:20.630
has anybody ever gotten that disc replacement thing and then gone into

1313
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:25.190
athletics? Gone back? That's a good question. I don't know. I'm trying man.

1314
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.730
Cause I, you know, rolling with little dudes trying to get in there.

1315
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:34.030
I'm trying to get my shit together cause you know when you're teaching Jujitsu,

1316
01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:37.610
when you're teaching and you're not rolling,

1317
01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.250
there's a big difference man.

1318
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:45.230
Because if you're not rolling there's so much shit that you forget.

1319
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.500
You know when you roll every time I'm rolling.

1320
01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:51.380
Even when it's like little blue belts and stuff, I'm like, oh,

1321
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:55.970
I remember that little transition. I got to teach that. Oh, I remember that one.

1322
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.720
Ooh, I don't remember this. I remember that because if you're not rolling dude,

1323
01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:04.580
it's like you like if you're teaching and you're not rolling all your

1324
01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:08.390
experiences just like plateau. That's it. You don't, you don't, you don't,

1325
01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.040
you can't, it's so hard to evolve and progress if you're not rolling.

1326
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:17.900
So man, I'm just trying to roll just to keep my teaching uh,

1327
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:22.790
evolving. Yeah. Stop Rolling Dude. You're frozen.

1328
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:27.690
And it's like teaching a language but not talking. Exactly. It's that.

1329
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.380
It's so important. You gotta keep rolling.

1330
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.620
So I physically and I'm probably not supposed to be rolling,

1331
01:19:35.931 --> 01:19:40.070
but um, a couple times a week, like twice a week I roll in.

1332
01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.860
Have you had your back looked at since you said that it's in pain?

1333
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:46.880
I'm afraid you're afraid. Like some shits loose and I'm afraid I don't, I don't.

1334
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.430
So it's going to happen. How do you feel right now?

1335
01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:50.990
Like sitting there right now. I'm fine.

1336
01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:55.010
It doesn't hurt right now when it hurts us. If I stand for too long.

1337
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.770
I remember back in the day of the comedy store when I would stand, they go,

1338
01:19:57.771 --> 01:20:00.170
where's daddy yet? And Joe Gall, he's sitting down somewhere.

1339
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:01.940
His back's fucked up. I would have to,

1340
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:06.410
I couldn't stand for more than 15 minutes. This was four years.

1341
01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.950
This was like you can stand

1342
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:12.390
<v 7>and stand for Lee to Joe. It's a, he's sitting down somewhere early.</v>

1343
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:15.510
Two thousands he couldn't stand. I couldn't stop. I can't,

1344
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:20.490
I can't stand like in one spot for more than like 1520 minutes without my back

1345
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:22.830
freezing up. Fuck man. It's tough. Crazy. It's tough.

1346
01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.170
So when I'm shooting down pumps, I went up and teaching.

1347
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:29.580
Now I'm teaching and if I'm just standing around teaching af like within a half

1348
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.400
an hour I got to sit down and start stretching my hamstrings cause you get

1349
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.200
tight. What do you do to now let me ask you this.

1350
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.630
If you strengthen all those muscles,

1351
01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.480
like significantly strengthening the muscles in your back. Listen man,

1352
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.610
this place is open to you anytime you want to use it.

1353
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.460
There's a reverse hyper machine. There's a bunch of back things up,

1354
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:46.620
gets inflammation that I'm dealing with. It's not,

1355
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:49.650
it's no standing weak muscles. It's inflammation. I understand.

1356
01:20:49.651 --> 01:20:52.600
But some of that can be mitigated by these machines and strengthened killers.

1357
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.640
No, no, no, no. Fuck that. I'm this. And then the other thing is sauna.

1358
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.310
Anytime you want to use a sauna here, go sit in that sauna.

1359
01:20:59.311 --> 01:21:03.660
That'll reduce inflammation. Big Time. You know what Cryo most is?

1360
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:07.860
When I jump in a pole and I swim, take the weight off of it.

1361
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.920
It's like a, it's like the coolness of the pool.

1362
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.410
It's like doing cardio in a pole. Dude.

1363
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:16.200
When I'm doing sprints and I'm dead tired, I'm out at the pool.

1364
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.380
I'm going to fucking pull and I'm automatically being cooled off in a pool.

1365
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:25.200
It's the best for me. Like swimming is everything for me. Right.

1366
01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:28.500
You see that football player who when the crowd chamber and did it where the

1367
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.590
booties and he stayed in there for like four talking about that right before the

1368
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:35.340
podcast. Oh really? Yeah, the good. The guy was his name Jay Antonio Brown.

1369
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:38.040
He got done today cause he's an asshole.

1370
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:42.120
But he's the best player in the game and he had a Madison for Dell Beckham Jr.

1371
01:21:42.121 --> 01:21:46.530
Okay. Shut the fuck up. [inaudible] Brown, right? Stats beg to differ.

1372
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.390
Best catch of all time.

1373
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.480
The Best Kachin NFL history was by who the giants were seeing how bad Kyrie

1374
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:56.420
David tied, right? No, no, no, no, no. Oh No. Beck him.

1375
01:21:56.421 --> 01:22:00.250
When he goes back with that one with one hand, that's great. I'm like this,

1376
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.430
but the homeboy did in the Superbowl. Come on man. No, no.

1377
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:05.490
That's the best catch in NFL history. That's Odell Beckham.

1378
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:08.580
Any radio jumper in case it gets cold inside. In the event

1379
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.200
they said to the UMC fighting fan experience,

1380
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.480
they built this arena specifically for UFC events. Someone's,

1381
01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.610
they're going to take someone and drag them into the woods with a camel.

1382
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.620
Oh Dude, do you mean the Sand Dragon? Let's say someone's done fucked up.

1383
01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:28.260
They might make their own woods out there. Do you know Abu Dhabi?

1384
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:31.890
They make it rain. They're once a year on purpose. Excuse me.

1385
01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:35.840
Once a week they cloud see 50, 50, two times a year. They have,

1386
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.510
they built their own islands too. Yeah. Yeah, they did though. That's a,

1387
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:41.970
that's Dubai actually is by has a, uh,

1388
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.380
a crazy island that's shaped like a palm shaped like the world. Yeah.

1389
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:47.850
Like palm tree. But it has,

1390
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.290
it's like each one of them represents the different continents. Yeah.

1391
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.510
It's really kind of crazy. Some of them are melting, right?

1392
01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.700
Like the sense like the water's taken away.

1393
01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:58.080
People have these huge cribs on them.

1394
01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:01.680
Can't really fight nature of hurricanes in that area. I do not.

1395
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:06.370
I don't think so. I don't think so. Did you hear were criticizing

1396
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:09.910
<v 1>Tyler Perry because Tyler Perry sent a bunch of, um,</v>

1397
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.220
resources down to The Bahamas, a bunch of supplies,

1398
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:13.750
but he did it in his private jet.

1399
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:17.860
He sent his own jet filled with products and people like, you know,

1400
01:23:17.861 --> 01:23:19.840
that's the height of celebrity ignorance.

1401
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:23.860
You're using a private jet and it's contributing to global warming. I'm like,

1402
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.150
how the fuck

1403
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.860
do you think that they're going to get these things down there?

1404
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:34.330
Listen people who such Edwards UFC legend. Yves Edwards.

1405
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.780
He's from The Bahamas. Yes. And he's like,

1406
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:42.370
he's trying to rally as many people as possible to help to go down there.

1407
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:46.740
Go to eve. It's a at Thug Jujitsu. Jensen.

1408

A tug Jitsu Thug Jitsu on Instagram.

1409
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.590
If you want to donate and help the people out. Is it a go fund me?

1410
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:57.130
It's some kind of donation. Cause just the dude.

1411
01:23:57.131 --> 01:24:01.570
Have you seen the drone footage of that island? That Bosco Island? Dude,

1412
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.990
it looks like a bomb got dropped. There's Eve. Wow, look at that. That's crazy.

1413
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:07.990
That looks like the, there you go. Thug thug.

1414
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:11.740
But to master to two master, but it Miss Florida, right?

1415
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:13.140
It went right past Florida. Yeah,

1416
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:17.090
but it was on the way to Alabama according to Trump. Did you see that? No,

1417
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.540
we're Trump drew. Like they, they told Trump,

1418
01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.300
Trump said it's on the way to Alabama and they were like, no, it's not.

1419
01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:27.220
So he shows a map of the hurricane and then with a sharpie he had drawn a line

1420
01:24:27.221 --> 01:24:30.880
like headed towards Alabama. It's like, look,

1421
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.950
I know like what the fuck are you talking about? Dude? People were watching,

1422
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.900
looking at the picture like Kyle Kalinsky was,

1423
01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:40.810
he had it up on his howling howling at this.

1424
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:45.820
Like Trump just added a sharpie can just drew a class line. It's classic,

1425
01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:50.740
but Jamie, didn't you say it may or may not be like against the law,

1426
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:55.741
what he did like against the law to alter a federal forecast or something like

1427
01:24:56.921 --> 01:24:59.750
that. That's out bullshit. They're not going to do anything to him.

1428
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.370
That's fucking bullshit. What does that on CNN and talking shit on Trump

1429
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:10.120
[inaudible] I know on CNN, they're all over Trump for that shit.

1430
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:14.200
They need to shut the fuck up at CNN, you know this was CNN.

1431
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:17.770
Fox News was making fun of it too, Dude. Everybody having every fondness to no,

1432
01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:21.120
look, Eddie, everyone was making fun of it. He literally drew a lot.

1433
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:23.740
It's just funny, the guy didn't want to be proven wrong.

1434
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.660
He said there was going to Alabama.

1435
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.530
The forecasters did not say he was going out. He missed little area.

1436
01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:34.540
So he took a piece of paper with the forecast and drew an extra little line,

1437
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.490
a little loop headed towards Alabama because he knows it's funny.

1438
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.830
Look at the sharpie line, the bubbles. He's like, look, see,

1439
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:47.830
I told you the forecasts. Look,

1440
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:51.700
do the people around like dog dentists, they can all fly, man.

1441
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:55.660
There's some people going to see the people around him will not deny that he did

1442
01:25:55.661 --> 01:25:59.800
it. Do you know, do you know that island that got hit? Do you know that, uh,

1443
01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:03.990
the conspiracy theory? I Dunno. It's, oh

1444
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:07.460
<v 4>no. This conspiracy on hurricanes hitting. Yeah. Wow.</v>

1445
01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:11.900
What are they conspiracy? They're so crazy. And the Epstein and all that shit.

1446
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.790
It's so crazy. None of that was hurting with Epstein Epstein happening.

1447
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:20.060
Dude. You guys gotta be opened at fucking everything. Okay.

1448
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:22.820
Tell us about the heredity opened the efforts about the hurricane Eddie.

1449
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:25.340
I don't know, man. You guys don't want, Oh, I'll do it.

1450
01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:29.600
And I [inaudible] ever heard one of hurricane, I believe in Epstein.

1451
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:33.830
I believe in fucking a ton of stuff. I don't know, man. Eddie,

1452
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:38.070
you guys, you guys, you guys, uh, he get mad about Trump. He's,

1453
01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.750
that's what got him. These are Trump supporters. Trump,

1454
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:46.340
Trump trying to fucking save this country and they're fucking crazy left is

1455
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:50.780
trying to fucking put transgenders in, in elementary schools. Okay,

1456
01:26:50.781 --> 01:26:55.640
so that's, you guys don't believe whatever the fucking was simple,

1457
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:59.030
simplified narrative. But I assume what you're saying like come on man. Poverty.

1458
01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:01.580
Here we go. Pull filter. Paul Felder.

1459
01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:06.350
Barboza to Paul Felder is a big Jackin lightweight.

1460
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.320
He has a shorts to keep them high and tight, Bro. Yeah.

1461
01:27:09.321 --> 01:27:13.100
I don't know why anybody would wear shorts that are loose because it gives

1462
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.840
someone an opportunity to grab them. Also just mobility. Yeah. Boxers.

1463
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:18.960
Why does where I'm so bad?

1464
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.970
Shorts mean you could grab them because people just do grab them.

1465
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:26.840
It doesn't mean that it's illegal, but they do. But nobody grabs tights.

1466
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:28.220
I mean if someone grabs tight,

1467
01:27:28.221 --> 01:27:31.310
so you literally go to grandma fucking tight to check on the lifts for little

1468
01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:35.720
shreds. I says, pads, I'm going to grab your tights.

1469
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.780
That's what happened in metamorris too. There was like a big fucking,

1470
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.800
it was some bullshit ass legal shit going on with that.

1471
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:46.700
Like cause I was wearing pants and Heuler was wearing tights.

1472
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:50.960
They said since you're, you're wearing pants heuler can grab them.

1473
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:54.380
And I said okay, if he could grab my pants, I'm going to grab his shorts.

1474
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:56.990
No you can't grab shorts. Look like he's grabbing my pants.

1475
01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.190
Why can't I grab his shorts?

1476
01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:02.990
Because the shorts are form fitting and your pants are loose. Hey Jamie,

1477
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:06.220
can you bring up Barboza Lincoln few fights? No, no, no.

1478
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:10.190
It doesn't make any sense that I was in the middle of everything to try to get

1479
01:28:10.191 --> 01:28:14.660
you to lose it. Crazy shit where I had to go at the very end, I'd go,

1480
01:28:14.661 --> 01:28:18.440
okay you could grab my motherfucking pants and I won't grab your fucking shorts.

1481
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:21.920
It got to that. Is that how you left it? I'm like what Brad?

1482
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:22.790
My motherfucking path.

1483
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:26.660
Cause I'm trying to make it legal for him to grab my pants because they weren't

1484
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:30.590
form fitting but I couldn't grab his shorts because they were formed fits.

1485
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:34.130
You ever find out how bad his knee is, bro. His knee.

1486
01:28:34.131 --> 01:28:38.090
I will never forget that. Sit in there walk cause I was live. I was right there.

1487
01:28:38.091 --> 01:28:41.900
I was watching you wrench his knees sideways and I was just going, oh

1488
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:46.400
I was thinking he's going to tap any second now and it's going pop, pop, pop,

1489
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:48.800
pop, pop, pop. Yeah. He didn't tap.

1490
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:53.270
That shit popped all over the place and animal and he tap. He's an animal.

1491
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.880
The fact that you can tap, it's been tough for him.

1492
01:28:56.150 --> 01:29:01.070
Lust videos last for Shark Winnie. That's be fake, right?

1493
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.093
No, you got

1494
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.720
<v 2>[inaudible]. Who the fuck shark? Winnie. Who is Shark Winnie Click on shirt.</v>

1495
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:11.220
Dan. That's great bro. What do you mean it's fake? Barboza verse winning.

1496
01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.020
He never headline in March 30 that's fake.

1497
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.040
And now they just got someone to spot for his jacket. Who's shark?

1498
01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:21.900
Winnie as the greatest jacket ever. It fake. It's a fake. It's fake Joe. Yeah,

1499
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:25.530
because his last fight he knocked out Dan Hooker. Right. Is that real?

1500
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:30.750
There's no guy named Dan Hooker. Just engage with Kao to him in his last fight.

1501
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.793
Yeah.

1502
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:36.950
So who is this kind of a crossroads where Barboza someone fuck with Wikipedia

1503
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:39.210
and got us to say it. They got us

1504
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.900
some lost Felder. Lost fatherless.

1505
01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:47.610
Barboza Barboza little mud fight though, bro.

1506
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:48.810
He was hitting him with this switch.

1507
01:29:48.811 --> 01:29:52.740
K everything that was like literally like he was moving through time.

1508
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:55.560
This kind of a crossroads for buyer Bose though. You look at this kind of,

1509
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.420
you know what I'm saying? Girls for Felder, two men.

1510
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.720
Felder got beat by Mike Perry. Broke his arm,

1511
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.720
had to get his arm bolted together again. Was that his last fight?

1512
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:07.560
That's his last fight, right? Mike Perry Felder's going to be fine.

1513
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:10.570
Those are commentator. Oh, he's a great comment. I love him as a kid.

1514
01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:14.190
His mind is so sharp too. Just not having any problems at all.

1515
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.870
And He's got a fucking chin, like a piece of rock [inaudible] description.

1516
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.560
A piece of rock. What does that, oh, I saw it too last night.

1517
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:25.800
How was it fucking legit man? Was it the ending? A little dicey.

1518
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:30.060
Stephen King sucked from who? Um, I don't know.

1519
01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:34.190
Probably same people that hated Dave Chappelle's comedy special for,

1520
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:37.320
especially for being what? Dave Chappelle's comedy special.

1521
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:41.430
Who did the Chris Media. Did you hear what social media? No, no, no, no.

1522
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.690
Critics. This is what happened. It's ridiculous on rotten tomatoes. So good.

1523
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:47.070
So good. The critics put it on.

1524
01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.490
They put it on rotten tomatoes and rotten tomatoes only let five critics judge

1525
01:30:50.491 --> 01:30:54.630
it and they gave it as 0% they didn't have it open to the public and people were

1526
01:30:54.631 --> 01:30:57.120
furious and they were, okay, here we go. The fight side.

1527
01:30:57.330 --> 01:31:00.020
Then they open it up to the public. You got 99% which parties?

1528
01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:03.390
Nothing gets [inaudible]. Chappelle crushed that shit. Of course.

1529
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.110
Steve Chappelle, so Paul Felder, Ooh, look at that. Right away.

1530
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.070
Barboza was showing spinning shit. That low calf kick and then oh my,

1531
01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.500
these boys are brings it baron. Was it because of that LBGT bit? Oh yeah,

1532
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:20.330
definitely. A lot of it fell to just top. Just touched him with, oh shit.

1533
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:23.400
There's that switch kick these boys, they're trying to go to the judges.

1534
01:31:23.401 --> 01:31:27.390
Are they? That switch kicked at Barboza throws is the best in the game.

1535
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.240
His switch kick to the body is fucking insane, dude.

1536
01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:33.540
Barboza is 10 is way better than Felder's. It's a lot better.

1537
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.190
Look at that Tan Felder's that Philly white boy founders putting that fucking

1538
01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:40.830
pressure on them. Huh? Look at that. That low calf kick. Oh,

1539
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.470
everybody's throwing that Felder's thrown heat.

1540
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:46.280
Barbosa has a speed advantage for sure. Oh yeah, for short.

1541
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:49.140
But he hasn't over almost everybody. He's so fast.

1542
01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:52.270
But they ever on the close down first fight. I don't believe that.

1543
01:31:52.271 --> 01:31:56.880
I don't think so. I think it was mostly a lot of this. I think that'd be tragic.

1544
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.440
Felder's not taking anybody down. He cracks with everybody.

1545
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:01.563
<v 1>Look at this though.</v>

1546
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.990
Try and take him down and he might just be threatening him cause it's hot as

1547
01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:06.550
fuck out there. He's trying to wear him out.

1548
01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.070
[inaudible] I don't think it's that hot out there, man.

1549
01:32:09.071 --> 01:32:14.020
I think you blown it out of proportion. Well Dominic crew sounds 120 oh,

1550
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:17.410
there's blood. If someone's got blood, look, it's all over a Barboza.

1551
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:22.330
His left arm is Felder. Cut Hashtag in Abu Dhabi.

1552
01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:26.890
Nice. Where's that? It's right there on the day. That's important to them.

1553
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:32.470
The ring links that goddamned in the ring in the cage. Oh, Ooh.

1554
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:36.300
Left Hook over the top. Where is the, Ooh, that leg kick and again,

1555
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.800
damn Felder. Zite nose checked it though. Oh, Sham.

1556
01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:43.770
Left-Hand Bro. He's going to drop.

1557
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:46.270
Someone's getting knocked out after I've took connect.

1558
01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:50.650
Son Felder is bound and determined to get this back and after he got killed by

1559
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.800
[inaudible], he thinks that Barboza is right for the picking.

1560
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.300
I think it's fear thinking. Who got knocked out by Gay g? A Barboza did.

1561
01:32:58.330 --> 01:33:00.940
He did garb. Kg starched him.

1562
01:33:00.941 --> 01:33:04.030
He stepped right to him and pounded his face with the right hand.

1563
01:33:04.031 --> 01:33:08.380
And they're doing gay g cowboys. What do you think about that? To fight night.

1564
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:11.680
Okay, so Felder's cut and it looks like he's cut on the forehead.

1565
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.680
It was not the fucking switch to the bar. Oh, we checked that one though.

1566
01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.260
On his left leg. Yeah. That's how you do it. That no, no, no, no, it's not.

1567
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.080
We get the body shot. Landis. Was that how you do it? You can.

1568
01:33:23.081 --> 01:33:26.030
You certainly can, dude. Look at the look at his fucking ribs now.

1569
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:30.760
But the way he checked it, it was the Shin Slam right into the thick,

1570
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:33.430
heavy part of the bone above the knee or below the knee.

1571
01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:37.840
That's where a Chris Weidman broke Anderson Silva's leg. Dude,

1572
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:41.260
that's a disadvantaged home. The skin color like bill burr, anything that hits,

1573
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.280
say something. Sandy got headbutted. He said he got head-butted.

1574
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.920
He's shaking his head. What does he say? What is he saying? What is he saying?

1575
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:52.120
I think I bring a doctor in here. He was talking that, that's so weird.

1576
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:55.360
What is he saying? It's above it.

1577
01:33:55.361 --> 01:33:59.800
So was checking the cut cause coming into his eyes and not really.

1578
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.880
That's the fine cut. I don't get it. What's going on?

1579
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.160
Let's see what happened. Thank, oh 100% headbutt 100% right there.

1580
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.850
So what are they going to say? And they just going to let him play.

1581
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.760
But I don't understand why he took that little break. This one to chuck.

1582
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:17.590
I think, uh, wanted to let everybody know that it was a headbutt.

1583
01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.980
I think herb wanted to check on it to the prop, but he was,

1584
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:24.340
he was motioning to check on that check to say something.

1585
01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:29.380
He was alerting herb herb. Oh my God. I'm telling you,

1586
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.730
you felt it can land that fucking left man. Well,

1587
01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:38.731
Barboza is almost purely a standup when you're almost purely a standup fighter.

1588
01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:44.100
It's so, it's Felder and you've had a few knockouts. People, oh,

1589
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.540
Barboza is still a purple belt. I don't know. I don't know what is juicy.

1590
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.250
It's gotta be a black belt by now. You think so? He's gotta be doing for,

1591
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:55.930
I mean cause even tries to get in the mix for like eight years.

1592
01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.660
He's threatened with the spin. Ricardo Amido, right. If you look at his hips,

1593
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:02.780
he's looking to spin. You see that right hip. He keeps,

1594
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:04.880
he keeps setting up with his right hip.

1595
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.790
Who's got a better wheel kicked in that mother.

1596
01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.710
He's got the best wheel kick ever against Adam. Remember that?

1597
01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.960
That was the first ever wheel kit. K on the UFC.

1598
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.330
He's at the best switch kick for sure.

1599
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.060
I've never seen a switch that for better ever. Never see.

1600
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:21.350
Even in Moitai I've never seen someone with a faster Bishkek and it's also

1601
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:22.250
powerful man.

1602
01:35:22.251 --> 01:35:25.220
You ever see when Mark Henry is holding pads for him and he hits that switch

1603
01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:27.560
kick, it's like cow rack,

1604
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:32.390
like a baseball bat cow rack. He's feeling good now. He's,

1605
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.810
he saw the blood and the fun fight running down Felder's faith.

1606
01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:36.920
He's feeling good now.

1607
01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:42.290
Felder's in an interesting situation because he's a fucking dangerous guy for

1608
01:35:42.291 --> 01:35:45.650
sure. He's a tough fight for anybody but his face is busted.

1609
01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:48.590
But Kenny be a world champion, you know,

1610
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:52.940
and if he can't is he going to eventually just step back and just commentate

1611
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:55.310
Ooh. Barboza with a gun. I would imagine if,

1612
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.090
let's say you get kicked code in this, I would imagine it goes through his head.

1613
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.520
Well I could probably just become dated.

1614
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:04.310
I fish tacos or hurt his leg right there.

1615
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.460
I don't like the way he wobbled after Felder checked that kick.

1616
01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:11.840
I think Barboza is right legs and a little bit of trouble cause he wobbled and I

1617
01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:15.240
don't like how he's moving. Which leg? Just right leg. His right leg. Yup.

1618
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:19.430
He threw a kick and Felder checked it perfectly and Barboza had that little,

1619
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:23.870
Oh fuck I hurt my shin wobble and now he hasn't thrown it and he's moving away

1620
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:26.150
moving Tinder limits or something. Wow.

1621
01:36:26.151 --> 01:36:31.151
Look at that month you seasoned movie tie professional fighters.

1622
01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:36.980
Can they still get like, like Kit Kayla like no, like,

1623
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:41.620
like can they get their leg kick checked and it hurts? Yes. Still it,

1624
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:44.330
it still hurts. It's still can't get to the point where it doesn't hurt no more.

1625
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:46.880
Cause the nerves are dead. Right. It's always the muscle.

1626
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:50.000
Well there's all tissue around in and trees and there's all this stuff from

1627
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:53.000
banana trees are easy. Dude, I could kick the fuck out of a banana tree.

1628
01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.510
Tie Fighters will still feel pain in their shin. They called [inaudible].

1629
01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.330
Most of it, they feel on the outside of the Shin, the bone,

1630
01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:04.550
the Shin gets what's called calcified. Right.

1631
01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:08.150
So you have these microfractures that are happening all over your Shin as you're

1632
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:12.380
clashing shins and hitting heavy bags and hitting sand bags and all that shit

1633
01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:15.740
gets dead. But what doesn't get dead is all this shit around it.

1634
01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.490
So when you add hot on that shit, yes. All that can to like here,

1635
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.200
like this kind of shit here. I always thought,

1636
01:37:21.201 --> 01:37:25.190
is there a point where your leg is just like, doesn't feel shit. Well,

1637
01:37:25.191 --> 01:37:28.970
your leg meat, leg up here, up top, there's always always vulnerable.

1638
01:37:28.971 --> 01:37:33.180
Particularly like our Nesto hoost he used to target right above the knees.

1639
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:36.170
So no matter how much experience you have, if you get hit in the right spot,

1640
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:40.250
yeah, it hurts. Yeah. Especially a guy like who stood God. Yeah.

1641
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:43.670
Like mark poses a leg kick, a Saurus,

1642
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:46.780
he's such a monster with his leg kicks. There's that switch.

1643
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:50.120
Look at that switch. So he's lighting ribs up. He's checking it though.

1644
01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:54.110
And every time he checks it Barboza is going to step back because you can snap

1645
01:37:54.111 --> 01:37:56.370
your fucking Shin and he's checking

1646
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:00.510
<v 2>it with his knee pulls Kalief next to yeah, to be honest. Damn,</v>

1647
01:38:00.511 --> 01:38:04.860
I can't wait for that fight. What happened? That was two hours quit. Well Shit,

1648
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:09.630
there you go to the body failed it with a kick to the body. So He fell.

1649
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:10.980
It was like one step behind.

1650
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:15.030
I think if you're going to beat Barboza like the way gate she did it,

1651
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.650
you got to literally throw yourself into the fire Khabib.

1652
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.470
You got to break it down and smash them. Smashed some down.

1653
01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:22.690
So did Kevin Lee like you get, you got to wrestle them.

1654
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:25.980
You can't sit here and play this game. If you do sit here and play this game,

1655
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:28.920
you got to do it. The weight gain she does when she goes out,

1656
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:31.320
he runs into the fire. Look, he's made out of his bestest.

1657
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.670
He just fucking throws himself into it. He makes it a fucking Bronx.

1658
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:37.480
He makes it a horrible kissing on the outside of the trade.

1659
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:40.050
You can't sit on that. Exactly. Exactly.

1660
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:44.110
So this is a show bar. Bowie.

1661
01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:49.290
Now look at this. He wants to steal this round.

1662
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.980
Paul's lighten them up with some elbows down there and fellow Felder's a double.

1663
01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:55.140
Great. [inaudible] but it doesn't matter.

1664
01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.390
He's told no when in the round it does matter.

1665
01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.380
Cause Paul at [inaudible] it doesn't matter if the [inaudible] open him up bad.

1666
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:04.740
It doesn't matter if the round ends now, but it's three minutes to go.

1667
01:39:04.741 --> 01:39:08.850
Three 30 to go out. I'm no bad. And when did he cut him from the bottom? Yes,

1668
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:11.910
he's leading. Susan went down their elbow.

1669
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:16.410
Oh Shit we have, we seen Felder play guard.

1670
01:39:16.530 --> 01:39:17.820
Oh Ladies and gentlemen.

1671
01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:26.970
[inaudible] the actor. Come Sit Down Aka the actor. Where's your wine?

1672
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.180
You want some whiskey? Cheese. You want some whiskey? Be One.

1673
01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.300
A little whiskey. I like plans. Well if you're gonna push me, I'll do.

1674
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:38.970
You're like what? Blands oh,

1675
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:44.670
we still have [inaudible] from acting. I do. Didn't you wipe it off? Looks good.

1676
01:39:46.630 --> 01:39:51.000
You should hire someone to do that all day. I have to catch you up dude. I have.

1677
01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:54.440
I have a sheen and tight skin dude. Let's go get this hard bar from the bottom.

1678
01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:58.980
Fell out. Felder's a bad motherfucker, man. Look at this. This is a blood bath.

1679
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:02.460
It is a blood. A lot of like stuff that just chatter about,

1680
01:40:02.461 --> 01:40:04.530
look how bad Barbosa is leaking.

1681
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:09.060
We've got back bottom fucked up man. There you go. Thanks.

1682
01:40:09.061 --> 01:40:11.800
You're the best buddy. You push her, but if a pusher, no,

1683
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:14.680
just when you join the fun. Woo. This is a blood bath show.

1684
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:17.970
This is the second round I was at. This is the best fight of the card so far.

1685
01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:22.140
It's an amazing mouth behind his fucking here. Yeah, look at that man. Good guy.

1686
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:25.500
Oh right hand Barboza was having a hard time seeing

1687
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:28.763
this is [inaudible].

1688
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:33.150
I remember the bags at the cage side of the first fight and he had such red

1689
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:36.670
welts on his body from Felder's. Looks like such an Allen, doesn't I?

1690
01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.030
I don't know if this is this thing. You were there for the first fight.

1691
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:39.980
I was there for the first fight.

1692
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:42.240
Was that one that I can't remember but I could hear it go black.

1693
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:43.740
I think it's Vegas. Had to have been Vegas.

1694
01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.540
It was going to say you wouldn't travel.

1695
01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.640
How weird is it that all this blood starts when a savage walks in the room?

1696
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:52.200
How weird is that? Oh,

1697
01:40:52.290 --> 01:40:56.080
a savage like dean called you walk in and all this blood spills.

1698
01:40:56.250 --> 01:41:00.490
What's going on? Oh, the elbow Felder just caught him.

1699
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:03.520
That was a hard shot. Dude. Felt Felder's bat to win this fight.

1700
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:06.400
Third rounds are both getting hot and he's melting.

1701
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:10.240
Oh look at this fell just coming on strong. Yeah.

1702
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:15.400
Why 24 to go higher do work Philly boy. It felt so hard to hurt.

1703
01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:19.410
He's so hard to hurt. I mean he was going crazy all over the world right now.

1704
01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:22.630
Philly's finest Catalan. Hartford.

1705
01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.300
Woo White people are calling crazy. Boom. Nice whiskey.

1706
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:35.530
I can't place that nice to best drink again.

1707
01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.070
It's a good Swiss skates. Like you could drink my goto and I go to a bar. Yup.

1708
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:41.350
Oh, a Felder's. Right. Arm's hurting him.

1709
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:45.610
He ate daddy that cause he went like this with his arm in a stiff way from

1710
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:49.800
[inaudible]. Yeah. And he's trying to hit him with an elbow now. Look guys. Oh,

1711
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:53.740
you're right. He's kind of winged guys hurt. See how it's like hanging by? Yeah,

1712
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:57.280
he ate that switch. Kick on the arm. Dude. Barboza kicked so hard.

1713
01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.290
If you catch that shit on your triceps, hey,

1714
01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:02.710
these two are fucking each other up. Fuck caviar. This is a great fight.

1715
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:06.700
Great Fight Theater Major. For those of you guys wondering. Yeah, brilliant man.

1716
01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.140
As he is, look at that deep, deep on the shot shot. Nothing. Damn.

1717
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.770
People would get twisted that they think Barboza has horrible take on the fence.

1718
01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:16.210
He just fights fucking months.

1719
01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:19.060
Do you think those guys and the white get mad at bla gets on them? Like I say,

1720
01:42:19.061 --> 01:42:21.820
there's Tom and Cruz domino. I bet they like a little color. Oh,

1721
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:26.050
the guys back there. The Saudis? Yeah, the princes. Are they princes?

1722
01:42:26.051 --> 01:42:26.980
If they're wearing that now,

1723
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:29.510
but that these are granted or some money in that group right there.

1724
01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:31.630
I just assume they're all princes, but there's a,

1725
01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:33.040
there's a hundred princes then. Yeah.

1726
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.430
Is there a hundred places for a guy to be a prince? Oh, they're in Saudi Arabia.

1727
01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:39.700
This is all no Abudabi come on Bro. My second round,

1728
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:42.170
I assume they're all princes. They all drive lambos bro.

1729
01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:46.780
Barboza probably dusted and half toilet. Hey, Barboza is with att.

1730
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:49.510
When did that, when did that switch take place? Oh, that's right.

1731
01:42:49.511 --> 01:42:54.210
He went to Florida. He moved back down to Florida to become a [inaudible]. No,

1732
01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:57.730
I think he was his family. I think he wanted to be a,

1733
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.500
I think his family's down there.

1734
01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:02.590
I think he'd had to do with something about also being able to travel back and

1735
01:43:02.591 --> 01:43:05.830
forth easily to Brazil. Who is the guy in his corner? The guy with the tattoos.

1736
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:10.360
What's his name? Great take downs or Marcos Demato I think necessarily as, yeah.

1737
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.140
Per romper. Nah, that's not the good one. How do you say that? [inaudible] oh,

1738
01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:18.850
Ooh. That hug. Look at that Hook. Oh God damn it.

1739
01:43:18.851 --> 01:43:20.920
You can't get here we go round three and he had a piss.

1740
01:43:21.190 --> 01:43:25.630
Don't go piss me right here. Run, run. Get three pounds. The experts here.

1741
01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.380
That's right, buddy. Duke, Rufus Scape Kiss. You don't laugh.

1742
01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.100
He's an expert asshole. Thank you God. So rude. I know.

1743
01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.520
He's really silly. Brendan. Sorry. I come from the set guy.

1744
01:43:36.521 --> 01:43:38.530
Sorry about my makeup and I'm feeling a little emotional.

1745
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.090
Are you emotional because you've been acting? Do you train? Do you Dang.

1746
01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.520
I'm so drained, right? Recite one line. Did you? No, no, no.

1747
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:47.500
You have to watch the show, sir.

1748
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.740
Scheduled Wednesday nights at eight 30 let's wait until after the round then you

1749
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:55.490
could do is set. Boom. Kicked it. The Baal Barboza looks tired,

1750
01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.750
man. In between rounds. He looked very tired. They still throw him big balls.

1751
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:03.200
Yeah, he's got some, he's still got snapped. Those Brian.

1752
01:44:03.201 --> 01:44:05.840
Apparently this is a new arena and it's hot as hell.

1753
01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.920
They're saying that it's more than 120 degrees inside the arena or feels like

1754
01:44:09.921 --> 01:44:12.170
it's 120 degrees. Dry Heat, dry heat,

1755
01:44:12.171 --> 01:44:17.171
but still very commentated for pride in 2000 in the year 2000 and we were in

1756
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.610
like some Tokyo stadium and it was so fucking hot and humid.

1757
01:44:22.611 --> 01:44:23.900
I had a suit with a coat.

1758
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.080
I wouldn't take the jacket off because I was completely drenched on the inside.

1759
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:31.220
Dude, you gotta take a jam. I'm like, dude,

1760
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:33.920
you don't want to see what's under this. How was it looked like?

1761
01:44:33.921 --> 01:44:38.660
I jumped in a pole. It was so hot. Pride. 10 pride.

1762
01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:42.590
10 did you watch all those fights? It was like 110 degrees.

1763
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:47.090
Pure humidity. It was death. Go back and watch those fights. That was when I,

1764
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:50.660
Hanzo and Sakharova went at it. Rumor that Shit. Yes I do. Yes.

1765
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:54.380
Felder just called them. The legend goes in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain,

1766
01:44:54.381 --> 01:44:55.214
places like this.

1767
01:44:55.430 --> 01:45:00.110
It certain times of the year you can fry an egg on the pavement if it's been out

1768
01:45:00.111 --> 01:45:02.960
there. Felder pressing the pace here. I wonder who's winning this fight.

1769
01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:07.520
You know we've been talking but I mean you've been talking. What about you bro?

1770
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:11.300
I've been watching paying attention, bro.

1771
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:13.610
I'm a fight kind of sore. Yes you are dude.

1772
01:45:13.611 --> 01:45:15.690
And I didn't know you were that tatted out. Well,

1773
01:45:15.691 --> 01:45:19.730
I'm good at talking with your shoulders watching like I do that. Yes,

1774
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:23.540
your watch and talk to it for a living sometimes I wouldn't say a living.

1775
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:26.480
It's like a side job now where you were going to this fight.

1776
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:27.610
Hundreds couldn't get to you though.

1777
01:45:27.610 --> 01:45:31.220
I'm not interested in getting all the way over there when I can do this with you

1778
01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:32.054
guys. Right.

1779
01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:36.260
And be like super close to home and do sets last night at the store.

1780
01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:40.670
Imagine when the fights over spinning back fist by,

1781
01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:43.550
by both sides that that might've been a wheel that was real.

1782
01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.610
Flight's gonna suck that. Not that he should show.

1783
01:45:46.611 --> 01:45:48.260
He started the same thing with a wheel kick.

1784
01:45:48.261 --> 01:45:51.770
I bet you catch the flight sucks and it sucks getting there and it sucks when

1785
01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:54.740
your body is so fused. Oh my God,

1786
01:45:54.741 --> 01:45:59.310
these guys are colliding two 47 ago. Who?

1787
01:45:59.790 --> 01:46:04.790
Who's winning the first [inaudible] clipped him with some shots at the shore.

1788
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.250
Oh, what if Dennis said, okay,

1789
01:46:07.251 --> 01:46:12.080
we'll fly you to Abu Dhabi private jacket with a king size bed.

1790
01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:12.891
It's not good enough.

1791
01:46:12.891 --> 01:46:16.370
The problem is it does your body in and it still takes 16 hours.

1792
01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.970
Kingsize fucking bed. I don't know. I got one of those at home, Bro.

1793
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.380
Some fighters can take just full shot, full back kicks and just keep coming.

1794
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:27.770
These two guys are made of metal. Well, it depends on how it lands,

1795
01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:31.820
man who's throwing it, but it doesn't matter who you are. Feelings correctly.

1796
01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:34.670
You ain't come for, yeah. That's one of those kicks. It's just, it just,

1797
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:37.930
there's just a lot. It's not designed to take that. No matter who you are,

1798
01:46:37.931 --> 01:46:39.140
your left hand,

1799
01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.650
you don't get get in better shape than that fell to hurt him with that left

1800
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:46.070
counter. Oh he did. He hit him with a right hand too. Well, that time.

1801
01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:50.130
Diff elder coming on strong, man. I fell down tiny. That left hooks.

1802
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.760
<v 7>I'm in the middle of filter. Felder's pushing it here. God fell.</v>

1803
01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.570
There's a beast. They better give this fight to Felder just cause, well,

1804
01:46:56.610 --> 01:47:00.510
who knows? There's two rounds of blood coming off of Barboza.

1805
01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:05.470
Barboza it's gotta be filled up with the,

1806
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.360
he's finishing strong, dude. I, I would give to filter such a warrior

1807
01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:14.820
base pants off. Take your pants. I know. Based on white privilege.

1808
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.030
I'll give it to the elder to meadows, to meadows. 10 minutes.

1809
01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.730
Tell me that him and Chris Barley, him and Chris Farley used to play this.

1810
01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.650
They do this bit where it'd be Chris Beck.

1811
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:26.460
They pretended they were detectives and Chris [inaudible]. Oh Man.

1812
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.390
What do you think happened in Chris' father? Go take your pants off.

1813
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:33.900
Let me fuck your ass. Why? And he goes,

1814
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:35.730
cause this is how we're going to figure out what happened.

1815
01:47:41.010 --> 01:47:43.590
So it was that stupid so stupid.

1816
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:49.140
Reminds me getting pumped really fucked up thing that we did.

1817
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:52.030
Oh that was the best you got to play. Oh

1818
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.720
so good.

1819
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:04.830
Come on Bro. It's so fun. Realize that to you games you saying. And I was like,

1820
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:09.720
so rounding muscles, I got to do squats. I got it. Flat Ass. And she says,

1821
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:12.720
well you got a great ass dude.

1822
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:18.270
It's all round and muscular. Take your pants off. Do you guys know that during,

1823
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:20.460
you know when you guys start fucking during that bit we'd like

1824
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:27.770
right when I used to DJ at a Strip Club at strip clubs, dude, that was uh,

1825
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:32.550
w we had to uh, there was a part, there was a song by enigma,

1826
01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:37.650
there was a super sexy spiritual atmospheric. So don't let it take you down.

1827
01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.620
Don't let us take you down. Stand up. You've got to, let me think.

1828
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:45.150
Does that count? Hold on. It's not good for the judges though, what happened?

1829
01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:46.520
But when I'm,

1830
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.730
when I'm at the Strip club and I'm playing this enigma song, right,

1831
01:48:50.731 --> 01:48:55.440
and there's this, it's like a meal cooler, but very popular enigma song.

1832
01:48:55.441 --> 01:49:00.441
It's like spiritual and there's all these Gregorian chants and it's so spiritual

1833
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:05.960
and sexy and then the music drops out and it's silent and you hear a girl go,

1834
01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:14.910
ah, just for two seconds. Every time I got to that part,

1835
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.380
every time it never failed.

1836
01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:20.220
I'd always mix in you fucking Bryan calendar in the ass.

1837
01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.300
So there's the girl going

1838
01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:33.510
and the strippers hated that I did that. You don't do that.

1839
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:36.800
But the manager loved it so much he would tell them to,

1840
01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.120
but you shut the fuck up. Go do some lap dances. I get it.

1841
01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:45.480
So every time I'd mix in you to fucking with a N***a above me,

1842
01:49:45.481 --> 01:49:47.800
a corner where I'm really fucking, by the way, fake

1843
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.460
<v 2>you guys. How was that? Was that I was drunk. I don't remember. What was that?</v>

1844
01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:56.050
I needed the money. What was that for? An album that I had,

1845
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:59.680
I did an album on Warner brothers in 99 back in the does a Oh,

1846
01:49:59.681 --> 01:50:03.330
hold on 20 years ago. How many specials do you have Joe? Including numbers.

Yeah. Nine, nine specials. Jesus. When are you gonna drop the next? I Dunno man.

1851
01:50:23.721 --> 01:50:24.554
No rush.

1852
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:30.320
[inaudible] by 2020 21 I have a legit hour right now. You know,

1853
01:50:30.321 --> 01:50:35.270
I'm doing the big these big arenas and shit and it's all great. I'm loving it.

1854
01:50:35.271 --> 01:50:39.510
I'm having fun and I'm just, uh, enjoying work on my act. Like, yeah.

1855
01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:44.030
Instead of saying, oh, I got to do an hour or special within, you know, like,

1856
01:50:44.031 --> 01:50:47.430
it's been almost one year since my last special dropped.

1857
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.650
Did it be one year in October?

1858
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:53.840
And so I think I'm gonna wait another year before I even think about it.

1859
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.290
Do this. Tighten everything up. Yeah. Shit's ripping already though. Yeah.

1860
01:50:57.291 --> 01:50:59.290
Everything's great man. But when I was talking to Jessalyn neck,

1861
01:50:59.291 --> 01:51:01.640
I was talking to Jellinek about specialists. An interesting story.

1862
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.890
He's a monster and he had a great take colors.

1863
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:11.720
Try tell her want it. Talk about putting it all on the line,

1864
01:51:11.721 --> 01:51:16.460
man. Fuck yes. How happy he is. Fuck yeah. We're also happy for him. Everybody.

1865
01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:20.540
Yeah, I'm a taxed him. Wow. You know what man? I mean, he's had some hard times,

1866
01:51:20.541 --> 01:51:25.520
man. The Mike Perry fight was rough. Broke his arm early, hung in there. I mean,

1867
01:51:25.521 --> 01:51:28.460
this is so cool too because Anna can Feld her. Love each other. It's great.

1868
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:31.880
Oh they do? Oh, they're good flies. Hope we've done commentary together.

1869
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:35.930
Oh true. John. Anik is one of the nicest fucking guys. A lie. Fucking love.

1870
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:39.120
I'm never gonna find a single person who knows and has a bad word to say.

1871
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:43.400
Randomly text them about once a month. Yeah, he's a big better.

1872
01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.350
Oh yeah, he is. He is

1873
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:50.110
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

1874
01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:53.110
<v 2>I still grind. Does he not look like Stephen King? Am I crazy?</v>

1875
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:59.740
No, you're crazy. That's an easy off loss. Well listen man,

1876
01:51:59.741 --> 01:52:00.970
Barboza is, you know,

1877
01:52:00.971 --> 01:52:04.720
he's had some good ones and bad ones and always watched Barboza fight.

1878
01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:08.170
He's a great fighter man. And again, his switch kick is the fucking,

1879
01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:12.280
that's the benchmark for everybody. Look at him. So happy.

1880
01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.310
So Felder, oh shit. Felder one

1881
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:20.410
with 29 28 damn. Fuck yeah, I just sent him a text, man.

1882
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:24.190
I love that guy. He's such a good dude.

1883
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:25.480
<v 10>Hold on. [inaudible].</v>

1884
01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:27.660
<v 2>Yeah, I'm in here. Get some look at him.</v>

1885
01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.200
<v 10>I don't know [inaudible]</v>

1886
01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.340
<v 2>I'm so happy for him. He's right there, you know?</v>

1887
01:52:35.410 --> 01:52:37.790
And he's right there in the mix now. But you hear me just said an actor.

1888
01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:41.150
Let's get him a job. He said otherwise I'll get top five. I'm retired.

1889
01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.660
I'm an analyst. I can be an actor. Yeah, I'll be on come, come get a come,

1890
01:52:44.661 --> 01:52:45.620
go get schools

1891
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.310
<v 7>to slow down redhead with the whole acting thing. Chill out.</v>

1892
01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:54.110
It's not the answer is or acting. Acting. Tina's got all your parts. Yeah.

1893
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:57.610
It's got all your fun guy. Pretty good. Got the other ones.

1894
01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.770
The guy that's Dion's.

1895
01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:02.210
I don't know the full it felt there might not a real red head though.

1896
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:03.200
He's a red beard.

1897
01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:08.030
He doesn't count like Tina is a real red right here on the top of his head.

1898
01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:11.990
It's a brown. How crazy is that? It's almost like he dies his beard red.

1899
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:15.060
It's pretty cool. More of a Celt is an animal though. Yeah. He,

1900
01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:18.710
Tina's a real red head with red head aggression. He's got everything.

1901
01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:22.140
All redheads are freckles. Are they? He's an Italian redhead,

1902
01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.440
but they're all spicy now. He's a fire up. He's a fire crows rocket.

1903
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.400
Is He half red? I mean half Italian. Half hours. Half. It's gotta be half.

1904
01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:34.550
He's a funny motherfucker. Yeah, you sent Tino.

1905
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:37.970
I love going on the road with him too. He's such a good guy. I love Santina.

1906
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:42.920
Yeah, I love you guys. You coming into Detroit or Minneapolis? No.

1907
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.690
Is that it? No, Detroit and Cleveland. Detroit and Cleveland.

1908
01:53:47.691 --> 01:53:51.340
Santina is coming with me. He helped me. He opened up it. Just

1909
01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.770
hilarious. Now he's an animal. Good fucking dude too. He's just funny. Solid,

1910
01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.660
solid little bit of a boozer. Well, he has a podcast.

1911
01:54:02.661 --> 01:54:06.160
The whiskey ginger with God said, I heard, I heard.

1912
01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:08.540
I shouldn't say hi Brian. You're in time.

1913
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:11.920
You're perfectly in time because you may have made event, dude. Right?

1914
01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:15.640
You didn't come with cheese and there's no Aoki pizza, but whatever. That hurts.

1915
01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:18.830
Forgive both of you. I was already so late. I was rushing to,

1916
01:54:18.831 --> 01:54:22.400
didn't even open until noon. I was like, oh, come on Steve. I would take,

1917
01:54:22.401 --> 01:54:26.360
so he has a pizza chit load of them. He's got his, yeah.

1918
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:28.920
Steve Aoki is a business. My Love. Stevia. Okay.

1919
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.530
He's a great pizza's not on the wet. No, I thought it was.

1920
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.280
We can get some afterwards and the Eddie's better than anybody in this fucking

1921
01:54:39.591 --> 01:54:43.550
room. Isn't that cool? Look at his skin. His skin is flawless.

1922
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:47.230
It actually works. Skin is not flawless. Dude,

1923
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:51.050
my dude come here and look up the mirror going, oh my God,

1924
01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:54.320
now you have good skin, dude. Fucking almost 60 now you're not.

1925
01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:58.010
You know what I mean? The hollers, how old are you? I'm old. I'm 50 next year.

1926
01:54:58.570 --> 01:55:02.180
You look book I every day I'm like, it's over. You have makeup on.

1927
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:06.800
It's better skin. I now like my life is for my son. Like I like my life is over.

1928
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:10.160
It's all about what your life is. You're alive. Stop saying that.

1929
01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:13.380
You got to keep. I think that, I think it's all about my son will listen.

1930
01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:16.730
It's great that you think like that, but you're alive and you're looking great.

1931
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.100
Thank you. I appreciate that. I like your hair. Thank you.

1932
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:23.290
You look the youngest out of the four of us. Yeah, you do. How old are you?

1933
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:27.440
Well, no, Brendan. Dude, you're a baby

1934
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:34.490
diaper baby dude. Not really dirty.

1935
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:39.350
Get my white hat. Ain't shit, dude. He's 35.

1936
01:55:39.351 --> 01:55:43.250
You've got a comedy career now like at 40.

1937
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:48.290
Started comedy again. I don't, I don't know how the fuck you're,

1938
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:50.070
you're funny man. I'm doing seminar.

1939
01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:53.580
Last time I saw you last time I saw you at the store,

1940
01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:57.330
you made me laugh hard. I laughed a bunch of times. Thank you.

1941
01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.160
The story about you getting laid for the first time,

1942
01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:03.480
that is a fucking hilarious story. Did you try it before Eddie? Before this? No,

1943
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:08.060
I did. I did some like before 10th Planet Jujitsu. It was even a thought. Uh,

1944
01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:11.280
I was hanging out with Joe at the comedy store every goddamn weekend he was in

1945
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:13.710
town and if he wasn't in town and he was on the road,

1946
01:56:13.711 --> 01:56:14.820
I'm like hanging out with Joe.

1947
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:18.500
So I was balls deep in the comedy scene and I did some, uh,

1948
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.830
open mics a little bit here and there. But I realized back then that, uh,

1949
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:26.010
standup comedy was like a martial art.

1950
01:56:26.011 --> 01:56:30.000
It's like you have to spend a lot of time on stage getting good at times,

1951
01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.170
being on the public speaking experience and the public speaking skills,

1952
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:35.520
that's the most important thing.

1953
01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:38.340
You don't even have to be fucking funny to be a successful comic.

1954
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.710
You decide to be confident on stage and have public speaking

1955
01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:47.220
[inaudible] funny. Did you know what I'm saying? But listen,

1956
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:50.430
that's just because they're famous. Yeah. They're famous at other things.

1957
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:51.121
My point,

1958
01:56:51.121 --> 01:56:56.121
my point is that public speaking experience and those skills are crucial and I

1959
01:56:56.281 --> 01:57:00.210
didn't have them back then. I was, I was horrible at public speaking experience.

1960
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:03.000
Why are they showing it? Yeah. Why do they want to show that bra?

1961
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:07.680
How are they highlighting this? He came out to tell him, dad, they do well,

1962
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:12.630
Dylan Dennis was talk shit dude. Did you take Kebab in the interview? Bret Modo?

1963
01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:17.400
No. He goes, oh, it's not over. He goes, you know, everyone wants to say, oh,

1964
01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:20.070
it's a, it's for the fight. He goes, not for me. I see him,

1965
01:57:20.090 --> 01:57:23.730
which were basically fucking them up. He goes, it will never be over.

1966
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:27.480
And he goes, look guys, well that's what he said. He goes, he goes, people,

1967
01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.520
you know, because they, it's a, it's a sport and we fight in the cage. He goes,

1968
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:33.060
it's bigger than it. Never be over. And then when we fight,

1969
01:57:33.061 --> 01:57:35.700
Conor McGregor was absolutely not, never happened. He was.

1970
01:57:35.701 --> 01:57:38.610
But if I see him outside of it, we'll fight. Whoa.

1971
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:43.440
And you know how certain guys hype things up? He's in his fucking boxers in his,

1972
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:47.610
uh, you know, in his hotel room and he just dead serious like Jesus.

1973
01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:49.140
That's why he's so good.

1974
01:57:49.170 --> 01:57:52.260
Who the fuck is as good as could be when you're looking at a guy who's like,

1975
01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:56.790
what is he 28 and Oh, I mean, what is cribs record 27, 28,

1976
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:01.440
27, 28, 28 and 28, 28 and now fought the best in the world.

1977
01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:05.540
Mauled everyone and what he did when he would, what he did is like,

1978
01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:09.270
just like you see right now it's being publicized and so it's like,

1979
01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:12.780
it's not going to deter him from doing it again. No. You know what I mean?

1980
01:58:12.781 --> 01:58:15.360
They're just showing the shit out of it right now. Well, you know,

1981
01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:19.530
we'll Harris from will Harris productions is the one who filmed Connor throwing

1982
01:58:19.531 --> 01:58:24.210
that Dolly at the, uh, at the bus and the UFC asked for it and he was like,

1983
01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:25.320
yeah, yeah. You could look at the footage,

1984
01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:27.870
but thought he was going to get credit. They didn't get any credit.

1985
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:30.780
Like will Harris Anatomy of a fighter? It's a fucking phenomenal.

1986
01:58:30.781 --> 01:58:33.540
Youtube could do too. Great Guy. I met him on the podcast.

1987
01:58:33.541 --> 01:58:35.190
He goes over to Abu Dhabi,

1988
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:38.880
he goes over to Dagestan and hangs out with those guys. He'd get solid dude.

1989
01:58:38.881 --> 01:58:42.190
He gets the best footage. She has the best footage, fight footage,

1990
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:45.580
<v 2>training footage like inside behind the scenes footage of anybody.</v>

1991
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:48.260
And he never thought he like y'all let the,

1992
01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:51.430
cause he thought they would show it as like a news piece. Meanwhile,

1993
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:56.520
every fucking promo for the fight was that Dali that we'll film getting thrown

1994
01:58:57.371 --> 01:59:00.370
at the bus. Like TMZ would've paid $2 million for that. Right.

1995
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.520
The worst shit that Connor did was the thing that they use to sell the fight.

1996
01:59:05.921 --> 01:59:09.640
Literally a felony. I mean, he's like, people got got hung from the gun,

1997
01:59:09.641 --> 01:59:13.420
like a glass and Chase's eyes let him buildings in this building.

1998
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:16.540
I gotta tell you right now, I'm going to say something right now.

1999
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:21.030
I believe it can be general. I believe that, excuse me, very [inaudible].

2000
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:26.310
These guys, real time guys from a Russian republic, but now it's an independent,

2001
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:33.630
genuine match, tattoos and they're on there. You know what, they're athletes.

2002
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.210
No, I'm, I'm going to say this and the job is the most of my money.

2003
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:40.150
I got my money on Dustin Poirier. Whoa,

2004
01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:42.850
how much money I kind of do till this and let's see if we can move the money

2005
01:59:42.851 --> 01:59:45.430
around here because that was credited and he goes, Brendan,

2006
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:49.210
$20 and he's never going to pay some. Maybe eventually,

2007
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:53.680
eventually I'll pay maybe two tickets Brendan, and if it's a wash,

2008
01:59:53.710 --> 01:59:56.770
if you win you'll, you'll let Eddie off the hook. I just think that,

2009
01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:00.760
I just think that if, if Khabib tries to trade with Dustin,

2010
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:05.500
Dustin is cube could be doing best strikers. Period. Oh boy. Listen.

2011
02:00:05.501 --> 02:00:08.590
He proved that in the Max Holloway final question and he's got real power,

2012
02:00:08.591 --> 02:00:13.450
hard real power and Justin Gay chief, but also the other [inaudible] brands.

2013
02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:14.070
Fine.

2014
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:17.950
The other thing why I like a a little bit in this as a dog is because if you

2015
02:00:17.951 --> 02:00:21.010
watch a Justin [inaudible] fight where Katie's just applying pressure, pressure,

2016
02:00:21.011 --> 02:00:24.340
pressure. Dustin really doesn't fate. He plays that game.

2017
02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:26.920
Nobody has taken Dustin down,

2018
02:00:26.921 --> 02:00:28.900
mauled them on the ground and that is the difference.

2019
02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:31.270
Question is going to be whether or not it could be, you can take it.

2020
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:33.820
Here's my question taking them. How did I acquainted?

2021
02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:37.240
Keep Cubby from taking him down. How did he do it? They didn't. Could be,

2022
02:00:37.241 --> 02:00:38.200
definitely took him down,

2023
02:00:38.201 --> 02:00:41.440
but I acquainted as a back whose backgrounds as a wrestler, he said, look,

2024
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:46.360
I escape but I, but gates, he never like, first of all, Kate,

2025
02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:49.810
she never fought Khabib and gate g I'm saying with Tufts doesn't try to take

2026
02:00:49.811 --> 02:00:51.910
guys down even though he's a wrestler,

2027
02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.890
he's also fucking 100% savage and that guy just throws himself into the fog.

2028
02:00:57.010 --> 02:01:00.340
But with, you know, a lot of people think he's definitely wild,

2029
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:05.110
but it's a controlled wildness. It's intelligent. Wildlands so here we go.

2030
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:07.180
Champion versus champion.

2031
02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.230
I think the UFC has to be very careful with this whole interim champion stuff

2032
02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:15.190
because they take them away from people like Colby, like this.

2033
02:01:15.191 --> 02:01:18.970
There's talk right now of Colby not getting the fight versus Uzman and Colby

2034
02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:21.820
says they're not offering them enough money and it's going to be in New York

2035
02:01:21.821 --> 02:01:22.121
state.

2036
02:01:22.121 --> 02:01:24.850
And apparently there's a lot of taxes that come with fighting in New York.

2037
02:01:25.150 --> 02:01:27.730
Same with Tony. Tony's even more. Well,

2038
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:31.810
they're both agregious cause Tony got injured in doing promo. Right.

2039
02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.880
Accidentally. Not his fault. They strip him.

2040
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:36.370
I liked the way he's running toward the fucking cage. Sorry to interrupt.

2041
02:01:36.371 --> 02:01:40.340
You keep going. Well a lot of guys do these two experiments to let this moment

2042
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.470
<v 7>over shy. He's nice and he's, you know,</v>

2043
02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:46.330
on paper could be does definitely gonna win on paper but could be,

2044
02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:49.760
it's never lost around in passing. And Josh just gonna fucking Mazda doll.

2045
02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:53.210
Astron don't forget about that. Don't forget about that shit.

2046
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:58.460
That shit could happen. One, he said 100% different,

2047
02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.300
but I had Mazda Dalton. I saw Mazda Dog's going to win that fight.

2048
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.490
I'll fight for Ben regardless. Flying me.

2049
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:09.050
I thought I was going to get in the same dimension. What'd you say?

2050
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:11.990
Aspirin and Capybara and the same dementia.

2051
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:17.090
They take people down and they maul them. No, but once a freestyle wrestler,

2052
02:02:17.091 --> 02:02:19.770
one guy's a son, but it's a little different. Okay. Okay.

2053
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.400
I see what you're saying or what you're saying on paper,

2054
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:28.010
but I think the differences could be has way better striking than Ben,

2055
02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.860
but it could be, he was also not a freestyle, you know,

2056
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:34.750
double leg shoot from far out, like also smashes people,

2057
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.150
punches and drops con and wants an under hood.

2058
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.040
Underestimate Mazda dolls set up. Oh yeah. Oh No, it's great.

2059
02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:47.600
And then the plan was to run at them and throw a fly on me.

2060
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:51.910
How do you set that up? You set it up with doing the opposite. What did he do?

2061
02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.860
He put his hands behind his back. Chill, lean against the fence.

2062
02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.220
He did the opposite. A fucking mind. Fuck.

2063
02:02:58.250 --> 02:03:01.790
Ask Ren and then boom, he bolted at them and through that,

2064
02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:07.070
hold on. I'm not just bolted first. He stepped in front of the ring first.

2065
02:03:07.071 --> 02:03:07.904
He went to his right.

2066
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:11.450
The ideas until [inaudible] set up and then he comes into the opposite.

2067
02:03:11.630 --> 02:03:14.720
Do the opposite of what he wanted to do. Right? That's fight IQ.

2068
02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:17.810
Mazda dos is high a fight. IQ is anybody in the game to doubt?

2069
02:03:17.811 --> 02:03:22.580
Put that in a fucking movie. But then in a movie he's happy to be.

2070
02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:24.860
I was the executive producer. I would show my shit.

2071
02:03:24.861 --> 02:03:28.670
This is a life's work like that. Guys. Don't talk over Eddie.

2072
02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.310
This is a life's work days waiting for this moment.

2073
02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.370
He was creaming in his pants right now at home. I mean he's, he's,

2074
02:03:34.371 --> 02:03:38.330
he is literally happy to be here. That's a huge sign of me. Wow.

2075
02:03:38.331 --> 02:03:41.620
How could he not be? He's getting paid. Well,

2076
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:45.730
he should say pussy. Hey, he's getting paid.

2077
02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.280
He's got Mike Brown in his corner. I don't, I don't, when this one piece,

2078
02:03:49.281 --> 02:03:53.540
if I say pussy, if you went this one who get paid? Who's that? Oh,

2079
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.960
I go with don. My railroad style. Jose.

2080
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:01.940
Here comes Colby. Man. It comes. Could be, boy. I would like to hear it. Jamie,

2081
02:04:02.050 --> 02:04:04.850
can we give us some volumes so we hear how crazy everybody goes. Nuts.

2082
02:04:04.851 --> 02:04:09.800
This is bigger reading taken off. They're smaller. It's not a big reason at all.

2083
02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.960
That is true. Like 16,000 capacity.

2084
02:04:11.961 --> 02:04:15.410
I think three should have the possibility to do whatever the fuck you want to do

2085
02:04:15.411 --> 02:04:19.700
with the UFC. Yeah, you should be. Youtube doesn't play that I get to as fuck.

2086
02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.790
I get you. I'll get, I've had my shit taken down off of Facebook.

2087
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:24.740
I've had my shit taken down off the Instagram.

2088
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:27.920
Has this for posting ever while you worked for the FC sat you down and say you

2089
02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:29.540
can't do this or that. Never.

2090
02:04:29.690 --> 02:04:32.870
No one's ever talked to companion show where they maybe chill out on no,

2091
02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:33.650
they love it.

2092
02:04:33.650 --> 02:04:38.160
Dana wants me to do a companion for Tuesday night contender series. So like,

2093
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.250
<v 2>he's like, mom, you do one for those. I'm like, maybe we will one night.</v>

2094
02:04:41.370 --> 02:04:44.490
You know for fun, if we're, we're around, I'm down for that.

2095
02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:45.683
Let's do some great fights.

2096
02:04:45.850 --> 02:04:50.460
I do one for winter series and a lot of those guys eventually become like legit

2097
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.090
contenders. I'll, there's some really good guys cas. Yeah, we should do that.

2098
02:04:54.091 --> 02:04:57.450
We should do a Tuesday night contender series. Fight companions for boxing. No,

2099
02:04:57.451 --> 02:05:01.520
UFC. UFC has a fight. Pat, you don't know any of them. Fucking suck.

2100
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:06.660
My testosterone spike dude and my head never started. [inaudible] good luck.

2101
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:10.390
Good luck finding my head to protect in the ass from that May.

2102
02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.580
I had never stopped fucking Eddie bet. Did you and Eddie bet on this fight?

2103
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:16.830
Yeah. Huh? I got $100 on this fight.

2104
02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:22.470
Dan hundred betting on Dustin's a friend of mine. Guys, I'll through.

2105
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:24.360
I'll throw the money in just for a goof.

2106
02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:27.900
I'll throw a hundred [inaudible] on the, on the Russian. He's got his,

2107
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:31.260
he's got his dad. I want to see your money. I got, I got the Honda.

2108
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:34.170
I got it right here. Well, let's put it on the table. It's sitting right here,

2109
02:05:34.171 --> 02:05:37.770
dude. He's wiping off his armpits. I use mine. Listen, this is not that.

2110
02:05:37.771 --> 02:05:40.950
I don't love Dustin Poray but I do love action. I love,

2111
02:05:40.951 --> 02:05:45.520
actually let myself look at me. Actor. Hold on. How much cash do I pay?

2112
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:50.970
Cash. Oh, here you go. Here's a hundred k right there. Oh Wow. Your money down.

2113
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:54.200
Okay. Your boys run low on cash. What the fuck I did.

2114
02:05:54.201 --> 02:05:57.150
I was going gonna back you, but I spent last night. Alright, it's okay.

2115
02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:00.000
I lend them the money. I'm gambling answer myself.

2116
02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:05.120
This is good because this way I'm basically either giving Brian money or not.

2117
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:10.230
So it's not like a gambling against Dustin who I love.

2118
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:14.460
Khabib is looking rather rather jack more than usual in my opinion. Nope.

2119
02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:17.310
That's what he looks like. Always looks like. Create a little drama. I'm sorry.

2120
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:21.110
The big thing, the big thing is his father in his corner in the back.

2121
02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:25.020
To me that's the game changer, right? Because his father can't come to the UFC.

2122
02:06:25.021 --> 02:06:28.510
Here's the females cause you can't get a visa. But,

2123
02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:32.280
and here's the other thing is Khabib will listen to his father. He, if you,

2124
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:36.240
if you watch the uh, the I Quinta fight when Javier is telling them what to do,

2125
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.870
he's just like, yeah, whatever dude. And does his thing. His Dad talks,

2126
02:06:39.871 --> 02:06:43.950
he listens. So if his dad goes, hey bitch, quit fucking tone. Enhance,

2127
02:06:43.951 --> 02:06:46.020
take him down. He's gonna take him down. Yeah. Here he goes.

2128
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:50.670
I'll be this bad mother fucker. That crap must be going crazy right now. I mean,

2129
02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:53.010
even thinking about how many people are Muslim in the world,

2130
02:06:53.630 --> 02:06:55.890
this guy is the guy.

2131
02:06:56.070 --> 02:06:59.960
He might be the most popular Muslim athlete on Earth. I think Internet is,

2132
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:03.710
he's probably the most famous, right? UFC fighter. Like the International.

2133
02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.930
How many millions of followers does he have on Instagram too? That's good.

2134
02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:10.370
Oh No, no, no, no. He's like 26 million. No Way. How many is he?

2135
02:07:11.530 --> 02:07:14.050
26 something crazy. Jamie is going to find out, let's say seven.

2136
02:07:14.130 --> 02:07:17.220
I'm going to say 10 16 million. That's a lot.

2137
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:19.830
You understand where he got in the show? 16 million.

2138
02:07:19.831 --> 02:07:24.120
But you understand that before he fought Connor, he had like one, not even one.

2139
02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:27.090
How many does Connor have? 30 does he have Beyonce?

2140
02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:31.340
I looked at Justin Bieber the other day. Had like 118 million. I'm like

2141
02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:36.280
[inaudible] uh,

2142
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:39.820
<v 7>Trump 30 to go? No.</v>

2143
02:07:39.821 --> 02:07:42.630
Selena Gomez is the [inaudible] 32 50 Gomez.

2144
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:44.770
Khabib is a way bigger star than Connor.

2145
02:07:45.610 --> 02:07:50.470
Khabib comes Dagestan is where like the Mirage goes to Turks. It's just this,

2146
02:07:50.471 --> 02:07:55.330
the Ottomans that everybody converge [inaudible] as 156 million.

2147
02:07:56.670 --> 02:08:00.640
She's number one. And it could be, but 16 million and Connor had

2148
02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:07.670
31.7 he's got more Comez. Connor's got doubled. Connor's accomplished.

2149
02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:08.733
She that big.

2150
02:08:08.970 --> 02:08:13.970
Connor's a soupcon hunters like celebrity [inaudible] and beyond saying no way.

2151
02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:15.670
Do you think that a lot of those are fake?

2152
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:18.070
Do you think that Selena Gomez ones are fake? Are they little kids?

2153
02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:22.040
They're kids though. That's why people, kids and girls have the most followers.

2154
02:08:22.041 --> 02:08:25.420
I have no idea. I don't know one Selena Gomez Song. Do you,

2155
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.950
do you know one song? No.

2156
02:08:27.070 --> 02:08:31.670
Am I the ones that go to bed to and wake up to one name? One? No, can't name.

2157
02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:36.310
I can sing them beyond sack and name a couple. Well, this fuck Eddie. Yeah.

2158
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:40.030
Yeah. We just talked about how old we are. That's a Destiny's child song.

2159
02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:45.810
Okay. Maybe I don't know any fiance. Yeah, right.

2160
02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:51.000
Marshawn Arenado actually has 182 million. Who Does? Cristiana Rinaldo. Oh yeah.

2161
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:55.620
That was a soccer player. They are the best of her novel. Ms Cristiana.

2162
02:08:55.630 --> 02:09:00.010
Rinaldo messy and how much mercy on it sounds like a girl. Christiana.

2163
02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:04.810
102 for messy. Again,

2164
02:09:04.811 --> 02:09:09.360
Ronaldo's like a celebrity dates hot chicks, and they're looking at him tots.

2165
02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.420
MSCI has 130 Jesus Christ. How many? How many does Lebron have?

2166
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.000
14 no, this at 50. 60 rocks.

2167
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:24.040
1461 56 for the rock has one 56. The one that,

2168
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.580
whew. Instagram account is 312 million, but

2169
02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.440
[inaudible] Instagram, no one ever account. No one does Twitter.

2170
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:35.600
No know who's their account? The Instagram account. Instagram,

2171
02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:38.510
their own account. That didn't count already on the ground.

2172
02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:42.760
363 for Ariana Grande Day. Wow.

2173
02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:49.600
Whew. Count. What do you got? 700,000. That's good. Keep it low. Keep it low.

2174
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:53.080
Stand on the radar. It's funny how that's low now. I was like, I know.

2175
02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:56.470
Used to be a big deal. Right? You remember when, um, when asked him,

2176
02:09:56.610 --> 02:10:00.400
she was in a competition with somebody to see who hit a million Twitter

2177
02:10:00.401 --> 02:10:03.790
followers? No, that was a while ago. Big Deal. Oh, CNN,

2178
02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.810
CNN and Ashton Kutcher walking around competition to see who it's a million and

2179
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.490
these guys get down to 50 [inaudible] so [inaudible] trying to up to 200.

2180
02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:13.350
Luke Rockhold. Tommy,

2181
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:16.800
he's like probably walking around at 200 pounds now while he's training. Yeah,

2182
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:20.890
he's eating bad. Is he eating everything that moves? He's definitely thick,

2183
02:10:20.891 --> 02:10:24.490
but he's never, he's not 200. Not Lean. When he's, when he's at 200,

2184
02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:29.290
I think of that has got us to close right there. Here we go, baby.

2185
02:10:29.291 --> 02:10:32.830
Here we go. Whew. Boy It looks, everyone looks sweaty.

2186
02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:34.880
Super Shiny.

2187
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.570
<v 2>It's hard as fuck in there. Bad.</v>

2188
02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:44.060
[inaudible] let's go around the table. Eddie Bravo. What's up on paper?

2189
02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:48.950
Cubby takes this, uh, I hope he wins only because, uh,

2190
02:10:48.951 --> 02:10:53.150
it would make it like a monstrous fight between him and Tony.

2191
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:57.720
But you can't count Dustin out. You know, he could throw a flying knee,

2192
02:10:57.810 --> 02:11:02.120
but you gotta catch him. If I had a gun to the head,

2193
02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:04.450
that gun to the head, I'd go. Could be, that's the safe.

2194
02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.880
But I'm not going to be surprised if Dustin drops him.

2195
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.090
I'm gonna say pour a third round Kale and then fights Conor McGregor.

2196
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:19.100
Ah, fights McGregor. Wow. Cowen.

2197
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:21.920
We think I'm going, I love cubby. Um,

2198
02:11:22.050 --> 02:11:25.670
I think portray drops him in one round. Dude,

2199
02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:30.040
I'm in the fourth round type move and I think, uh,

2200
02:11:30.250 --> 02:11:34.100
and I think he's going to fight Conor McGregor. Wow.

2201
02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:40.780
Okay. Well you just said exactly how do those reshoots go? Brian Do,

2202
02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:45.440
do those reshoots shoot, I'm glad you're asking me what were the lines? No, no.

2203
02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:48.260
Fuck those lines. Here we go. We're about to do this. Yeah. Please

2204
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:54.500
note how I've cleverly avoided making a prediction. Let's move on.

2205
02:11:54.501 --> 02:11:57.650
You can't make predict. You have to. Here we go. Here we go. Oh Shit.

2206
02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:01.490
Oh Shit. Nope. Nope.

2207
02:12:01.650 --> 02:12:05.180
Nothing interesting about Dustin is Dustin South Pole with a fucking nasty

2208
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:09.460
straight left hand. Yep. And great combos. Although he did fight Connor,

2209
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:13.070
who was also south Paul. Oh, that's a while ago. It's got much longer. Arms.

2210
02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:16.970
Got better kicks. Dustan also has hip issues.

2211
02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:20.930
He said some pretty significant wear and tear on his hip. He's fine.

2212
02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.070
He's a black belt on the ground, but I don't think can be, gives a flying fuck.

2213
02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:28.460
Dozens of black belts caught that leg under Tim crater.

2214
02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:32.540
I believe his training partners were guys like, you know, Robbie Lawler,

2215
02:12:32.541 --> 02:12:37.400
et Cetera, before a lot will Robby went left a ATG notice right away.

2216
02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:41.180
Staying on the outside could be was avoiding the kicks.

2217
02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.680
He's staying away from Dustin.

2218
02:12:42.681 --> 02:12:45.710
Striking length cause death and striking lights is a boxing length.

2219
02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.940
So Dustin's forced to throw kicks, which he doesn't necessarily prefer.

2220
02:12:50.090 --> 02:12:51.620
So when he's throwing those kicks,

2221
02:12:51.621 --> 02:12:54.170
could bebes caught a couple of them already or caught one of them at least,

2222
02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:58.760
but he's avoided the kicks. But see the distance, look at the distance,

2223
02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:03.440
sees Khabib is staying outside the striking range and looking for that opening

2224
02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:07.670
for the shot. C C Dustin's forced to throw kicks, but he's not a kicker.

2225
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:12.200
That's not as shit, especially with a bad hip. And so could be,

2226
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:15.800
oh here's the shot,

2227
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:20.030
here's the Dustin's no punk with his take down defense man.

2228
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:24.080
But he's never seen anybody like could be never fought anybody.

2229
02:13:24.081 --> 02:13:27.890
That's that good. But here he goes. But the other thing is,

2230
02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:32.640
it's keeping [inaudible] even if could be, doesn't take you down. The draining.

2231
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:37.200
<v 7>He drained. It does this a lot of energy for condense and</v>

2232
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:43.110
tired though. Really, really by Quinta. Conor McGregor flights.

2233
02:13:43.111 --> 02:13:45.630
He takes rounds up striking me. Yeah, but

2234
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.330
[inaudible] knows the mauling begins the mauling now he's standing up or goes

2235
02:13:54.590 --> 02:13:57.210
up. Not Quiet. Not Quiet. He's not up yet. Boom. No.

2236
02:13:57.211 --> 02:14:02.050
Dustin's going to get taken down into the ground. It's a switch.

2237
02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.920
Nope, no, on his bathroom. Now it's around. Not Good.

2238
02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:11.880
I might be over very bad. Very, very, very bad. First rounds.

2239
02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.740
Very bad for Dustin. Very bad. He might get smashed here. Oh look. Yeah,

2240
02:14:16.741 --> 02:14:20.460
he pulls his face like that. He actually got fingers on his eyes, man.

2241
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.790
I can't tell like I got bears that $100. That's my $100 you know,

2242
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:28.860
it's crazy. You know what's crazy is that, oh my God, it's over.

2243
02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:32.820
It's over. He's going to use that full cart track is going to use that footage.

2244
02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:36.710
Oh No. That was close to being over

2245
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:40.860
someone. Here's a Jujitsu coach. Oh,

2246
02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:44.010
big shots is this where it doesn't want to be sideways,

2247
02:14:44.011 --> 02:14:46.780
like not where he wants to be, but sideways. And this time. No, he's fun.

2248
02:14:46.781 --> 02:14:50.490
He's in a good spot right down right here because he tells your grades face,

2249
02:14:50.850 --> 02:14:50.971
man, look,

2250
02:14:50.971 --> 02:14:54.090
he's actually using the cage to defend the rear naked choke cause he's got the,

2251
02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:57.300
he doesn't have the angles. See how he's sideways? He's using that cage.

2252
02:14:57.850 --> 02:15:00.390
It's covering his mouth. It's so cool.

2253
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:04.350
Shout just couldn't have been gun any worse for justice. Might be. It might be.

2254
02:15:04.351 --> 02:15:08.220
It might be it. Dustin's trying. He's trying to survive, man.

2255
02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:11.320
He's trying to survive more people have an adopted, oh,

2256
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:16.470
he's got a nasty no crank here. Oh, Dustin survives. Doesn't survive.

2257
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:18.810
Oh, standing. Standing, standing.

2258
02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:25.430
Whoa. Don't count him out. Damn those so close.

2259
02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:28.070
He just asked for the money back. You fuck. I don't remember that.

2260
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:32.200
You're off the train. I don't have any. Oh,

2261
02:15:34.330 --> 02:15:37.820
he's going to have to turn like that. Why don't you do that?

2262
02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:40.410
I don't know why he did that. He just tried to separate the hands.

2263
02:15:40.411 --> 02:15:44.090
That's why he's trying to separate the hands. Never turn your back on.

2264
02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:47.760
I think he's just trying to separate the hands. All right. Okay.

2265
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:51.540
You just tried to face their guns. Let's fucking go. Come on. Just just be cool.

2266
02:15:51.570 --> 02:15:54.000
He might just try to wear this out or ride this out. Rather,

2267
02:15:54.001 --> 02:15:57.620
he's going to survive to the second round for sure. Who the fuck knows for sure?

2268
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:02.970
Some minute to go, man. Anything can happen. It's going to take. There you go.

2269
02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:07.530
Oh, that trip coming up. Do you just keep standing up?

2270
02:16:07.531 --> 02:16:11.140
You know he's gonna get slammed right now. He is. He both way. He controls this.

2271
02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:14.640
There's no one better, man. He's the best. He's a mall or bursts.

2272
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:18.030
The best smaller man fucking wrestles with.

2273
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:24.020
Oh, it's not going to work. His hands were close,

2274
02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.660
which is not gonna work on your hands and competes too good.

2275
02:16:26.670 --> 02:16:30.100
It's not going to work. Now he's mounted, man. Now he's mounted. This

2276
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:33.910
<v 2>is no boy in only 20 seconds. He's what? No Bueno. No, he's good.</v>

2277
02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.170
Connor chilled here in the mouth, remember? Yeah, but listen, this is,

2278
02:16:38.171 --> 02:16:41.560
we really don't do work. This is a different fight. It's entirely possible.

2279
02:16:41.730 --> 02:16:46.360
Con could be, you could get him here. Be Tough. Look at this. We did this. Boom,

2280
02:16:46.361 --> 02:16:50.950
boom, boom. Oh, she's ain't good. This ain't good. So how much time,

2281
02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.660
this ain't good. 10 seconds. Five, four, three two.

2282
02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.850
That was the rush. A C to survive. Yeah, he survived.

2283
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.690
He's fine. Not a mark on know this is going to happen in [inaudible] third,

2284
02:17:04.691 --> 02:17:05.830
fourth round man. Yup.

2285
02:17:05.950 --> 02:17:10.150
<v 7>If he can make a third, fourth round. It's crazy. That was crazy.</v>

2286
02:17:10.850 --> 02:17:13.280
<v 2>We got to get some food after this. Yeah, let's get food after this.</v>

2287
02:17:13.370 --> 02:17:18.150
We'll go get some fucking monster. But that's that.

2288
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:21.870
You got to walk through the fire to get to that third, fourth round man. Yes.

2289
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.280
Yes. So you've got to hope he gets tired from whooping your ass. He's done.

2290
02:17:25.281 --> 02:17:28.370
He's done that third and fourth round. He was telling Barbosa to come on, man.

2291
02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:32.720
No, he's a different animal. Barbara. Yeah. Oh boy. I'm going to give up.

2292
02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:35.510
But they, but they not good. Doesn't know this. He listened.

2293
02:17:35.511 --> 02:17:37.730
He is fucking how many fights? 40 fights.

2294
02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:41.150
He knows this has been the game for so long, man. Yeah, he's been down.

2295
02:17:41.151 --> 02:17:43.700
He's been up. He knows how to lose. He's gonna get a freak out.

2296
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.760
He's lost before and bounce back is that shit in his pants, right?

2297
02:17:46.761 --> 02:17:51.530
He's a fucking full veteran. He's a full veteran. He's fine. Come in. He's like,

2298
02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.020
he's not a guy that's going to get broken at this stage of his life.

2299
02:17:54.610 --> 02:17:58.160
Beating Kippy even in front of his dad though I have the odds are not good in

2300
02:17:58.161 --> 02:18:02.960
front of Russia, sir. In front of Russia and in Abu Dhabi,

2301
02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:06.800
it's got Darby shot aside. What I'm saying is that the Russians Watch,

2302
02:18:06.801 --> 02:18:08.390
here we go. Here we go. Is watching. Here we go.

2303
02:18:08.391 --> 02:18:11.720
Well now you know Dustin's going to want to avoid going to the ground at all

2304
02:18:11.721 --> 02:18:15.200
costs lower stance now and then avoiding the distance.

2305
02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.400
He's still with those kicks, man. I think you waits for Khabib to come in.

2306
02:18:19.401 --> 02:18:23.240
I would say avoid those kicks and just wait.

2307
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:26.540
Oh Jesus. Okay. That, oh he got, he got clipped.

2308
02:18:28.130 --> 02:18:29.200
[inaudible] Khabib is a striking,

2309
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:31.250
not terrible and just show worried about the take down.

2310
02:18:31.251 --> 02:18:33.560
Remember when he dropped Connor? Yeah. Oh, hold on, please.

2311
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:34.910
Dropped other guys too. It's like,

2312
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:39.540
<v 8>oh,</v>

2313
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:42.630
<v 7>oh shit.</v>

2314
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:55.710
[inaudible] yeah, but he can, he can't get crazy.

2315
02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:56.670
He's wearing them out.

2316
02:18:58.050 --> 02:19:01.430
He can't get crazy because he'll run into a takedown. Oh,

2317
02:19:01.470 --> 02:19:04.830
she has to play in trouble with them again. Yeah.

2318
02:19:04.831 --> 02:19:09.750
It could be my be in trouble here. Oh, dark shit. [inaudible] Dustin's tired.

2319
02:19:09.751 --> 02:19:13.410
Dustin's tired. Yes he is. Yes. He retired. He, he's tired.

2320
02:19:13.470 --> 02:19:15.910
He just chased him for a minute. Straight dude.

2321
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:19.680
Just took a deep breath or maybe, oh there's a shot.

2322
02:19:20.930 --> 02:19:24.560
Oh that's a teen attempt. Oh I've got ideas is bad. It's also,

2323
02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:28.600
he was bad with a hundred and fucking 20 degree index inside Alaina.

2324
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.240
He got so tired like that. Something happened. Damn.

2325
02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:34.880
Duly shout him right there. What do mean something happened?

2326
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:38.750
He just know put his energy out there trying to finish him cause it hurt him a

2327
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:42.300
little bit. Well he got real wild. He got real wild. It doesn't ask it well.

2328
02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:45.410
He has to around that. Now this is a big,

2329
02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:48.710
if he can [inaudible] 22nd early in the second round.

2330
02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:52.040
Why does he have to get wild when when you clip someone. Right.

2331
02:19:52.041 --> 02:19:55.160
But he clipped him and hurt him. He could just do that again.

2332
02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.890
He could just stay technical and keep it on the outside,

2333
02:19:57.891 --> 02:19:59.630
which where I think he has an advantage.

2334
02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:03.990
I don't think his wildness was the result of this takedown exhaustion,

2335
02:20:04.690 --> 02:20:08.900
but the wildness leads to you being exhausted, but they're bo o exhaust.

2336
02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:12.140
They're both again. Yes. Cause both times big punches,

2337
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:15.860
exhaust [inaudible] ties, but but could be.

2338
02:20:16.050 --> 02:20:20.270
I'm way more efficient at doing this. Yes. He clips your fucking legs.

2339
02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:23.760
He crosses your legs. I got crossing. No, no one's figured it out.

2340
02:20:24.350 --> 02:20:26.730
Discounts Cross your legs like that. I don't know. Is that a move on camp?

2341
02:20:26.731 --> 02:20:29.570
Did you go to, is that like a merit badge? I want to talk about it.

2342
02:20:29.571 --> 02:20:31.220
When I was younger I was dressed up like a girl.

2343
02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:35.990
It's how I got myself through college. All right. All right. Here we go.

2344
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:38.480
It's going to be two minutes and 30 seconds of this.

2345
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:42.530
Most of the time Dustin just has to kind of hopefully capitalize on those little

2346
02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:45.460
moments. By the way, kind of refined here. He's kind of resting,

2347
02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.970
survives here and then tries to get him, they're both out of bed on the floor.

2348
02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:52.010
He just got to survive. Sydney one's case, I've got another shot.

2349
02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.100
It's really dependent upon what kind of recovery he can have,

2350
02:20:55.101 --> 02:20:57.660
how he's dealing with the heat and how, what kind of, Oh God.

2351
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:58.850
He gave his back up again.

2352
02:20:59.430 --> 02:21:03.020
He's going to stand up and then use and then like he's bleeding on his left

2353
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:05.810
side. He's relaxed. He's relaxing. That's a bad kid.

2354
02:21:05.810 --> 02:21:07.220
This isn't a place to relax though.

2355
02:21:07.221 --> 02:21:09.610
It could be [inaudible] going to get back into Sisco.

2356
02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:12.260
Face him or he's going to get that left under hook and he's fine.

2357
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:17.000
All you gotta do is just pull that left under, hook out and it's good.

2358
02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:20.630
Pull that left. Oh, you didn't get it. He had, he just hurt treasures. No,

2359
02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:24.470
don't go. Y'All team back. There you go. Under hooks.

2360
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:28.510
That pressure, that pressure. Dude could.

2361
02:21:28.690 --> 02:21:32.200
You've got serious head pressures and the best for,

2362
02:21:32.201 --> 02:21:35.780
forget about Bose head pressure and the way he dips his body down and gives us

2363
02:21:35.781 --> 02:21:40.310
all the Hayden deep dude. He's on his flight. His head belongs on Brock Lesnar,

2364
02:21:40.311 --> 02:21:44.030
by the way, for cubby. He's got the biggest head up to his feet. Oh,

2365
02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:47.510
don't grab it. Who is he going to do? Maybe Granby roll.

2366
02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:50.480
I'll just going to just keep getting up. It's just killed time.

2367
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:51.500
There's a minute just killed.

2368
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:56.120
This is just killing time for Dustin for another shot to get hope on smart other

2369
02:21:56.121 --> 02:22:00.190
shots. Smart. Another shot. Your best bet. SMART, smart. Just drive frustrate.

2370
02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:04.310
Don't go. Don't, it's frustrating. Take your stand up. Well,

2371
02:22:04.311 --> 02:22:07.520
he doesn't have a neck, dude. There's no way he's going to kill it. No,

2372
02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:10.660
you're wishing. Imagine if he did. Only way he could kill it.

2373
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.800
Tina is if Dustin is known for a hellacious guillotine and lots of shit that I

2374
02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:19.910
be, he's got a hellacious. Doris is Darcy's franchise. Good. I'm liking this,

2375
02:22:19.911 --> 02:22:24.600
right. Oh, oh. Oh Damn. Damn right.

2376
02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:28.680
Shot shot to separate. He, he was not gonna fuck with it, man.

2377
02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:32.490
Didn't give you any breath. He can't dude. He should've just ran. At that point.

2378
02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:35.430
Riley ran [inaudible] hit him in the knee,

2379
02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:39.000
like patch over new side that went over and ran.

2380
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:43.710
As soon as the separation was run. Look at this up again up again.

2381
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:48.810
Look at this. Oh trip. Beautiful trip. 19 not enough time. He's good.

2382
02:22:48.811 --> 02:22:53.760
1716 I'm telling you, Dustin's not taking a lot of damage.

2383
02:22:53.761 --> 02:22:56.770
He might be tired, but he's not taking as much damage as he could. Ah, yeah.

2384
02:22:57.750 --> 02:23:01.930
Yeah. Aren't you an actor? He got hit with a big knee there, man.

2385
02:23:02.430 --> 02:23:06.960
Dustin did oh shit on their feet.

2386
02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:12.510
Two rounds of fury. Look at this. God Damn, he's tired for sure.

2387
02:23:12.511 --> 02:23:14.250
Of course he tired. Of course.

2388
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:17.910
Sleep suit and fourth round is usually a tough time for him.

2389
02:23:18.390 --> 02:23:19.200
I'll say this though.

2390
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:23.160
It's kind of impressive what Connor did come back of that long lift cause we see

2391
02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:26.400
what he's doing to Dustin, just to everybody he's about to stand for.

2392
02:23:26.401 --> 02:23:28.390
We're Kinda, you know, he did defend a few take downs.

2393
02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:31.320
You know what I am landing some shot. I see Dustin like,

2394
02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:36.210
like this is the game plan where I'm out a hundred percent hundred percent,

2395
02:23:36.310 --> 02:23:39.360
the sort of, I survived. Serve Austin's a hundred percent dangerous.

2396
02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:41.610
He's in the mix, right? He can knock you out.

2397
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:46.500
I would love to be listening to a Mike Brown's coaching say to, you know what?

2398
02:23:46.501 --> 02:23:49.230
If he takes you down, just survives. I love Mike [inaudible].

2399
02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:54.990
He shot lots of shots. Oh shit man,

2400
02:23:55.490 --> 02:23:59.430
that was legit and then shit. Oh No,

2401
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:03.930
look at that. He's still, he heard him. He heard him. Oh Shit.

2402
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:06.390
And then the shot, man, he screws up.

2403
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:08.900
The thing is you go looking for that shot up.

2404
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:11.370
You gotta go for the Servant of looking for those shots.

2405
02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:15.180
You gotta be real conservative, calm. Champlin you wanna win. You wanna win.

2406
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:19.410
You've got to get wild. He's gotta to just look at every go. Here we go.

2407
02:24:19.411 --> 02:24:21.930
Every beginning of every round is the time to knock them out.

2408
02:24:21.931 --> 02:24:26.040
And once you get shot on, okay, just survived two chains in the crowd.

2409
02:24:26.041 --> 02:24:28.140
How the fuck did that happen to changes there?

2410
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:30.570
It looked like is how do you know what two chains looks like?

2411
02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:34.050
I don't know what's to check. What is that? What'd you say?

2412
02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:37.920
Jamie's sit next to Dana. Is He to James's? What is to chain? He's a rapper.

2413
02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:40.290
Oh really? He debated Nancy grace about marijuana.

2414
02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:45.300
He hasn't been hot for a second, but maybe he's hot goes why?

2415
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:48.510
He looks, he looks tired. He's certainly tired. Yeah. You know,

2416
02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:52.890
he certainly tired. He's looking for like, oh, no problem man. This is it.

2417
02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.080
Oh, dusty. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2418
02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:00.680
That is Huggies. Snuggie on that.

2419
02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:05.070
Snuggie snuggie snuck Alicia. Scott is tired.

2420
02:25:05.071 --> 02:25:09.890
It's delicious. He does have a leg. My legs get tired.

2421
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:15.560
Oh Shit. What the fuck? Tali roll still tall. It's tight. Damn.

2422
02:25:15.561 --> 02:25:18.480
That's talking about boys. Roland goes back, dude.

2423
02:25:18.481 --> 02:25:23.380
Is he going to put him to sleep? Oh my God. This is incredible. No, he it.

2424
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:24.100
He lost.

2425
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.080
<v 2>He's still in it. No, I lost it. Nope, he's out.</v>

2426
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:35.020
[inaudible] he pissed Khabib off.

2427
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:37.380
He tried to take a little breather truck after that go.

2428
02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:40.570
That Kia team took on his neck. You tugged on the beer snack.

2429
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:42.280
Now he's going to fuck you up. I, his dad right there.

2430
02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:46.360
Nothing moves on his face. Makes you think, look of elite Brazilian Jujitsu.

2431
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:49.120
Black belt gets him in a position like that as he's trying to take him down and

2432
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:51.280
he's an elite presented you as a black belt. Hey, no,

2433
02:25:51.281 --> 02:25:53.370
but like a dobby ramen style. No, no. You know,

2434
02:25:53.430 --> 02:25:57.250
you know who I think has the style to beat could be Tony Tayga.

2435
02:25:58.410 --> 02:26:02.670
Brian Ortega or Tony Ferguson, but Brian Ortega as far as his, uh, neck attacks.

2436
02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:07.570
But the thing about Tony, oh, here's that fulcrum chart. Oh, this might be it.

2437
02:26:07.930 --> 02:26:10.960
Nope. Nope. Tony could beeps the fight all day. I see.

2438
02:26:10.961 --> 02:26:14.770
I disagree with Brian RTO cause he's too small. He's 125 pounder. Oh,

2439
02:26:14.771 --> 02:26:19.270
he's a huge fan for these 145.8 Ferguson is the man. Oh,

2440
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:24.000
he's under the neck. [inaudible] tap, tap, tap.

2441
02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:29.230
Wow. Could beep. He's a goddamn monster. If leap is on stone on Steve now,

2442
02:26:29.231 --> 02:26:32.110
dude, Tony could be look at this. Even could be said that though.

2443
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.860
Could be big as a god damn monster. What's he doing? Is He hugging his dad?

2444
02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:38.470
Where's he running into the crowd for? With the camera go.

2445
02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:43.000
Did he go to hug his dad? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he starts knocking Dana. Oh,

2446
02:26:43.001 --> 02:26:47.620
look at that man. That's amazing. He's hugging everybody. Wow.

2447
02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:50.920
He's humping through there. I think they're jumping up and down with them.

2448
02:26:51.250 --> 02:26:55.660
That's his dad. I think with the white hair we went on, we went out on a limb.

2449
02:26:55.930 --> 02:26:58.450
Brian, it made it fun. It made it fun, but he was, he was on my guns.

2450
02:26:58.530 --> 02:27:03.250
My money buys 400 you gotta take your money. Look at this 400 for a reason.

2451
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:07.260
Mine, I loaned you a hundred you owe it to me. Pour it. Portray,

2452
02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:10.360
made it fun though for a little bit. And that's what you gotta do, man.

2453
02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:14.110
That's his dad. So that wasn't his dad that he was jumping around with.

2454
02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:18.400
That was somebody else. His daddy guy could be a good fight. Great Guy.

2455
02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:21.780
Great Guy. Look at that. Look at that. Beautiful, beautiful sportsmanship.

2456
02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:23.860
I think you'd be Gibbs only to do two more. Beautiful.

2457
02:27:23.890 --> 02:27:28.140
That's what it sounds like. Two more. He's not interested in the long game. Who?

2458
02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:30.940
Ferguson. Then who else? I don't know. He wants GSP.

2459
02:27:31.090 --> 02:27:33.880
Just be wants to fight to me. It was just amazing man.

2460
02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.620
He man saying what a man. That's it. It's totally [inaudible]. That's it. Oh,

2461
02:27:38.621 --> 02:27:41.110
that's it. That's the only song. Now here's the difference.

2462
02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:44.350
Here's the difference in Mys. Tony Ferguson does not get tired,

2463
02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:45.880
never gets tired, doesn't get tired.

2464
02:27:45.881 --> 02:27:48.400
It doesn't matter if you take them down and he's just scrambling mother fucker

2465
02:27:48.401 --> 02:27:51.160
and he can cut you up with elbow Bose from the ground.

2466
02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:56.420
And he's got Darcy's from every everywhere dude. He's got long arm.

2467
02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:59.740
He just fucked one little mistake. And you're in a Darson.

2468
02:27:59.741 --> 02:28:04.390
It's over with triangles. Darts is g teens,

2469
02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:06.970
you name it, he can hit you with his elbows from the back.

2470
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:10.420
And here's the biggest difference is Tony does not get tight.

2471
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:13.990
Tony's one of the only fighters who bombed saying from round one,

2472
02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:17.650
he's even better in four. He's the only guy that we know who gets better.

2473
02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:20.650
And before you've trained with him, you've been in this camp.

2474
02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:22.070
What the fuck does he do to

2475
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.360
<v 4>have that kind of endurance?</v>

2476
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:28.970
<v 6>He just, he, he is, um, he has,</v>

2477
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:32.180
uh, you know, my son is seven and he like,

2478
02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:37.900
he loves baseball and he came at me with some fucking Vince Lombardi quote,

2479
02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:40.160
did like some of Michael Jordan Shit.

2480
02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:44.480
One day we're walking in basketball practice and, and um,

2481
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:48.470
my son does savage dude and he, and I said, how do you like baseball so far?

2482
02:28:48.890 --> 02:28:52.580
He said, Daddy, you know, practice is my favorite sport.

2483
02:28:55.530 --> 02:28:57.840
<v 4>Mike Sh Practice this for practice is my favorite sport.</v>

2484
02:28:57.900 --> 02:29:01.680
You can put that on a fucking wall. That's pretty practice is my favorite sport.

2485
02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:03.330
My seven year old told me that.

2486
02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:08.250
That's an amazing fucking pretty shit. That's brother Jordan Shit.

2487
02:29:08.850 --> 02:29:12.150
That's Tony Ferguson. Shit. That's a tee shirt. Tony Ferguson,

2488
02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:16.610
he loves training. Did he loves the, what is it?

2489
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:18.300
But what does he do specific? He does that.

2490
02:29:18.301 --> 02:29:21.180
You've been in this camp like what is he, what is his schedule like?

2491
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:24.540
Just cardio all day. What kind of cardio?

2492
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:28.290
The traditional shit. And then he makes up shit. Okay.

2493
02:29:28.291 --> 02:29:30.390
Starts off in the morning. How's he start off in the morning?

2494
02:29:30.570 --> 02:29:34.170
You know what he does? He's, he's, I don't know his exact schedule,

2495
02:29:34.171 --> 02:29:34.951
but when you've been there,

2496
02:29:34.951 --> 02:29:37.050
what have you give me a typical day like in big bear,

2497
02:29:37.051 --> 02:29:41.220
when you guys go to big bear, he's wearing cans, sprinting, uh,

2498
02:29:41.310 --> 02:29:46.230
doing all sorts of like, uh, like football, calisthenics type stuff,

2499
02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:49.010
drills, like all sorts of shit. Like he's,

2500
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:52.050
he loves training.

2501
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:57.740
<v 6>That's his secret weapon is he fucking loves it. He wants to train all day.</v>

2502
02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:02.150
He does nuts. That's what he's gonna eat. Like, um,

2503
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:06.760
<v 4>when he's not training for a fight, he eats like anybody else. No,</v>

2504
02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:09.590
when he's trying Tacos, Burritos, he don't give a fuck.

2505
02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:13.730
He'll blow up to like one 85 when he's training. When he's training,

2506
02:30:13.731 --> 02:30:18.080
he's a fucking machine dude. He's a machine. He's just, he eats like

2507
02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:23.280
all the best shit. And he trade like when you're eating with him,

2508
02:30:23.281 --> 02:30:25.830
what's he eating? I don't eat with them cause I ate some bullshit.

2509
02:30:25.831 --> 02:30:28.150
I'll go to in and out. You know what I mean? He ain't going yet.

2510
02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:31.410
You'll veer off on your own path. Yeah. And so he's got money, many prepped,

2511
02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:36.510
everything's meal prepped. Him and his wife that like he did.

2512
02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:40.230
He just, it's like a savage. He's just,

2513
02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:44.760
he didn't put the hat on John Anak. He always puts that shit on. No,

2514
02:30:44.761 --> 02:30:48.720
he does it to you, man. Respect. Hey, Jamie d, can you hear what he's saying?

2515
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:51.360
Is he calling anybody out? Yeah. Let's give it some volume.

2516
02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:55.100
I'm assuming he's going to call Tony out. Let's hear this. Yeah. GSP.

2517
02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:58.950
Maybe I can get permission from the UFC to play volume in the background.

2518
02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:01.080
That'd be dope. Why not? Come on.

2519
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:03.900
Think it would ruin shit and fuck you for that. That's not that.

2520
02:31:03.901 --> 02:31:06.210
It's just so you could hear. They could hear results. Here we go.

2521
02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:10.690
He just saying how much respect he has for Dustin.

2522
02:31:12.350 --> 02:31:15.850
<v 10>I have a lot of grades. It's not what I want to hold it. Everything.</v>

2523
02:31:17.130 --> 02:31:19.880
We really, what do you want to do?

2524
02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:23.453
[inaudible]

2525
02:31:23.530 --> 02:31:24.370
<v 2>respect. Oh</v>

2526

2527
02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:32.240
<v 2>people can hear this, but he's, he's saying respect, respect,</v>

2528
02:31:32.241 --> 02:31:33.920
teammates, respect gym coaches.

2529
02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:37.470
<v 10>You can leave your Jean ever</v>

2530
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:41.160
<v 2>keep clean your gym. He's just a class where doesn't show a shirt.</v>

2531
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:45.450
He is wearing Dustin. Pour your fucking scores on. Man. That's beautiful.

2532
02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:50.000
That that makes me tear up. He was wearing Dustin's fucking [inaudible].

2533
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:54.180
He's an amazing him and vain is incredible. I'd leave the nice guy in the world.

2534
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.620
The guy's amazing. That really is incredible.

2535
02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:00.930
[inaudible] 17 oh,

2536
02:32:00.931 --> 02:32:04.590
he's got 12 wins just below George Saint Pierre is 13

2537
02:32:04.650 --> 02:32:05.720
<v 10>hold on. [inaudible]</v>

2538
02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:09.630
<v 2>look at these killers behind him. All those dudes. Look at his dad.</v>

2539
02:32:10.690 --> 02:32:13.890
Tough fucking [inaudible]. He goes [inaudible] rounds right now.

2540
02:32:17.350 --> 02:32:17.710
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

2541
02:32:17.710 --> 02:32:19.960
<v 2>he's speaking now in his life. You ever hear him?</v>

2542
02:32:19.961 --> 02:32:22.060
When they were asking about the Conor McGregor stuff,

2543
02:32:22.061 --> 02:32:25.900
like jumping in the crowd and he goes, I've got gotta. See my dad. He does.

2544
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:28.900
I apologize. My Dad. I got to go home and tell my dad because dad

2545
02:32:31.090 --> 02:32:32.050
probably slapped him around.

2546
02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:37.220
<v 10>Well, all my [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

2547
02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.710
<v 2>dude, I'm just talking shit.</v>

2548
02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:45.230
<v 10>There you go. I'm glad when he did, he followed father's plan.</v>

2549
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:53.510
[inaudible] [inaudible] congratulations to you and not be [inaudible].

2550
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.640
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2551
02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:58.520
<v 10>wait to get back to the octagon. You did drop the name [inaudible] here,</v>

2552
02:32:58.610 --> 02:33:00.530
<v 2>John, and there it is. Heard it. Here we go.</v>

2553
02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:06.570
<v 10>[inaudible] here we go. [inaudible] go watch. You know, I didn't feel much</v>

2554
02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:10.850
[inaudible]

2555
02:33:10.850 --> 02:33:14.860
<v 2>give me a couple of days to think about it. Bad Ass. Yeah. Good for him. John.</v>

2556
02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.720
Anik does the best post-fight interviews and the game. Very clear cut.

2557
02:33:17.780 --> 02:33:21.500
He's the best. So good. So good at it. I don't like doing them.

2558
02:33:21.501 --> 02:33:25.790
They should make him do them. I met God. Who the fuck? I mean,

2559
02:33:25.791 --> 02:33:28.520
Tony First is the only guy who can really compete this amazing.

2560
02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:32.690
A lifetime of discipline. Amazing. Oh, was it Dustin after this here?

2561
02:33:32.691 --> 02:33:37.070
This where's Dustin girlfriend here? Um,

2562
02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:39.980
I mean it goes right back to the drawing board is a good fight.

2563
02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:42.140
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

2564
02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:44.330
<v 2>keep it cranking up Jamie. Grant get higher.</v>

2565
02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:46.080
<v 10>I mean, I knew he was going to president.</v>

2566
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:47.410
I was going to be against the pins a lot.

2567
02:33:49.890 --> 02:33:51.430
Just want like cut myself down. You know,

2568
02:33:51.431 --> 02:33:52.930
I didn't cut any corners here for this.

2569
02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:55.030
<v 2>Oh, come on, Dustin. You all right buddy?</v>

2570
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:57.080
<v 10>My whole career has set me up for this moment, but</v>

2571
02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.970
<v 2>[inaudible] I Bet Sharon, listen,</v>

2572
02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:04.940
the respect man. Beautiful Man.

2573
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.610
People came from all around the world for that fight. Oh,

2574
02:34:08.390 --> 02:34:10.700
he's such a great dude now. I love him.

2575
02:34:11.490 --> 02:34:13.030
<v 10>Oh, now I've got to wait. We good?</v>

2576
02:34:13.031 --> 02:34:15.490
But look myself in the mirror every morning with this resolved.

2577
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.220
<v 2>Yeah. He's just dealing with the aftermath year.</v>

2578
02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:20.000
<v 10>I think person he's taught me in the past,</v>

2579
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:24.770
there's more time to good to be grateful and with times like this be graceful.

2580
02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:28.810
So I'm gonna just go home. Good for you and my family. It's been a long road.

2581
02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:30.830
I'm proud of everything I've accomplished in this sport.

2582
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:32.540
I have a lot of dreadlocks in the tires,

2583
02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:35.450
but right now I just need to sit down to date, man.

2584
02:34:36.250 --> 02:34:40.120
<v 1>And there was no hacker, beautiful shirt. His daughters the shit.</v>

2585
02:34:41.010 --> 02:34:43.930
All right, let's kill that Jamie. I love this.

2586
02:34:43.931 --> 02:34:48.640
This makes me more excited than ever for Tony Ferguson fight because I think

2587
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:53.220
fatigue plays a gigantic factor in any could be fight. And uh,

2588
02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:58.260
I think that is one fucking tool that Tony Ferguson has in his box that very few

2589
02:34:59.021 --> 02:35:02.380
people have. The kind of endurance of that guy has.

2590
02:35:02.410 --> 02:35:07.040
It's almost superhuman Ferguson. Yeah. Almost superhuman. Yeah.

2591
02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:12.070
And also he's so good at rolling. Like he don't, he don't just take Tony down.

2592
02:35:12.071 --> 02:35:15.370
It's not like you shoot and he resist and then boom, he's on his back.

2593
02:35:15.610 --> 02:35:18.030
When you shoot, Tony goes with you transitioning.

2594
02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.270
He rolls with you when you shoot ramble. [inaudible] yes,

2595
02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:23.920
that's the difference. Kimberly train.

2596
02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:30.500
<v 6>He'll throw them at every angle member when he DAARS mark nine 99.9% of fighters</v>

2597
02:35:32.671 --> 02:35:37.230
out there don't see Darcy's though, like Tony does.

2598
02:35:37.231 --> 02:35:39.960
Tony sees him at every x, the fight, man.

2599
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:42.440
He could be inside control in a fucking room.

2600
02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:43.293
<v 1>The ramen.</v>

2601
02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:46.450
And how about the fact that he fucking hit Barboza with that shit when they were

2602
02:35:46.451 --> 02:35:51.451
covered in blood and sweat and chaos and coming off of this watching Dustin

2603
02:35:52.121 --> 02:35:55.830
almost catch that guillotine. Tony. Tony catch that good.

2604
02:35:56.130 --> 02:35:57.030
<v 6>One of Tony's</v>

2605
02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:03.540
strongest weapons is the fact that most fighters,

2606
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:05.910
boxers or MMA fighters or whatever,

2607
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:07.980
they're trainers will tell you the same thing.

2608
02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:13.420
[inaudible] the goal is to take their performance in the gym and take it to the

2609
02:36:16.891 --> 02:36:21.390
ring. And most people can't do that. Most people fight their best at the gym.

2610
02:36:21.570 --> 02:36:24.330
They just can't take it to the the ring.

2611
02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:27.510
There's just too much pressure or whatever, or they're just too cautious.

2612
02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:31.980
Too much. There's just so much pressure. Tony does not have that problem.

2613
02:36:32.610 --> 02:36:37.560
You could. It's any proves that time and time again when you look at like, uh,

2614
02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:42.060
that w when he throws like a spinning elbow. Yeah.

2615
02:36:42.490 --> 02:36:45.930
He not only does it, will he throw a spinning elbow and not give a fuck,

2616
02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:49.560
but I'll throw two in a row. Dude, that tells you right there.

2617
02:36:49.650 --> 02:36:53.700
He also improvise. We're told he's a lot like Nate Diaz, like Nate B is,

2618
02:36:53.701 --> 02:36:58.701
and like Nick d is what happens when they get in the ring is they don't give a

2619
02:36:59.371 --> 02:37:00.480
fuck.

2620
02:37:00.570 --> 02:37:05.190
And they actually do perform like the in the ring like they do in the gym.

2621
02:37:05.310 --> 02:37:08.490
That's the biggest difference is I remember, I remember Tommy Morrison,

2622
02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.350
his biggest thing was can we take what he does in the gym and take it to the

2623
02:37:13.351 --> 02:37:16.130
ring in front of the world and just, he just couldn't

2624
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:19.460
<v 4>do it on a consistent basis. And most fighters, that's the big problem.</v>

2625
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:24.290
Can you do what you do under pressure under the whole world?

2626
02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:28.430
And Tony has [inaudible] problems with that. That's as big as,

2627
02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:31.430
especially when he goes out there and he, dude,

2628
02:37:31.431 --> 02:37:36.431
he will improvise on the spot and do shit and throw caution to the winning and

2629
02:37:37.911 --> 02:37:42.860
give a fuck. That is why Tony is dangerous because he has no,

2630
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:45.800
once it gets in the ring it's like there's no pressure. What's all season?

2631
02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:47.510
The pressure is on you dude,

2632
02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.940
because I'm going to come after you with everything.

2633
02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:52.940
So the pressure is on the other. So he goes out there and he plays,

2634
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:55.490
once Tony starts dancing, it's over dude.

2635
02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:59.060
Once he starts dancing and you see Tony just start doing crazy shit,

2636
02:37:59.390 --> 02:38:00.280
you're fucked.

2637
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:05.290
Has He ever lost yes to cause the last fought was to uh,

2638
02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:08.450
um, John's uncle John Johnson. Michael Johnson.

2639
02:38:08.451 --> 02:38:12.170
Cause Michael Johnson broke his arm. He lost the decision, he threw a kick,

2640
02:38:12.171 --> 02:38:15.110
he checked the kick and it broke his farm and he was out for like a year.

2641
02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:17.360
He had like metal plates in his arm and everything.

2642
02:38:17.361 --> 02:38:20.810
So it was Kinda hard to win that fight. But um,

2643
02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:25.600
it's going to be a great fight. Tony's one of five.

2644
02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:30.350
He's on a ridiculous wind streak and isn't like 17 in a row or 12 here's a

2645
02:38:30.351 --> 02:38:32.420
longer WinStreak than could be in the UFC.

2646
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:35.600
But he is the longest win streak besides John Jones. Right.

2647
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:39.440
It's really kind of amazing that he hasn't gotten a legit title shot yet other

2648
02:38:39.441 --> 02:38:42.410
than interim. Well he just got hurt, right? Yeah.

2649
02:38:42.730 --> 02:38:46.560
And then those could be fights, you know, like can be miss out or,

2650
02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:49.700
or you missed weight. It's, it's perfect now.

2651
02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:53.090
All that shit in the past built this up.

2652
02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:58.120
So now it's better than ever because good is better than ever right now.

2653
02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:01.200
So good. He is.

2654
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:05.300
Jesus gets on your back. Nobody can solve that problem.

2655
02:39:06.350 --> 02:39:10.670
Well is grappling is just so superior to almost everybody else in the sport.

2656
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:14.630
That's why I think Tony stands a chance because Tony's grappling is so

2657
02:39:14.631 --> 02:39:17.870
interesting and he's so agile and the thing he does,

2658
02:39:17.871 --> 02:39:19.400
like if you watch Tony Train,

2659
02:39:19.401 --> 02:39:24.401
like he's always like moving in weird ways and that's not like for fun.

2660
02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.070
That's actually how he fights. He moves and he does that for real.

2661
02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.190
I slices you with elbows,

2662
02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.400
video that he put on Instagram of him like fucking with the wing Chung dummy and

2663
02:39:34.401 --> 02:39:37.600
all these wing Chung experts came out like he's not doing it right. He's, oh,

2664
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:40.310
that's not wing Chung. I don't know what the fuck he's doing. Like, dude,

2665
02:39:40.690 --> 02:39:42.920
Tony's doing whatever the fuck he wants. He'll beat you up.

2666
02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:46.770
He'll take a whiz chunk dummy and do Tony Ferguson on.

2667
02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:51.230
He'll beat your founder up. Oh their show did that when he was fucking up.

2668
02:39:52.110 --> 02:39:55.730
Donald Serone. I was lash. Look at him, dude. He's the man.

2669
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:58.980
The other thing you gotta to think about with Tony as you can't watch the train,

2670
02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:01.490
fuck this shit. You can't find anyone to mimic Tony.

2671
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:03.470
He'll get you from all angles. Dude.

2672
02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:06.770
They'll knock you out and submit you in the same fight.

2673
02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:10.550
He's just so on with the bikes. Yeah,

2674
02:40:10.551 --> 02:40:14.250
I definitely was having a little success in the early, in the early round,

2675
02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:16.890
but he didn't, I mean he mounted them and he got in a good position,

2676
02:40:16.891 --> 02:40:18.000
but he didn't do any damage.

2677
02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:21.370
There's been some fighters that have had some success, you know, but,

2678
02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:23.220
but there's been success on Khabib too.

2679
02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:25.140
What you're dealing with the equip fighters, man,

2680
02:40:25.141 --> 02:40:26.700
whenever you're dealing with elite fighters,

2681
02:40:26.701 --> 02:40:29.550
you're dealing with guys that are gonna test each other. I mean,

2682
02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.710
of course it's not going to run through everybody.

2683
02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:33.720
He's going to have some difficult moments,

2684
02:40:33.721 --> 02:40:37.100
but his ability to win is unprecedented. It's right up there.

2685
02:40:37.490 --> 02:40:41.250
Tony could beat, ran through everybody. The difference between Tony,

2686
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:45.270
every ball of cubby clip tonight got put into a bad situation.

2687
02:40:45.271 --> 02:40:47.700
Just like Tony has been put in a bad situation. [inaudible] got clipped tonight.

2688
02:40:47.730 --> 02:40:52.730
But the difference between Tony and all of Khabib's opponents is once generally,

2689
02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:57.360
most in the last time, I forget most of the guys that could be takes down,

2690
02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:00.570
they're spending all their energy trying to get back up.

2691
02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:03.540
They're trying to get back up in the news that they're trying to get back.

2692
02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:06.870
They're trying to drag themselves up the fence. Tony's not going to do that.

2693
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:08.640
Tony's going to attack,

2694
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:13.380
embrace Khabib's never dealt with a guy that's gonna actually go,

2695
02:41:13.410 --> 02:41:15.920
okay, we're on the ground. Let's do this. Yeah.

2696
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:20.040
So that's going to be the difference. You know what, I'm not, I'm not,

2697
02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:22.560
I'm not making predictions or anything.

2698
02:41:22.890 --> 02:41:26.190
I know I've been in this sport long enough where I know anything can happen.

2699
02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:30.060
You can't predict any fights and promise cookie, no controls on the ground.

2700
02:41:30.270 --> 02:41:32.280
Whenever your Jujitsu is, whatever it is,

2701
02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.650
he can chose your hips and your legs will CLL. Nobody can,

2702
02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:41.100
has just takes everything away. Okay. He can, I respect that. Right?

2703
02:41:41.101 --> 02:41:45.090
He pins your hips to the ground and just see you later. But he hasn't,

2704
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:49.470
he hasn't fought anybody with Tony's, uh, uh,

2705
02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:54.560
weapons on the ground. And the fact that Tony's not going to try to like draw,

2706
02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:56.790
spend the whole round trying to get back up.

2707
02:41:56.820 --> 02:41:58.960
He might try to get back up here and that spots,

2708
02:41:59.110 --> 02:42:01.890
there's going to be spots where it's like, okay, let's attack this.

2709
02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:03.900
I'm on the fuck. And it's a different ballgame.

2710
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:08.370
It's a different game when [inaudible] trying to keep the guy on the ground

2711
02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.570
who's trying to drag himself up the fence and a guy just turns up in squares

2712
02:42:12.571 --> 02:42:17.100
with them and goes, okay, let's attack it. It's a whole different game,

2713
02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:19.520
so I don't know how it's gonna turn out. I don't know.

2714
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:23.010
I don't know who knows how it's gonna turn out, but I'm not guaranteeing a win.

2715
02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:27.630
I'm just saying it is like that have no other fight. There's nothing else.

2716
02:42:27.690 --> 02:42:31.470
My feeling is that if Ferguson can be busy enough on the ground,

2717
02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:35.610
[inaudible] Connor ranked number three. He hasn't fun so long.

2718
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:40.260
It seems so strange to me. They're worried if they take them out.

2719
02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:44.160
Those rankings are so odd. You know? It's like who makes those?

2720
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:45.661
How do they do that?

2721
02:42:45.661 --> 02:42:50.190
I know that the pound for pound rankings are made by journalists like

2722
02:42:50.191 --> 02:42:55.030
journalists submit their submissions. So are these, yeah, really the ranking.

2723
02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:55.950
Yeah, there's a whole,

2724
02:42:55.950 --> 02:42:58.970
there's like a number of journalists who submit soul after. Do you,

2725
02:42:58.971 --> 02:43:02.070
don't you think that after like a long lengthy layoff,

2726
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:04.950
how long has it been since he fought Connor? Last time he fought it was Vegas.

2727
02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.460
How long ago would he be? Twice a year and a half. Two years.

2728
02:43:11.390 --> 02:43:12.223
[inaudible] a year.

2729
02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:17.340
<v 6>It's been a year. When I go into yoga class and they go,</v>

2730
02:43:17.350 --> 02:43:21.550
let's do ohm and everybody is out of key and out of pitch.

2731
02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:26.110
I not here, it's hot, right? [inaudible]

2732
02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:30.990
dude, I, I do a yoga. I know I don't do,

2733
02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:34.900
I do old man Yoga Dude. What's old men yoga? Oh my God,

2734
02:43:34.901 --> 02:43:38.530
it's the greatest yoga ever invented. Why?

2735
02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:40.480
Cause you don't do shit

2736
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:44.470
because you know what it is.

2737
02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:49.680
It's an hour of some stretching to never do at your house.

2738
02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:55.060
You would never do it. So the first five minutes did the, you know, we warm up,

2739
02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:58.600
we fucking lay there d we just lay there and I'm like passing out.

2740
02:43:58.601 --> 02:43:59.434
I'm like Oh shit.

2741
02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.660
And then after five minutes she'll grab a lek and then you grabbed the other leg

2742
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:06.640
and I love it. I fucking love it.

2743
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:09.730
And you know how you know we cool down the last five minutes.

2744
02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:15.240
We fucking just get in a fetal position and just take a nap for five out of

2745
02:44:16.450 --> 02:44:19.590
fear. First Time I show this past, my wife says you've hate this, don't you?

2746
02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:22.660
Cause I went with my wife and my son, cause you hate this. I know, I'm sorry,

2747
02:44:22.661 --> 02:44:23.740
we'll go to someone. I'm like,

2748
02:44:23.741 --> 02:44:27.640
what are you talking about this I found my life's passion.

2749
02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.820
Oh Man. Yoga Dude. Your, your character. The Lazy Dancer.

2750
02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:38.320
Do I go to university 10 apps now dude,

2751
02:44:38.350 --> 02:44:41.050
I'll take a nap in June. And my wife gets mad at I,

2752
02:44:41.350 --> 02:44:44.110
cause she knows that that noise I make when I go, when I go out, like,

2753
02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:48.970
like you know when you kinda call the snoring wakes you up, you're like,

2754
02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:56.860
well she's like, I'm gonna kill you. You've been at like, I love Yoga.

2755
02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:02.580
I love everybody in the class is at least 85 years old.

2756
02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:05.500
I swear to God, me and my wife and my son,

2757
02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:07.330
we're like the youngest motherfuckers in the hung.

2758
02:45:07.331 --> 02:45:11.860
I focus you still roll Jujitsu? Like lie you a phone?

2759
02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:16.870
Uh, I am rolling but um, I'm not like,

2760
02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:20.770
you know, I'm not rolling. Like, you know,

2761
02:45:20.771 --> 02:45:22.990
I'm training for Abu Dhabi or anything like that.

2762
02:45:22.991 --> 02:45:26.910
I'm like trying to lose weight. And you said your shoulder trying to stand. Not,

2763
02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:31.150
how long has it been since your surgery in your shoulder? Uh, one year. Exactly.

2764
02:45:31.210 --> 02:45:34.590
And it's not 100%. It'll never be 100%. What's it at right now? Dude?

2765
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:37.770
Like if you try to under jack this arm and try to put me in the arm,

2766
02:45:37.810 --> 02:45:39.970
I'll tap like right here. Stem. So Bro. Yeah,

2767
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:42.940
we need to get stem cells in there. Once last time you roll kiln,

2768
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.240
everybody keeps saying I'm ting. Nice way.

2769
02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:50.320
It was when cds were fairly widely available. No, I rolled was,

2770
02:45:50.930 --> 02:45:53.890
you know what everyone, the thing about stem, I'm sorry cause I'm down with it,

2771
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:58.240
but every fucking three months there's a new dude that comes out and says, oh,

2772
02:45:58.450 --> 02:46:00.010
they did their stem cells like this.

2773
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:04.300
We take our stem cells out of fucking pigs better. And then,

2774
02:46:04.301 --> 02:46:08.050
and then six months later, oh, they've been taking their stem cells from pigs.

2775
02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:09.830
We take our stem cells from fucking,

2776
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:13.280
<v 2>uh, aborted fetuses in China. And they're like, okay.</v>

2777
02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:16.190
And then the another six months, like, oh, they take their fetus,

2778
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:18.620
they're their stem cells from my board to feed us in China.

2779
02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:21.200
We take ours from aboard board fetuses from Haiti.

2780
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:26.600
God like when you guys get to master the shit, it's amniotic fluid now I think,

2781
02:46:26.601 --> 02:46:29.340
and they take it from a placenta is not fluid.

2782
02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:34.310
What's the latest shit in court that use him? Bill Gibson was on your podcast.

2783
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:38.930
Go to Panama. We do have a hold on him cells. Slow downs did stop, stop, stop.

2784
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.800
Listen.

2785
02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.400
Dr Neil Riordan was on my podcast and he had treated Mel Gibson and Malcolm's

2786
02:46:43.430 --> 02:46:44.150
Dad.

2787
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:47.600
Dr Neil Riordan runs a clinic in Panama because they can do things in Panama but

2788
02:46:47.601 --> 02:46:50.600
they don't allow yet in the United States because they would have to classify it

2789
02:46:50.601 --> 02:46:52.370
as a drug. What does that Ford if you go down,

2790
02:46:52.430 --> 02:46:55.520
it's a little bit in that range and I sat my mom down there,

2791
02:46:56.060 --> 02:46:59.480
I sent Miriam Nakamoto down there to Miriam Nakamoto has got a fucked up knee

2792
02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:02.090
and she, she couldn't get it fixed and she was falling apart.

2793
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:07.670
She's just got it done. She's just got it done. Where do you actually know what?

2794
02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:11.690
She hasn't gone to find out. I don't think she's got it done yet. This week,

2795
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:15.320
my buddy went to, people were going to, no, he went to Germany, but he did.

2796
02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:17.600
Now the people who are going to, he's done all the research.

2797
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:21.100
They that he said that's cutting edge. She's coming to my, showed him

2798
02:47:22.610 --> 02:47:25.460
what's cutting edge. So, so the, the umbrella, there's,

2799
02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:29.660
it's called renew r e n u. And uh,

2800
02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:31.790
you'd have to read how they do it, but they, it's,

2801
02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:33.920
it's essentially from Sicilian sections.

2802
02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.120
They take the placenta and the umbilical cord from that and those cells,

2803
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:39.440
those cells, I guess are,

2804
02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:43.750
they can essentially become anything wants to do Joe not promising around.

2805
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:45.740
That's what I'm doing. And I'll tell you, my buddy did it,

2806
02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:50.600
shot it and both shoulders, shoulders hurt for seven years. He said, dude,

2807
02:47:50.601 --> 02:47:53.000
I'm telling you. He said he got a lot of them done. He said,

2808
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:55.420
I haven't had in two years. My shoulders haven't heard. That's great.

2809
02:47:55.421 --> 02:47:57.130
All this is a secondhand thing.

2810
02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:01.250
I've had a full length rotator cuff tear disappear. It's gone. Here you go.

2811
02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:03.140
I'm shooting my fucking foot. Yeah,

2812
02:48:03.141 --> 02:48:06.450
you show your plantar Fascia says it works really well. I'm shooting in my fuck.

2813
02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:10.400
You need to go to lifespan medicine in Santa Monica and talked to Dr Ben Rue.

2814
02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:12.410
He zoned Santa Monica. He's phenomenal. Listen,

2815
02:48:12.411 --> 02:48:16.040
my guy is the best guy on the planet and trust me in the United States for what

2816
02:48:16.041 --> 02:48:17.090
you can get done in the United States.

2817
02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:20.360
The guy that I go to is as good as any fucking human that's alive.

2818
02:48:20.361 --> 02:48:22.610
It's in Santa Monica, California, so you've got to trust me.

2819
02:48:22.611 --> 02:48:25.300
I do all the research. Yep. I've talked to all the doctors. I,

2820
02:48:25.490 --> 02:48:27.420
I've read books on this shit. I'm,

2821
02:48:27.421 --> 02:48:31.100
I'm about as up as you can get without being in the business.

2822
02:48:31.130 --> 02:48:36.080
Has anybody gotten stem cells in their dick? Yes.

2823
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:38.420
That would've been greenfield. Said it made his dick bigger.

2824
02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:41.630
I would recommend if you're in Vegas, I would rally back into that shit.

2825
02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:44.930
I would recommend Dr Rodney McGee. He's got a piece on him. It's not bad.

2826
02:48:45.170 --> 02:48:48.470
He doesn't need stem cells. His Dick Finger for his body.

2827
02:48:48.471 --> 02:48:52.190
He has a real problem on his dick. He would go hod Kellen,

2828
02:48:52.191 --> 02:48:56.540
you need some like physical therapy on your DQ flux. How much? I'm fucking

2829
02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:03.230
acupuncture. But for real, if you, Eddie, if you want to talk to Ben Rowe,

2830
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:06.200
he's the guy that did your back with the Regena King.

2831
02:49:06.290 --> 02:49:07.980
Your back was too far gone for that and he

2832
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:11.220
<v 1>told you your back was too far gone because all it does is act as in,</v>

2833
02:49:11.221 --> 02:49:14.280
tell me that. What did he tell you? He said it was gonna work.

2834
02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:18.450
He wouldn't like it. Well maybe it would've worked if you didn't do Jujitsu.

2835
02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:22.560
The problem at hip point. No, he saw, he saw my ex,

2836
02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:27.680
my MRI and my l five s one was like this and he,

2837
02:49:29.490 --> 02:49:32.760
he still stuck me with that shit. I said it was going to give you some relief.

2838
02:49:32.850 --> 02:49:36.540
Did it give you any relief? I don't know. Eddie's not a fan. I'm not even,

2839
02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:40.380
I don't even remember at this point. All I know is just like I've had stem cell,

2840
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:43.830
no one getting stem cells when I went to, they still talk about it.

2841
02:49:43.970 --> 02:49:46.050
It's in its day in the office cause yeah,

2842
02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:49.020
you're apparently you were hitting him with all kinds of crazy conspiracy

2843
02:49:49.021 --> 02:49:51.900
theories while you're in there. Fuck. Yeah. That's why I love that.

2844
02:49:51.901 --> 02:49:54.390
He thought I was getting stem cell

2845
02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:57.400
treatments.

2846
02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:00.600
I went in there and I signed a go stem cell and then at the very end they go,

2847
02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:03.360
oh, the same stem cell. This is just the weight of it.

2848
02:50:03.361 --> 02:50:07.650
Why did you think it was Texas PRP? I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2849
02:50:07.651 --> 02:50:10.710
It's not PRP. It's Regenics different. It's different. It's different.

2850
02:50:10.711 --> 02:50:14.430
It's way superior to PRP. It's how I fixed my bulging disc in my neck.

2851
02:50:14.730 --> 02:50:18.210
I had a real fucking problem with my neck. No fingers. What'd you do with,

2852
02:50:18.211 --> 02:50:21.240
what is Regena cane? It's a procedure they invented in Germany.

2853
02:50:21.241 --> 02:50:24.150
Koby Bryant went down there and Peyton manning had his neck fixed.

2854
02:50:25.230 --> 02:50:29.550
TJ Dillashaw themselves relax. I know they do stem cells there too.

2855
02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:33.390
They do bolt in there. I went in there thinking, listen,

2856
02:50:33.391 --> 02:50:37.170
this is what I was thinking. Maybe I'm a retard and I probably am,

2857
02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:39.420
but I went in there thinking I was getting sick.

2858
02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:43.710
I was telling everybody I'm getting swelled because you didn't listen and then

2859
02:50:43.890 --> 02:50:46.950
by the time it happened they go, oh no, you're not getting stem cells.

2860
02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:50.880
Why didn't you, why the army? Eddie didn't lie to you. You just didn't listen.

2861
02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.590
If you want to get stem cells, they can, but when it comes to look, I got,

2862
02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:59.520
Regina came to my back last week cause I've been having some sciatic nerve

2863
02:50:59.521 --> 02:50:59.941
issues.

2864
02:50:59.941 --> 02:51:03.390
My ass hurts and the nerve goes down cause I had a little bit of a bulge that's

2865
02:51:03.391 --> 02:51:05.790
pushing on it. Did it help? This hurts for other reasons.

2866
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:16.460
[inaudible] so rude. [inaudible] knows about ass Powell. I know about they,

2867
02:51:16.730 --> 02:51:21.330
they do everything. They do everything there. But if I had to tell someone,

2868
02:51:21.570 --> 02:51:23.820
if someone had a real issue and they wanted to deal with it,

2869
02:51:24.090 --> 02:51:28.680
I would say if you have time, go to Panama because they can do things in Panama.

2870
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:29.700
They can't do. Dude,

2871
02:51:29.701 --> 02:51:32.760
my mom was about to get a fucking knee replacement real close.

2872
02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:35.560
I sent her down there to Panama and for,

2873
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:39.600
I mean she's 73 so for a while it was like, wow, I don't feel anything.

2874
02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:42.270
It's still hurts. But then about six months in she's like,

2875
02:51:42.271 --> 02:51:45.690
it really seems like it's getting better. Eight months later, no pain. Come on.

2876
02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:50.560
Yes. Come on. Yes, she, she's hiking in the Grand Canyon. One mouth. Yes.

2877
02:51:50.610 --> 02:51:53.120
I need that shit. She went on vacation to Vegas.

2878
02:51:53.130 --> 02:51:57.210
She can walk with no pain in your neck? Yes. They could put it in and day.

2879
02:51:57.211 --> 02:52:00.510
My foot in the doctor and I sent my mom down there again. I just,

2880
02:52:00.511 --> 02:52:02.940
she just got back. I sent her down there twice. Why Mom?

2881
02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:05.950
Does that call snap a lie when she

2882
02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:08.890
<v 2>came back? You know how mean the price is right?</v>

2883
02:52:08.891 --> 02:52:10.770
I don't know what the fuck [inaudible].

2884
02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:14.500
I sent her down there and I'll send her down there every time she wants to go.

2885
02:52:14.501 --> 02:52:17.230
I'll send him down there three fucking times a year or, I mean it's real,

2886
02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:19.540
but they're doing intravenous stem cells.

2887
02:52:19.541 --> 02:52:22.210
They're doing direct injections and the problem joints.

2888
02:52:22.211 --> 02:52:25.060
Anything you have an issue with, it's regenerating tissue.

2889
02:52:25.090 --> 02:52:28.630
I need to see a documentary. Okay. There is there. I got papers on it now.

2890
02:52:31.390 --> 02:52:32.890
He's got published journals. Man.

2891
02:52:32.891 --> 02:52:37.420
I mean I need to see a documentary article that peaks. Okay.

2892
02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:40.570
Listen man, if you go down there,

2893
02:52:40.571 --> 02:52:44.440
I guarantee you it'll help you for you show. I'm going to start in Santa Monica.

2894
02:52:44.470 --> 02:52:47.170
I'm gonna start getting nervous about the thing about your back and here's the

2895
02:52:47.350 --> 02:52:51.910
new, don't sit nervous and Panama, the guys from Dallas. No, no shit.

2896
02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:54.630
I just taught you. I told Chaz to,

2897
02:52:54.850 --> 02:52:58.810
cause the federal government treats it as a drug and the FDA wants all that

2898
02:52:58.811 --> 02:53:01.000
money down to trucks. Come on, Bro. Yeah.

2899
02:53:01.570 --> 02:53:05.270
Callen you have to go down there if you want to get in a mileage, because it's,

2900
02:53:05.350 --> 02:53:08.140
it's, look, it's smaller doses. You can get it done in America,

2901
02:53:08.141 --> 02:53:10.120
but you want to get the fucking full Monty.

2902
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:11.590
We're going to go down there to Panama.

2903
02:53:11.591 --> 02:53:14.950
I would be happy to go if I have the time, if I don't get to take five days off,

2904
02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:18.300
save your life. My body's fine. My Buddy's fine dude.

2905
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:22.330
Slash they had big results from what I've had done in the United States and I'm

2906
02:53:22.331 --> 02:53:26.140
telling you what I get done in the United States is not as potent as what

2907
02:53:26.141 --> 02:53:26.974
they're doing in Panama.

2908
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:29.730
He's thought about maybe asking them a trip that pedal a hundred percent I'm

2909
02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:31.720
talking to my mom about flights. I know we're hours.

2910
02:53:31.721 --> 02:53:35.650
This is what we're going to do. It's more than that. [inaudible] we do this.

2911
02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:40.680
How bout all of us had a bar fight companion to sponsor all of us and we all go,

2912
02:53:42.161 --> 02:53:45.190
they pay for the free and we blow it the fuck up. Listen,

2913
02:53:45.191 --> 02:53:47.170
I already blowing them up. I've already blown them up,

2914
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:49.560
which is why he's willing to help. You know,

2915
02:53:49.640 --> 02:53:53.440
like a lot of my friends have gone down my companions stem cell and we talked

2916
02:53:53.441 --> 02:53:57.690
about how we feel [inaudible] it up.

2917
02:53:57.940 --> 02:53:59.050
What I was gonna do with my families.

2918
02:53:59.051 --> 02:54:01.090
We were going to go to Panama for three days.

2919
02:54:01.091 --> 02:54:04.420
I get the treatment and then we're going to go from there and jet somewhere else

2920
02:54:04.421 --> 02:54:08.470
and then have another injury like so.

2921
02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:10.930
So let's just say my ankles. I got all my son the morning.

2922
02:54:10.950 --> 02:54:13.500
My fucking ankles are so stiff. 100% they get fixed.

2923
02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:18.970
[inaudible] right into the joint. You can even get a little botox. Well this,

2924
02:54:18.980 --> 02:54:22.760
listen what Ben Greenfield with Ben Greenfield did with the,

2925
02:54:23.130 --> 02:54:25.720
with with his Dick. I told you Ben Grifo got shot his dick.

2926
02:54:25.810 --> 02:54:29.230
He got his shot through his whole body. He got a shot in every joint.

2927
02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:32.790
It was like they put him under, they did his bat. Louise's ankle.

2928
02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:36.940
They did his big toes. Cause he fussed up. Yes. Oh yeah.

2929
02:54:36.941 --> 02:54:39.700
I mean he was like for a while, I don't know, it's just like holy shit.

2930
02:54:39.850 --> 02:54:42.220
His whole body was like out of it. But he said afterwards,

2931
02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:44.320
his biological age dropped.

2932
02:54:44.470 --> 02:54:47.500
He said he felt significantly better through his entire body.

2933
02:54:47.501 --> 02:54:50.830
Like every joint felt better. His energy level went through the roof.

2934
02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:54.130
He said he did you see this? You see what made the news today? But they can,

2935
02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.780
they, they can do a,

2936
02:54:55.781 --> 02:54:59.450
they can reverse your biological clock by two and a half years. Human groves,

2937
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:03.680
Ga foreman. I met from [inaudible] commentary,

2938
02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:06.620
but here's the thing about metformin. I met, there's a guy,

2939
02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:10.070
David Sinclair from Harvard who's coming on my podcast again next week.

2940
02:55:10.310 --> 02:55:13.310
He's been on before. And the thing about metformin is when,

2941
02:55:13.311 --> 02:55:14.540
when he talked about it,

2942
02:55:14.541 --> 02:55:17.300
he was advising it and talking about the benefits of it.

2943
02:55:17.301 --> 02:55:21.170
But then when I talked to people like Greenfield and then also Rhonda, Patrick,

2944
02:55:21.171 --> 02:55:22.850
they said there's a performance hit though.

2945
02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.730
Like your physical performance suffers from it form. It's not,

2946
02:55:25.970 --> 02:55:29.300
you don't have as much like you, you're not gonna. It's, it's,

2947
02:55:29.301 --> 02:55:31.190
you're not gonna feel as good when you train.

2948
02:55:31.370 --> 02:55:34.460
You're not gonna feel as good physically, but it lowers your biological age.

2949
02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:37.850
It's a tricky one. Like she's not so like, listen man, I,

2950
02:55:37.970 --> 02:55:41.090
I put my fucking right hand on the Rhonda Patrick Bible.

2951
02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:44.590
She says as thorough a researcher is there is, and you know,

2952
02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:47.810
she's a legit scientist and when she does the research on something,

2953
02:55:47.811 --> 02:55:51.770
she looks at every fucking angle completely non-biased and she's not sold on

2954
02:55:51.771 --> 02:55:54.140
metformin. And there's a lot of other people that agree with her.

2955
02:55:54.141 --> 02:55:56.360
They say there's, there's a performance hit apparently,

2956
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:59.960
but Davidson Claire is not exercising. If he does, he's like, yeah,

2957
02:55:59.961 --> 02:56:02.120
no fucking elliptical machine. While he watches the news,

2958
02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:06.020
he's not doing anything crazy. But if you're an athlete like I know you are.

2959
02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.190
Damn right. I was about to say, Joe, that's a great shirt. I just noticed that.

2960
02:56:10.490 --> 02:56:12.020
That's a great fucking show.

2961
02:56:12.970 --> 02:56:17.750
That's an official [inaudible] coming around for a while I was wearing the all

2962
02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:19.760
like I'd wear the official ones at the Wayans.

2963
02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:22.460
It's a great tired of them taking my shirt off in front of everybody and that's

2964
02:56:22.461 --> 02:56:25.950
a great shirt. Yeah, they make dope shirts, man. They're getting guns.

2965
02:56:25.970 --> 02:56:28.220
A bunch of dope shirts that Yo over marijuana. My favorites.

2966
02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:31.800
I would offer you the stop. [inaudible]

2967
02:56:31.930 --> 02:56:35.660
sent me the style pass. I've worn that one. It looks like the Matrix.

2968
02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:36.610
It's like different colors.

2969
02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:41.420
That cartoon of a Yellow Romero and a mosfet now.

2970
02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:46.040
Yeah. Blow that up. I'm seeing [inaudible] glove.

2971
02:56:46.390 --> 02:56:49.910
That is so good bro. Polo coast is the only guy to slow down.

2972
02:56:49.911 --> 02:56:54.320
Yoel Romero like literally like put it on him where Yo always puts it on

2973
02:56:54.321 --> 02:56:58.970
everybody. Yeah. He made EOL fight off his back foot. He made yo l like,

2974
02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.820
like little like having a hard time setting up to throw shots.

2975
02:57:01.850 --> 02:57:05.790
I didn't know Cosa was that good though. He'd be sleeping. You'd be dreaming.

2976
02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:11.270
He could. I can't play it. I didn't know Costo was that God damn Downton.

2977
02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:15.230
What'd you say? Oh, somebody else's video.

2978
02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:21.480
Youtube is holy go. Well it's man,

2979
02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.470
you guys don't watch football so you can give a fuck. Something happened.

2980
02:57:24.580 --> 02:57:28.820
And I know Antonio Brown signed with the Patriots. Is that bad?

2981
02:57:29.230 --> 02:57:30.063
Oh Dude.

2982
02:57:30.210 --> 02:57:34.220
What is it about the dark side that just added to the best team in the world and

2983
02:57:34.221 --> 02:57:37.730
he's the best quarterback? The best coach. Oh,

2984
02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:43.040
how is that guy still the best quarterback at his age? 42 stem cells. Is He,

2985
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:45.500
well he's definitely done some of that shit. Ton of it. Yeah.

2986
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:50.310
That doesn't take hits. He takes his credible kind of incredible lines.

2987
02:57:50.311 --> 02:57:53.540
He's just getting sense because before him,

2988
02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:57.380
remember his drew Bledsoe like drew Bledsoe was awesome.

2989
02:57:57.750 --> 02:58:01.090
And to think that drew Bledsoe's back

2990
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:05.130
<v 7>would be the best mother fucker of all time.</v>

2991
02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:07.890
Especially that cause no one ever thought that. Cause he not a fast runner.

2992
02:58:07.891 --> 02:58:11.400
He's nice. He's, no one's ever thought that the true blood flow was high level.

2993
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:13.650
Yeah. How about that dude that just retired? What's his name?

2994
02:58:14.340 --> 02:58:17.850
What's that guy that retired man, you're Andrew Luck. Yeah. Why did he retire?

2995
02:58:18.090 --> 02:58:18.701
Because he,

2996
02:58:18.701 --> 02:58:21.440
he's at 29 he had a a hundred million dollars or whatever and he's [inaudible]

2997
02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:24.270
graduate engineering or architecture Stanford.

2998
02:58:24.271 --> 02:58:26.460
He had other options and he's like, I don't want to get my head. No.

2999
02:58:26.461 --> 02:58:29.850
He kept getting hurt though, so he was a baller, super baller,

3000
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.090
but he kept hummed. Horrible injuries had missed a whole year.

3001
02:58:33.091 --> 02:58:35.730
Previous to that thing, came back, got an NFL player that come back,

3002
02:58:35.731 --> 02:58:37.800
play with you. Then just his line suck,

3003
02:58:37.801 --> 02:58:41.040
kept getting hit and has money in the bank. Super Smart Kid. It was like, Oh,

3004
02:58:41.041 --> 02:58:42.960
I'm out man. I don't have the passion for it.

3005
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:47.700
I looked at the list of cal ski saying things like Brandon who played football,

3006
02:58:47.701 --> 02:58:51.240
I go hit a last ready to kidney. He had a lacerated lacerated kidney.

3007
02:58:51.241 --> 02:58:54.630
He had a lacerated liver and he looked at the list and I was so horrified.

3008
02:58:54.631 --> 02:58:58.320
My job was like, what? Like that's it. Looks like you've been to a car accident.

3009
02:58:58.321 --> 02:59:02.570
And Brendan goes, it's not that bad. No, there's guys way,

3010
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:03.783
way worse.

3011
02:59:03.810 --> 02:59:08.340
Even Robin Broski was talking to a like a crowd and he started getting emotional

3012
02:59:08.341 --> 02:59:12.180
talking about how he kept getting hurt and like his mind was in in it and he was

3013
02:59:12.181 --> 02:59:13.080
hating the play.

3014
02:59:13.081 --> 02:59:18.081
It's just he guys placed in fucking four man and you play into your twenties and

3015
02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:21.900
you're like fuck this man right after was money in the bank.

3016
02:59:21.901 --> 02:59:24.800
You also see these guys that are getting pulled around in wheelchairs when

3017
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:26.970
they're in their sixties and they can't remember what their name is.

3018
02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:31.290
There's a lot of that tunnel and we are aware of it now where they weren't aware

3019
02:59:31.291 --> 02:59:33.390
of it 2030 years ago. I think fighters,

3020
02:59:33.570 --> 02:59:35.970
two fathers a lot smarter now like Nate Diaz, like dude,

3021
02:59:35.971 --> 02:59:37.020
pay me what I'm worth man.

3022
02:59:37.021 --> 02:59:42.021
I know I'm on the reverse side of that is you see a lot of guys like

3023
02:59:43.850 --> 02:59:48.840
that have had many concussions in football like Troy Aikman and Steve Young.

3024
02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:53.900
They've had tremendous amount of concussions and they're commentating and they

3025
02:59:54.211 --> 02:59:57.450
sound like they say to Jean, they say,

3026
02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:03.800
did you get knocked out by some gigantic 260 pound guy?

3027
03:00:04.410 --> 03:00:06.510
Run a full clip like eight times.

3028
03:00:06.511 --> 03:00:10.710
Didn't you get like [inaudible] on off season doing commentator commentating and

3029
03:00:10.711 --> 03:00:14.250
they sound brilliant. There's fighters like Elster over him.

3030
03:00:14.310 --> 03:00:18.730
Sugar Ray Robinson is a no, no, no secret. Oh,

3031
03:00:19.230 --> 03:00:22.110
sugary Robinson. You mean Lennon or Robinson letter? Yeah. Struggling,

3032
03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:26.280
struggling, struggling. Go to his Instagram page. And by the way,

3033
03:00:26.930 --> 03:00:30.300
Rob Smash struggling. No, no, no. He has a hard time talking.

3034
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:34.590
And then Robinson was struggling real bad late in his life.

3035
03:00:35.350 --> 03:00:38.130
Like Steve Young, he's had him in Troy and I've had,

3036
03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:43.260
Overeem is the guy that explained there's no, there's,

3037
03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:45.630
there's not a hundred like there's an off season.

3038
03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:48.300
It's an off season a hundred is an exaggeration joke.

3039
03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:51.350
But in football you have an off season. You have a lot to tell you, right?

3040
03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:54.420
To say a billion, a billion concussion. No, but seriously,

3041
03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:59.480
and those guys are commentating for Fox and CBS and NBC particulars a gene they

3042
03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:03.820
can't treat. You can't kill for Lich at all.

3043
03:01:03.821 --> 03:01:07.510
When you're commentating for fucking NBC, you can't glitch.

3044
03:01:07.511 --> 03:01:10.170
You have to be on by [inaudible] NPO.

3045
03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:13.820
[inaudible] something that I've been tested for it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have it.

3046
03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:18.850
Thank God. We'll see. Yeah. I don't see any good tickets now because CTE, CTQ,

3047
03:01:19.130 --> 03:01:22.720
kicking, any seconds you say, I see no sign of CTE on the sidewalk. I see him.

3048
03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:27.490
Yeah. What you do? What on who? In Brennan? Trenton. You don't see nothing?

3049
03:01:28.030 --> 03:01:30.790
Not even a little bit. You see some? No.

3050
03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:36.230
<v 11>Oh God.</v>

3051
03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:43.050
Oh fuck. He's going to be another intervention.

3052
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:48.930
<v 7>That was good dude. What was there that would want to do that? No,</v>

3053
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:51.120
this is people that are fighting currently that do worry me though.

3054
03:01:51.150 --> 03:01:53.320
You have conversations with them and they sound like they're drunk. Yeah.

3055
03:01:53.370 --> 03:01:55.240
And then they pull it together for fights. Yeah,

3056
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:57.420
they pull it together and they look at it at fights.

3057
03:01:57.421 --> 03:02:00.990
But you know what the thing is though, Joe, on the average, I know in the,

3058
03:02:00.991 --> 03:02:02.640
in the media, and this isn't a conspiracy,

3059
03:02:02.670 --> 03:02:04.700
he might agree with this city and this to your point, believe in

3060
03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:11.430
[inaudible] that shit. Well, I'm just saying Bryan. So you see cts everywhere,

3061
03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:15.390
cts everywhere in brain trauma, but the odds are you're not going to get it.

3062
03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:16.800
There's more guys better off.

3063
03:02:16.801 --> 03:02:20.220
Who played in the NFL and college football and fought true fine.

3064
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:22.980
Then those that are stupid. It's actually true. Okay.

3065
03:02:22.981 --> 03:02:26.480
The odd odds are most of the are fine for socks.

3066
03:02:26.610 --> 03:02:30.570
There's out there that have been like fucking shut off a few times that do not

3067
03:02:30.571 --> 03:02:34.440
know about the longterm CT study that they did where they've tested 111 people

3068
03:02:34.441 --> 03:02:38.800
in 110 of them had CT yes. That they were, well they were slept 10.

3069
03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:42.310
How did they do to, it was a selected 110 minutes. I mean what is it?

3070
03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:45.660
There's an ability to like try and keep tasks or something? No, no, no.

3071
03:02:45.661 --> 03:02:48.900
They have the ability to determine whether or not yet. That's a very dramatic,

3072
03:02:48.930 --> 03:02:52.110
what was that? It, that's a little bit of a trick, uh, based on Taiwan MRI,

3073
03:02:52.111 --> 03:02:55.410
those, those, and correct me if I'm wrong, those samples that were,

3074
03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:59.380
those samples were donated by their family and those guys showed signs show

3075
03:02:59.910 --> 03:03:02.820
signs. So, so that was a, that was kind of not a very good control group.

3076
03:03:02.850 --> 03:03:04.800
Their bodies are fucked up. Their joints,

3077
03:03:04.801 --> 03:03:06.910
their back 100% but their brain though,

3078
03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:10.650
there's more guys that don't have CT than do. That's interesting. Yeah.

3079
03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:15.510
Well Ken, Ken, someone be kept alive with just their head. Yes.

3080
03:03:16.050 --> 03:03:19.230
Yeah. Is there, is there proof of that? Oh, you mean like a head transplant? No,

3081
03:03:19.231 --> 03:03:23.520
no. Like, like I try to like, cause you have, I lost my arm. I'd still be alive.

3082
03:03:23.521 --> 03:03:26.310
Right. If I lost both arms, I still be alive. Both legs.

3083
03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:29.570
At what point in your heart? I need to live. I need long you,

3084
03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:32.310
you need to gotta breathe. You need that Gabriel. Yeah.

3085
03:03:32.311 --> 03:03:36.660
You need the holistic medical science has went down a weird road.

3086
03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:39.750
What have you had a head and you had like a some blood support.

3087
03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:40.591
You had a machine,

3088
03:03:40.591 --> 03:03:43.530
you know there's guys that have been knocked out a bunch of times like Oh,

3089
03:03:43.531 --> 03:03:46.050
like I said, Overeem, Overeem is one of the best examples.

3090
03:03:46.051 --> 03:03:49.020
You talked to that guy, he sounds fucking clear as day.

3091
03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:53.940
He's been knocked out by mean gang. Oh, time. He more than anybody in the se.

3092
03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:58.070
Yeah, a gang of times and he sounds fine. Super. For now.

3093
03:03:58.260 --> 03:03:59.990
<v 1>It says no problems. Hopefully he, I mean,</v>

3094
03:03:59.991 --> 03:04:02.270
and he's still winning and still fighting. Well, it's like,

3095
03:04:02.271 --> 03:04:06.260
have you seen that nicotine helps with that? With that the studies are nicotine,

3096
03:04:06.830 --> 03:04:10.220
so nicotine, the way it's delivered, fucks people's lungs up, stuff like that.

3097
03:04:10.221 --> 03:04:11.660
But nicotine by itself can take you in.

3098
03:04:11.661 --> 03:04:15.300
The chew actually helps with brain trumps, stuff like that. It helps us.

3099
03:04:15.301 --> 03:04:19.290
Silicide dementia. Siliciden apparently regenerates neurons. Yeah.

3100
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:21.260
It's one of the rare things that regenerates neurons.

3101
03:04:21.261 --> 03:04:23.810
Another thing that's supposed to be really good for it is lion's mane,

3102
03:04:23.811 --> 03:04:25.730
lion's Mane, mushroom, Paul Stamets,

3103
03:04:25.890 --> 03:04:29.330
who's a mycologist and Paul Stanley Stamets. Oh,

3104
03:04:29.570 --> 03:04:33.770
different guy close. He's been on my podcast before.

3105
03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:35.240
He's coming on again to,

3106
03:04:35.241 --> 03:04:39.110
he's a legitimate scientist and next time to possibly see your podcast.

3107
03:04:39.111 --> 03:04:41.710
Can you invite me please? Yes. I have a, again,

3108
03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:45.710
I don't know if we'll ever be on it yet. Just to one day. Okay.

3109
03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:50.110
Please don't apologize to him for when you met him, when your younger kiss,

3110
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:56.630
did you ever hear anything back from Kanye? We'll talk about that off the air.

3111
03:04:57.590 --> 03:05:00.410
Not, not bad. Nah. Yeah, it just hit me.

3112
03:05:00.411 --> 03:05:04.160
I think it's better for that guy to not do podcasts. Just make great music.

3113
03:05:04.161 --> 03:05:05.180
This is why I don't think you can.

3114
03:05:05.250 --> 03:05:06.500
This is why I don't think it's gonna work for you.

3115
03:05:06.501 --> 03:05:09.770
You're not gonna let him rant like Trump does and get away with all that stuff.

3116
03:05:09.800 --> 03:05:11.180
It's not what you do with Trump.

3117
03:05:11.181 --> 03:05:14.490
Let's say you never saw that video of him in the White House talking about

3118
03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:18.440
making his own like book and Vocabulary Shit and Trump's like, that'd be cool,

3119
03:05:18.441 --> 03:05:20.990
dude. Trump's like, okay, you're on my side, right?

3120
03:05:21.470 --> 03:05:25.490
I'm talking long as you with me. I'm a Kanye Fan. I'm telling you I am too.

3121
03:05:26.210 --> 03:05:26.960
It's amazing.

3122
03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:30.880
I think she's incredibly eccentric and I think if you're going to be incredibly

3123
03:05:31.470 --> 03:05:32.303
eccentric the way he is,

3124
03:05:32.540 --> 03:05:36.290
you're going to have a lot of nutty thoughts and ideas and he also has some

3125
03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:40.340
mental health issues like legitimate that he's discussed that are public and

3126
03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:44.630
that that I think in some ways may contribute to his art because he's off

3127
03:05:44.631 --> 03:05:49.040
medication. He was on medication for awhile and the way he talked about it,

3128
03:05:49.041 --> 03:05:52.160
he was saying that it was stifling him. It was fucking him up telling him, yeah,

3129
03:05:52.161 --> 03:05:55.670
it was doubling his ability to create, how could it not? It's a fine,

3130
03:05:55.671 --> 03:05:59.360
it's a fine line though, right? Because we're making great art. Amazing.

3131
03:05:59.390 --> 03:06:03.470
What made him amazing is this wild mind that he has. But this wild mind is not,

3132
03:06:03.740 --> 03:06:07.280
it's not based on mathematical truth and logic and reason.

3133
03:06:07.281 --> 03:06:11.000
It's based on this ability to just go with the flow and think what you think and

3134
03:06:11.001 --> 03:06:12.800
be confident in your decisions and just be,

3135
03:06:13.250 --> 03:06:15.740
and this be in touch with your emotions and your feelings.

3136
03:06:15.740 --> 03:06:20.150
And I mean he's a fucking incredibly prolific artist and to leave that guy alone

3137
03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:23.690
and I think the Kim Kardashians situation's perfect because she loves him.

3138
03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:26.540
They have a family together. I bet she kind of keeps him grounded.

3139
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:29.450
Her and her family obviously have an amazing business sense.

3140
03:06:29.660 --> 03:06:32.510
So like they'll keep all the money tight, keep everybody together.

3141
03:06:32.540 --> 03:06:34.820
I mean she's got fucking more loot than God.

3142
03:06:35.310 --> 03:06:37.940
So have Kim Kardashian on your podcast. You know what? I'd have her,

3143
03:06:37.970 --> 03:06:40.760
I'd have her come on and talk about her decision to help with prison reform

3144
03:06:40.940 --> 03:06:42.260
because I think that's really admirable.

3145
03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:44.540
There's a lot of people that have made a lot of money and they've gotten real

3146
03:06:44.541 --> 03:06:48.470
famous and they didn't do shit with it. But what she's done, she goes MP free.

3147
03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:49.670
Yes, she's actually,

3148
03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:53.450
and she's actually pushed a narrative that you can do something like this and

3149
03:06:53.451 --> 03:06:56.190
she's talked to Trump, but she's visited the White House and she's got,

3150
03:06:56.430 --> 03:07:00.150
<v 2>I think something like 18 people freed from prison that were wrongly</v>

3151
03:07:00.151 --> 03:07:02.620
incarcerated. Pretty close. So respect to her. I don't,

3152
03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:05.460
I don't know ever want to make a Kim Kardashian joke for the rest of my life.

3153
03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:08.750
Plus it made a bunch of them. But even if I did,

3154
03:07:08.751 --> 03:07:11.880
it would feel less special the one before that one before.

3155
03:07:12.300 --> 03:07:17.060
But even if I say Shit, that was Bruce man. But if I did, I mean,

3156
03:07:17.061 --> 03:07:20.010
I mean it, but I mean, what she's done is like,

3157
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:23.560
she's decided to make a difference. She didn't have to make a difference.

3158
03:07:23.850 --> 03:07:25.680
She could just buy diamonds to get her toes done.

3159
03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:30.150
She decided to make a difference, you know, so I respect her 100% man.

3160
03:07:30.780 --> 03:07:34.860
There's a lot of fucking, there's this people that learn and grow, you know,

3161
03:07:34.861 --> 03:07:38.310
would want to sell people short and just write people off and cancel people

3162
03:07:38.311 --> 03:07:41.460
because of this or that and turn it into a noun. Yeah.

3163
03:07:41.560 --> 03:07:44.760
It's who you are changing. It's not talking about nonsense,

3164
03:07:45.130 --> 03:07:48.360
about the difference between you and I. When we were 28 Oh my God.

3165
03:07:48.690 --> 03:07:51.780
The more the level of Moronic Energy, oh my God,

3166
03:07:51.781 --> 03:07:56.430
we were morrows and what we thought about all the time in our head as we're

3167
03:07:56.431 --> 03:07:59.560
together. Oh, let's go get a

3168
03:08:01.810 --> 03:08:06.090
[inaudible] pickle. That's high. Let's get Parata. Oh yeah. I had a flat

3169
03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:10.740
Parata and human skeleton in my tank. I said to him one time, I go, yeah,

3170
03:08:10.741 --> 03:08:13.500
I want to talk, but I want to talk. That's just basically jaws on a leash.

3171
03:08:13.501 --> 03:08:18.090
I want a pitbull the head, oh, help you help you say my house. The next.

3172
03:08:18.091 --> 03:08:18.924
He's like, I'm here.

3173
03:08:19.090 --> 03:08:22.810
Legitly went to a guy who was fighting dogs to get Brian's died.

3174
03:08:22.811 --> 03:08:24.100
I didn't want to fight. I just wanting to find,

3175
03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:26.610
knock that I wasn't gonna fight it. I just wanted a bad ass tall.

3176
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:28.380
You want the Lowe's a sweet dog?

3177
03:08:28.381 --> 03:08:31.920
Did you get the dog was a great friend watch on a farm. Oh,

3178
03:08:31.921 --> 03:08:34.980
I'll tell you how to tie it. Good question. I had my friend watched on the farm.

3179
03:08:34.981 --> 03:08:38.420
My friend calls me and goes, hey, your dog's not with us anymore. I go, why?

3180
03:08:38.490 --> 03:08:42.840
He goes, yeah, sorry about that. Wow. Lab News. I shot it. And I go, oh.

3181
03:08:42.841 --> 03:08:43.590
And he goes, yeah,

3182
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:46.630
so you could have told me that that dog was going to turn on at any minute.

3183
03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:51.180
And I go, the dog went after a baby calf,

3184
03:08:51.210 --> 03:08:55.170
a cow. I was holding on to it. The neighbor's dog. Well, no, I'm sorry.

3185
03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:58.080
Let me start again. It killed a couple goats.

3186
03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:03.150
Then when after the baby calf and when the, the family dog came out,

3187
03:09:03.151 --> 03:09:06.780
which was like a German shepherd, golden retriever. Pippa was like, yeah,

3188
03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:11.740
and killed. Got It. Yeah. And broke. It broke its leg.

3189
03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:15.180
And then that was when my friend, he said, when I tried to pull that dog off,

3190
03:09:15.210 --> 03:09:19.160
it was so swollen. It was like, it was like the small dog. It was,

3191
03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:24.320
it was pulsing and it was covered in blood and it was so excited and I was like,

3192
03:09:24.331 --> 03:09:27.900
I was like, oh, this is a demon dog. And he shot the dog. Wow.

3193
03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:31.140
Because he was like, I can't have this talk on my phone. He's got a gun.

3194
03:09:31.170 --> 03:09:33.650
He's a farmer. He's like, everyone been fucked. Yeah.

3195
03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:36.690
Well they don't bite people. I know. He was as hell on four wheels.

3196
03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:39.150
I know a dude who had wolf dogs. They were like seven,

3197
03:09:39.151 --> 03:09:43.750
eight Timberwolf and they got out of his yard or he let him out. I don't know.

3198
03:09:43.850 --> 03:09:46.980
But they went to a neighbor's farm and killed like eight sheep.

3199
03:09:47.570 --> 03:09:51.630
They'd come back just bathed and blood will just come from blood wolf dogs.

3200
03:09:51.631 --> 03:09:55.690
They are illegal in a lot of parts that they should be at all, man.

3201
03:09:56.650 --> 03:10:00.580
Like cit. Fuck you. Yeah. And was like the conversation you have with the dogs.

3202
03:10:01.090 --> 03:10:04.540
See it? Yup. Fuck you. They're big. They're big man. Big Dr.

3203
03:10:04.541 --> 03:10:06.490
Pack instinct is very, very strong.

3204
03:10:06.610 --> 03:10:10.450
So children are lower on that totem pole than they are.

3205
03:10:10.750 --> 03:10:14.200
And so what happens is they look at children as below them subservient.

3206
03:10:14.201 --> 03:10:16.550
They don't look at him as part of the family cause they're, they haven't,

3207
03:10:16.570 --> 03:10:19.720
they're very pack oriented, the bite kids and that. So they'll take kids out.

3208
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:22.030
Did you hear about that guy that got attacked in British Columbia while he was

3209
03:10:22.031 --> 03:10:24.310
sleeping in his bag? You sleeping in a sleeping bag?

3210
03:10:24.430 --> 03:10:27.670
I'm going to get a lot of mail. Me To 10 tried to drag him out, attempt.

3211
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:31.270
People were screaming wolf bit him was dragging him.

3212
03:10:31.340 --> 03:10:34.870
The Wolf's ass was hanging out of the tent, pulling this guy out.

3213
03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:35.950
The guy's screaming,

3214
03:10:35.951 --> 03:10:39.340
the wolves got ahold of his arm and then some other people kicked it,

3215
03:10:39.341 --> 03:10:42.010
some other campers woke up, kicked it, threw rocks at it.

3216
03:10:42.310 --> 03:10:46.030
Gray wolves almost never do that. But that, that was what they have in the past.

3217
03:10:46.300 --> 03:10:49.210
You know, there's a story on happen. Well, they kicked in,

3218
03:10:49.211 --> 03:10:51.130
the thing ran off and they threw rocks at it.

3219
03:10:51.131 --> 03:10:54.500
And then the forest rangers got shot at and yeah,

3220
03:10:54.570 --> 03:10:57.130
I'm going to get a shit load of emails from people who own wolf dogs.

3221
03:10:57.250 --> 03:10:59.920
Don't send them to me. I don't want to hear it. I'm sure they're great.

3222
03:10:59.921 --> 03:11:02.320
Dogs are great dogs. Just you've got to be in control of it.

3223
03:11:02.321 --> 03:11:03.730
There's a guy in my neighborhood that does one.

3224
03:11:04.090 --> 03:11:06.820
You gotta be in control of that God damn thing. You gotta in the kids.

3225
03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:10.560
They're great dogs. They [inaudible] around. Yeah.

3226
03:11:10.590 --> 03:11:14.490
But a key is keeping Akita Akita is more of a control.

3227
03:11:15.250 --> 03:11:19.420
Ikea's WIC where you buy cheap furniture, but a Akita, Akita, Akita, Akita,

3228
03:11:19.450 --> 03:11:23.790
you said, you know what they said? Kia [inaudible] car,

3229
03:11:23.860 --> 03:11:25.510
Akita, Akita

3230
03:11:30.380 --> 03:11:33.130
[inaudible]. Apparently it's a Japanese bear hunting dog.

3231
03:11:33.131 --> 03:11:36.970
They said that the curly tails dogs [inaudible] aggressive, quiet.

3232
03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:37.691
They're very quiet.

3233
03:11:37.691 --> 03:11:40.330
They pretend to be good for people that have allergies cause they can be

3234
03:11:40.510 --> 03:11:43.450
hypoallergenic. They, they are. Um, uh,

3235
03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:47.680
and they are pretty good watch dogs, but they're very dog aggressive, you know,

3236
03:11:48.050 --> 03:11:48.883
very dog.

3237
03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:53.940
One of their main characteristics are that my landlord had one is that they're

3238
03:11:54.071 --> 03:11:58.780
only loyal to their master and they don't give a fuck about anybody else.

3239
03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:01.300
You know, most dogs are all about love. You know, most dogs,

3240
03:12:01.450 --> 03:12:05.440
like all they care about is love. They just want love, love, love. Yup.

3241
03:12:05.710 --> 03:12:07.750
Not Akita. They didn't want that.

3242
03:12:07.810 --> 03:12:12.610
All they want is food from their master and everyone else can suck this trip,

3243
03:12:12.611 --> 03:12:16.600
dude, I, I lived around a motherfucker like that and I was scared.

3244
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:20.890
I was scared as shit. There's bad ass dogs. He's all Dick too.

3245
03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:23.080
He'll go right after our mail at all.

3246
03:12:23.410 --> 03:12:27.850
Last thing Kito wants is love that aren't really, they don't want pets.

3247
03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:31.670
That's one dog talking about a really low fucking control group. No,

3248
03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:34.780
that's why they're Japanese police dogs is because of their Co.

3249
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:39.830
That quality is that they only care about their master and everyone else,

3250
03:12:40.270 --> 03:12:41.920
all the, they won't bite everyone else.

3251
03:12:41.921 --> 03:12:44.440
They just don't give a fuck about no one else. They're like,

3252
03:12:44.441 --> 03:12:48.850
please stay away from those. That's like this German Sherri. I lived with one.

3253
03:12:48.851 --> 03:12:52.040
My landlord had gone guard dogs. He wanted guard dog. He

3254
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:56.570
<v 7>was a meth dealer. Oh Jesus. My landlord. Your landlord was a meth dealer.</v>

3255
03:12:56.960 --> 03:13:00.880
Oh my God. So you mom, you wanted Akita,

3256
03:13:01.390 --> 03:13:05.330
you got to pay the guy the rent and he's fucking, no, he was called to me.

3257
03:13:06.260 --> 03:13:10.460
EMS was involved in a lot of shady shit and he had that dog for a reason.

3258
03:13:11.230 --> 03:13:16.230
Like that was some serious protection like navy seals and shit.

3259
03:13:16.580 --> 03:13:21.500
This motherfucker you, whenever I came around I was scared of Shit.

3260
03:13:21.501 --> 03:13:25.190
I'd come around the house and I was like, I'm paying the rent and that dogs,

3261
03:13:25.191 --> 03:13:28.950
I please don't pet me. Bite your fucking arm.

3262
03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:34.010
If you pet the [inaudible] stereo, who's just like, but shepherds,

3263
03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:38.780
shepherds, they're like a good German shepherd and Belgium Elmore's those dogs,

3264
03:13:39.090 --> 03:13:41.990
they're a lot. They, they bond on one person, but good luck if it,

3265
03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:42.980
those dogs are trained,

3266
03:13:42.981 --> 03:13:47.870
those big mail check line showers that my buddy Ryan has enjoy that shit like a

3267
03:13:47.871 --> 03:13:51.760
my buddy Ryan who he, yeah, he's trying my dogs, right?

3268
03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:56.420
Ryan can take his dog in the middle wallets biting asleep while it's in the down

3269
03:13:56.421 --> 03:13:58.550
position, waiting for the command. You can go up and pet it.

3270
03:13:58.970 --> 03:14:01.490
He can say go get him and he'll go to your house.

3271
03:14:01.940 --> 03:14:06.290
He will not touch a woman or a child. But if it's a man and you're in the house,

3272
03:14:06.410 --> 03:14:08.960
he get up take and there's no barking.

3273
03:14:09.250 --> 03:14:13.730
He's taken each shepard talk dude, just coordinate. You touch his body.

3274
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:18.510
I'm just playing ball walk. He's always 10 minutes. Did I send you to his dogs?

3275
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:21.110
Dogs amazes dogs. Amazing Shepherd.

3276
03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:24.170
He's really good at getting real great talks cause he goes for temperament

3277
03:14:24.171 --> 03:14:27.230
first. So the dogs will come out and he goes to Connecticut this one place,

3278
03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:32.530
he'll get these fucking dogs and I've met probably six of them there.

3279
03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:36.560
They're fucking terrifying. They're already grown dogs.

3280
03:14:36.561 --> 03:14:38.810
They're already fully trained, but you can pet them.

3281
03:14:38.960 --> 03:14:40.940
They're fucking really friendly up doing.

3282
03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:44.080
Meanwhile they're really well taken care of and they're trained right.

3283
03:14:44.330 --> 03:14:47.000
They're worked out well. So his dog, that's big for those dogs.

3284
03:14:47.001 --> 03:14:48.620
They have to exercise. What do you will have?

3285
03:14:48.650 --> 03:14:52.730
One of his dogs was there with me and it was fully trained and the gardeners

3286
03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:54.590
that he had never seen. We're just there.

3287
03:14:54.860 --> 03:14:57.950
And the dog didn't bark a go after him and all. And I went, but the dogs,

3288
03:14:58.090 --> 03:15:00.530
those guys didn't even know those guys and my, and he goes,

3289
03:15:00.531 --> 03:15:03.560
why they're not acting in a threatening way because just haven't deployed them

3290
03:15:03.561 --> 03:15:05.540
on them. I'm gonna go get some tea. Do you do,

3291
03:15:05.541 --> 03:15:09.730
I don't know if you remember a sketch that got rejected by the man show that's

3292
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:12.380
got super pets that we wrote that it was about,

3293
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:15.530
it was about like if your sister, you're suspecting that your,

3294
03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:17.540
your kids are doing drugs.

3295
03:15:17.540 --> 03:15:21.350
Like you get a family pet but it's actually a uh,

3296
03:15:22.130 --> 03:15:24.950
drug sniffing dog that you bring into your family.

3297
03:15:25.340 --> 03:15:28.310
And like the commercial was like, you have to like,

3298
03:15:28.311 --> 03:15:29.510
your kids think you have like this,

3299
03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:33.050
you brought home a dog but it's a drug sniff in college. And if you,

3300
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:36.740
if you're doing drugs like the background with like the doll just tearing apart

3301
03:15:36.741 --> 03:15:40.940
your kids and you're all happy because it found the drugs that's super pets.

3302
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:43.660
I liked that. Rejected it, got rejected. Whatever.

3303
03:15:44.020 --> 03:15:46.080
The ones that we would never be able to do today,

3304
03:15:46.170 --> 03:15:48.920
but we couldn't even do it back then. That's first Asian NASCAR.

3305
03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:54.330
Bobby Lee as a car driver just constantly crashing into walls.

3306
03:15:54.390 --> 03:15:58.510
He's a superstar. Cars get NASCAR, drivers lying into the Christian NASCAR,

3307
03:15:58.760 --> 03:16:02.380
he would keep crashing and everyone loves the crafts. Racist

3308
03:16:04.050 --> 03:16:06.810
Asian NASCAR. How about sac fighting?

3309
03:16:06.900 --> 03:16:10.560
Ultimate Stack fighting championship that got green lit and then got cut off

3310
03:16:10.561 --> 03:16:13.800
halfway. It was all about kicking people in the balls.

3311
03:16:13.801 --> 03:16:18.120
Like that's the balls were exposed out of your body and when the balls are in

3312
03:16:18.121 --> 03:16:21.930
play, what? What was the balls are in play? The game changes.

3313
03:16:22.290 --> 03:16:26.190
So you gotta have like no shorts but you got to have an openness.

3314
03:16:26.380 --> 03:16:30.810
Your ball stung up. Yeah. Target. If the balls are in play,

3315
03:16:31.370 --> 03:16:35.670
like you don't keep your hands up, you keep your hands down, you want the god,

3316
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:39.370
you in the face. You want to protect your balls. So it was,

3317
03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:43.080
we had this whole sketch where like, it's called extreme sack fighting.

3318
03:16:43.081 --> 03:16:47.640
Joey Diaz was going to be the master because he had the biggest stack and like,

3319
03:16:47.700 --> 03:16:50.670
you know, Joey Diaz, his balls would hang down low and he was like,

3320
03:16:50.820 --> 03:16:55.030
he was the guy like the big boss at the end of a video game. How would,

3321
03:16:56.140 --> 03:16:59.800
how would fight him change in the UFC if you didn't wear a cup and,

3322
03:16:59.850 --> 03:17:04.290
and you could kick in the balls fighting. That's what we did actually.

3323
03:17:04.291 --> 03:17:07.490
They did pride. Right. Baseball. You, you'll see one.

3324
03:17:07.650 --> 03:17:08.960
You'll see two though and be like,

3325
03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.450
remember when big daddy Goodrich grabbed the Pedro's Dick and balls? No.

3326
03:17:12.451 --> 03:17:16.850
Crushed him. No. [inaudible] controlling the guys. There was a scene,

3327
03:17:17.010 --> 03:17:17.731
there were no dairy.

3328
03:17:17.731 --> 03:17:22.350
Goodrich grabbed his dick and balls and was crow inside his handful. Yeah.

3329
03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:23.700
Crushing about the scene.

3330
03:17:23.700 --> 03:17:26.940
I've got a scene where a guy in between rounds and it's,

3331
03:17:27.390 --> 03:17:30.810
Paul's are all all like popping out and their cut and there's dudes like,

3332
03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:35.790
uh, and swell on your palsy. Like just code them.

3333
03:17:36.030 --> 03:17:39.500
Just cut 'em and get Paul's and everyone's trying to do balls

3334
03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:44.460
like rocky. We're cutting Mickey cooking when fucked by the way.

3335
03:17:44.461 --> 03:17:46.710
No one's ever done. No one's ever cut anybody.

3336
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:49.710
That was a dumb scene and rocky cut me blossom though.

3337
03:17:49.770 --> 03:17:54.430
Like why are we cutting for my son, for my son? I sat him down.

3338
03:17:54.460 --> 03:17:57.780
We went through rocky one, two, three,

3339
03:17:58.150 --> 03:18:02.040
four all dig in like two weeks movies. You got to go back and like, dude,

3340
03:18:02.041 --> 03:18:06.060
those movies were fucking great. Great Dude.

3341
03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:10.470
Those are fucking two great movies. Are you kidding? Rocky five,

3342
03:18:10.471 --> 03:18:14.700
forget about that. But rocky one, two, three and four. Are you kidding? One,

3343
03:18:14.701 --> 03:18:18.270
two, amazing movies. Amazing Dude.

3344
03:18:18.271 --> 03:18:20.880
You went through like real shit. Like rocky won.

3345
03:18:20.881 --> 03:18:25.350
He's like the broke doodoo almost one and then rocky two he's like,

3346
03:18:25.351 --> 03:18:28.510
he's got money, but then he runs out of money. She goes, man.

3347
03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:30.690
Then he has to fight. He has the take the rematch.

3348
03:18:30.780 --> 03:18:34.560
So he takes the remap now hockey three he has all this money and he's huge.

3349
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:35.760
And then clubber Lang,

3350
03:18:35.761 --> 03:18:39.810
the young guy comes through and he's all hungry and then he gets fucked up.

3351
03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:40.201
Dude.

3352
03:18:40.201 --> 03:18:45.201
Rocky three fucked me up because clubber Lang beat him like at like at an

3353
03:18:46.190 --> 03:18:47.900
[inaudible] or two or three, three an

3354
03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.570
<v 4>hour and 15 minutes.</v>

3355
03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:53.290
Clubber Lang beats rocky and that you kind of thinking like what?

3356
03:18:53.291 --> 03:18:57.520
How does rocky lose? Like what's going on? What happened? And then you realize,

3357
03:18:57.550 --> 03:19:00.910
oh shit, they're going to do a rematch in the same movie.

3358
03:19:01.270 --> 03:19:04.990
They're gonna do a rematch in the moon because they did it so that if you didn't

3359
03:19:04.991 --> 03:19:08.170
think that was going to be a rematch, you're like, rocky loses.

3360
03:19:08.230 --> 03:19:12.920
The Russian is too. No for Russians, for me to go back. Tommy Marcy,

3361
03:19:13.140 --> 03:19:17.440
you're confused if you're two as you talked about it. Oh listen,

3362
03:19:17.660 --> 03:19:21.490
you gotta go back with your kids and watch rock and rock. Two, three and four.

3363
03:19:22.450 --> 03:19:26.400
[inaudible] trust. Fuck, I'm fire with fire. My son must go deep.

3364
03:19:26.720 --> 03:19:30.730
If my son was so creeping in with Adrian goes, when Adrian goes to rocky,

3365
03:19:30.970 --> 03:19:35.230
when he was going to fight cleverly, she goes, you can't win rocky.

3366
03:19:35.680 --> 03:19:37.770
And I thought, oh my God, my son's going to be like,

3367
03:19:38.110 --> 03:19:41.140
cause he was all about rocky was suck. Like he was like,

3368
03:19:41.141 --> 03:19:42.790
dad is rocky going to win his rock?

3369
03:19:42.791 --> 03:19:47.791
He wants to know though the results now you gotta tell me he's rocky gonna win

3370
03:19:48.930 --> 03:19:51.460
now. And then when you heard there's, you can't win rocky.

3371
03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:54.280
I looked at my son and I thought he was gonna be depressed.

3372
03:19:54.820 --> 03:19:59.640
He started fucking laughing hysterically. He's like,

3373
03:20:01.410 --> 03:20:06.010
well what's going on here? I thought I thought he was like so into rocky,

3374
03:20:06.011 --> 03:20:09.380
but he was laughing at Adrian saying you can't win Ron.

3375
03:20:09.550 --> 03:20:13.630
Cause he knew that rocky could win. I don't know. It was just so weird.

3376
03:20:13.631 --> 03:20:16.300
He just started laughing and I thought well what is going on?

3377
03:20:16.301 --> 03:20:20.080
