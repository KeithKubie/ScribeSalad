00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.663
- [Instructor] Lea has nine roly-polies.

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:04.875
Let's write that down.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.375
Lea has nine roly-polies in her bug house.

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.274
She has one more than Dingane,

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.037
is I think how I would say that name.

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:20.408
How many roly-polies does Dingane have?

00:00:20.408 --> 00:00:22.070
Dingane have.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.427
So that's what we need to figure out.

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:25.636
So we need to figure
out how many roly-polies

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.136
does Dingane have.

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:31.823
So this right over here
is our question mark.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.271
Now it's always good.

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.288
When you look at a word
problem like this you say,

00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:38.903
okay will Dingane have
more or less than Lea?

00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:43.033
Well it says she, Lea,
has one more than Dingane.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.349
So Lea is going to have more,

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:46.578
and how much more?

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:50.507
One more, so Dingane is going
to have one less than Lea.

00:00:50.507 --> 00:00:54.674
If Lea has one more, then
Dingane has one less than Lea.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.448
So how do we write one less?

00:00:57.448 --> 00:01:00.785
Well we could just subtract one.

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:05.200
So this right over here,
this is one less, one less.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.329
This is saying that Dingane
has one less than Lea.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.217
So how much does Dingane have?

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:14.025
Well he's going to have eight roly-polies.

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:16.357
Eighth roly-polies.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:17.945
Now another way you could have done it,

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.658
you could have drawn Lea's roly-polies.

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:21.491
One, two, three, four,

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.062
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:28.027
and that would have been them rolled up,

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:30.161
and you said okay that's
one more than Dingane.

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.850
So Dingane has one less than this.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.284
So one less than this.

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:36.169
You just take away one of these

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.836
and you're left with

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:42.951
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven eight.

00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.207
You're left with these right over there.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:47.824
Let's do one more of these, woops.

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:51.036
All right, let's do one more.

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:54.667
So they tell us the mass of a small box

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.483
is seven grams less than the large box.

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.287
The mass of the small box is six grams.

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:03.537
So let's write that.

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:05.571
They tell us the small box,

00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.738
small box, it has a mass of six grams.

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:15.023
And we need to figure out what is the mass

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:16.440
of the large box.

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:19.117
Large box.

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:23.224
This is what we need to figure out.

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:25.179
So this is a question mark.

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.154
Now like we did in the last problem,

00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:30.422
is a large box gonna have a
larger mass or a smaller mass?

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:31.956
And we shouldn't just look
at the names of the box,

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:33.462
we should look at what they tell us.

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:35.746
They tell us that the
mass of the small box

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:38.996
is seven grams less than the large box.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:44.023
So this, the small box
is seven grams less than

00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:45.445
the large box.

00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:47.809
And that's another way of
saying that the large box

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.942
is seven grams more than the small box.

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:53.100
So another way to say seven grams more,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.640
the small box is six
grams plus seven grams.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.206
That's seven grams more.

00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:01.288
That's going to equal the
mass of the large box.

00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:03.626
So what's the mass of the large box?

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.793
Well six plus seven is 13.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:10.393
Six plus seven is 13, and we're done.
