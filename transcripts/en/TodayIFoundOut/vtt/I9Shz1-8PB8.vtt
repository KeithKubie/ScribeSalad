00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.350
We British are often stereotyped as being
prudish and stoically reserved in all aspects

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.350
of intimacy.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.930
As such, it may surprise non-natives to learn
that for over four decades, one of the most

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.681
popular newspapers in the entire country had
a large picture of a topless woman on the

00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.710
third page for no other reason than that she
was an attractive lady showing off her wobbly

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.710
bits.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.210
The idea of supplementing a newspaper’s
editorial content with pictures of women in

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.250
various states of undress came about after
Rupert Murdoch acquired and relaunched The

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.250
Sun in 1969.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.120
Prior to Murdoch’s acquisition, the paper
was a broadsheet aimed at, according to its

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.150
original founder, the “sophisticated and
superior middle class”.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.540
When the paper failed, Murdoch bought it for
£800,000 (about £11 million today) and re-branded

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.409
it as “a straightforward, honest newspaper”.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.360
The Sun quickly established a foothold in
the editorial landscape thanks to the oversight

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.000
of editor Sir Albert “Larry” Lamb, who
adopted the nickname “Larry” in homage

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.670
to Larry the Lamb of Children’s Hour.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.350
Under Lamb’s leadership, the paper began
pushing sensationalist headlines and stories-

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.600
yes, BuzzFeed-esk journalism existed long
before the internet.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
For example, literally the first headline
that November 17, 1969 edition of the paper

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.160
ever ran under Murdoch’s ownership was “HORSE
DOPE SENSATION”.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.860
We can only assume they didn’t precede those
words with “YOU WON’T BELIEVE THIS…”

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.390
due to space limitations.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.130
Beyond the click-bait-like headlines, Lamb
maintained that sex should be a primary component

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.560
of the paper’s content, reasoning that,
next to TV, it was probably the most important

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.690
aspect of his readers’ lives, so the most
likely to sell more papers.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.370
Towards this end, Lamb saw to it that a picture
of that month’s Penthouse Pet, Ulla Lindstrom,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.890
wearing a half unbuttoned blouse was included
in that first edition for no particular news-related

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.890
reason.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.761
Elsewhere, they also included a full spread
picture of a nude blonde woman lying at the

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:19.920
feet of the Rolling Stones.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.950
Over the coming months, the paper continued
to periodically feature images of scantily

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.069
clad women on its third page.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.069
In a time before this sort of thing was available
to everyone at a click of a button, as you

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.570
might expect, this greatly increasing readership
amongst males.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.080
In fact, just one month after Lamb took over
The Sun, readership had risen from 850,000

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.640
to 1.26 million.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.180
After one year, it had grown to two million.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.760
Not stopping with scantily clad women, Lamb
decided to up the ante, with the first topless

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330
“Page 3 girl” coming on its first anniversary.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.090
This went on to be one of its most popular
issues up to that point.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.110
Doubling down on this success, The Sun began
to feature more and more half naked women

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.750
culminating in it becoming a daily feature
by the mid-1970s.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.860
This inexplicably coincided with The Sun becoming
the most popular paper in the whole of the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.470
UK, with daily sales swelling to four million
by 1978.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.420
The success of the paper and their Page 3
feature was such that many other papers in

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.150
the UK, such as the Daily Mirror and the Daily
Star, followed suit.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.020
While the latter still maintains the tradition
of including lady bits for no particularly

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.730
newsworthy reason, the Daily Mirror quashed
the practice in the 1980s citing that it was,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.730
to quote, “demeaning to women”.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.790
(Aside: when the Daily Mirror is taking the
moral high ground over you, you know you might

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.010
want to take a moment to reevaluate your decision
making paradigm.)

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.930
Despite the questionable nature of some of
his paper’s antics, in 1980, Prime Minister

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.800
Margaret Thatcher managed to obtain a knighthood
for Larry Lamb for his “services to journalism”.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.510
It should probably be noted that in the election
of 1979, despite not being “a Conservative

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.050
newspaper” the paper strongly supported
the Conservatives, such as in their feature

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.930
“A Message to Labour supporters” where
they stated, “Vote Tory this time: it’s

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.310
the only way to stop the rot…”

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.440
The Conservatives subsequently managed to
win a majority in the House of Commons and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.380
Thatcher was made Prime Minister.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.410
Within a year, Larry Lamb became Sir Larry.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.280
Back to the Page 3 feature- according to Lamb,
his intention was to use it to showcase “nice

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.569
girls”, and that he wanted it to be “breezy,
not sleazy”, further quoted as saying that

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.630
“big-breasted girls look like tarts”,
so should not be featured.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.550
For anyone unfamiliar with British vernacular,
“tart” can be understood to have a similar

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.810
meaning to the modern definition of the word
“slut”.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.990
That said, anyone who’s taken a look at
the archives for Page 3 girls- which I did

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.400
a deep dive on in order to satisfy the extremely
thorough research requirements the editor

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.169
here at TodayIFoundOut mandates for all articles…-
can see, this “no big-breasted girls”

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.229
rule wasn’t followed very closely.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.770
Either that or Sir Lamb and I have very different
definitions of what constitutes “big breasted”…

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.770
(Incidentally, “slut” used to have an
entirely more innocent definition just a few

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.770
hundred years ago, see: Why Women are Sometimes
Called “Broads”, “Sluts”, and “Dames”).

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.069
In any event, despite the success of his paper,
partially because of Page 3, in his later

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.830
life, Lamb would come to regret introducing
the feature at all.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.470
He also lamented the blatant sexism in the
workplace that was so common in his heyday,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.120
once snapping at his journalists,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.599
Cut out nudges, winks and leers.

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.919
Always have second thoughts on stories about
the jockstrap world of men only.

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.910
Remember, women not only smell better; they
work harder and deserve better.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.080
He also gave the female editor of the topless
section, Joyce Hopkirk, veto control over

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.119
what content was published there.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:34.719
But to the surprise of no-one, the feature
has proven to be contentious with the public

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.270
right from the start.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.430
This is something The Sun was grateful for
in its early days, as it worked like free

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.300
advertising when other newspapers would feature
articles bashing The Sun for their pictures

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.490
of topless women.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.599
As Lamb noted:

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.100
The more the critics jump up and down, the
more popular the feature became.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.370
And, indeed, it’s telling that a paper best
known for including topless women on its third

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.050
page abruptly rose from nearly going out of
business to the best selling newspaper the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.469
UK for four decades straight after introducing
that feature.

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.000
To add further controversy to the whole thing,
the topless women shown for no other reason

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.539
than to be eye-candy were occasionally only
16 years old, such as editions featuring Maria

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.400
Whittaker (in 1985) and Samantha Fox (in 1983).

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.289
(And if you’re curious, see: How was it
Decided What Age Makes You an Adult?)

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.380
Though often criticised, the feature had and
still has steadfast defenders who argue that

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.309
sex, nudity and cheeky double entendres are
nothing to get worked up about and are even

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.960
to a certain extent hallmarks of British culture.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.099
To be fair, there is truth to this, but opponents
note that it’s difficult to ignore that

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:41.289
the photo is there for no news related reason,
with the contention being that in this context

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.460
it objectifies women.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.470
Despite this, The Sun has traditionally remained
staunchly defensive of their Page 3 exploits

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.900
and pushed back against every attempt to remove
or otherwise censor it, even going as far

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.159
as publicly labelling female members of parliament
“fat and jealous” when certain MPs criticised

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.039
it in 2004…

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.419
When Rebekah Brooks took over as head editor
of The Sun in 2003, most thought the Page

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.840
3 feature would finally go the way of the
dodo, as Brooks had previously argued that

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.020
it hurt readership numbers in modern times
and thus should be removed.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.819
But after taking the reins, she changed her
tune and began championing it, even writing

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.240
an editorial explaining why there was nothing
wrong with Page 3, including rightly noting

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.849
that the models featured were, “intelligent,
vibrant young women who appear in The Sun

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:29.439
out of choice and because they enjoy the job.”

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:34.090
(On this note, being featured on The Sun’s
Page 3 did indeed help launch many a young

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.379
woman’s successful career in modeling.)

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:41.380
However, cracks began to emerge as early as
1994, when Rupert Murdoch himself noted that

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.499
the feature “just would not be accepted”
in any other paper that he owned.

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:50.740
In a 2014 interview, Murdoch mentioned that
the paper might replace the topless photos

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.099
with more conservative glamour shots of models;
he also openly noted in that interview that

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:58.139
the feature was “old fashioned”.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.899
Murdoch’s comments were praised by activists
for the “No More Page 3” campaign.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.249
This was started in 2012 after actress Lucy-Anne
Holmes noticed that, despite the successes

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:13.909
of British female athletes at the 2012 Olympics,
the largest picture of a woman in any paper

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:16.880
in Britain was on The Sun’s Page 3.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.349
At its peak, the No More Page 3 campaign was
reportedly backed by 138 British MPs as well

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:26.809
as “the Girl Guides, the Girls’ Brigade,
most of the teaching trades unions, the College

00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:30.599
of Midwives, the Scottish parliament and the
Welsh Assembly”.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:36.099
This is in addition to the dozens of universities
who refused to stock the paper until the feature

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.099
was ended.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.560
Unlike unsuccessful campaigns against Page
3, which generally sought to introduce legislation

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.750
to stop it, “No More Page 3” took a different
tact of just requesting the paper voluntarily

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.980
shelve the feature.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.589
The problem with the former approach had been
that while many MPs didn’t like the feature,

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:57.590
most were staunchly against legally banning
it due to the censorship precedent this would

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.590
set.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.670
As then Prime Minister David Cameron noted,
“…on this one I think it is probably better

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.730
to leave it to the consumer…”

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.750
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg concurred,
stating, “If you don’t like it, don’t

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.830
buy it … you don’t want to have a moral
policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.550
what they can and cannot see…”

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.270
Thanks to the No More Page 3 campaign and
some surveys it spurred which indicated that

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:24.270
although 48% of men had no problem with the
feature, a whopping 80% of women did, the

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.440
paper began taking steps to partially phase
it out.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.580
The change started with The Sun’s Irish
edition, which stopped publishing pictures

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:38.190
of topless women in 2013, replacing them with
more conservative, “tasteful” images of

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.450
scantily clad women…

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.370
In 2015, the British edition followed suit,
opting to relegate these topless photos to

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.270
the web edition of the paper.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.140
However, some still feel the editors at The
Sun are missing the point of the “No More

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.480
Page 3” campaign completely.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.010
The general complaint now put forth is that
the problem was never the fact that they were

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.650
showing women’s nipples, but that the picture
existed in a “news”paper for no newsworthy

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.650
reason at all.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.740
As journalist Lucy Johnston of The Independent
noted,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.400
The space will still feature a picture of
a woman; the only difference is that now she

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.660
will be allowed to wear a bra, which sends
the slightly strange message that it was the

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.540
model’s nipples that were the problem.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.830
Thus, the saga continues.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.470
And not only for this, but also because while
today the newspaper that was once widely praised

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.940
for “liberating the nipple” and somewhat
less widely for “taking the rudeness out

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:27.050
of nudeness” has ended the topless “tradition”
they started nearly a half a century ago,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:12:01.350
many other British tabloids still maintain
it.
