00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:03.295
- [Instructor] Shantanu bought
more apples than bananas

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:06.458
and he bought more
bananas than cantaloupes.

00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:09.603
Let A represent the number
of apples Shantanu bought,

00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:11.635
let B represent the number of bananas,

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.353
and let C represent the
number of cantaloupes.

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:18.774
Let's compare the
expressions B plus C and A.

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:20.791
Which statement is correct?

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.078
So is B plus C greater than A?

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:24.331
Is it less than A?

00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.225
Or are these two quantities equal?

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.612
Or is there not enough
information to tell?

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.755
So like always, pause this video

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.403
and see if you can work
through it on your own

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:35.537
and now I will work through it with you.

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:37.416
All right, so let's just
write down the information

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:38.467
that they gave us.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.470
They say let A represent the number,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.791
well that's more straightforward,

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.229
A for apple, B for
banana, C for cantaloupe.

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.494
Here we have more apples than bananas,

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:49.411
so A is greater than B,

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:54.349
and then they also tell
us he bought more bananas

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:57.766
than cantaloupes, so B is greater than C,

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.671
or we could rewrite that as

00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.754
A is greater than B is greater than C

00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:10.884
or we could write that as C
is less than B is less than A.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.991
This is essentially the
information that they give us.

00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.510
So let's see, which of
these is going to be true?

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.510
B plus C greater than A,

00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:25.866
B plus C greater than A,

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.616
B plus C less than A.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:33.358
So one thing that we can
try is let's try to plug in

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:35.519
some values, some numbers

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.173
to see if we can get combinations

00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:39.261
that are consistently
in one of these buckets

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:41.114
or if they fall into
multiple of these choices,

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:43.596
then we say hey there's not
enough information to tell.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:46.126
In general, this is a good
strategy for things like this

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:49.009
where we're dealing with
very abstract quantities.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.795
So let's make a little table here.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:52.628
So A, B, C

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:58.817
and then I can also figure
out what B plus C is.

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.005
So this is going to be A, B, C,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.739
and this is B plus C and
we can compare that to A.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.506
So let's see a situation where

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:11.589
let's see if we can make
B plus C greater than A.

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:15.756
So they both have to be less than A.

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.923
So let's see, if C is five

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.650
and B is six

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:28.390
and let's make A seven.

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:34.956
So in this situation, B plus
C is going to be equal to 11.

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:37.024
So we're able to find a situation

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.934
where if B plus C are close enough to A,

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:41.922
that B plus C is going
to be greater than A.

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.650
So we're able to find this scenario.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.196
Let's see if we can figure out a scenario

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.696
where B plus C is less than A.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:50.947
Well if,

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:56.050
well we could do the
same B plus C, six, five.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.379
We could make A bigger than six plus five.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.796
We can make A 12.

00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:02.181
And now this is a situation,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:06.433
so this first situation we have
B plus C is greater than A.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.023
The second situation right over here,

00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:10.690
you have B plus C is less than A

00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:14.666
and so depending on what
your A, B, and C's are

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.200
that meet these constraints and notice,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.388
both of these situations
I meet all the constraints

00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:20.917
where A is greater than
B is greater than C,

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.365
but it could be either one of these.

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:23.877
So that immediately tells us

00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:27.627
that there is not enough
information to tell.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.757
Now, one thing that we,

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:34.341
yeah there's just not
enough information to tell.

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.217
I can even come up with a scenario

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:37.998
where B plus C is equal to A.

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:40.165
If it's six, five, and 11.

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:43.827
Then B plus C is equal to A.

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:46.669
So based on the information they gave us,

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.831
any of these are actually possible.

00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:51.917
So there's not enough information to tell.
