00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey guys welcome back to the workshop! Today,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
We're going to try to make our own version of a simple experiment you may have seen before

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.380
This little device here lets you connect to soda bottles together two make a tornado tube. To make it work,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000
You simply fill one soda bottle two-thirds full of water,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.720
Attach the tornado tube device and then screw the other soda bottle into the top of it

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.680
You can see that there are threads that hold the device onto the soda bottle

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.140
And then a small smooth hole down through the center so to make this device work the way we want to we're going to flip

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.160
It upside down and quickly shake it in a circular motion. Watch what happens!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.920
Now, as you can see, we've got this cool water vortex forming in the upper chamber

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.860
So what happens is as the water swirls around it's able to drain just on the edges of the hole in the connector while the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.440
Center of the hole has air flowing up through it into the bottle on the top.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.780
Because air is able to flow into the top bottle as the water drains into the lower bottle, the pressure

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.620
Between them stays equal, and the water is able to flow smoothly. Now we see how this version works,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.160
let's try to build our own! All of the equipment that we're gonna need today is two clear 2 liter soda bottles, a 1 inch

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.060
PVC coupling, and a glue gun

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.220
Now our 1 inch PVC coupling fits over our cap with just a little bit of room to spare. To secure it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.760
I'm gonna take some hot glue and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.680
spread that all the way around the sides of this cap which has some ridges on it to help with grip and I'm hoping that'll

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.520
Also help it stick to our PVC a little bit better. To ensure we have a good grip on the PVC itself,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.260
I'm just gonna take a little bit of sandpaper and rough up the inside

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.540
I'm trying to apply the glue fairly quickly so that it doesn't cool down,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.820
before I can then fit our coupling over the cap and you can see that the coupling has a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.360
Middle stripe going around the middle and we want that to end sort of right at the same level as the soda bottle cap

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020
With our coupling attached to the first cap, now

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.700
We'll take the glue gun go around the edge to ensure good connection and then keep adding glue covering the entire cap. That way

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.660
We'll have just a small pool of hot glue a couple of millimeters thick

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.200
As soon as we have our hot glue pool down inside our coupling

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.160
We'll take our other soda bottle with the cap attached flip it upside down and press the cap down into the hot glue

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.140
There's a pretty good amount of hot glue in the coupling there

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.880
So we're gonna give that just a couple minutes to cool down once it has will try and disconnect both bottles from their caps

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
inside the connector

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080
There we go!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.040
First bottle comes off pretty nicely

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.560
You can actually see that when I press the bottle down into the puddle of hot glue some of it oozed up

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600
past the cap that's what we want. It means

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.300
There's glue surrounding the sides of the cap and should give it a really nice connection

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.280
So now we have our two caps inside our PVC coupling pressed against each other being held together with a bunch of hot glue

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.400
Now what we need to do is drill a hole to let the water drain from one bottle into the other. To drill the hole,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.480
I'm using a 3/8 inch drill bit

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.060
Alright we now have our tornado tube connector device

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.400
That should be working, so let's attach it to both bottles and see if we can get that nice vortex. We were looking at

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.700
Stand it up straight

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.620
There we go! We have our tornado in a bottle... or I guess it's in water not air so that's a maelstrom, not a tornado

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.460
There you go how to build a working tornado tube connector in just a few minutes with some very basic parts

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.840
There are a couple things

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.700
I want to try to make this look just a little bit cooler though as

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.480
The water is spinning down from one bottle into the other you can see the vortex in the center now looks really cool

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.800
But I want to try something that lets you really see the water swirling around itself

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.640
So I'm going to add just a little bit of glitter to our water and see what that does

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.420
Alright, I'm gonna try and pour some glitter into our bottle without it getting everywhere because I don't really want a glitter covered workshop

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.280
It's all over my gloves already! It's spreading. The workshop is going to be glittery forever!

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.680
Let's start by just shaking this up a little bit to get the glitter to mix into the water

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.980
There we go

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.700
Weirdly still it's floating quite a bit on the top. All right, I'm gonna try flipping it and swirling it around

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.510
There you go, there's your tornado!

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.960
And you can definitely see it swirling around a lot more. Glitter does do a good job of catching the light

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.620
I guess that's kind of the whole point of glitter. This is interesting, if you look down at the bottom

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.700
How much of the glitter doesn't want to mix into the water and just sort of stays on the surface?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500
All right, let's try that again!

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.320
As soon as the vortex forms for a second all of the surface glitter gets pulled down into it you have this really glittery

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.780
Vortex and then it clears out, and then you just have water with glitter in it swirling around and it

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.660
settles in a layer there

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.120
Wide vortex and just pulls the surface glitter down. It's like stuck to the sides of it and, Ha! It's really cool!

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.320
It's funny it's not it's not dropping. It's like on the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.860
the water side of

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.940
The vortex not the bubble side of the vortex so some of it's just stuck there. That's an interesting effect

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.310
All right that works pretty cool

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.080
Let's move on to our next filler

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.560
Our we've emptied out most of the glitter and now we're going to try filling one of our bottles about 2/3 full of tonic water

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.420
Tonic water is a sweetened beverage that contains quinine

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.220
And we'll see the advantage of something with quinine in just a second. All right, We've got our tonic water

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.180
There's our connector. T

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.940
That's already ending up in our tonic water, but that's all right

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.240
There we go the bubbles are doing a fairly nice job similar to the glitter that lets you see it spinning around,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.840
But that's not the real advantage of using tonic water now the reason we're trying using tonic water is that quinine

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.500
Glows in a blacklight, so I have here a little blacklight check this out

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.660
Just lights it up bright blue

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.260
kinda cool, you can see the path that the light is taking through the bottle. Alright, and I also happen to have a

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.460
Larger blacklight here. Wow you can already see how much that's lighting it up

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.660
So let's get this tornado going and I'll put the large black light up against it

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.720
And we'll have this just glowing blue tornado! here goes

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.820
Ha! Look at that

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.320
Beautiful glowing Maelstrom

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.220
Looks like we found some liquid from the movie avatar and put it in the bottle

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.240
There we go we filled it with quinine and put a black light next to it and got a really cool

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.920
Blue glowing effect now fill the bottle back up with regular water, and I'm going to be adding some glow-in-the-dark

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.920
Craft paint this is an acrylic based paint which should dilute nicely into the water when I shake it up

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.040
So I'm going to pour this in and I'm gonna see if we can get this to glow in the dark

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
That looks like a good amount

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.520
That looks pretty well mixed, let's give just a little bit more to make sure

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.140
I'm gonna try and squeeze the foam out and pour that off into the sink. I don't want bubbles

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.210
Now it's great

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.880
All right, just a quick test

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.700
I'm gonna be using a blacklight to see the result blacklight is really good at charging glow-in-the-dark stuff very quickly

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.900
Oh, Beautiful look at that

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.200
Let's get some swirling action and then just

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.740
Ha! That looks really cool

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.480
Just lights up and makes

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.330
Individual tiny tiny little paint particles glow and those get caught up in the swirl of the water

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:17.020
And they're so small they don't hold much of a glowing charge for long, but it's still pretty cool. All right

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.840
Let's try getting a whole whirl pool here. Now of course the paint has made the liquid a bit more opaque

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.020
So you can't really see the whirlpool itself, but now when we light up part of it with our blacklight

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.640
It starts swirling around really cool

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.080
When I hold it right here

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.120
You can watch the glowing paint run down the side of the bottle and mix with the rest of the paint

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.020
Let's try with the big black light see what happens

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.380
Get some charge see if we get all of it glowing before we start our tornado

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.700
This black light is about hmm a million times more powerful. All right! Let's flip this

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.020
That looks pretty cool

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.680
This glowing up here runs down. It's not glowing too much on the sidewalls

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.040
I bet I can make it glow more on the sides

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.340
That looks so cool as it drips down into the bottle. It's just

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.060
like liquid light pouring down

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.520
There you go how to build your very own vortex funnel device for just a couple of dollars

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.120
And it only takes a few minutes

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.960
I hope you've also liked the look of the glitter, the tonic water, and the glow-in-the-dark paint

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.840
to give your swirling vortex a couple of different looks

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.120
Thanks guys for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then!

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.700
Extra-fine meaning it gets everywhere even more and is even harder to get rid of

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.700
Aww, I was doing so well! ): ... A couple drops spilled nothing too bad

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.740
