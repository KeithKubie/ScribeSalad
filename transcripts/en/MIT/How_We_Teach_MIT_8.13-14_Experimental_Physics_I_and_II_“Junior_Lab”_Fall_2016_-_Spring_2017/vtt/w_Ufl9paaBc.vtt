CHRISTINA WANG: For
people who are considering

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.460
taking junior lab, I think
some people are scared or don't

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.520
want to take it
if they want to be

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.260
like a theoretical physicist.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.580
But I think even though you want
to be a theorist in the future,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.600
it's still helpful to know
about the experimental side

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.190
and learn about how to do
experiments and how it works.
