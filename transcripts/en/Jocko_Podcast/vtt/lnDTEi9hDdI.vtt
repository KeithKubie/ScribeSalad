00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.770
How do you handle it when someone up the chain of command beat trees trust,

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.210
like what is this like lying they lie to you or this could be, this is a huge,

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.160
this is a huge spectrum of things I guess. Yeah. So for,

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.050
for number one you just learned, right?

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.250
You just learned something about someone's character. Yeah.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.390
You now kind of know better what you're dealing with. Now,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.360
if this is a major situation,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
you might have to immediately confronted and or go above them and the chain of

9
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.320
command, I mean, if there's lives at risk,

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.620
if there's something morally wrong that is happening,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.550
if there's something he illegal that's happening that now you're going to get

12
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.280
wrapped into, and that's another decision you gotta make.

13
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.330
If you're not going to be wrapped into it,

14
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.230
then it's a decision you've got to make.

15
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.600
If you want to ruin this person's life or whatever, that's,

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.610
that's a different decision. That's not this question.

17
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.930
We'd have to deal with that in a separate question. Hmm.

18
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.500
Are innocent people being hurt? So if, if it's something like that,

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.500
lives at risk, you know, something morally wrong is happening,

20
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.950
something illegal is happening, innocent people being hurt,

21
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.950
then you're probably going to have to say something or you're going to have to

22
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.510
say something. Now, I will tell you this before you say something,

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.070
make sure all your ducks in a row, make sure you have evidence.

24
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.580
Don't go off half cocked. Be Ready.

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.440
Because people that are deceitful like this, they, they, they prepare,

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.800
they are ready for battle, um,

27
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
to protect themselves and they don't care what happens to other people.

28
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.460
So you've got to watch out for that. Now if it's something really,

29
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.700
if it's something minor, you know, if it's something minor,

30
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.860
then that's something that you logged down and in the brain,

31
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.970
right? And something that you logged down in the brain. And,

32
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.263
<v 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.500
<v 0>but it allows you to see person's character. And that means, again,</v>

34
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.240
it's a minor infraction,

35
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.240
but it also means you got to watch yourself and you're gonna Watch them a little

36
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:03.100
bit more closely. [inaudible] you gotta be careful because people like that,

37
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.080
they think they're smarter than everyone else. Yeah.

38
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.060
The thing that they're getting away with lies.

39
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.880
So they think they're smarter than, there's like a little hint of sociopath.

40
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.080
Yeah. In there that they can get away with these lies.

41
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.680
And so you gotta watch them. You gotta watch them

42
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.310
carefully in, like I said, it Kinda goes back to that previous question

43
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.840
because you don't want to be a person that comes across as dishonest yourself.

44
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.110
And if people don't think they can trust what you're saying,

45
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.650
they're not going to trust you with other things. So if you know,

46
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:45.370
I'm not giving you good feedback because I'm too nice,

47
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.540
you're not going to start you. You're not going to respect my opinion anymore.

48
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.010
Right. So you know when you're,

49
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.560
when you're dealing with someone, if someone comes to you and said, again,

50
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.100
this is honesty versus dishonesty. If you come to me and say, Hey,

51
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.980
what do you think of this plan? I'm not going to say, Hey,

52
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:04.970
I think that's a stupid plan.

53
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.110
<v 0>I might say, I don't know if that's how I do it. I might try this approach.</v>

55
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.940
Right? You're just going to be diplomatic. If you,

56
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.910
if I'm not going to say to you,

57
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:16.830
and I don't think you're smart enough to figure this out,

58
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.090
I want to move you to a different division cause I don't think you're smart

59
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:24.060
enough to solve this problem. I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say,

60
00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:24.894
you know what?

61
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.360
I need you on this other project over here that I think you're going to be

62
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.460
really knocked this thing out of the park.

63
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.983
<v 1>Mm.</v>

64
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.190
<v 0>Now you're getting to know deep inside,</v>

65
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.103
<v 1>okay,</v>

66
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.400
<v 0>but it's called tact and that's what you have to use.</v>

67
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.070
But back to the honesty, or we person betrays your trust. You've learned,

68
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.390
you've learned about their character.

69
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.020
If it's a big thing you're going to have to talk about,

70
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.440
are going to have to tell somebody. Yeah. It's a little thing

71
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.100
you got to watch.
