00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 in this capsule we will be reducing the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.010
 concept of decision making process 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.370
 to the lion then in this part of the court 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.070
 we will firstly obviously define this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.289
 What is a decision process? 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.050
 come back this will get us to define the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.760
 notions of plans or policies as well 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.109
 than the value of a plan or a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 policy 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 we will see two algorithms value 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 creation is not also region for this 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 we're going to say we're going to solve them 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 decision process mark well 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.829
 that is, solving problems 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.590
 that can be modeled using a 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.180
 audi brand decision process then 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.739
 the decision process mark comes 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 will be useful in the context of a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.660
 agent youtu be based on remember 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 that a useful agent tibet is an agent 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 who can leave from Sancerre to capture 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.829
 information on its environment 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.960
 from that will try to put to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 day his estimate of the state of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.129
 the environment then given its 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.420
 knowledge about how the world 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.460
 evolves then what are the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.330
 consequences of his actions will try 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 to maximize internal utility in order to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.439
 determine which of the head action that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.830
 takes the rex that will trigger so a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.140
 some way of interacting so 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.960
 certain actions undertake on his 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 environment and with the processes of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 marco decision comes so these are some 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.090
 it's a mathematical tool for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.640
 model that kind of behavior this 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
 kind of environment there we want to take 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 actions is among other things that me 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.710
 allow to incorporate the fact that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.320
 maybe we do not know exactly 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 what will be the hurdles the effects of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.899
 our actions maybe we have to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.780
 uncertainty about the effect of 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.310
 our actions 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.290
 which will necessarily reduce a 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.030
 uncertainty about on the state of our 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.250
 environment maybe too much because 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.560
 that information capture through our 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.240
 censors in relation to our honor is going 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.780
 to be in fact the raw information and is 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 so at any time our our 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.340
 estimate of the state of the environment 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.740
 will have associated with her some 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.569
 uncertainty and so with the processes 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.459
 decision marco well we are able 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.800
 to handle that uncertainty there for 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.800
 take actions that are rational 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.110
 but an example of the kind of decisions 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.720
 that we would like to be able to model in a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 context where there is uncertainty but 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 I recognize the actions have been 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.480
 handsomely the action of al she is to 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.900
 doors and minutes before departure from 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.550
 the plane 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.459
 and here I want to know if action in 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.019
 question would arrive on time 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.480
 well there are several problems there are 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.450
 the uncertainty of the kind after eating a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.040
 observe partial ability of my 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.280
 environment ie the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.900
 road conditions 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.959
 it's basically a piece of information 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.450
 be partial to noise t2 real 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.860
 road conditions they go a little a 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.480
 certain delay between the moment 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.510
 I learn that traffic that is the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.500
 when there is indeed traffic 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.920
 so that's related to things like 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 gross censors and he also goes from 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.739
 the uncertainty in the facts of my 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.989
 actions so even though I'm driving well 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.730
 my car it may be that I have a 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.950
 puncture that there is a breakdown that have 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 nothing to see that my way driving but 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.410
 more about car wear by 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.180
 example laid bare and generally speaking 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.109
 is going to be a pretty complex environment 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280
 to model and with the processes of 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.060
 decision mark at the lion will do 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.920
 some assumptions that will simplify 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.590
 the simplified model our modeling 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.280
 of the environment that will allow us 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.630
 still to model it so 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.130
 satisfactory to take good 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.760
 decisions to solve problems 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.760
 interesting 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.950
 so maybe another example of 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.359
 problems a little more detail so 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.450
 imagine that we have a robot that 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.489
 represented by the little circle here and that 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.210
 the robot can move on a 20 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.710
 grill or cat 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.780
 squares like that corresponds to a 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.940
 possible position in the grid is 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.670
 long several pieces are listed 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.090
 here and my robot can take on everything 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.270
 moment four actions is winter is 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.030
 west south or north east 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.610
 the robot a goal ie to get 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.650
 make it here and that it's going to be presented 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:23.580
 that a utility function that represents 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.850
 the degree of desirability of the different 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.520
 four times when we bend gray +1 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.750
 for the state of a robot that lies 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.880
 in a box in this region 6.06 is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 found nowhere else except at 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.760
 some places like that that could 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.620
 correspond to boxes him and 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.810
 obstacles that we would like the robot 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:50.490
 is fast by someone would have a degree 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:52.350
 of negative desirability and the in this 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.270
 this case have taken magic that there is 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.970
 indeed uncertain effects to 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.430
 our actions to know that if I determine 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.190
 that I will go I want the robot 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.240
 arrives to the south maybe with 5 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.280
 taking away two parts I'm going 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.260
 actually move to the box in 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.030
 underneath but with a heart of 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.080
 probabilities I go below but 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.370
 left so south west or down 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.010
 go right or south 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.720
 is that so it would allow 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.090
 represent the fact that a real robot is 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.250
 still limited in his way of 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.860
 move to make some mistakes and 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.330
 so we'll see that this kind of notions 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.640
 we'll be able to incorporate it into a 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.960
 mark decision process comes back via 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.960
 probabilities
