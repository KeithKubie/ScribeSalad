00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
I've always been the type of lady
to go after what I want.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.020
Hey boy, you want, you want... I got you a present. You're a good looking boy, you want to come home with me?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.380
Can I be your mom?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.780
Look.. I.. if I were your mom I'd shower
you with gifts. Come on!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.900
Hey! Hey, come here.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.780
I was talking to a friend the other day.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.500
Who told me,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.380
Friend: I've been trying to send him signals,
but I just don't think he's picking up on them.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.840
Anna: Why don't you just ask him out?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.680
[Laughter]

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.420
Good one.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.340
Oh, you're serious...

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.760
Oh...

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.860
No, no I can't do that.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.760
Why?

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.160
Well, I mean...

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.540
Now I've always aggressively
chased the boys that I've liked.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.960
When I was a kid I would make it
abundantly clear if I liked-liked you.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.220
As an adult, my habits haven't really changed.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.080
That's a cute picture of me, huh?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.460
(It was when) I was a kid, yeah

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.240
Good looker

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.860
But I've been surprised to find

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.000
that a lot of my female friends
are very reluctant to ask guys out.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.920
When I ask them about it,
they have all kinds of excuses.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.460
I don't know.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.280
Guys love the chase.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.400
I'm not aggro like you, Anna.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.460
I don't think I could handle that kind of rejection.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.680
So ladies, I have three very good reasons
why you should ask the next guy out.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.440
One.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.440
What's the worst that could happen?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.240
He says no.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.280
So what?

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.020
Rejection's not the end of the world,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.480
and that kind of pressure is something that guys face

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.200
every single time they want to ask a woman out.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.800
Two.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.740
Time.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.260
I don't about you, but when I'm crushing
on someone, I waste so much time

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.160
fantasizing about what their butt looks like.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.440
Just ask them out.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.560
Get some answers.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.540
Get that butt.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.560
Three.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.080
Missed Opportunities.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.760
Look. Putting yourself out there

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.800
and putting your feelings out there

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.520
is very vulnerable and scary;

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.940
it's a hard thing to do.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.120
But some guys are maybe too shy to ever do that,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.500
so imagine all of the missed
loves that you never had

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.100
because you were both too afraid
to approach each other.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.100
Plus, think about how much easier this
would make the whole dating process.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
If you aren't asking people out,
you're basicly sitting around,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.180
waiting for someone to come find you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.920
You want to know how Brad and I started dating?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.100
I asked him out;

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.240
I hit him up on Facebook,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.440
and I said hey I think you're cute,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.900
and I'd like to take you out to dinner,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.340
and we ended up chatting
about his childhood ferrets till 4 a.m.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.120
But, I've also been rejected a lot
throughout the years by guys

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.860
who either didn't like how aggressive I was,
or didn't like me as person,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.140
or didn't find me attractive, or I don't know.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.660
They don't always tell me.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.600
So, who knows? Go out there lady friends.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.820
I implore you!

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.980
And the next time you see a cutie,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.980
hit him up.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.180
I'd like to ask you out

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.980
Um, with this. Here.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.760
That's a present for you.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.760
'Cause I think you're real cute,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.760
and I wanna show you that I,
that I like you, and I want to cuddle.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.660
Thanks so much to Lootcrate

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.660
So I got December's galaxy themed loot pets box,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.560
whichâ€”I've never unboxed
anything before so this is exciting.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.900
Oh, it's cute!

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.540
It came with galactic snacks 
freezedried beef liver snacks for dogs!

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.900
I have four cats so maybe they can eat that,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.020
even though they're not dogs.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.320
Oh, they've got a pet collar,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.260
that looks kind of futuristic.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.640
We got a new bowl!

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560
That's perfect 'cause we broke a bowl the other day

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.860
It's a firefly troublemaker ceramic pet bowl.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.000
Thank you.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.980
Oh my god, it's a sweater? Is it a sweater?

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.400
It's a tank top!

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.360
Oh my god!

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360
They have their own magazine!

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.400
and it's a pug!

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.000
