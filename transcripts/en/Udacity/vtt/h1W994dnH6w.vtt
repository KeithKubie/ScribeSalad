00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is it about math and these kind of tricky puzzles that just intrigues people so much?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Have you spent time thinking about that?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I have a little bit,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I don't take it for granted that it intrigues everyone.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Meaning it doesn't actually intrigue everyone, but it intrigues a lot of people.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Even mathematicians and computer scientists--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
many of them run when they hear a puzzle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Oh, no. They'll say, "I'm no good at puzzles. I'm leaving the room."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It is certainly true that you can good--in fact, you can do great mathematics--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
without being a puzzle-solver kind of a person, and great computer scientist,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
great computer science as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There are some kinds of math and computer science where you create structures of things,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and you don't try to solve puzzles.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You try to create structures.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You try to define things.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You can do all kinds of great stuff this way.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Not all mathematicians or computer scientists like this kind of puzzle

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or like puzzles of any kind.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
On the other hand, lots of people who are not mathematicians and computer scientists

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
love mathematical puzzles.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There are loads and loads of amateurs out there who adore this kind of puzzle.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There are lots of people with mathematical talent, logical talent,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
people just with good creative minds who are not doing mathematics

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or computer science or any thing like that who are really good at this sort of thing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you like puzzles, obviously, they're good for mental exercise, keeping the mind sharp,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but mathematical puzzles really do introduce you to techniques

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that you can actually use in solving problems that you run across,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and I gave examples of this as you just saw.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
These problems arose and the techniques used to solve them

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
can be used to solve other problems.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They give you new ideas.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They help you think creatively.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
On the negative side, solving puzzles could distract you from doing something more important.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But I like to think that you can't do important stuff 24-hours a day.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You need to spend some time doing stuff that's just fun,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and if there's a blurry line between what's fun and what's hard work,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so much the better.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But there's also something very satisfying at the end when all the pieces fall into place

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and you didn't know why it had to be 15 prisoners or whatever it had to be,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but everything kind of makes sense at the end,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I think some of us find that extremely gratifying.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I think I agree.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It's just a little bit like--many puzzles are like riddles.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Once you see the solution, once you can really grasp the solution,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
you've "ah-ha!" It's that kind of thing.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I have to say that there are also other kinds of puzzles,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
not sort of the riddle-type puzzles,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but puzzles which challenge your intuition, and I like those a lot too.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Those have a different function, which is to keep your mathematical intuition

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
from running off the rails,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
to get you to distrust certain notions of, for example, probability.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Probability, which we humans invented to try to deal with all the uncertainty

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that's in the world from our perspective,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
is something that we don't always know how to deal with.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Puzzles involving probability, especially ones with very counterintuitive results

00:03:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that you try to prove or disprove, can really help you keep sharp.
