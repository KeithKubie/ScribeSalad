00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.920
Alright, everybody, welcome back. So, let's, let's work through these. Charles,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.000
what is, what are you thinking for, for this first one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.090
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking I should write a program, and just

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.650
run it through, 'because that's the easiest thing to do.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.980
&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is this f function is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.390
so kind of wacky that it's hard to imagine actually analyzing

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.510
it, and doing anything with it. But, on the other

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.830
hand. The X, the space of X values is very small.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.370
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; Good so right so we can

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.180
enumerate all the possible values and just

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.940
see which one gives the highest output.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's pretty straight forward if I just wrote

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.000
the code, in fact it's like one line of code.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.420
&gt;&gt; So I wrote it for you.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.050
&gt;&gt; Oh good.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.290
&gt;&gt; I'm nice that way.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.600
&gt;&gt; You are nice that way, you optimized our time.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.670
&gt;&gt; Our did, for what it's worth, this is what

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.430
the function looks like. I'm not even sure that's a function.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.620
&gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.250
&gt;&gt; It's something. It looks DNA gone wrong.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.320
totally wrong, there's just mutations everywhere. It's like a bow

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.130
tie that then tried to hide itself in another dimension.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.264
I mean like, you can see there's this interesting up

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:04.129
and down-ness to it like a, like the sine wave part.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:04.160
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.600
&gt;&gt; But they're, they're interdigitated with each

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570
other. It's all, it's just crazy to me.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.410
&gt;&gt; Interdigitated. That is an excellent word.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it means, it means to put you're fingers together.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.370
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.140
&gt;&gt; So,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.270
&gt;&gt; So what happens if you plot that but with,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.060
connecting lines?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.372
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh, hee, hee. Sure. [LAUGH]

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:20.460
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.800
&gt;&gt; You get somethin' like that. Wow.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.890
&gt;&gt; This is a kind of unfriendly function.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not the friendliest function I have ever seen.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.870
&gt;&gt; And now it looks a bit like, actually

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.930
it looks a bit like an insane bow tie.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.940
&gt;&gt; Nice. Electric bow tie.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.940
&gt;&gt; So it turns out that there's two points that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.390
are really really close to the top. There's this one at

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.960
11 and there's this one I don't know a little bit after

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.880
80 or so. But the 1 and the 11 is actually the largest.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.790
&gt;&gt; Hm. This function goes too loud.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.850
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does indeed. So, I'm going to say 11.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.770
I wanted to make a crazy function that was the,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.832
was the first thing that popped into my head. Actually

00:01:56.832 --> 00:01:59.560
I did, the second one was a mod three at first.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.600
&gt;&gt; Hm, well, it's an interesting thing,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
right because if you tried to reason this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.530
out, it would be very difficult to do. I mean, first off, mod isn't very

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.960
nicely you know, it's very easy, it's not very easy to deal

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.520
with algebraically in closed form but you can start reasoning and say,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.370
well, the dominating factor is mod seven in the sense that you're

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.370
never going to be greater than six and of course the mod six

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.450
is never going to be greater than five so the best you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.650
can get there is five and then you minus the sign, which is

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.480
going to be some small number so you can kind of pick

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.420
all the values that are going to give you something like. Five there,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.460
and then whichever one has the smallest Sine, that's the one

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.830
you go for. I wonder if that would get you anywhere close

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.350
to the right answer. So, interesting that that's not quite true here

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.550
because 11 mod six is, no 11 mod six is five, right?

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.600
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
&gt;&gt; Squared is 25. Mod seven is four. Is that right?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.070
&gt;&gt; Anyway.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.760
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.530
&gt;&gt; let's do the second one.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.490
&gt;&gt; Alright so it turns out

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.220
that, again, 11 and 80 are really close but 11 is slightly larger and it's just

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.770
almost five, but not quite. Alright, so for the second problem, now we can't

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.020
use of enumerating because our X's constitute the entire space of the, reals.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.710
&gt;&gt; So, there's like, 200 of them.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.700
&gt;&gt; More.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.340
So we need to do something else. And I think what you were pointing out to me is

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.470
that because this is a nice polynomial. We can

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.240
actually use calculus to figure out where the maximum is.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.570
&gt;&gt; Right, just take the derivative and set it equal to 0.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.200
&gt;&gt; So unfortunately, I made that a little harder

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280
than than probably you'd appreciate. So the derivative would

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.970
be this, and setting it equal to 0 would

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.140
give us this equation, which unfortunately is a cubic.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.710
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.339
&gt;&gt; So it should have three solutions.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.840
Perhaps, and you could just check each of them.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.670
But solving the cubic is sort of a pain.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.686
&gt;&gt; Mm mm.

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.410
&gt;&gt; I guess I could have been a bit nicer.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.280
&gt;&gt; You could have been.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.380
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.180
&gt;&gt; But it all depends what you're optimizing.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.550
&gt;&gt; So how would you go about solving this now?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.940
&gt;&gt; I would go on Google and I look up how do you solve cubics.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure, that's not a bad idea.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.440
Any other things, because it is nice and smooth,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.570
right? So let's, here, let's, let me actually find it for you. So

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.279
here's the function, and I just plotted a subrange of it, from minus

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.940
500 to 1000. You know you could ask, could it be that the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850
maximum is actually someplace outside this

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.400
range. You know how you'd answer that?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.590
&gt;&gt; No. So because it's a fourth order

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.400
polynomial, like think of like a, a quadratic,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.510
&gt;&gt; It's got the one bump in it, a cubic can have as much as you know

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.770
one up bump and one down bump. And a qua, and a quartic ca, a 4th

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.820
degree polynomial can have an up bump, a

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.350
down bump, an up bump and then back down.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.035
&gt;&gt; M-hm.

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:49.990
&gt;&gt; So we're actually seeing all the activity here,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.480
outside this range it just plumettes negatively. It, it

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.270
can't turn around and come back up again. So

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.260
because we can see the two bumps we are good.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.860
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.730
&gt;&gt; And in this case, it looks like the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.850
bump that we want is somewhere between 500 and

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.450
a 1000, somewhere in the 700 kind of zone and well so one thing we could do

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.200
because it's really well behaved, we can kind of

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.982
zoom in on the function at that range. Mm-hmm.

00:05:11.982 --> 00:05:15.730
&gt;&gt; So there we are now zoomed in from between 500 and 1,000. We can see,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.470
okay, well, actually it looks like the peak

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.050
is maybe between 600 and 800, you think?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.800
&gt;&gt; I'd say 700 and 800.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.350
&gt;&gt; Between 700 and 800. All right, well let's take a look at that.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.603
&gt;&gt; Ooooo.

00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:28.710
&gt;&gt; Nice and

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.140
Pointy. Alright. So how bout that?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.670
&gt;&gt; 740. How bout 740 and 760?

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.340
&gt;&gt; So we really are kind of getting into

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.500
the nitty gritty here. So, so, for the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.750
quiz we'll you know, we accepted anything, between

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.730
you know, 745 and 755. But in fact we

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.090
can keep zooming in and we can use calculus, and we can, we can really hone on

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.080
what that, the tippy top is there. But

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.980
that's not so important right now, we could also

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.640
something called Newton's method, you know Newton's method?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.760
&gt;&gt; I remember it.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.370
&gt;&gt; Newton, newton's method said if, you

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.780
know, guess a position like you know, 455

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.260
sorry 755, and use the derivative at that point which is actually really easy to

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.420
compute, doesn't involve solving the, the cubic,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.410
it just involves, Writing down the cubic and

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.510
evaluating at that point, we can actually you

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.380
know, fit with the straight line is here.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.500
And we can take it, take steps in the direction of

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.270
that line, it's a, it's a gradient ascend kind of method.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.220
&gt;&gt; And, and that'll allow us to hone in, as we

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.410
get closer and closer to the top. The slope is going to flatten

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.970
out, we're going to take smaller steps And this process converges to

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.180
whatever the peak is, I think it's a little bit under 750.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.960
&gt;&gt; That looks about right.
