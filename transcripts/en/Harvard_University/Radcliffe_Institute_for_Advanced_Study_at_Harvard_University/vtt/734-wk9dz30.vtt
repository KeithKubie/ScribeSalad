00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:06.480
- Hi, beautiful people,
how are you today?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.580
Thank you for being here.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.403
Before I begin,
let's take a moment

00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.820
to acknowledge
that we're gathered

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.790
on the ancestral and unseeded
lands of the Massachusetts

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.920
and the Wampanoag peoples.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.460
We pay respect to their
elders past and present.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
Thank you so much to everyone
involved with the Radcliffe

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.940
Institute.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.140
You make we fellows feel not
only beloved but protected,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.570
and that's rare in
this world of ours.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.600
I feel less dread here
than in most places.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.055
Thank you, Meredith.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.860
And thank you to
Suzanne for endowing

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.770
this amazing fellowship.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.800
It has blown my mind in
100 different ways, which

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.930
someday I'll be able
to understand, not yet,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.240
but someday.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.670
My fellow fellows, you
people in the audience,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.520
you;re people such genius that
I come from your talks quivering

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.650
with ideas and with emotion.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.195
And that too is rare in my life.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.570
I don't have my
research partner,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.750
my undergraduate research
partner, Patricia Liz here.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.080
She did all of the aesthetic
work in this slide show.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.580
I don't know how
to do a slide show.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.660
I'm kind of a Luddite.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.500
Thank you, Patricia.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.280
You're wonderful.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280
She's also a great poet.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.060
Someday you'll know her name.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.590
I mean you know her name now.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.300
I don't know if the Professor
Richard Moran is here.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.200
If he is thank you for letting
me take your Proust class.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.500
It is blowing my mind.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.660
To my mom who is in the
audience, you're the best.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.520
Thank you for being here.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.200
So what I'm going
to do today is I'm

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.940
going to talk a little
bit about my next project,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.820
The Vaster Wilds and then I'll
read just a little bit from it.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.200
And I did this
because every time

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.570
that I sit down at a
blank page, I wonder,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.900
how is it that people come up
with ideas for books again?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.610
I don't know.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.250
And this is my
sixth published one

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.840
and I've written
probably four others

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.720
that were just disasters.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.370
So I wanted to think about
how these books come to life.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.120
And the first metaphor
that came to mind

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.500
is probably
incredibly grandiose.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.930
In fact, it's very
grandiose, but it's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.790
the only one that came to mind.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.170
So it is this.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.170
Nuclear fusion.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.490
So nuclear fusion is
a reaction in which

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.310
two or more atomic
nuclei are combined

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.470
to form one or more
different atomic nuclei

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.270
in subatomic particles.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.450
Now there are physicists in the
room who can school me on this.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.190
But for me, this is the
way that I see ideas

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.870
coming to life in a novel.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.790
A single idea for me is inert.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.050
It doesn't actually come to life
until two or more other ideas

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.620
crash into it and become this.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.840
Now this is, I think
this is amazing.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.775
This is an artificial sun that
is being developed in China.

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:53.818
And isn't it great?

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:55.610
It's so cool that
there's an artificial sun

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.830
in the world and so terrifying.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.150
All right.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.760
So the first-- I'm going to
go through six ideas that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.580
crashed together and came
together into The Vaster Wilds.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.148
So the first one is this.

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:09.440
This is Mary Rowlandson.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.830
This is a frontispiece from one
of her editions of her books.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.380
Those of you who don't
remember high school

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.020
may not remember
that Mary Rowlandson

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.810
is this very incredible figure.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.200
She was born in 1637.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.000
She died in 1711.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.160
And she was one of the settlers
on the Massachusetts frontier.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.730
In the middle of King
Philip's war, February 10,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.180
1675, at Lancaster in
Massachusetts not far

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.850
from here, there was a raid
on the town of settlers

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.510
by the combined forces of
the Wampanoag, Narragansett,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.670
and Nashaway peoples.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.700
In this raid, 13 English
people were killed

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.570
and 24 were taken captive,
including Mary Rowlandson

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.070
and her three children.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.620
Two of those children
were separated from her,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.160
and the youngest child was
6 years old and five months.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.750
She's very specific about this.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.590
And the little girl was
wounded very badly in the raid.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.490
And for the next 11 days,
Mary carried this little girl.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.800
Until on the 11th
day, the girl died.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.620
So Mary was taken captive.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.120
And it was a late winter.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.768
It was harsh.

00:04:20.768 --> 00:04:21.560
It was unforgiving.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.220
It was during a time of
absolute hunger, famine.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.962
And Mary Rowlandson
didn't speak the language

00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:29.670
of the Native American
people around her,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.295
so she didn't understand
their culture.

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:34.310
She didn't understand what was
happening to her basically.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.980
About 11 weeks later,
she was ransomed

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.700
to a group of people who
paid for her to come back

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.220
to her husband.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.120
And later, her
two older children

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.760
were brought back to her.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.870
And she wrote of her
narrative of this.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.710
And she wrote it, it's
a very famous book.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.015
And she wrote it in
a series of removes.

00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:55.640
So every time that
the Native Americans

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.200
got up and fled the
onslaught of the soldiers,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.458
each one was called a remove.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:03.500
And so I'm going to read
to you an entire remove.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.800
This is the 14th remove, because
I want you to hear her voice.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.600
It's so extraordinary.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.200
OK, she says, now
must we pack up

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.420
and be gone from this
thicket, bending our course

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.380
toward the bay towns.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.390
I having nothing to
eat by the way this day

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.450
but a few crumbs of cake
that an Indian gave my girl

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.580
the same day we were taken.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.740
She gave it me and I
put it in my pocket.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.650
There it lay till it was so
moldy for want of good baking

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.600
that one could not tell
what it was made of.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.630
It fell all to crumbs and
grew so dry and hard that it

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.400
was like little flints.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.752
And this refreshed me many
times when I was ready to faint.

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:39.710
It was in my thoughts
when I put it in my mouth

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.660
that if ever I
returned, I would tell

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.080
the world what a blessing the
Lord gave to such mean food.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.530
As we went along, they killed
a deer with a young one in her.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.470
They give me a piece of the
fawn and it was so young

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.230
and tender that one might
eat the bones, as well

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.430
as the flesh.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.320
And yet I thought it very good.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.600
When night came, we sat down.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.690
It rained, but they
quickly got a bark wigwam

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.890
where I lay dry that night.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.800
I looked out in the
morning and many of them

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.570
had lain in the
rain all night, I

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.130
saw by their
reeking or the smoke

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.080
coming off of their bodies.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.720
Thus the Lord dealt
mercifully with me many times,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.722
and I fared better
than many of them.

00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:18.680
In the morning, they took
the blood of the deer

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.290
and put it into the
paunch and so boiled it.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.990
I could eat nothing of that,
though they eat it sweetly.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.762
And yet they were so
nice and other things

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:28.220
that when I had fetched water
and had put the dish I dipped

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.665
the water with into the kettle
of water which I brought,

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.540
they would say that they
would knock me down,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.120
for they said it was
a sluttish trick.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.130
So they were much more
hygienic than she was is

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.110
what she is saying in the end.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.443
Sluttish trick just means dirty.

00:06:41.812 --> 00:06:43.520
Her narrative was
actually published here

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.980
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts in 1682.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.240
And it had a preface likely
by Cotton Mather, that Puritan

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.600
preacher, and was so deeply
inflected the whole way

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.940
through with piety,
that many scholars do

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.700
believe that he had a
heavy hand in the text.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.890
So I remembered Mary Rowlandson.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.850
She dug at me.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.080
I didn't know why.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.210
I didn't understand
what it was about her

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.240
that was so interesting.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.365
And so I started reading
other captivity narratives

00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:10.280
of early American women.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.400
Cotton Mather actually wrote
his own captivity narrative

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.010
of Hannah Dustin,
who is this woman who

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.200
had been taken by the
Abanachy and apparently

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.160
in scouts 10 Native
Americans on her way fleeing.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.790
There was Elizabeth
Hanson in New Hampshire.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.710
Susanna Willard Johnson,
also New Hampshire.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.370
And what I found from these, I
found this kernel of an idea,

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.880
that this was one of the first
forms of American women's

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.770
literary storytelling.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.380
Yet at the same time,
these narratives

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.460
were controlled by the
men who published them.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.440
They were edited by men.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.650
And often they were
as told to men.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.330
And they were published by men.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.210
So who knows really, what the
actual voices of the women are?

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.790
Once in a while, in the course
of reading these narratives,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.250
you hear something that
rings absolutely like

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.810
a soul talking to your own.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.590
But you never quite know if
these women were actually--

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.680
these were their words
and their experiences.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.050
At the same time
also in 2019, it

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.940
is hideous to read these now.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.300
Because they are tools
of absolute propaganda.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.180
And at the time they were used
as Puritan self-justification

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.060
for stealing the land,
for the acts of genocide

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.950
that were perpetrated, for
making Native Americans seem

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.180
other or barbaric and
almost giving justification

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.190
to the colonialists
to take their land

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.130
and to treat them as barbarians.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.850
It's brutal to read these now.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.059
Yet at the same time, I fell
in love with one narrative.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.210
And this is a little bit blurry.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.080
But this is Mary Jemeson's
captivity narrative.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.200
She was captured in
1775 when she was 15.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.720
But she grew to love the
Seneca with whom she lived.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.730
And she had two husbands
and children with them.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.880
And she was given the chance to
go back, but she chose not to.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.560
She chose to stay
with the Seneca.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.510
And I found her
really fascinating.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.910
And I wanted to think a
little bit more about her.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.890
Now the second thing sort of
coming into the first atom,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.860
was Robinson Crusoe.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.890
So I remembered Robinson Crusoe.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.570
I have to, before
you talk about it,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.227
I have to read the subtitle
because I just love it so much.

00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:23.810
Are you ready?

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.950
I am going to try
to do in one breath.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.100
The life and strange,
surprising adventures

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.080
of Robinson Crusoe
of York, mariner,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.760
who lived eight and
20 years all alone

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.920
in an uninhabited island
on the coast of America

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.630
near the mouth of the
Great River Nookie,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.170
having been cast on
shore by shipwreck

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.712
wherein all the men perished
but himself, with an account how

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:43.520
he was at last strangely
delivered by pirates.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.800
Love it so much.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:54.050
And I read this when I was
17, like the Mary Rowlandson

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.310
captivity narratives.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.420
And I remembered that the first
part of Robinson Crusoe, he

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.960
was actually captured by
a Moore, which is a North

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.380
African of Muslim belief.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.192
And he was held for
two years as a slave.

00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:09.650
So I thought, OK,
there's some sort

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.130
of connection with these
captivity narratives.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.010
And I reread this
book all the time,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.070
because I find it so
fascinating because there's

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.350
no interiority in
Robinson Crusoe.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.080
There's no self
reflection really.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.590
And so that there's so
little self reflection,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.420
there's a lot of a litany of
what happens, what happens,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.400
what he does, what happens.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.650
That sometimes there
are these objects

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.360
that begin to contain all of
the emotion of the human who

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.480
is regarding them.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.590
So for instance, the day that
he's shipwrecked, he looks out

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.180
and he's just devastated.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.140
And he says, reflecting upon all
my comrades that were drowned

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.300
and that there should
not be one soul saved

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.660
but myself, for, as
for them, I never

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.030
saw them afterwards
or any sign of them

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.330
except three of
their hats, one cap,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.240
and two shoes that
were not fellows.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.330
Oh my god, it's so good.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.560
So I reread this
and I thought, and I

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.660
got snagged on this one moment.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.870
So Robinson Crusoe, he's trying
to create a life for himself

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.760
amongst these goats.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.415
And he decides to make
for himself a table.

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.040
And I started thinking
about this table

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.820
because in an England
household of the time,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.862
the table was the place around
which everyone gathered.

00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:32.320
And so how poignant
is it that he's

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.990
making a place for himself,
around which nobody else

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.210
will gather but him, right?

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.570
And then I read that he
said, if I wanted a board,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.120
I had no other way but
to cut down a tree,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.130
set it on an edge before
me and hew it flat

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.002
on either side with
my ax till I had

00:11:47.002 --> 00:11:48.460
brought it to be
as thin as a plank

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.640
and then dub it
smoothed my adze.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.990
It is true by this method I
could make but one board out

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.190
of a whole tree.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.680
But this I had no
remedy for but patience,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.050
anymore than I had for the
prodigious deal of time

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.900
and labor which it took me to
make up a plank or a board.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.790
So I mean, that's
really poignant too.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.580
He had to cut down a whole
tree to make a plank, right?

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.240
That's really extraordinary
and wonderful.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.860
But then I thought
about this further.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.060
And I thought that
this is very strange.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.700
This is almost an imposition of
England upon this wild island,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.200
right?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.010
There's a right angles.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.218
He's trying to make right
angles in this place that's

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:22.330
full of not right angles.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.940
And it's starting to
feel almost as a motif

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.870
of an imposition of puritanical
ideas of work and suffering

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.910
and commerce.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.350
And I am very ambivalent
about puritanism and work

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.490
and suffering and commerce.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.690
So I was really, really
concerned about this,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.540
as almost this too felt almost
propagandic in some ways.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.510
And that made me sad.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.460
The third element that crashed
into the first two was--

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.260
I read an article.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.130
Now this, I read an article
in National Geographic

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:05.410
about Jamestown, the first
English settlement that lasted.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:11.020
And in this article, it was
shown that archaeologists

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.170
found the skull and shinbone
of a 14-year-old girl who

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.700
had been cannibalized.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.220
Now in five of the
primary sources,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.040
people had said at the time
during the starving time, when

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
everyone was dying,
there was no food.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.860
They were eating their horses.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.000
They were eating vermin.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.120
You know, they're
boiled their shoes,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.290
that there was cannibalism.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.090
But this is the first
time there's actually

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.440
evidence, empirical
evidence, from the bones.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.140
And I thought this was amazing.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.080
This was really strange.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.020
So I started looking
into Jamestown.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.670
And this is Jamestown before the
starving time of 1609 to 1610.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.880
And as I was looking
into this research,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.040
I started reading
primary sources.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.990
I read all of John
Smith's narratives.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.490
And I love John
Smith as a character

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.990
because he was a braggart.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.010
He was a liar.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.320
He was amazing.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.930
I read A True Relation
and Observations

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.750
by George Percy, A True
Discourse of the Present

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.570
State of Virginia
by Ralph Hamor,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.140
and all bunches of letters.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.170
And then I started
reading secondary sources.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.920
Still I still had no
idea what I was going

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.570
to do with all this stuff.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.210
Now, I was pretty
sure at this point

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.470
that I was going to
write historical fiction.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.340
And in the past.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.510
I said I would never write
historical fiction again.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.380
And I think I said this
because in literary fiction,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.260
historical fiction is
often looked down upon.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.200
And I have theories
about this, which

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.910
I'm having to happy
about in the Q&amp;A.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.470
But one of the
theories that I have

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.320
is that historical
fiction is often,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.900
even by very excellent
writers, treated

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.680
as tourism into the past.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.300
And I didn't want to do this.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.730
If I had to write another
historical fiction book,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:57.160
I wanted to write something
that was oppositional, that was

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.215
talking about the current day.

00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:01.090
Because I think that if
you're not doing that

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.950
in historical fiction, why?

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.970
Why bother?

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.640
And I'm not a historian.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.740
So what I think a historian
does, and there's so

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.040
many great historians
in the room,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.665
I've seen all of
their work, thank you.

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:13.090
I'm not a historian.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.960
What they do is they make
this beautiful lace work out

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.370
of facts and ideas
and inferences.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.330
But I think the job of a
person who's writing fiction

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.970
within history is to
take this lace work

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.270
and to gently tease apart one
of the holes and look through.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.180
And you try not to break
the threads if you do.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.430
You build, they'll tell you.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.220
But you know, you
try to look through.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.470
So that's what I wanted to do.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.730
So I eventually
succumbed to this idea

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.030
that I was going to write
this historical fiction.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.040
Now these are my ideas
about, sort of encapsulated,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.720
about how to do this right,
how to do this morally.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.738
And the Hilary Mantel one
is really interesting.

00:15:53.738 --> 00:15:55.780
I think that she's probably
one of the people who

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.560
does the best historical
fiction writing out there.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.510
She says, when you choose
a novel to tell you

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.260
about the past, you're
putting in brackets

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.350
the historical accounts,
which may or may not

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.660
agree with each other
and actively requesting

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.070
a subjective interpretation.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.870
If you're buying
a replica or even

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.120
a faithful photographic
reproduction,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.912
you're buying a painting with
the brush strokes left in.

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:16.870
That's beautiful right?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.270
That's a beautiful way
of thinking about this.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.010
And then Walter been
Benjamin actually

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.980
has this statement which goes
against some of the things

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.040
that Hilary Mantel
actually does.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.330
But he says, it is
more arduous to honor

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.548
the memory of the nameless
than that of the renowned.

00:16:30.548 --> 00:16:32.590
So this is what I wanted
to do with this project.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.875
I wanted to honor
someone who is nameless.

00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:38.500
Now the fourth and fifth things,
I don't have a slide with this

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.300
because I put it in today and
my research assistant put it in.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.050
I was really, I've always been
interested in survivalism,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.360
in eschatology, in
wilderness survival.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.350
That's the fourth.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:55.390
And the fifth is, I started
this at the end of 2016,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.910
which you remember, right?

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.190
And I was so angry.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.310
And I'm still so angry.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.500
But I just hated the patriarchy
so much at that point.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.410
I just wanted to
throw a grenade at it.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.750
And I was, I was
looking at the way

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.550
that the patriarchy
reverberated out into our lives,

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.530
and how at the
beginning there could

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.510
have been an
alternative to the way

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.569
that we have been taught
to see the formation

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.109
of the American
culture as it is today.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.250
And it devastated me.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.860
So I wanted to write this
thing as a vision of--

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.270
you'll see.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.250
I wanted to-- I wanted
to write a fusion.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.830
I wanted to write a
female Robinson Crusoe,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.250
reimagining a girl fleeing
Jamestown in the Starving Time.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.532
Eventually, she joined
Native Americans.

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:46.240
It's a captivity
narrative sort of that's

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.510
not propaganda or
puritanical justification,

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.000
but one in which as her
body moves outwards away

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.840
from Jamestown, and the
spring begins to warm she

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.230
generally loses some of
her preconceived ideas

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.910
that she has just
taken for granted all

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.370
throughout her life.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.845
And it's a very physical book.

00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:06.220
So I wanted to
think of it almost

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.870
as an anti-captivity narrative.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.140
In some ways this is,
it's more complex possibly

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.330
than in captivity narrative.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.460
Now, I wrote a couple drafts.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.010
And I like to write many drafts.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.230
I write a whole thing, throw it
out, start over again, throw it

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.730
out.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.803
And I do it all longhand.

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:24.220
And I will talk
to you later about

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.560
why, if you are
interested in the Q&amp;A,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.870
it's really long,
my explanation.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.930
And so, on about the
fifth or sixth draft,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.610
I remembered one of the great
loves of my life, William

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.280
Shakespeare.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.570
I love him so much.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.060
And I tend to try
to read Shakespeare

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.500
as much as possible.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.690
But I realize that
Shakespeare was

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.850
contemporaneous with this
character that I was creating.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.730
And so the quote is, I can call
spirits from the vasty deep.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.232
And I was reading
Henry IV Part One,

00:18:56.232 --> 00:18:57.940
and I thought, oh,
the vasty deep, that's

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.530
a great title for a book.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.420
But then I thought,
know the vasty

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.190
wilds, because
she's in the wilds.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.950
But I thought, nobody
knows what Vasty is,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.520
so it has to be vaster,
the vaster wilds.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.820
So that's where the title
of this book comes from.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.120
And then I got so, I
kind of get over the top.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.980
I get very in love
with the things

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.420
that I'm studying at the time.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.890
I got so in love
with Shakespeare,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.600
I tried to write an entire
draft in iambic pentameter.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.430
And that was
actually the most fun

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.200
I've ever had writing
in my entire life.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.850
It was just joyous.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.400
And I think sometimes you
have to mix it up like that.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.980
I mean, I've been doing
this for 20 years.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.587
So I have to, I have to
make it fun for myself.

00:19:35.587 --> 00:19:37.420
So I did a whole draft
in iambic pentameter,

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.160
threw it out immediately
because it was just failed.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.740
And what I had to
do then was try

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.850
to find a kind of language
that wasn't archaic the way

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.890
that we see the language of the
17th century as archaic now,

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.200
but felt as fresh
then, as it was--

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.190
as fresh now as it
was then, right?

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.180
Almost newborn.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.060
Because back then,
there's so many influences

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.770
changing the English language.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.170
And if you read some
of the primary sources,

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.360
you know that none
of the spellings

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.010
are at all standardized.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.170
So it's actually very
fun to read it and try

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.960
to hear it and try to hear what
it is that they're actually

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.220
saying at the time.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.450
So I wanted to find a
language that was fresh.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.970
And if Professor
Joyce Chaplin is here,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.970
I want to say thank you.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:27.550
Because she read it for
possibly anachronisms

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.780
that I had definitely put in
to the book at that point.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.420
And then one more revision.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.790
I started making sure
that my understanding

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.277
of the Native American world
of the time in particular

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.110
in which my characters
is living is correct.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.150
Because it has to be
absolutely correct or else

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.260
I will be re-perpetrating
the acts of colonialism

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.880
upon these populations.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.820
So I've been in conversation
with particularly Lisa Brooks,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.140
who wrote this amazing book.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.640
I don't know if
you've ever read it.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.780
But it's in one
chapter in particular,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.840
she talks about Mary Rowlandson.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.730
But she talks about her from
the other side of the tapestry.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:08.780
And she gives sort of, the
way that Mary Rowlandson sees

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.920
barbarism, she gives
really clear explanations

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.003
based on the cultures in
which Mary Rowlandson is

00:21:15.003 --> 00:21:15.670
sort of meeting.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.325
And Mary Rowlandson had no
language or understanding

00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:18.950
of the culture.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.240
And so she just, she had no idea
what she was coming up against.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.030
So I've been talking to Lisa
Brooks, Kahente Horn-Miller,

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.177
and Alyssa Mt.

00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:29.680
Pleasant-- all of these great
Native American academics--

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.040
to try to make sure that
I'm not being a jerk.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.410
And so that's where I
am with this so far.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.500
And I'm going to read
a little bit of it now.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.640
I'm slightly anxious about
this, because I don't share

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.120
my work unless it's finished.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.700
So here it goes.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.150
All right.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.010
This is from the beginning.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.320
The moon hid itself
behind the clouds.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.530
The winds spat icy
snow at angles.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.110
Close to the great black
wall of the palisade,

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.102
there was a split seemingly
too small for human passage.

00:22:06.102 --> 00:22:07.810
Through it the girl
slipped from her life

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.810
and into the black and
terrible wilderness.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.680
Her face was hooded and she
was slight, born bony and short

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.260
but the feminine has
drifted down yet starker

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.230
to root and string and fiber.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.740
Even so starved and blinded
by the dark, she was quick.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.080
She stumbled with her
first step and nearly fell,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.660
but caught herself
and began to run, now

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.350
going fast over the frozen ruts
of the field, the corn that

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.310
came up in summer black
and stunted with blight.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.450
Swifter, girl, she told herself.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.720
And her legs in their panic
and anguish moved faster.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.450
The good boots
she had stolen off

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.360
the dead son of a
gentleman, the thick cloak

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.220
she'd stolen off her
own mistress, who

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.160
wept even now inside
that hellish place,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.550
diminishing its grip on her
with each step she took away.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.550
There was a glimmer on
the dark ground ahead.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.560
She knew it was the
shirt of a man who'd

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.750
been caught worming
his way to the forest

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.560
when, with no sound at all,
the worst and bloodiest

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.800
of the naturals had loomed
up out of the shadows.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.960
The warrior, two heads
taller than the men

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.510
of the fort, who made
himself more terrible

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.950
by wearing black swans wings
outstretched upon his back.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.700
Then this most dangerous of the
natural men, had in silence,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.710
lifted the creeping
man by the hair

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.400
and it cut a second mouth
into creeping man's throat

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.770
and dropped him there to
spill his heart's blood

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.120
into the frozen earth, where he
lay splayed still after a week.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.480
For the soldiers of the Fort
had become too weak and cowardly

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.450
in their hunger to
fetch his body back.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.000
She passed the dead man
and his lingering reek

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.310
and was nearly to the
woods when she stumbled,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.750
this time in fear.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.320
For now before her she saw
the naturals lurking in ambush

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.220
in every deeper, blacker
shadow of each tree.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.820
Yet she went on.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.820
And each imagined natural
and terrified passing

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.830
revealed himself to be
merely shadow again.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.430
She had left everything
behind her in fleeing,

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.750
a roof, a home, a country,
a language, the only family

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.950
she had known, innocence,
her own knowledge of herself.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.390
Do not think of it,
girl, she told herself,

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.900
or else you shall die of grief.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.490
And she did not
turn back to look

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.490
on the red gleam of the
small fires inside the fort

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.770
as they shown in
the night sky above.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.790
She was devout.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.250
She listened when the minister
read from the Good Book.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.720
She had learned her lesson
from the wife of Lot.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.820
She ran and she was nothing.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.770
In this wilderness,
she was no one.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.190
The dark rendered the self
she'd owned down to nothing.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.640
Yet a nothing is a
thing with no past.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.790
A nothing could be free.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.850
Inside the forest the wind
calmed and removed its hands

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.310
from her cheeks and
under her skirts.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.040
It was warmer, though
by no means warm.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.230
She stopped and pressed
her for head to a tree

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.592
and its rough skin
held her there.

00:25:01.592 --> 00:25:03.550
What light that should
have fallen from the sky

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.850
could not, because all was
covered in a thickness of cloud

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.550
and the forest before her
was dense and dense and dark

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.060
as pitch.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.820
Pocks of snow shined
darkly here and there

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.770
within the pits of trees.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.800
Her breath was ragged
and she quieted it.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.290
She let the silence
seep back in and allied

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.270
the crashing of her footsteps.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.550
Surely it had been loud
enough to have woken

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.150
what ears might have been near.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.760
Perhaps even now the naturals
were following or silently

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.960
behind her, stalking
her like prey.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.990
She listened over the scrape
and bow of the wind, cold trunk

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.260
upon cold trunk picking shrieks
as though tuning fiddles,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.200
but heard no footsteps,
no breaking twigs.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.410
And at last not far from
where she stood listening,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.810
she heard the rasp of the
stream that she knew was nearby

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.810
running under its shell of ice.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.092
She pressed on as
silently as she could.

00:25:54.092 --> 00:25:55.800
And when she found
the ice with her feet,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.650
she followed it northward
and into the black.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.170
For some time, she
gingerly slid up the stream

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.340
until she saw a deeper
gleam near her boot.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.850
And knowing it to
be flowing water,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.040
she bent and took off
the leather and gloves

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.190
with her teeth and pressed her
frozen hands between her legs

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.050
until they thawed
enough to move,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.000
then opened the sack
she had been carrying

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.090
in one frozen fist, and
dipped the pewter cup

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.060
she'd stolen into the
water and drank deeply.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.000
The cold water sliced
down the center of her

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.940
like the tip of a knife.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.910
It made her shudder and her
teeth chattered in her head.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.330
And then she replaced the cup
and tied the sack to her waist,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.480
lifting her cloak and
gowns to place it there.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.420
Her bones shouted,
and her head swam,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.760
but with aching bones and slow
blood, she pressed on again.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.710
Her stomach, emptied
these three days,

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.110
protested at its
fullness of water.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.810
She began to run again
and her body warmed

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.700
and her breath rasped, softer
now against the cold air.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.430
Now that her legs had
reached a good warmth,

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.590
and the pulse of nerves
that had sent her running

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.163
had faded into the
constant forward motion,

00:27:05.163 --> 00:27:06.580
and the harshness
of her breathing

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.710
had softened into
a rhythm, her brain

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.770
could loosen up into wonder.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.390
She had until now,
been moving herself

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.970
in recoil from the worst
thing she'd yet seen

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.970
or could imagine, the
terrible thing in the yard

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.360
that she could
never after unsee.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.280
And still the minister's
hand was still,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.080
it was so hard upon her
throat, that when she swallowed

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.720
she could feel the ghost
of it there, squeezing.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.250
She could smell his
sour breath in her nose.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.160
She could feel the
choking in her whole body

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.800
which sorely needed to rest.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.080
And even as she
ran, before her eyes

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.200
fell the vision of the
mistress, weeping on her knees

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.090
in the light of the fire
reaching her hand out greedily.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.110
She shunted it away
behind a door in her mind

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.200
that she closed
and locked tight.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.630
She had placed a great
many things in her life

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.580
behind this door in her mind.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.580
The grief too great, it
would burn her up as fuel.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.430
She knew that there
would be no return.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.380
She could only move
into the nothing,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.130
the great vast dark in the
desert waste of this land.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.550
The sacrifices of God or
a broken spirit, a broken

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.840
and a contrite heart.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.620
Oh, God doubt will not despise.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.850
You sinner, she said to herself.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.140
What is it that you have done?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.880
What have you done?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.130
It fell upon her all in a
heap that she was venturing

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.010
into this virgin immensity
with its great hard perils,

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.510
known its serpents and lions
and many fanged winter itself,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.050
but also there was awaiting
her great perils unknown,

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.260
monsters yet uncharted and
unknown to the imagination

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.290
of men, difficulties
never yet returned from

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.440
and reported in the letters
and books that men produce.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.750
And she knew further, of
all the unknown perils

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.830
that stalked her.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.230
The worst by far were
the faceless naturals

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.270
whose hatred for
her people burned

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.640
in their mysterious hearts,
whose language would

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.480
be a tangle of sounds, who would
view her in what strange light

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.600
and deal with her in
what unknown manner.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.430
So savage were they
that the rumors

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.970
rippled outwards and redoubled
back in waves of terror.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.650
There were tales of
a soldier whose head

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.630
had been found
cleaved from his body,

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.840
with bread stuffed into his
mouth as if to mock the famine

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.403
the settler suffered.

00:29:15.403 --> 00:29:17.320
There were tales of men
creeping back to fort,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.870
pressing their hands to
staunch the blood pouring

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.960
from their heads, all
hair and flesh ripped off

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.513
to the bony skull.

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:25.930
And there'd been
a soldier, it was

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.360
said, in the first
wave of settlers, who'd

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.820
come across one of the
natural girls in the forest

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.910
and starved to madness
for the company of women,

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.790
he had pushed this natural girl
down and had his way with her.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.990
She screamed and wept, and he
left her lying there bleeding.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.880
And one day, when this
man was out in the bay

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.030
gathering oysters, he looked
up to find his companions had

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.000
disappeared from around him.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.590
And the birds in the
trees had gone silent.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.350
And in a blink, as though
they had been magicked out

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.500
of the fog upon the
waters, the natural women

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.090
had silently surrounded him.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.770
Before he could
cry out, they put

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.720
a leather thong in his mouth.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.430
So he was made mute
and could not scream.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.940
And they dragged him away
with them by the head.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.100
And then that same
night, four women

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.650
tied him naked as a
newborn babe to the trees

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.930
visible from the
gate of the fort,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.080
legs and arms
painfully outspread.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.060
Then they built a
great fire before him

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.110
so that his pale skin glowed
in the dark like a star.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.090
And they loosed the
thong in his mouth

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.810
so his screams could be heard
in the heart of the fort.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.120
And all at once, the many
women poured naked out

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.060
of the dark forest with
sharpened oyster shells

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.530
in their hands.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.920
And with these as knives, the
women slowly flayed the man.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.170
This is really, really bloody.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.750
First the skin of
his eyelids, so he

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.560
had no choice but to watch
what they were doing to him.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.270
Then the skin of
his arms and legs

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.120
and belly, which they
threw into the fire

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.052
before his peeled eyes.

00:30:55.052 --> 00:30:56.510
And then his tongue
from his mouth,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.570
so he could yet scream
through the clotting blood.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.820
And then his privy
members which they slowly

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.440
removed, the figs first
and then the manhood.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.330
And at this at last,
he lost his senses,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.950
and they waited for
him to wake again

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.410
before they let his
parts fall, plump

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.810
and spitting into the fire.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.940
Only then in mercy, did
they slit his throat

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.160
and let the hot blood
pour out of him and steam

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.940
upon the ground.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.820
This was the savagery of
the people of these parts.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.470
And she prayed they
did not catch her,

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.750
for there was no telling
what they would do.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.230
For they did hate her own
people, and deeply so.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.970
And it was no secret what
men across the world entire

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:39.483
did to women of the enemy
in times of war and strife.

00:31:39.483 --> 00:31:41.150
But under these
thoughts of the naturals

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.060
there sang a low
counterpoint in her mind.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.330
And she saw in a vision,
how in her own native city,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.430
the heads of the enemies
of the late queen

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.730
had been stuck on the pikes
of the great bridge, the way

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.880
that in a harsh wind
their beards flapped,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.370
and it seemed that they
were silently screaming,

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.010
and beneath the carts piled
with vegetables were rolling

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.300
stupidly to the markets.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.830
And farmers rode
stolidly with no notice

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.220
those skulls on the pikes.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.765
And furthermore,
that though it was

00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:10.640
said that when women
and children of the fort

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.190
disappeared during the
famine, that the naturals had

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.350
come through in the
night and stolen them,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.750
she'd always imagined that
perhaps the cleverest women,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.930
seeing danger on both sides,
had taken their children

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.200
and fled to the naturals,
who were also hungry but had

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.920
food enough for all to survive,
and would grudgingly take them

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.210
in as slaves.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.420
For mothers, having
already lost their liberty

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.810
when they bore their children,
understood the delicate balance

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.050
between the price of freedom and
the price of their children's

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.357
lives.

00:32:40.357 --> 00:32:40.940
You know what?

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.400
I'm going to stop there
to the blood and death.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.850
Thank you.
