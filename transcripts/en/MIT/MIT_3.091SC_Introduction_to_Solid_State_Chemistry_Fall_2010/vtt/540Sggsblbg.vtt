00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.290
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.140
Folks, I may not look like Don
Sadoway, but for today, I am

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.040
Don Sadoway.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.810
So let's--

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.760
I guess you can hear me
pretty well, right?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.210
OK.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.470
Professor Sadoway is in a
faraway, terrible place.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.770
It's called Vienna.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.800
Yeah, I know.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.260
We're here.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840
What can I say?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.450
And he'll be back
next Tuesday.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.100
And so my name is Ron
Ballinger, and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.490
I'm taking his place.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.380
Put a muffler on that.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.920
OK, great.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.960
I'm sure you're all anxious,
before we get

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.080
started, to see that.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.330
Right.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.380
The average--

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.520
it was about 66, which is about
10 points lower than the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.490
last five or 10 quiz ones.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.870
So it's a little bit lower.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.440
It was a little bit harder
test. I'm sure Professor

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.330
Sadoway will mention this when
he comes back, but for those

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.350
of you who are below the 50
mark, it's time to do

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.750
something about it, and when I
say do something about it, I'm

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.540
sure your recitation instructors
will be very happy

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.070
to help out in any way possible,
but there are other

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.150
options, not the least
of which is a tutor.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.590
And so if you think you need one
and you need to be kind of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.560
ruthless about examining
yourself--

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.990
if you think you need one, go
down and see Hilary and there

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.430
are tutors which are available
for individual instruction.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.350
So I think it's a great time to
take it take advantage of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.200
that because I can guarantee you
that test number two will

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.660
not be any easier.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
In fact, it'll be considerably
harder because it'll be pretty

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.010
much new material.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.380
OK.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.790
So that's enough for that.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.980
Last day, we were--

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.530
I wasn't here.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.920
I was in Washington.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.860
They're actually trying
to build what's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.970
called an exoflop computer.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.250
Does anybody know
what exo means?

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.190
10 to the 18th.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.090
10 to the 18th floating point
operations per second.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.830
Why do they need that?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.070
Because when you go beyond 3091
then starting modeling

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.470
these atoms--

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.430
especially F-block atoms-- you
need a supercomputer that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.360
large and to do one run on a
petaflop machine takes 100,000

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.100
CPUs 10 hours for one atom.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.540
So solving the Schrodinger
equation's a bit tricky.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.820
OK.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.210
Remember last time, we talked
about metallic bonding and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.030
we're sort of sneaking
up on it.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.080
Remember, Paul Drude--

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.940
well, let's look up here.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.980
These are the characteristics
of metallic solids.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.680
They have high electrical
conductivity.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640
They have high thermal
conductivity.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.870
They shine and they
have ductility.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.000
So we're going to deal with
the first three today, and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.150
later on in the course, we'll
talk about the ductility part.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.610
But recall that Paul Drude
modeled the solid as a series

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:07.150
of cations, which amounted to
the nucleus plus the inner

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.420
core electrons and then allowed
the electrons--

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.690
the remaining, the outer shell
electrons, the valence

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.290
electrons, to float around,
called it a free electron gas.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.440
And that model explained the
temperature dependence of heat

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.500
capacity, but it was not
so good when it came to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.560
electrical conductivity.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.020
It explained the fact that you
get electrical conductivity,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.440
but not the fact that some
materials are conductors and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.570
some materials are insulators.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.770
So we need to deal with that and
for that, we need to talk

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.620
to two sets of folks.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:58.040
The first one is Felix Bloch
and he was a 1928--

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.220
he was a--

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.080
he got his PhD under
Heisenberg.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.290
Boy, it would've been nice back
in those days, working

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.140
for those great folks.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.680
And he applied quantum
mechanics to solids.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.500
He said, OK, let's consider that
in a solid, the atoms are

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.960
arranged in an array.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.650
What's an array?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.970
Well, it's actually
called a crystal.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.650
It's an ordered array of atoms.
We're going to say a

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.040
lot more about that as
we go along, but--

00:05:48.040 --> 00:06:06.350
and then he said, well, then
let's apply the Schrodinger

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.120
equation to this system.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.600
Now it's a big difference
between the Schrodinger

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.390
equation for a single
atom in a gas and

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.306
multiple atoms in a solid.

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:19.270
It's a different set of boundary
conditions, different

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.890
set of conditions
all together.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.160
And when you do that, you get
a set of solutions for the

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.670
valence electrons which
is, as you might

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.035
expect, it's periodic.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:57.340
It's periodic and it invokes
wave-like properties of the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:05.890
electron and you end up with
a set of values of the

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.130
wavelengths for the electron
that are such that it allows

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.930
mobility, which is, after
all, what we're after.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.220
These electrons got to move
through the solid if we're

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.540
going to have conductivity.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:37.280
And this is an example where
classical physics wouldn't

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.900
allow that.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.790
So you can't get this
kind of behavior

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.810
with classical physics.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.050
So that's one piece.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.360
And the second group,
two guys.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:06.380
Walter Heitler and
Fritz London.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.510
We know Fritz London from London
dispersion force--

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.850
the same guy.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.430
These guys were very,
very productive.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.290
And he did a post-doc--

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.650
that's another word for slave
labor, by the way.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.070
Folks will know that here.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.060
For guess who?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.440
Well, he did it for
Schrodinger.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.930
Interesting story, I guess.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.380
These guys showed up for their
slave labor at Schrodinger's

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.190
lab, only to discover that
Schrodinger had taken a

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.330
position at a different
university.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.720
So these guys showed up
and he said, goodbye.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.060
Anyway, that's a bummer.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.960
OK.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.220
And they sat down and
they said, well, OK.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.270
Let's see if we can go at this
from an energy point of view

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.980
as opposed from the quantum
mechanical point of view and

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.560
let's see if we can
apply LCAOMO--

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.810
now don't break out in hives
because of the test--

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:33.070
to a solid, to large
aggregates.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.320
Large what?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.860
Of atoms. How big is large?

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.880
Well, I don't know.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.670
Dream up a number-- say,
10 to the 23rd.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.190
Lots of atoms. And let's
see what happens.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.860
Well, we've already done a
little of this in the past. We

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.020
looked at the energetics of the
stability of hydrogen or

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.130
the stability of helium.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.710
So we can take that and we can
kind of add up and we'll see

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.940
what happens.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.360
Well, remember, we had atom A
and now let's only deal with

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.550
the valence electrons.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.985
And so this would be 0 and
there's another atom A--

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.620
0--

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.830
and this would be A2 and we've
been through this before.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.810
Let's just take--

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:37.940
we know that we get splitting
and we get a sigma bonding

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.820
orbital and a sigma star
anti-bonding orbital.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.990
Well, let's start adding some
atoms here, additional atoms.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.230
What do we get?

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.680
Well, let's just try
for A sub N--

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.436
lots of atoms. What do we get?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.640
We end up with lots of states.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.460
Remember, we have to have
conservation of states.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.840
So for every atom we add--

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.410
let's say this is copper,
for example, which

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.960
has an s1, one s.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.880
It's an odd number
of electrons.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.990
So every time I add a copper to
this, I add extra states.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.870
And then what do I do?

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.510
I start filling them using
Aufbau, just like we've done

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:40.140
in the past. Well, if we keep
going, and by the way, not to

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:49.030
scale, it starts looking like
a whole bunch of states.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.370
And this energy level here,
these energies, what?

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.180
We know for hydrogen,
this is what?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.560
Minus 13.6 electron volts.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.110
So what are we dealing with
here in terms of state

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.330
differences?

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:09.550
Well, let's take 10 to the 23rd
atoms and let's see if we

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.800
can calculate energy.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.910
Well, let's take for copper--

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.110
the molar volume of
copper is what?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:22.220
7.11 centimeter cube for mole.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:22.790
All right.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.510
And that's N to the 23rd--

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:32.310
actually, 6.02 times 10
to the 23rd atoms.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.930
And let's just ask ourselves,
what's the sort of range here?

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.720
Well, we know it's 13.6 here.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.470
We know that's 0.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.820
We're all friends.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.880
So let's call it 10 ev,
just for grins.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.240
Not a bad number.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.600
And let's ask ourselves, well,
if we've got 10 to the 23rd

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.340
atoms and 10 ev-- let's take 10
ev over 10 to the 23rd and

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.000
you get what?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:14.940
Well, 10 to the minus
22 ev per state.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.370
That's small.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.120
That's really, really, really,
really small and if you

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.800
convert that to joules,
you end up with 10 to

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.690
the minus 41 joules.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.990
That's really small.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.160
So what are we saying?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.310
We're saying that this
organization here--

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.850
when we and put a lot of atoms
in there, we end up with what

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.060
amounts to a band.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.925
A band of states.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.150
And what do we do?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.790
We populate this band just like
we did using the Aufbau

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.910
principle, but what does
it really look like?

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.550
Well, in the case of copper,
you remember,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:19.810
copper has a 1s electron.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:28.660
Copper is 3d10s1.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.490
If we start filling start this
band, we're going to get--

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:47.900
and so we start filling and we
get up here and we find that

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.890
we end up with a half-filled
band, because there are states

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.916
that are not occupied.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.290
But remember, the distance
between this guy and this guy,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.680
an occupied and unoccupied
state, is only 10 to

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.020
the minus 41 joules.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.650
So that's pretty small.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.980
10 to the minus 22
electron volts.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:21.530
To give you an example, 0.025
electron volts, which is, if

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.120
you want to convert that to
temperature, that's about 300

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.160
degrees Kelvin.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.350
So very, very small energy.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.640
So that means if I were to take
and if I were to apply a

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.750
potential here, then
what happens?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.960
Well, I add a little energy--
and I don't

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.250
have to add much energy--

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.120
and it's very easy for me to
promote one or more of these

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.600
electrons up into the
above here and

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.560
then I can get migration.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.200
So the endpoint is that if we
apply a potential, we end up

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:09.830
with conductivity, which
is what we were after.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.100
Moreover, we can say
a few more things.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.590
If I shine--

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.560
now this is a sort of
mixed metaphor here.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.180
This is an energy diagram and
this some plates on an

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.270
electrode so be a little
bit careful.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.370
We shine photons
on this thing.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.130
What happens?

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.560
What's the energy of the
photons, of light?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.190
Between 200 or 400 and
700 nanometers.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.330
It's about one electron volt.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.890
So there's plenty of electron
volts here.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.500
I'm going to-- with a metal,
not only will I have

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.270
conductivity, but there'll be
enough energy here to promote

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:50.010
electrons and those electrons
will move around and we'll end

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.710
up with re-emission and we
end up with opaqueness.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.660
In other words, we absorb light
and readmit it and so we

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:05.930
end up with, in the case
of a metal, luster.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.400
So there's a couple of things.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.530
So if we recall back here--

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.680
we're talking about high
electrical conductivity.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.250
We had-- we need to say
a lot more about that,

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.500
but we're OK here.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.940
But Drude, it was OK as well.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.000
High thermal conductivity,
Drude did that.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.100
That was fine.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100
Luster.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.590
OK, So it works for copper,
seems to be OK.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.180
But what about another one?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.830
Like, say, beryllium.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.850
What's with beryllium?

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.900
Well, beryllium is 2s2s2.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.270
So now let's draw the
thing for beryllium.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.290
We have beryllium.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:56.900
We have-- must be a 2s and now
it's 2p and we populate this.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.040
And now we want to
add a beryllium--

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.530
n beryllium atoms, all right?

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.980
What's happening?

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.550
well, it'll be a little bit.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.270
We got this band that we've
talked about earlier.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.680
Now we go to fill it.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.390
So we're filling these guys
and we fill it, and lo and

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.740
behold, we find out that we fill
it all the way to the top

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.220
and so we're screwed.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.470
We have no conductivity.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.540
What I can imagine now is
there's 100 computers in here.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.910
50 of them have Skype.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.750
Guess what's going to happen?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.570
By the end of the
day, there'll be

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.410
50 things up there.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.910
So we know beryllium's metal
and it has conductivity.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.410
So what's the deal?

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:52.560
Well, it turns out that while
beryllium has the 2s band

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.280
full, the 2p orbitals
still are there.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.745
They're still there and
so there's going

00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:06.410
to be a band unfilled.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.210
There's going to be a band
for the 2p orbitals.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.690
Well, guess what?

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:24.650
It turns out that the way I've
drawn it, the 2p band overlaps

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.180
the 2s band.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:33.110
And so what that means is that I
can promote into the 2p band

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.940
and I can achieve
my conductivity.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.850
So that's another-- so we solved
the problem of the

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.940
filled s-orbitals,
and we've got

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.800
conductivity in both cases.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:55.760
So we're OK so far, but Drude
wasn't far behind.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.750
What can we say about
insulators?

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.170
It looks like we
have a problem.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.210
Well, let's take a look
at another example.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.650
And let's try carbon.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.170
Well, we know carbon is what?

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.420
2s2p2.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.650
And so we can go--

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.470
and we know, by the way, that
most of the time carbon will

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.100
hybridize and so we'll
end up with 2sp3.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.940
So n equals 2sp3 hybridized.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.820
So we see that happen.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.440
And we also know that carbon's
not a metal and that we have

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.470
strong bonds.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.720
In the structure that we're
going to talk about, they're

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.440
covalent bonds and so they're
very strong bonds.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.690
So let's do this.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.720
Carbon in the gas phase--

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:21.160
we have 2s and 2p.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.540
We know that what happens is we
end up with hybridization

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.030
and so we ends up and
we fill these guys.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.870
So that's what we get.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:46.620
Now this would be for diamond
in the gas phase.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.780
So with this hybridization,
we get bands.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.220
We start adding carbon atoms
to this and what do we get?

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:04.280
Well, we get a band that's
the 2p band.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.820
The sp3 band is different
looking than the bands for

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:14.430
magnesium or copper or beryllium
in that there's a

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.080
separation between the sigma
and the sigma-star

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.500
anti-bonding orbitals.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:31.860
So we start doing these guys
up using Aufbau, and we

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:40.650
discover that there's an energy
gap e sub g between the

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.180
sigma bonding orbital
part of the band and

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.030
the sigma-star band.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.150
So what's happening?

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.480
Well, that's actually
pretty good sized.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.220
It's about 5.4 electron volts.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.020
Now compare that with what?

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:07.250
Visible light is around
one electron volt.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.110
So now we have a very, very
different situation and

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.010
there's some terminology
we need to have here.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.870
This is the so-called conduction
band and this is

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:23.530
the so-called valence.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.210
band.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.210
Valence band and conduction
band.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.820
So in order for us to get
electrical conductivity, we

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:39.500
have to somehow promote an
electron across the 5.4

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.090
electron-volt band gap.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:50.500
This is the so-called
band gap.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.540
Now we know that visible light
is about 1 electron volt so we

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.910
know that's not going
to do it.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.870
And in fact, we might expect
that even a diamond is what?

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.480
Transparent to visible light.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.710
So if the photons come in, if
there's no promotion, there's

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.870
no mission, transparency
to visible light.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:15.390
So that's a big number.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.740
Let's try another one.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.710
Let's try silicon.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:30.970
Now I'm going down group four,
where silicon is going to be

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.690
also sp3 hybridization.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.450
So we can do that, only
this time over

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.800
here, carbon is what?

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.040
n equals 2.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:53.980
For silicon, n equals 3 and so
we can do the same thing.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.950
Here's the 3s.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.200
Here's the 3p.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:06.270
And we hybridize and we end up
with before and then we end up

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:12.300
with a band, same kind of band
structure where this is a

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:20.980
sigma-star, star, this is e
sub g, this is the valence

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.200
band, conduction band.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.270
Now we have states up
here, but in this

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.930
case, what do you figure?

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.040
n equals 3.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.290
So those valence electrons are
hanging out further away from

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.860
the nucleus.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.300
And we know generally that the
energy drops off, the valence

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.840
electron energy drops off
as we get further

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.760
away from the nucleus.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.040
So you might expect that the
energy of this gap would be a

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.360
little bit smaller and indeed.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:53.760
it is.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.090
Very fortunate for us, it's
1.1 electron volts.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.340
Now we're getting close.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:15.830
And so this is 1/4 or even 1/5
of that for carbon and

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.850
remember, visible light
is on the order of

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.700
one electron volt.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.700
So one, one and half
electron volts.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.190
So what happens?

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:32.560
This is close enough so that
we get semi-conduction.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.410
It's called a semiconductor and
we'll make a definition.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:55.030
If the band gap is greater than
3 electron volts, we call

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:00.160
it an insulator.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.976
If the band gap is less than--
well, let's give it a range.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:24.880
1 to 3 electron volts, we call
it a semiconductor and of

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.280
course, if the band
gap is equal to 0,

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.340
we call it a metal.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:39.040
So that's a distinction, which
is a little bit arbitrary, but

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.450
pretty good.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.830
So now, if I take a look at
silicon, what do I see?

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.340
Well, if I had a piece of
silicon here as opposed to

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.200
diamond and I looked at
it, it would be gray.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.680
We would have color and the
reason it would have color is

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.210
because I get some promotion
here and I get re-emission and

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.730
so now I get color.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.835
So it's not transparent
to visible light.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.100
OK.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.520
Let's take a look in general
at what we--

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.230
what we're talking about
is photoexcitation.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.120
Now this is a diagram
which is--

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.710
you should have in
your aid sheet.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.680
Sooner or later, you should
have it in your aid sheet.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.110
OK.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.180
So let's draw a general band.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.410
Here's our two bands.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.500
This is the valence band.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:56.630
This is the conduction band
and we have a band gap.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:07.480
And now what happens if
I were a photon here?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.910
Well, I guess it depends.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.380
If the photon--

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:17.740
if e photon greater than e band
gap, then what happens?

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:24.570
I get promotion of an electron
up from the valence band to

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.630
the conduction band.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.940
OK.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.210
So then what happens?

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.865
Well, the photon is quantized.

00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:34.610
It's one shot.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.570
The photon's gone.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.070
Now I guess we need to settle
one little thing.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.520
What happens if the photon
is really a lot greater

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.460
than the band gap?

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.030
In another words, let's say it's
a million electron volts

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.010
or something like that.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:50.260
Well, for purposes of 3.091,
what we're going to assume is

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:58.820
that any excess energy
goes to heat.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.290
Let's not worry about what
happens for other things.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.850
In fact, that's not far off.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.990
Some of these LEDs that you
see, they get warm.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.600
So there is some heat.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.500
So the photon--

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.450
once it goes away, I get--

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.890
the electron falls back down.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.410
Well, if the electron falls back
down, then what do I get?

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.250
I get another photon out, but
now I've basically built

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.900
myself a diode or some
kind of device.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.150
That photon--

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.610
the energy of the photon
is equal to what?

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.320
It's equal to the band
gap, which is

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.160
equal to HC over lambda.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.780
So I can adjust the wavelength
here if I can

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.790
adjust the band gap.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.720
See where we're going
with this?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.510
Well, what happens if I--

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:18.700
let's say I hook this up to a
resistor and I draw a current.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.230
Well, as long as I keep the
light shining on here,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.650
photons, then I can keep
promoting these guys, and I

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.820
can keep drawing current.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.020
So what do I have?

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.190
I have something that
I can generate

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:39.500
electricity with light.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.600
And so that's sort
of solar-powered

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.390
something, isn't it?

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.760
We can generate current.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.850
What happens if I take--

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.320
and now instead of doing that,
I hook up a battery to this

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.070
thing and now I pump
current in here?

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.980
I pump current in here.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:03.520
In that case, I can force
the electrons up here.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:10.480
So I can force electrons to go
in the reverse and I could

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.410
make a photosensor or I could
force the electrons up here

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.530
and let them come back down
and I know this wavelength

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:24.350
here, I can make a
light-emitting diode.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:28.470
So just this one little concept
here, which is very

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:38.830
simplified, gives us the basis
for photovoltaics.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.000
And that's exactly
the way it works.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.950
OK.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.120
Let's put this in another way.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:01.380
Let's plot the percent
absorption.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.490
In other words, if the energy's

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.870
high enough, I absorb--

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:12.730
versus wavelength this way and
since energy is inversely

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.840
proportional to wavelength, we
have energy going this way.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.570
Let's put some numbers
in here.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:30.370
Let's say this is 400, this is
700 and this is Professor

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.620
Sadoway's dreaded nanometers.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:42.970
So this is visible light and
let's put carbon on there.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.500
Well, if you do the calculation,
convert iy, it

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:53.860
turns out that for carbon, with
this band gap, you end up

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.160
with behavior where if
the energy is above

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.480
the band gap, I get--

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.800
well, let's call this 100.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.430
That's 0, right?

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.110
I get 100% absorption.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.320
When I get to the band
gap, below the

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.420
band gap, what happens?

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.380
Well, I drop off and
it goes like that.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.960
In the case of carbon, this
wavelength, right, which is,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.565
by the way, called the
absorption edge--

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:35.910
that number comes out
to be about 229.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:47.210
If I try it with silicon,
that number--

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:53.930
so this would be carbon, this
would be silicon and carbon--

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.660
1125.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.470
All right.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:05.740
So the absorption edge for
silicon is 1125, which means

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.930
it absorbs in the visible range
and so that's the way we

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.960
get the luster.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.470
And this would be in the what?

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:15.720
Infrared.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.320
And this would be in the UV
region, if you wanted to--

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.780
which would be far hard UV and
this would be far infrared.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.110
OK.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:37.840
This is the paper--

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.440
Heitler and London's paper.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.720
It's in German and you
can see in Zurich.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.010
And this is their
original paper.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.620
You can go down to the library
and you can get this original

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.790
paper and if you know how
to read German, it's--

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.040
we have it.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.470
This is some of the
original paper.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:00.180
You notice the Schrodinger
equation up there.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.130
Nasty--

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.950
really nasty, but this
is the calculations.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.700
This is radius.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:09.500
This is energy and you can see
a point here where you get an

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.520
energy minimum and that's
where the bands operate.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.870
This is another way
to look at it.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.580
This would be the bottom of the
bonding orbital or the top

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.160
of the anti-bonding orbitals.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.020
This is another way to look at
what we've drawn so far.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.060
Somebody is talking.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.070
Something you guys ought
to know, this room is

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.350
acoustically perfect.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:43.470
If you pass gas in the back
row, I'll hear it, OK?

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.070
So if you're talking up
there, I'll hear it.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.870
OK.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.790
So you can see what's
going on here.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.780
We've drawn that and this
another way to look at it.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.380
By the way, there's a mistake
in your book that

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.320
doesn't make any sense.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.570
2s3p--

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.770
it's 2p in the description
for beryllium.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.350
OK, this is another
way to look at it.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.650
This is in the archival notes.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.640
It's one of the few pieces of
the archival notes which I

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.930
don't understand.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.200
So don't worry about that.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.370
OK.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.280
Here's what happens when you--

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.940
where we illustrated this where
you apply a potential.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.200
What happens is you depopulate
the bonding orbitals, and you

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.520
populate the antibonding
orbitals rules, and you get

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.320
conduction.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.500
This is another--

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.750
this is the right way
to look at it.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.370
This sort of illustrates the
things we've gone through the

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.270
whole time.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:45.680
A metal has no band gap.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.150
That no band gap is achieved
either by half-filled set of

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.190
orbitals or overlap
between one or

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.920
between different levels.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:02.950
An insulator has a large band
gap and a semiconductor has a

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.360
sort of intermediate band gap.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.930
Let's get a little--

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.010
sort of wet your whistle for
your reading for next Tuesday.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.560
I think we have Monday
lecture on Tuesday.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.570
If you go over to
the reactor--

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.130
they have a reactor
here at MIT--

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:26.650
once a week, a truck backs up
and it's full of silicon logs.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.780
These things are about 12 inches
in diameter and they're

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.140
about this tall and they bring
them into the reactor and

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.460
they're irradiated
with neutrons.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.390
Well, what do you
think happens?

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:46.250
Since everybody in here knows
the Periodic Table by heart,

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.130
what's the next atom--
what's the next

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.030
element over from silicon?

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.160
Phosphorus.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.670
OK.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.860
So guess what?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.850
You take and you irradiate
the silicon.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.440
You absorb a neutron.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.690
It adds one to z, doesn't it?

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.890
And it becomes phosphorus.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:09.560
Well, phosphorus has one more
electron than silicon.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:17.630
So I have implanted phosphorus
into silicon by transmutation.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.860
And there's one more electron
that's in there.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.610
Now where's it come from?

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.350
I don't know.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.170
The electron bank, right?

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.000
But what do you figure the
energy of that guy is?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.550
Well, it's a lot higher than
the electrons in silicon.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.600
And so guess what?

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.000
That electron, we'll find out,
doesn't reside down here.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.880
It resides up here or
very close to that.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.830
So that's what's called--

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.780
and we'll talk about it next
time-- it's called doping,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.850
only now we're doping it in
a special kind of way.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:53.510
OK.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.870
We've got-- let's keep going.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.800
I want to get this
one up there.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.050
There we go.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.990
OK.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.900
Now-- so far we've talked
about photons.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.050
They're a one shot deal.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:33.430
What about thermal excitation?

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.700
Well, we can make our-- the same
drawing we have in the

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.850
past. We got our material here
where we have a valence band,

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:46.140
conduction band, and
now we put--

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:54.780
we add thermal energy.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.340
By the way, what's the one
electron volt in temperature?

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.040
Just to give you a feel--

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.060
one electron volt is 11,600
degrees Kelvin if you convert

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.420
that to temperature.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.650
So one electron volt seems like
a small number, but in

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.830
temperature, is pretty warm.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:11.460
OK.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:19.480
So now the thermal
energy is what?

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.730
It's constant.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.950
Unlike the photons, which
are one off, right?

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:28.980
So it's constant.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.530
So what happens?

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:39.762
Now I take an electron from the
valence band and I promote

00:41:39.762 --> 00:41:44.010
it up here.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.020
So it looks sort of like--

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.360
so far up there with photons.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.080
But there's one critical
difference.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.730
It stays up there.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.290
It stays up there because
the energy is constant.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.290
So what does that mean?

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:03.225
Well, it leaves behind
a broken bond.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.240
And that broken bond has a lot
of energy, and in fact, it

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.900
doesn't like to stick around.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.500
So given a chance, it'll move.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.850
It's like a hot potato
and so that broken

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.040
bond is called a hole.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.170
We're not too imaginative.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.610
It's a hole in the lattice.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.200
But it has high energy.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.770
So what's the deal
with this hole?

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.050
Well, this is--

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:51.580
a hole is a 0 in a
land of minus 1.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.380
So what does it mean?

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.915
It's actually net positive.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.570
So now in the case of thermal
excitation, I end up with an

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:09.070
electron in the conduction
band and a hole

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.200
in the valence band.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:16.160
So I end up with an electron in
the conduction band and a

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.800
hole and the electrical
engineers call this p.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.550
They're not very imaginative
either-- positive in the

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.590
valence band.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.720
So we get 241.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.940
We get two charge carriers
for every event.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.420
That, we get one.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.035
This, we get two charge carriers
for every event.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.770
So now we have what?

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.770
Let's ask ourselves,
what's the--

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.340
can we do a little
math on this?

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.940
And the broken bond, by the
way, is a hole and so the

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:13.660
number of electrons is also
equal to the number of holes

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.210
because it's a one for one,
and in the electrical

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.060
engineering world, they
say n equals p.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.000
And so we can now go back and
say something about this

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.830
conductivity.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:36.570
We can do some calculations here
and we can calculate the

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:42.730
conductivity due to the
electrical connectivity, and

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:47.920
it's really the sum over i of
n of i, which would be the

00:44:47.920 --> 00:45:00.430
number of the population
of carriers times--

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.510
that's the value of the charge
on the carrier--

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.110
times something called
the mobility.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.570
OK, so what's the mobility?

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:22.510
Well, you could imagine that
these electrons have to move

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.500
back and forth in the lattice
and in a metal versus a

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.500
covalence solid or something
like that, it might be a

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.350
little bit different.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.340
The resistance might be
different and so--

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.890
in fact, it is.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:40.660
mu i is equal to the velocity of
the charge carrier divided

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.440
by the electric field.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:47.840
OK.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.090
So we're almost there.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.880
Now we need to-- and we can
simplify this because of the n

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.590
equals p business, and we can
say that the electrical

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.790
conductivity is equal to what?

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:12.760
It's equal to n sub e times e,
which is the electronic charge

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:20.760
times mu sub e plus n sub h,
which would be the holes, the

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.690
electronic charge,
times mu sub h.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:30.610
But since n is equal to p, we
end up with n sub e times the

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:38.870
electronic charge times
mu sub e plus u sub h.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:40.490
OK.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:43.600
And so that-- what we really
need to get is this.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.450
Well, we don't have time to go
through that, but from a

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.930
quantum mechanical calculation,
we can get that.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.740
n sub e is equal to what?

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:58.700
It's equal to some constant
times T to 3/2 times the

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:10.070
exponent of minus E sub g
over 2k sub B times T.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.650
So what is all this stuff?

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.790
Well, this is a constant.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.370
This is the temperature.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.370
This is the band gap.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:20.340
So it's a representation
of the binding.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.090
What's down here?

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.840
Well, k sub B is Boltzmann's
constant.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:36.020
This is absolute temperature
and so this represents the

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:40.895
disruptive force.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.860
So it's a balance between how
tightly they're bound and how

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.810
much energy I've
got to do this.

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.115
Well, let's--

00:47:54.115 --> 00:47:56.000
we've got one minute.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.090
Let's do a quick calculations
for silicon, just to

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:01.960
close the loop here.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:08.540
For silicon at room temperature,
that number comes

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:15.560
out 1.3 times 10 to the 10th
per centimeter cubed.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.310
Say well, that's billions.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.260
That's a big deal.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.980
What about copper at
room temperature?

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:31.800
Well, that number comes out
about 8.5 times 10 to the 22.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.950
Now we're talking big numbers.

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:38.190
So there's a 10 to the 12th
difference between these two

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:42.630
Well, let's take a quick look
before we finish up.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.790
OK.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.580
This is the band gap as a
function of position in the

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.120
Periodic Table.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.690
Now you guys ought to be able
to rationalize this.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.460
Lead is a metal, bigger
atoms you can see.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.690
10 actually comes
in two flavors.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.320
Gray and white and
one of them--

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.550
I think it's white--

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.250
actually forms covalent
bonds and they use

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.880
tin for night vision.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.860
Think about where that
band gap is.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.980
But here's the punch line.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.390
We're trying to rationalize
this large difference in

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.420
conductivity.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.630
Well, there's copper up there
at 10 to the 7th, there

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:20.820
silicon at 10 to the minus 4 and
ten to the minus 4, 10 to

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.060
the minus-- about 10 to the
12th or thereabouts--

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.490
and so, lo and behold, this--

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:30.660
we were able to rationalize
with these fairly simple

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.880
models, the range of
conductivities that go all the

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.060
way from metals to

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.150
semiconductors and even diamond.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.730
Look at diamond--

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.630
10 to the minus 11.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.660
You can rationalize that
the band gap--

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.620
where's the band gap?

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.050
5.4 electron volts.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.550
OK, we're out of time.
