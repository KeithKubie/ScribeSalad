00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.070
We are on problem number 19.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.120
If a, b, c, and f are four
non-zero numbers-- I don't

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.900
know where they got f.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.850
I would have expected a d-- but
a, b, c, and f are four

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.050
non-zero numbers, then all of
the following proportions are

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.990
equivalent except-- OK.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.870
So this is interesting.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.440
This is one where you have to
work through all of them.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.759
So choice a, a/f is
equal to b/c.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.460
Let's see, choice b says
f/c is equal to b/a.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.630
So the real simple way of
doing this, let's cross

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.650
multiply all of them,
essentially, right?

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.900
So we can cross multiply.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.110
If we multiply both sides by,
essentially, fc-- and that's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.030
what cross multiplying is-- so
we said a times c, ac is equal

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.460
to bf, right?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.600
a times c is equal
to b times f.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.770
And you can get there
multiplying both sides by f

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.860
and multiplying both
sides by c.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.940
If we cross multiply on
this side, we have

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.520
af is equal to bc.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.380
This is an f here.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.250
ac is equal to bf.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.205
Here we have af is
equal to bc.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:30.330
Let's see, choice c is
c/a is equal to f/b.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.910
What does this tell us?

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.100
This tells us that cb or
bc, bc is equal to af.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160
So these two are equal.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.790
These two are the same
thing, right?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.850
In d, we have a/c
is equal to b/f.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.150
Now if we cross multiply, you
get af is equal to bc.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.780
These are equal.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.660
I think you see a pattern.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.340
I suspect that e is going to
look very similar to these

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.680
three, and that this is
the different one.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.100
But just to do it,
I'll show you.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.450
Choice e has af/bc is equal
to 1, essentially.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.330
So that's af is equal to
bc, which is the same

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.080
thing as all these.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.410
So a is the one choice
that is different.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.470
ac is equal to bf is very
different than af is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.480
equal to bc, right?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.070
We're multiplying different
things.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.110
These are all the same.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.035
Hopefully you see that.

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:26.580
And that's multiplication is
communicative and all that.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.710
So it doesn't matter what
order, fa and af

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.780
are the same thing.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420
But here, we're multiplying.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.190
It was saying ac
is equal to bf.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.540
Let's do problem number 20.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.510
And you could actually, in that
last problem, literally

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.510
try it with four different
non-zero numbers.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.070
It actually should work out, if
you pick good numbers, if

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.120
you don't want to deal with
the abstract letters.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760
Problem number 20.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.640
For all numbers x and y, let
the operation square be

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:15.810
defined as x square y is
equal to xy minus y.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.660
If a and b are positive
integers, which of the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.225
following can be equal to 0?

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:25.330
So a, b positive integers.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.850
So which can be equal to 0?

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.000
So they're saying choice number
one is a square b.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.720
And that, we learned from here,
is the same thing as a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.613
times b, right?

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:38.930
It's just pattern matching,
wherever you see the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.950
x, you put an a.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.380
Wherever you see the
y, you put a b.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.410
So that's ab minus y.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.930
Sorry, ab minus b, right?

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.100
And can I come up with a
situation where this

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.590
comes out to be 0?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.160
Well sure.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.750
If a is 1, what happens
when a is 1?

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.550
If a is 1, then this translates
to b minus b, which

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.120
equals 0, right?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.060
And why did I think what
happens when a is 1?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.010
Well, this could also
be written as a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.500
minus 1 times b, right?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.740
If you just factored
out the b's.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.180
So I said well, if a is 1,
then this term becomes 0.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.800
So 1, this definitely
can be equal to 0.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.070
It's not always 0, but it can
be, especially if a is 1.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.140
OK, let's do choice two.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.460
They wrote a plus b square b.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.570
And what is that equal to?

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.480
Well, every time you saw an x,
replace it with a plus b.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.780
Every time you see a y,
replace it with b.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.760
So that's equal to-- that
equals-- I'll switch colors

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.290
for variety, just so you don't
get confused with this top

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:56.040
part-- that's equal to a plus
b times b-- times the second

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.940
term, times b-- minus the
second term, minus b.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.140
So we can't do what we did the
previous time, because now the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.120
term a plus b can't
equal 1, right?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.670
There's no circumstance under
a plus b equals 1.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.120
How?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.840
Because they're both positive,
they're both integers, right?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.820
So in order for this to equal 1,
one would have to be 1, and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.860
one would have to be 0.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.990
And neither of them
can be negative.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.680
So this can't equal 1.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.860
So that's not a situation in
which this is equal to 0.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.000
So let's see if we
can solve it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.950
What's that equal to 0?

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.060
And of course, b can't
be equal to 0.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.510
So we see a plus b.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.510
We could factor it out.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:50.380
We could say a plus b minus 1
times b is equal to 0, right?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.380
We know b can't equal 0 under
any circumstances, right?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.470
We know b can't equal 0, because
we're saying it's a

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.050
positive integer.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.100
And so this term would have
to be equal to 0.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.430
You could multiply this out and
you'll see where I got-- I

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.820
just factored out
just the same.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.260
I divided each of these terms
by b and factored it out.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.340
And then you're left with
a plus b minus 1, all

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.330
of that times b.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.250
So if b can't equal 0, can
a plus b minus 1 equal 0?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.170
Well a plus b minus
1 equals 0.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.560
Then a plus b would have to
equal 1, which I said, it just

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.580
can't happen.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.680
So under no circumstances can
choice two be equal to 0.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.040
And now, what does
choice three say?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.730
Choice three is a
square a plus b.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:53.230
And if we map it, that's a times
a plus b minus a plus b.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.560
And now here, once again, we can
factor out the a plus b.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.520
So we could write this as a
minus 1 times a plus b.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.130
And we want to see
if that equals 0,

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.080
see if this is possible.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.240
Well for this to be equal to 0,
either this term would have

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.810
to be 0, or this term, or
both of them, really.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.060
Can a plus b equal 0?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.210
No, because a is positive,
b is positive,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.910
they're both integers.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.640
Nothing's negative.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.570
They have to be greater than 0,
so there's no way that this

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.000
is going to be equal to 0.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.790
But can a minus one equal 0?

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.920
Well sure, a could be 1.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.830
If a is 1, then this expression
becomes 0.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.100
So this one also works.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.190
So our choices-- the
ones that could be

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.740
0-- are one and three.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.900
And that is choice E.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.960
I'll see you in the
next section.
