00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Given this central-difference formula for the second derivative,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
try to figure out essential difference formula for the fourth derivative.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Obviously, there's is a factor of 1/Δx⁴, but how much of these values of the functions do we need

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as we go one step to the left, two steps to the left, one step to the right, two steps to the right.

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Insert the correct numbers.
