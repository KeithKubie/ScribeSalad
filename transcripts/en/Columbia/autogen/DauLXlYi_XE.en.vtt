00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840
and coverage has probably run much
farther than facts on the ground so far

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
farther than facts on the ground so far
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.370
farther than facts on the ground so far
have warranted the issue itself in terms

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
have warranted the issue itself in terms
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.900

what are we talking about and so I hope

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650
what are we talking about and so I hope
 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.430
what are we talking about and so I hope
that today's panel can perhaps shed some

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
that today's panel can perhaps shed some
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280
that today's panel can perhaps shed some
light on on what this should mean

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
light on on what this should mean
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.750
light on on what this should mean
because we're still in a process in a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
because we're still in a process in a
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510
because we're still in a process in a
stage where these questions have not

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
stage where these questions have not
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.259
stage where these questions have not
been answered in any way definitively so

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269
been answered in any way definitively so
 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.469
been answered in any way definitively so

thank you a lot of things have been said
 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.990
thank you a lot of things have been said
so I'm going to try to give you my

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
so I'm going to try to give you my
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990
so I'm going to try to give you my
thought about an agreement and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
thought about an agreement and
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030
thought about an agreement and
negotiation in Afghanistan right now I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
negotiation in Afghanistan right now I
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.510
negotiation in Afghanistan right now I
of course it's pessimistic it's my

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520
of course it's pessimistic it's my
 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.050

I see three three possibilities

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
I see three three possibilities
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.399
I see three three possibilities
logically first no agreement because the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
logically first no agreement because the
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.889
logically first no agreement because the
coalition wins the war

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899
coalition wins the war
 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.370
coalition wins the war
Oh kind of win the war anyway the Kabul

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
Oh kind of win the war anyway the Kabul
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
Oh kind of win the war anyway the Kabul
government is able to stand alone and so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
government is able to stand alone and so
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050
government is able to stand alone and so
we can withdraw without an agreement the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
we can withdraw without an agreement the
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.219
we can withdraw without an agreement the
second possibility logically is 12 real

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
second possibility logically is 12 real
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.260
second possibility logically is 12 real
agreement with a political agreement

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
agreement with a political agreement
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.929
agreement with a political agreement
with the Taliban that is a government of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
with the Taliban that is a government of
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.840
with the Taliban that is a government of
coalition in Kabul and the third

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
coalition in Kabul and the third
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.349
coalition in Kabul and the third
possibility is what I would call a fake

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359
possibility is what I would call a fake
 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.069
possibility is what I would call a fake
agreement short-term agreement think

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
agreement short-term agreement think
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.889
agreement short-term agreement think
about for example Vietnam 73 I mean the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
about for example Vietnam 73 I mean the
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.639
about for example Vietnam 73 I mean the
agreement in Paris and then two years

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
agreement in Paris and then two years
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.130
agreement in Paris and then two years
after of course it's all over that could

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
after of course it's all over that could
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960
after of course it's all over that could
be that could be the third default

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
be that could be the third default
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.090
be that could be the third default
solution so what is likely what is not

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100
solution so what is likely what is not
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700
solution so what is likely what is not
likely what are the consequences of of

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710
likely what are the consequences of of
 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.460
likely what are the consequences of of
all that the first the first situation

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
all that the first the first situation
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.610
all that the first the first situation
would be no agreement and that's the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
would be no agreement and that's the
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.680
would be no agreement and that's the
current position of the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
current position of the
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.090
current position of the
US government means that what is called

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
US government means that what is called
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.110
US government means that what is called
an agreement actually is that the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
an agreement actually is that the
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.700
an agreement actually is that the
Taliban should should give up their arms

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710
Taliban should should give up their arms
 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.980
Taliban should should give up their arms
respect the Constitution and be nice

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990
respect the Constitution and be nice
 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.800
respect the Constitution and be nice
guys forever

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
guys forever
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.630
guys forever
okay that's of course not going to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
okay that's of course not going to
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.090
okay that's of course not going to
happen but that's the official line of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
happen but that's the official line of
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.580
happen but that's the official line of
the US government at the same time you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
the US government at the same time you
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.760
the US government at the same time you
have the second ID that Karzai should be

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770
have the second ID that Karzai should be
 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.030
have the second ID that Karzai should be
in charge of the negotiation and that's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
in charge of the negotiation and that's
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.700
in charge of the negotiation and that's
two key points that makes any kind of

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710
two key points that makes any kind of
 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.370
two key points that makes any kind of
diplomatic solution impossible so we are

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
diplomatic solution impossible so we are
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.400
diplomatic solution impossible so we are
going to to see that the first thing is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
going to to see that the first thing is
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.560
going to to see that the first thing is
that the trend currently is in favor of

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570
that the trend currently is in favor of
 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.480
that the trend currently is in favor of
the Taliban in Afghanistan there is no

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490
the Taliban in Afghanistan there is no
 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.630
the Taliban in Afghanistan there is no
change in the momentum the crime in

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
change in the momentum the crime in
 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.920
change in the momentum the crime in
Afghanistan is that your vote of wishful

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
Afghanistan is that your vote of wishful
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.290
Afghanistan is that your vote of wishful
thinking based on local anecdotes and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300
thinking based on local anecdotes and
 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.640
thinking based on local anecdotes and
Afghanistan is a big country you can

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650
Afghanistan is a big country you can
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.290
Afghanistan is a big country you can
always find a village where things are

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300
always find a village where things are
 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.380
always find a village where things are
going not so bad well it's coming

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
going not so bad well it's coming
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.380
going not so bad well it's coming
difficult because it's going difficult

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390
difficult because it's going difficult
 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.150
difficult because it's going difficult
to go to villages but still you can find

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
to go to villages but still you can find
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.380
to go to villages but still you can find
a village and I'm afraid of something is

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390
a village and I'm afraid of something is
 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.440
a village and I'm afraid of something is
that the current conversation but

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450
that the current conversation but
 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.260
that the current conversation but
Afghanistan is too much about a few

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270
Afghanistan is too much about a few
 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.690
Afghanistan is too much about a few
district in the south

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700
district in the south
 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.370
district in the south
what should be clear for everybody is

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380
what should be clear for everybody is
 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.580
what should be clear for everybody is
that even if the current military

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590
that even if the current military
 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.540
that even if the current military
operation in the south works and I don't

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550
operation in the south works and I don't
 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.520
operation in the south works and I don't
think it's going to work but even if it

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530
think it's going to work but even if it
 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.080
think it's going to work but even if it
works the momentum is still in favor of

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090
works the momentum is still in favor of
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.900
works the momentum is still in favor of
the Taliban because what we have seen in

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910
the Taliban because what we have seen in
 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.590
the Taliban because what we have seen in
2010 is the Taliban becoming really I

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600

you find who's back you find local
 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.409
you find who's back you find local
communities while working with the

communities while working with the

Taliban not necessarily for ideological
 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.809
Taliban not necessarily for ideological
reason but for the reasons and that

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819
reason but for the reasons and that
 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.900
reason but for the reasons and that
makes the current situation basically

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
makes the current situation basically
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.089
makes the current situation basically
impossible to a change in the long run

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099
impossible to a change in the long run
 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.370
impossible to a change in the long run
what makes military victory against the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380
what makes military victory against the
 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.620
what makes military victory against the
Taliban totally impossible is the fact

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630
Taliban totally impossible is the fact
 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.850
Taliban totally impossible is the fact
that I have the full support of the

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
that I have the full support of the
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.999
that I have the full support of the
Pakistani military and I don't see any

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009
Pakistani military and I don't see any
 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.879
Pakistani military and I don't see any

can even think about the beginning of
 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.540
can even think about the beginning of
withdrawal what's going to happen the

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.440
 
concretely what I am saying is that next

September October November some people

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720
September October November some people
 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720
September October November some people
are going to say well actually we need

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:16.730

elements I think it's a kind of

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.350
elements I think it's a kind of
 

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.469
elements I think it's a kind of
political problem if I'm reading the

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479
political problem if I'm reading the
 

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.270
political problem if I'm reading the
situation well and that could be that

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.280
situation well and that could be that
 

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.430
situation well and that could be that
could be I mean we will discuss that

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
could be I mean we will discuss that
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.900
could be I mean we will discuss that
later but obviously the idea that we

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:43.910
later but obviously the idea that we
 

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.590
later but obviously the idea that we
start we roll we roll in after July 2011

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600
start we roll we roll in after July 2011
 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.900
start we roll we roll in after July 2011

a government of coalition why because

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:01.840

literally where it's not possible

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:45.810
literally where it's not possible
 

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.710

political to say to people there is a

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720
political to say to people there is a
 

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.480

level of risk that we have to accept

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.490
level of risk that we have to accept
 

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.360
level of risk that we have to accept
because life is like that and zero risk

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.370
because life is like that and zero risk
 

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.860
because life is like that and zero risk
mean infinite cost that's the problem

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:57.870
mean infinite cost that's the problem
 

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.310
mean infinite cost that's the problem
from zero issue of the cost is is is

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320
from zero issue of the cost is is is
 

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.700
from zero issue of the cost is is is
incredibly high so for this reason the

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:04.710
incredibly high so for this reason the
 

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.410
incredibly high so for this reason the
most likely is that the next 18 months 2

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420
most likely is that the next 18 months 2
 

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.080
most likely is that the next 18 months 2
years is not going to do anything very

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.090
years is not going to do anything very
 

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.860
years is not going to do anything very
positive then if Obama is re-elected it

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:15.870
positive then if Obama is re-elected it
 

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.750
positive then if Obama is re-elected it
will probably be in a better situation

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760
will probably be in a better situation
 

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.240
will probably be in a better situation
to do something if it's a new president

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.250
to do something if it's a new president

the term movement was more appropriate
 

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.879

discreet geographic area is that this is

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.420
discreet geographic area is that this is
 

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.579
discreet geographic area is that this is
a coherent cohesive you know political

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:23.589
a coherent cohesive you know political

entity the Taliban in fact there were
 

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:30.119
entity the Taliban in fact there were
very few people that would you know

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:30.129
very few people that would you know
 

00:16:30.129 --> 00:16:31.949
very few people that would you know
there were a lot of people that were

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959
there were a lot of people that were
 

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:34.009

divergent affiliations throughout that

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:37.540
divergent affiliations throughout that
 

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.610
divergent affiliations throughout that
area so when you start to talk about who

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:41.620
area so when you start to talk about who
 

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.100
area so when you start to talk about who
you're negotiating with I mean it is it

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.110
you're negotiating with I mean it is it
 

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.590
you're negotiating with I mean it is it
is a question which our moderator raised

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600
is a question which our moderator raised
 

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.179
is a question which our moderator raised
right at the beginning who exactly is

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:48.189
right at the beginning who exactly is
 

00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:50.309
right at the beginning who exactly is
that and I think everybody needs to take

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319
that and I think everybody needs to take
 

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:52.949
that and I think everybody needs to take
that into account that means that the

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959
that into account that means that the
 

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.990
that into account that means that the
style and type of negotiation that

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000
style and type of negotiation that
 

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.970
style and type of negotiation that
you're going to do is going to is going

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:56.980
you're going to do is going to is going
 

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.439
you're going to do is going to is going
to rely on a different set of

00:16:58.439 --> 00:16:58.449
to rely on a different set of
 

00:16:58.449 --> 00:17:00.420
to rely on a different set of
interlocutors and and one set of

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.430
interlocutors and and one set of
 

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.030
interlocutors and and one set of
interlocutors based in Quetta or

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040
interlocutors based in Quetta or
 

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.750
interlocutors based in Quetta or
elsewhere delivering the Taliban is is

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760
elsewhere delivering the Taliban is is
 

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.909
elsewhere delivering the Taliban is is
basically not going to be possible so

00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919
basically not going to be possible so
 

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:11.370
basically not going to be possible so
what you're going to have is is a much

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:11.380
what you're going to have is is a much
 

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.819
what you're going to have is is a much
more you know a much more nuanced and

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:14.829
more you know a much more nuanced and
 

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.529
more you know a much more nuanced and
and broad conversation with a lot of

00:17:16.529 --> 00:17:16.539
and broad conversation with a lot of
 

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:19.860
and broad conversation with a lot of
different people but but the key is is

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:19.870
different people but but the key is is
 

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.919
different people but but the key is is
all of these other factions these other

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:22.929
all of these other factions these other
 

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:25.710
all of these other factions these other
criminal networks that are out there and

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720
criminal networks that are out there and
 

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.569
criminal networks that are out there and
then really understanding that a lot of

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:27.579
then really understanding that a lot of
 

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.720
then really understanding that a lot of
the conflict is locally driven and so

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:30.730
the conflict is locally driven and so
 

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.610
the conflict is locally driven and so
again one of the things that Gio

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:32.620
again one of the things that Gio
 

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.090
again one of the things that Gio
identified is that not everything is

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.100
identified is that not everything is
 

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.760
identified is that not everything is
ideological and it is in areas that the

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:38.770
ideological and it is in areas that the
 

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.649
ideological and it is in areas that the
conflict is not ideological that it may

00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:40.659
conflict is not ideological that it may
 

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:44.130
conflict is not ideological that it may
be straight political or economic

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:44.140
be straight political or economic
 

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.680
be straight political or economic
in nature that we have the opportunity

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.690
in nature that we have the opportunity
 

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.389
in nature that we have the opportunity
to explore a way forward and I think

00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:51.399
to explore a way forward and I think
 

00:17:51.399 --> 00:17:52.950
to explore a way forward and I think
that's very important for folks to

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960
that's very important for folks to
 

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.950
that's very important for folks to
understand because it's only the very

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960
understand because it's only the very
 

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.409
understand because it's only the very
narrow ideological conflict against the

00:17:58.409 --> 00:17:58.419
narrow ideological conflict against the
 

00:17:58.419 --> 00:18:01.200
narrow ideological conflict against the
West you know in support of

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.210
West you know in support of
 

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.980
West you know in support of
transnational sub state actors that is

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:04.990
transnational sub state actors that is
 

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.750
transnational sub state actors that is
you know our red line and so the big

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760
you know our red line and so the big
 

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.289
you know our red line and so the big
thing is is that you know local

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299
thing is is that you know local
 

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.840
thing is is that you know local
accommodation and community equities

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:15.850
accommodation and community equities
 

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.690
accommodation and community equities
have to be taken into account so you

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:18.700
have to be taken into account so you
 

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.490
have to be taken into account so you
know in the areas that we were operating

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:20.500
know in the areas that we were operating
 

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.139
know in the areas that we were operating
I'll discuss this just a little bit more

00:18:22.139 --> 00:18:22.149
I'll discuss this just a little bit more
 

00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:26.310
I'll discuss this just a little bit more
in depth you know people had some some

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320
in depth you know people had some some
 

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.070
in depth you know people had some some
basic asks of how they were able to

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080
basic asks of how they were able to
 

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.509
basic asks of how they were able to
better interact with their own

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:30.519
better interact with their own
 

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:34.620
better interact with their own
government and finding ways to address

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:34.630
government and finding ways to address
 

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.279
government and finding ways to address
those concerns can mitigate conflict in

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:38.289
those concerns can mitigate conflict in
 

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:40.139
those concerns can mitigate conflict in
a way and create some traction for the

00:18:40.139 --> 00:18:40.149
a way and create some traction for the
 

00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:43.320
a way and create some traction for the
state that will be drawn in sharp

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:43.330
state that will be drawn in sharp
 

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.690
state that will be drawn in sharp
contrast with what the Taliban is trying

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:45.700
contrast with what the Taliban is trying
 

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.320
contrast with what the Taliban is trying

negotiations on reconciliation of
 

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.730
negotiations on reconciliation of
reintegration to be successful though

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:53.740
reintegration to be successful though
 

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.860
reintegration to be successful though
the relationship between the center and

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:55.870
the relationship between the center and
 

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.879
the relationship between the center and
the periphery is going to have to be

00:18:56.879 --> 00:18:56.889
the periphery is going to have to be
 

00:18:56.889 --> 00:19:00.419
the periphery is going to have to be
better defined and the narratives are

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:00.429
better defined and the narratives are
 

00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:01.799
better defined and the narratives are
going to have to be synchronized and

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:01.809
going to have to be synchronized and
 

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:04.500
going to have to be synchronized and
what I mean by that is is what is

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:04.510
what I mean by that is is what is
 

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.120
what I mean by that is is what is
happening in Kabul in terms of

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.130
happening in Kabul in terms of
 

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.639
happening in Kabul in terms of
reconciliation is not necessarily what's

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:08.649
reconciliation is not necessarily what's
 

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:09.960
reconciliation is not necessarily what's
happening at the district level and

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:09.970
happening at the district level and
 

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.029
happening at the district level and
we've got to find a way to make sure

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039
we've got to find a way to make sure
 

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:14.220
we've got to find a way to make sure
that the districts are on the same page

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.230
that the districts are on the same page
 

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.960
that the districts are on the same page
as the province which is on the same

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:15.970
as the province which is on the same
 

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.080
as the province which is on the same
page as Kabul and in terms of the

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.090
page as Kabul and in terms of the
 

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.419
page as Kabul and in terms of the
narratives you know is it a political

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:21.429
narratives you know is it a political
 

00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:25.110
narratives you know is it a political
war is it an ideological war and who is

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120
war is it an ideological war and who is
 

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.500
war is it an ideological war and who is
the war against so you know as one

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:28.510
the war against so you know as one
 

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.549
the war against so you know as one
example of that soldiers who are serving

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559
example of that soldiers who are serving
 

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.430
example of that soldiers who are serving
in the Afghan government in the in the

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440
in the Afghan government in the in the
 

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.639
in the Afghan government in the in the
Afghan National Army expressed concern

00:19:38.639 --> 00:19:38.649
Afghan National Army expressed concern
 

00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:40.440
Afghan National Army expressed concern
to us that they said look every day we

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.450
to us that they said look every day we
 

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.730
to us that they said look every day we
are fighting folks that are

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:41.740
are fighting folks that are
 

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.560
are fighting folks that are
ideologically aligned with the Taliban

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:43.570
ideologically aligned with the Taliban
 

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.830
ideologically aligned with the Taliban
and then we see that the negotiation is

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840
and then we see that the negotiation is
 

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.240
and then we see that the negotiation is
all about the Taliban and not

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.250
all about the Taliban and not
 

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.980
all about the Taliban and not
necessarily about our local concerns and

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:49.990
necessarily about our local concerns and
 

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.350
necessarily about our local concerns and
that concerns us because we're trying to

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360
that concerns us because we're trying to
 

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.350
that concerns us because we're trying to
support the state and so that narrative

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360
support the state and so that narrative
 

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.690
support the state and so that narrative
has to come together and then the last

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:57.700
has to come together and then the last
 

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.109
has to come together and then the last
point

00:19:58.109 --> 00:19:58.119
point
 

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:00.449
point
I actually agree with Zeile again is

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:00.459
I actually agree with Zeile again is
 

00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:04.199
I actually agree with Zeile again is
that you know red lines remain for the

00:20:04.199 --> 00:20:04.209
that you know red lines remain for the
 

00:20:04.209 --> 00:20:08.189
that you know red lines remain for the
West in terms of the affiliation with

00:20:08.189 --> 00:20:08.199
West in terms of the affiliation with
 

00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:10.229
West in terms of the affiliation with
al-qaeda or other other groups and so

00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:10.239
al-qaeda or other other groups and so
 

00:20:10.239 --> 00:20:11.959
al-qaeda or other other groups and so
that will have to be taken into account

00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:11.969
that will have to be taken into account
 

00:20:11.969 --> 00:20:16.739
that will have to be taken into account
but all of that adds up to elements that

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:16.749
but all of that adds up to elements that
 

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:19.879
but all of that adds up to elements that
make up a negotiation strategy so you

00:20:19.879 --> 00:20:19.889
make up a negotiation strategy so you
 

00:20:19.889 --> 00:20:23.699
make up a negotiation strategy so you
know I think that while it's very easy

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:23.709
know I think that while it's very easy
 

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:25.199
know I think that while it's very easy
to sit back and say okay nothing is

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:25.209
to sit back and say okay nothing is
 

00:20:25.209 --> 00:20:26.639
to sit back and say okay nothing is
working and and everything's falling

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:26.649
working and and everything's falling
 

00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:28.529
working and and everything's falling
apart actually if you do have those

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:28.539
apart actually if you do have those
 

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.089
apart actually if you do have those
elements in place and if people are

00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:30.099
elements in place and if people are
 

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:32.149
elements in place and if people are
considering them which in fact they are

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159
considering them which in fact they are
 

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:35.309
considering them which in fact they are
you do have the opportunity to move

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:35.319
you do have the opportunity to move
 

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:37.649
you do have the opportunity to move
forward and that change can happen very

00:20:37.649 --> 00:20:37.659
forward and that change can happen very
 

00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:40.769
forward and that change can happen very
quickly on the ground I think that you

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:40.779
quickly on the ground I think that you
 

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:42.419
quickly on the ground I think that you
know in highly kinetic environments

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:42.429
know in highly kinetic environments
 

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:44.009
know in highly kinetic environments
people can get it's very easy to get

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:44.019
people can get it's very easy to get
 

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:45.959
people can get it's very easy to get
pessimistic you see a lot of people

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:45.969
pessimistic you see a lot of people
 

00:20:45.969 --> 00:20:49.769
pessimistic you see a lot of people
dying you see a lot of problems but you

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:49.779
dying you see a lot of problems but you
 

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:51.629
dying you see a lot of problems but you
know wars do end and the way they end is

00:20:51.629 --> 00:20:51.639
know wars do end and the way they end is
 

00:20:51.639 --> 00:20:54.899
know wars do end and the way they end is
often through negotiation let me just I

00:20:54.899 --> 00:20:54.909
often through negotiation let me just I
 

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:57.329
often through negotiation let me just I
just want to give folks a little bit of

00:20:57.329 --> 00:20:57.339
just want to give folks a little bit of
 

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.309
just want to give folks a little bit of
a sense of what the current structure is

00:20:59.309 --> 00:20:59.319
a sense of what the current structure is
 

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:02.099
a sense of what the current structure is
because in Afghanistan the way is F and

00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:02.109
because in Afghanistan the way is F and
 

00:21:02.109 --> 00:21:05.299
because in Afghanistan the way is F and
the Afghan government have defined

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:05.309
the Afghan government have defined
 

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:07.289
the Afghan government have defined
reconciliation reintegration is a bit

00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:07.299
reconciliation reintegration is a bit
 

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.919
reconciliation reintegration is a bit
different than other parts of the world

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:09.929
different than other parts of the world
 

00:21:09.929 --> 00:21:12.929
different than other parts of the world
you know it's not a traditional DDR our

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:12.939
you know it's not a traditional DDR our
 

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.819
you know it's not a traditional DDR our
structure they literally come up with a

00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:14.829
structure they literally come up with a
 

00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:17.669
structure they literally come up with a
definition where reconciliation is a

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679
definition where reconciliation is a
 

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:20.039
definition where reconciliation is a
high level between the Karzai government

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:20.049
high level between the Karzai government
 

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:23.299
high level between the Karzai government
and you know let's say Taliban or others

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:23.309
and you know let's say Taliban or others
 

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:26.099
and you know let's say Taliban or others
and reintegration is really everybody

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:26.109
and reintegration is really everybody
 

00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:28.559
and reintegration is really everybody
who is not a senior senior decision

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:28.569
who is not a senior senior decision
 

00:21:28.569 --> 00:21:31.379
who is not a senior senior decision
maker and is a mid-level commander and

00:21:31.379 --> 00:21:31.389
maker and is a mid-level commander and
 

00:21:31.389 --> 00:21:34.859
maker and is a mid-level commander and
and in fact ICF's guidance to troops is

00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:34.869
and in fact ICF's guidance to troops is
 

00:21:34.869 --> 00:21:37.069
and in fact ICF's guidance to troops is
to support Afghan government efforts at

00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:37.079
to support Afghan government efforts at
 

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:39.929
to support Afghan government efforts at
reintegration on the ground so I would

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:39.939
reintegration on the ground so I would
 

00:21:39.939 --> 00:21:42.239
reintegration on the ground so I would
distinguish a little bit when you say

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:42.249
distinguish a little bit when you say
 

00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:44.159
distinguish a little bit when you say
that the military is absolutely against

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:44.169
that the military is absolutely against
 

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:46.769
that the military is absolutely against
any sort of negotiations on the ground

00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:46.779
any sort of negotiations on the ground
 

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:48.419
any sort of negotiations on the ground
and is looking for an absolute some sort

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:48.429
and is looking for an absolute some sort
 

00:21:48.429 --> 00:21:50.909
and is looking for an absolute some sort
of kinetic military victory in fact it's

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919
of kinetic military victory in fact it's
 

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:52.559
of kinetic military victory in fact it's
a much more pragmatic approach and

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:52.569
a much more pragmatic approach and
 

00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:54.569
a much more pragmatic approach and
that's that's part of what defines the

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:54.579
that's that's part of what defines the
 

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.749
that's that's part of what defines the
counterinsurgency strategy this

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:57.759
counterinsurgency strategy this
 

00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:01.859
counterinsurgency strategy this
two-tiered approach however you know

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:01.869
two-tiered approach however you know
 

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:04.199
two-tiered approach however you know
requires some caution because there have

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:04.209
requires some caution because there have
 

00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:06.119
requires some caution because there have
been a lot of disarmament programs in

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:06.129
been a lot of disarmament programs in
 

00:22:06.129 --> 00:22:07.389
been a lot of disarmament programs in
Afghanistan over the last

00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:07.399
Afghanistan over the last
 

00:22:07.399 --> 00:22:10.899
Afghanistan over the last
years you know including the disarmament

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:10.909
years you know including the disarmament
 

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:14.200
years you know including the disarmament
of the illegal armed groups effort and

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.210
of the illegal armed groups effort and
 

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.539
of the illegal armed groups effort and
several other efforts that have been put

00:22:16.539 --> 00:22:16.549
several other efforts that have been put
 

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:20.039
several other efforts that have been put
forward the challenge there is that

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:20.049
forward the challenge there is that
 

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:22.930
forward the challenge there is that
ordinarily in a wartime situation you

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:22.940
ordinarily in a wartime situation you
 

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.839
ordinarily in a wartime situation you
have some sort of peace settlement some

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:25.849
have some sort of peace settlement some
 

00:22:25.849 --> 00:22:28.599
have some sort of peace settlement some
sort of political accommodation and then

00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:28.609
sort of political accommodation and then
 

00:22:28.609 --> 00:22:29.799
sort of political accommodation and then
that's followed by a reconciliation

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:29.809
that's followed by a reconciliation
 

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:31.989
that's followed by a reconciliation
process in other words reconciliation is

00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:31.999
process in other words reconciliation is
 

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:33.639
process in other words reconciliation is
the process of after you've agreed to

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:33.649
the process of after you've agreed to
 

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:36.070
the process of after you've agreed to
stop shooting you're bringing folks back

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080
stop shooting you're bringing folks back
 

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.079
stop shooting you're bringing folks back
into the government and and that's

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:38.089
into the government and and that's
 

00:22:38.089 --> 00:22:41.320
into the government and and that's
usually paired with a DDR armed process

where you know you actually have

00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279
where you know you actually have
 

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.729
where you know you actually have
specific armed groups and then there

00:22:45.729 --> 00:22:45.739
specific armed groups and then there
 

00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:48.789
specific armed groups and then there

reintegrated and those sometimes one

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:52.700
reintegrated and those sometimes one
 

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.099
reintegrated and those sometimes one
happens and the other doesn't happen it

00:22:54.099 --> 00:22:54.109
happens and the other doesn't happen it
 

00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:55.180
happens and the other doesn't happen it
really depends on the nature of the

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.190
really depends on the nature of the
 

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.579
really depends on the nature of the
conflict you know in Afghanistan the

00:22:57.579 --> 00:22:57.589
conflict you know in Afghanistan the
 

00:22:57.589 --> 00:23:00.099

challenges they're trying to do several

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:00.109
challenges they're trying to do several
 

00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:01.779
challenges they're trying to do several
of these things at once so they're

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:01.789
of these things at once so they're
 

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:03.549
of these things at once so they're
actually trying to do a reintegration

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559
actually trying to do a reintegration
 

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:06.639
actually trying to do a reintegration
program or put it forward while in a

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:06.649
program or put it forward while in a
 

00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:09.339
program or put it forward while in a
kinetic war and we don't have the full

00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:09.349
kinetic war and we don't have the full
 

00:23:09.349 --> 00:23:11.409
kinetic war and we don't have the full
political settlement yet and I think

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:11.419
political settlement yet and I think
 

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:13.269
political settlement yet and I think
that's that's a bit of a challenge and

00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279
that's that's a bit of a challenge and
 

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:15.099
that's that's a bit of a challenge and
how you implement because what happens

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:15.109
how you implement because what happens
 

00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:17.320
how you implement because what happens
is some folks want to move forward with

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.330
is some folks want to move forward with
 

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.940
is some folks want to move forward with
programs and it's not going to take a

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:18.950
programs and it's not going to take a
 

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.489
programs and it's not going to take a
programmatic end to the to the war the

00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:21.499
programmatic end to the to the war the
 

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:25.450
programmatic end to the to the war the
other thing is is that what we're also

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.460
other thing is is that what we're also
 

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.849
other thing is is that what we're also
dealing with is is a conflict that is

00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:29.859
dealing with is is a conflict that is
 

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:32.289

toward the state and the challenge is is
 

00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:38.469
toward the state and the challenge is is
getting communities fully vested in the

and when that kind of initiative happens
you have a far better chance that they

clear that you know he did not want to

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:43.810
clear that you know he did not want to

you know transnational terrorism and in
that case it opens up an opportunity for

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:56.890
that case it opens up an opportunity for
 

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.800
that case it opens up an opportunity for
us to go in and re-engage him what were

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:58.810

for the US military one to stop
targeting him okay but that required

it's very easy to write this this off as
 

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.510
it's very easy to write this this off as
well that's warlordism and that's a

well that's warlordism and that's a
 

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.130
well that's warlordism and that's a
return to warlordism but at the same

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:29.140
return to warlordism but at the same
 

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.700

and and take over some of that area and
 

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.190
and and take over some of that area and
the interesting thing is is that to

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200
the interesting thing is is that to
 

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.690
the interesting thing is is that to
support somebody like that does not

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:51.700

what it what it does is it takes us out
 

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.570
what it what it does is it takes us out
of the conflict and it puts us in a more

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:21.580
of the conflict and it puts us in a more
 

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.240
of the conflict and it puts us in a more
facilitative role and interestingly you

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.250
facilitative role and interestingly you
 

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.630
facilitative role and interestingly you

in fact they were quite favorable to our
 

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.290
in fact they were quite favorable to our
involvement what they didn't like though

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:40.300
involvement what they didn't like though
 

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.270
involvement what they didn't like though
was a lot of elements that were

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:42.280

so understanding where those concerns
 

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.710
so understanding where those concerns
are coming from is a way to advance the

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720
are coming from is a way to advance the
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.900
are coming from is a way to advance the

of that comes together which gives

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:27.790
of that comes together which gives
 

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.570
of that comes together which gives
people a reason not to necessarily

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580
people a reason not to necessarily
 

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.520
people a reason not to necessarily
perpetuate conflict and in a lot of ways

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:32.530
perpetuate conflict and in a lot of ways
 

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.960
perpetuate conflict and in a lot of ways
you could argue okay that's that's

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:33.970
you could argue okay that's that's
 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.690
you could argue okay that's that's
probably why the moment have generally

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:36.700
probably why the moment have generally
 

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.100
probably why the moment have generally
chosen to side with the government

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.110
chosen to side with the government
 

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.240
chosen to side with the government
they're they're they're getting more

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.250
they're they're they're getting more
 

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.430
they're they're they're getting more
benefit by being part of the state than

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440
benefit by being part of the state than
 

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.870
benefit by being part of the state than
being in opposition to it same thing

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880
being in opposition to it same thing
 

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.409
being in opposition to it same thing
with the Shinhwa right and the co gianni

00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:46.419
with the Shinhwa right and the co gianni
 

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:48.600
with the Shinhwa right and the co gianni
though have had more of a difficult

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:48.610
though have had more of a difficult
 

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.640
though have had more of a difficult
relationship because there has been a

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:50.650
relationship because there has been a
 

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.770
relationship because there has been a
return of some of the poppy crops and

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:52.780
return of some of the poppy crops and
 

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.010
return of some of the poppy crops and
things like that but I would contest

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:56.020
things like that but I would contest
 

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.770
things like that but I would contest
that you know poppy is the only way to

00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:58.780
that you know poppy is the only way to
 

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.090
that you know poppy is the only way to
make money there's a lot of different

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.100
make money there's a lot of different
 

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.560
make money there's a lot of different
ways to make money and it's making sure

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:01.570
ways to make money and it's making sure
 

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.230
ways to make money and it's making sure
that people have access to that and

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240
that people have access to that and
 

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.000
that people have access to that and
again you can look at things like local

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.010
again you can look at things like local
 

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.880
again you can look at things like local
revenue generation and taxation and and

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:08.890
revenue generation and taxation and and
 

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.919
revenue generation and taxation and and
changes like that can show that the

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:10.929
changes like that can show that the
 

00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:12.690
changes like that can show that the
state is more responsive so the

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:12.700
state is more responsive so the
 

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.500
state is more responsive so the
possibility is out there so again the

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.510
possibility is out there so again the
 

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.490
possibility is out there so again the
final thing though I want to say is that

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500
final thing though I want to say is that
 

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.020
final thing though I want to say is that
you know for us to continue to make

being over the past few years people are
trying to you know to grapple with the

issue of what an earth they are about
 

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.199
issue of what an earth they are about
and how do we use this knowledge about

and how do we use this knowledge about
 

00:40:04.209 --> 00:40:06.150
and how do we use this knowledge about
what they are about to inform what has

what they are about to inform what has
 

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.359
what they are about to inform what has
to be done so I mean yeah if we had all

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:09.369
to be done so I mean yeah if we had all
 

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:11.160

interesting questions one could ask
 

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.569

00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:18.479
about what is to be done
I mean I'd only get through a couple of

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:18.489
I mean I'd only get through a couple of
 

00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:20.699
I mean I'd only get through a couple of
them but of course we generally start we

00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:20.709
them but of course we generally start we
 

00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:23.160
them but of course we generally start we
generally start with asking you know

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.170
generally start with asking you know
 

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.029
generally start with asking you know
broadly what is it did the Taliban want

00:40:26.029 --> 00:40:26.039
broadly what is it did the Taliban want
 

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:28.259
broadly what is it did the Taliban want
and you know quite often you can just

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:28.269
and you know quite often you can just
 

00:40:28.269 --> 00:40:29.819
and you know quite often you can just
get onto a website when you want to

00:40:29.819 --> 00:40:29.829
get onto a website when you want to
 

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:33.089
get onto a website when you want to
watch the workout what a movement is is

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:33.099
watch the workout what a movement is is
 

00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:36.120
watch the workout what a movement is is
about and you read the thing and you and

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.130
about and you read the thing and you and
 

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.440
about and you read the thing and you and
you memorize it and that's it but of

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:37.450
you memorize it and that's it but of
 

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.339
you memorize it and that's it but of
course the thing is that yeah it's not

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:41.349
course the thing is that yeah it's not
 

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:45.420
course the thing is that yeah it's not
quite as simple as that because they you

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:45.430
quite as simple as that because they you
 

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.449
quite as simple as that because they you
know the Taliban is the Taliban is far

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:48.459
know the Taliban is the Taliban is far
 

00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:50.400
know the Taliban is the Taliban is far
more than just a simply hierarchically

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:50.410
more than just a simply hierarchically
 

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.469
more than just a simply hierarchically
organized movement that you look at the

00:40:52.469 --> 00:40:52.479
organized movement that you look at the
 

00:40:52.479 --> 00:40:54.029
organized movement that you look at the
top of the hierarchy and that tells you

00:40:54.029 --> 00:40:54.039
top of the hierarchy and that tells you
 

00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:55.979
top of the hierarchy and that tells you
what the whole movement is about that

00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:55.989
what the whole movement is about that
 

00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:58.410
what the whole movement is about that
they even when you talk to Taliban foot

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:58.420
they even when you talk to Taliban foot
 

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.589
they even when you talk to Taliban foot
soldiers whereas I mean in reality they

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599
soldiers whereas I mean in reality they
 

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:04.349
soldiers whereas I mean in reality they
exercises a fair degree of autonomy in

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359
exercises a fair degree of autonomy in
 

00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:05.609
exercises a fair degree of autonomy in
the areas where they operate they say

00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:05.619
the areas where they operate they say
 

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:07.859
the areas where they operate they say
but we do listen to what our official

00:41:07.859 --> 00:41:07.869
but we do listen to what our official
 

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:10.349
but we do listen to what our official
spokesman says and it does influence us

00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359
spokesman says and it does influence us
 

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:14.849
spokesman says and it does influence us
some way so basically in trying to

00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:14.859
some way so basically in trying to
 

00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:16.469
some way so basically in trying to
understand there's I mean there's a you

00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:16.479
understand there's I mean there's a you
 

00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:17.969
understand there's I mean there's a you
know there is a sort of stargazing game

00:41:17.969 --> 00:41:17.979
know there is a sort of stargazing game
 

00:41:17.979 --> 00:41:19.259
know there is a sort of stargazing game
involved there trying to work out what

00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:19.269
involved there trying to work out what
 

00:41:19.269 --> 00:41:20.969
involved there trying to work out what
the Taliban are banned there's no single

00:41:20.969 --> 00:41:20.979
the Taliban are banned there's no single
 

00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.459
the Taliban are banned there's no single
text and there's no authoritative text

00:41:23.459 --> 00:41:23.469
text and there's no authoritative text
 

00:41:23.469 --> 00:41:25.709
text and there's no authoritative text
which you can say really defines what's

00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:25.719
which you can say really defines what's
 

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:27.509
which you can say really defines what's
drives the movement because there is an

00:41:27.509 --> 00:41:27.519
drives the movement because there is an
 

00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:29.549
drives the movement because there is an
awful lot of position play and a lot of

00:41:29.549 --> 00:41:29.559
awful lot of position play and a lot of
 

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:30.870
awful lot of position play and a lot of
the this is what has put out in the

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880
the this is what has put out in the
 

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.870
the this is what has put out in the
airwaves and the propaganda is

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880
airwaves and the propaganda is
 

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.709
airwaves and the propaganda is
convenient there as part of the

00:41:34.709 --> 00:41:34.719
convenient there as part of the
 

00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:36.449
convenient there as part of the
informational war but does not really

00:41:36.449 --> 00:41:36.459
informational war but does not really
 

00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:38.849
informational war but does not really
define what actually is driving the the

00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:38.859
define what actually is driving the the
 

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:41.459
define what actually is driving the the
conflict so yeah how yeah there's a

00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:41.469
conflict so yeah how yeah there's a
 

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:43.079
conflict so yeah how yeah there's a
complex basis as how you're rising seas

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:43.089
complex basis as how you're rising seas
 

00:41:43.089 --> 00:41:44.219
complex basis as how you're rising seas
but I think some of the things that I

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:44.229
but I think some of the things that I
 

00:41:44.229 --> 00:41:45.390
but I think some of the things that I
think we could we could justify and

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400
think we could we could justify and
 

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.859

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240
and so yeah that's that's about how you
 

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.760
and so yeah that's that's about how you
structure the deal how you structure the

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:01.770
structure the deal how you structure the
 

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.020
structure the deal how you structure the
engagement the

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.030

what happens afterwards and also
 

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.770
what happens afterwards and also

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780
accepting that it's possible that's
 

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.210
accepting that it's possible that's
something which would look like a deal

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220
something which would look like a deal
 

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.720

broadly I think that the more that

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:40.170
broadly I think that the more that
 

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:42.350
broadly I think that the more that
happens the more difficult it is to

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:42.360
happens the more difficult it is to
 

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.720

achieve stability and to a G on to

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:44.730

so definitely anybody working for
 

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.320
so definitely anybody working for
stability wants to watch that process

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:54.330
stability wants to watch that process
 

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.990
