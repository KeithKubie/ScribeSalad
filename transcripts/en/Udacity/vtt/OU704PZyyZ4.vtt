00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.500
When writing software, code reuse is the practice of writing generalized code

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
that can be relied upon to address a variety of similar goals.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.570
Whenever you notice that two parts of your code have similarities,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.920
there's an opportunity to factor out the similar aspects of it

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.600
into some reusable library code.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.680
So that you won't have to repeat yourself in either of the two original places
