Points are good and we use them a lot when we look at real world data, but

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:07.449
what's even better than a point? A line. This is an example of a line on a

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:11.492
coordinate plane. Now this line might not seem that interesting, but its got a

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:15.460
whole personality that we're going to talk about. Notice that this line has a

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.801
ton of points on it. I have points here, here, here and even anywhere along this

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:24.022
line all of these are points, but there are two points on this line that I find

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:28.477
most interesting. I want you to check the two most mathmatically interesting

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:32.487
points on this line and I should say this is a debatable one. So if you get a

00:00:32.487 --> 00:00:36.582
different answer from me it just means we are thinking differently which is

00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:36.957
okay.
