00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.590
In this recitation, we'll be
going over the basic steps

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.420
in building, solving, and
analyzing a linear optimization

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.920
model.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.380
The problem we will
use to demonstrate this

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.000
comes from Google AdWords, which
is the advertising system used

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.720
by Google.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.830
Let's begin by talking a
little bit about Google.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.740
As you may know, Google is a
major company in the United

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.740
States that provides
products and services related

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.330
to the internet.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.280
Google's official
mission statement

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.350
is to organize the
world's information,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.350
and to make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.480
Although Google today
develops a variety of products

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.590
that includes things such
as the Android operating

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.020
system, the Google Glass
wearable computer, and even

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.390
self-driving cars,
Google became famous--

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.250
and is still most widely known--
for its search engine, which

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.489
can be found at www.google.com.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.980
The search engine lets
the user enter a query.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.789
Google then searches
through the web pages

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.700
accessible on the internet,
to return links to websites

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.120
that best fit the search query.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.370
Now, how did Google come about?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.650
Well, the idea of
Google originated

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.800
as a research project
of two people--

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.770
Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.030
This was in 1996,
while they were still

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
graduate students at
Stanford University.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.910
Their idea, in a nut shell,
was to measure the importance

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.120
of a web page to a
particular query,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
not just by measuring how much
that query occurs in that web

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.610
page, but also by considering
the links to that web page

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.620
from other web pages.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.250
They quickly found
that this idea could

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.080
form the core of
a search engine,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.009
and they found that the
search engine actually

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.700
worked quite well.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.560
They eventually named it Google.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.830
And in 1998, they incorporated
Google as a company.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.380
In the same year, they
received their first funding.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.360
At the time, they had a database
of 60 million web pages.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.000
Six years later, Google's
initial public offering

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.090
took place, and Google became
a publicly traded company.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.020
After going public,
Google has continued

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.880
to grow at an immense pace,
acquiring other internet

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.970
companies like YouTube in 2007.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.800
In 2013, Google's traffic
reached more than a billion

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.850
unique monthly visitors.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.610
Today, more than two-thirds
of all the searches

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.890
done on the internet are powered
by Google's search engine.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.240
Now, you may be rather surprised
to hear that Google does not

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.400
actually make any money
directly from its search engine.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.930
In fact, Google's search engine
is free for anyone to use.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.920
So then, how does
Google make money?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.030
And the answer is --
through online advertising.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.790
Basically, Google sells space on
its web pages-- in particular,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.120
results of its search
queries-- to outside companies.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.660
These companies can then
place advertisements, or ads,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.090
on these spaces.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.940
Let's take a look at
a concrete example.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540
So here we have a screen shot of
the results of a Google search.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.260
The query here was "nine
inch nails tickets".

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.680
Nine Inch Nails-- if you're
not familiar with it--

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.710
is a critically acclaimed
industrial rock band

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.760
from the United States, that
recently toured North America.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.860
On this page, there are only two
search results-- here and here.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.910
The first is a link
to Ticketmaster,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.590
which is a company that
sells concert tickets.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.280
The second is to the tour
page of Nine Inch Nails'

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.990
official website.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.130
All the remaining links
on this web page are ads.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.820
In this case, these
are mostly links

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.530
to other third-party
companies that resell tickets.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.930
Now, you may be asking,
why do companies

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.560
advertise with Google?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.480
Well, there are several reasons.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.860
As you saw a few
slides back, Google

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.260
receives a lot of internet
traffic, as a lot of users

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.980
conduct searches on Google.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.550
So an ad placed
on Google could be

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.630
seen by a very large
number of users.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.960
At the same time, Google's web
pages-- and the ads in them--

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.830
are formatted in a very
clean, visually appealing way.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.720
Lastly, companies that
advertise with Google

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.930
can select which queries their
ads will be displayed for.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.350
This is a very useful feature,
because a company can then

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.420
target specific
customers that they

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.360
think are likely to
buy their product,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.540
or to use their service.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.640
Google's online advertising
system is known as AdWords

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.440
and is responsible
for more than 97%

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.820
percent of Google's revenues.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.190
In the next video, we'll
go into more detail

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.409
about the components
of the AdWords system.
