When people say, "that's not a color found
in nature!" they're always talking about neon

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:16.890
green or hot pink, but you know what they
SHOULD be talking about? Blue!

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.529
Blue is a tough color. Yes, the sky appears
blue and water APPEAR blue (even though they're

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.539
actually not). Though some birds, plants,
and butterflies display the color blue, it's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.270
actually a super rare color in nature because
it's REALLY difficult for nature to create,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.430
especially since half of the world names blue
their favorite color. ComicCon is coming up,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.390
and in honor of my anime and cosplay-loving
friends heading down there, sorry we don't

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.480
have blue hair… nature, ya know?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
The eye evolved 600 million years ago. Before
that, the organisms on earth KNEW there was

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.980
a sun because they could feel its energy.
Eventually, a predator likely evolved a better

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.399
way to perceive some that energy and catch
prey! That was a huge change in evolution,

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.569
suddenly, color was incredibly important for
survival. This new predator kicked off a multi-million-year

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:11.759
race to evolve colors to indicate danger,
to camouflage, or for sex-differentiation

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.799
to hide the breeding females!

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.479
Color in the animal kingdom comes from a variety
of evolutionary tools. Yellows, oranges, and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.649
reds come from carotenoids in our diet. Cardinals'
red comes from insects and berries, and flamingos

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.609
absorb carotenoids from algae and tiny animals
to become pink (without it, they're just white).

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.569
And when we eat red, yellow and orange foods,
animals can use those pigments to create color,

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.859
but if you fed flamingos blueberries, it wouldn't
turn them blue… blue isn't as easy to suck

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.529
up… So, instead of using pigments, animals
evolved physical structures to reflect light

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.130
in just the right way.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.789
By analyzing hundreds of birds, scientists
at the Argonne National Laboratory found keratin

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.039
inside of the cells of the feathers. Keratin
is the same stuff that makes up hooves, hair,

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.959
horns, fingernails, et cetera. As the cell
grows, the keratin molecules INSIDE the cells

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.099
separate from the water in the cell, and once
the feather is mature and the cells die, the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.709
water evaporates, leaving this keratin structure
-- which refracts light at JUUUST the right

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.430
angles to cancel out the yellow and red wavelengths,
and only BLUE is reflected! This is called

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.860
structural color, as opposed to pigmented
color. Our skin can use pigmentation to make

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.659
combinations of browns, reds, and yellows,
but not blues… or greens, actually.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.689
Snakes and frogs aren't actually green, for
example, but they want to hide by sitting

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.329
in trees or on lilypads… so they needed
to evolve green! Since they can't make blue

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.579
pigment and green pigment, they evolved YELLOW
pigment to their skin, and a blue structural

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:54.010
color too! Boom green. When smooth greensnakes
die, that yellow pigment fades, leaving just

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.590
the structures which create blue… So, even
though blue isn't a common color in nature,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.280
it can exist, it's just tough. Somehow, thanks
to a roll of evolutionary die, fungi, insects,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.159
plants and crustaceans evolved blue pigmentation,
but not us vertebrates, and though we don't

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.620
know exactly why… at least we can fake it.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.489
Have you ever had blue hair? I had red hair
that glowed in blacklight when i was in college.

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.769
It was sick...
