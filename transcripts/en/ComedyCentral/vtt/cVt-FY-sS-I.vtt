00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.768
I don't like new positive Dan.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.069
Man, alright. Let's just ...

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.737
Me and Shane don't like it.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.341
Ooh, you're new boyfriend!
He's single, white femaling me.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm just saying, you know,
he came over to watch the game.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.980
We shared some depressing times
together. Some good food.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.281
Is this 'cause
he's an Eagles fan?

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.482
I won't be an Eagles fan.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.586
Laughs. I wasn't done
explaining our night.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:23.022
Sweet dessert treats.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.424
That's great.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:29.763
Some high fives were involved.
Wings! He loves wings.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.033
This is the most petty...
I like petty Jay.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.234
It's hit's favorite food, wings.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.469
Yeah. Petty Jay.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.337
Wow.
You went on the offense there

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.872
when I was getting
ready to say ...

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.474
No, hell yeah,
I went on the offense.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.976
There's not a radio slut
in this world that could take

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.812
the place of my Danny Soder.
That's what I was gonna say!

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.013
I don't care, I'm already out.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.247
While you were uncorking on me.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.682
I'm already packed up.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.918
Being scorned
by my radio husband.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.488
For a man that I brought around.
I basically ...

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.923
You're not scorned.
I honestly got ...

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.591
This is like when
a rich guy hires,

00:00:58.624 --> 00:00:59.792
when like the wife is like,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.061
"We need a nanny.
Get an au pair."

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.497
And then this Brazilian girl
comes in and the husbands like,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.232
"I'm gonna marry the au pair.
You're out of here."

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.068
And she's like ...
That's what I am!

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.171
Shane and me both think

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.739
you'd look really good
on a long board.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.243
Dude, I'm so uncoordinated
that a long board

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.511
would result in my death.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.213
I've never put two feet
on a skateboard in my life.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.414
It's never happened one time.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.715
Not once?
Not one time ever!

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:23.916
Should we do a ...

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.184
Here's what I do
I put my foot ...

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.954
Should we do a Bonfire X Games?
We ride skateboards?

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.188
Dude ...

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.423
For the heart of shame?

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.058
If I could get on one
I'd be impressed with myself.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.292
I've always put
one foot on it.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.527
Yeah.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.529
I roll it back and forth
a couple times. I go, no way.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.797
Really?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.933
I've done that a hundred times
in my life.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.568
I'm like a baby deer.
I can't skate at all.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.404
When I see a guy run and jump
onto a skateboard

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.140
and start skating I go,
you might as well ...

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.341
Suck your own ass.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.343
That guy could probably
do brain surgery.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.879
Yeah. He could probably do
a standing back flip.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.147
Yeah. No doubt.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.548
Yeah. You know what's weird,
when you see...

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.450
But I also believe
standing back flip,

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:02.188
again, if I believed in myself,
I could achieve that.

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.389
You know ...

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.624
Much like a kid,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.892
if I just believed
I could accomplish it ...

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.193
Yeah.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.162
And saw the follow
through in my head,

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.429
the same way I told him here

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:12.832
where I did Comedy Jam
in Phoenix

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.368
when I was gonna get on
the front of the bar to sing.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.602
Yeah.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:17.837
And it was like a bar

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.238
that I definitely could've
pushed myself up

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.673
and planted my foot.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:23.843
But all I saw in my head
going up for it,

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:26.846
I was just like,
I'm gonna miss it,

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.915
end up throwing my knee
up there last minute nervous,

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.683
and then have to roll
onto a bar.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.752
And you can't be a fat guy

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.687
rolling onto a bar
to go sing a song.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.722
That's what they kick
fat people out of bars for.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.660
When we, I went and saw St.
Paul and The Broken Bones

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.295
with Ari Shaffir and Greg

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.596
Fucking hipster brag.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.997
Yeah, it's real hipster
brag sure.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.366
But the guy got stuck
on the amp crawling up, 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.503
he's like kind of a chubby dude
in like a leopard print suit,

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.971
and he like "aah",

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.873
and he's singing
and he goes "Aah",

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.841
and just stayed
where he was at.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.610
Scott, I'm actually
gonna need a little help.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:58.811
Aah. Yeah.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:02.048
Seriously guys, my knees
caught in a funny way.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.382
"Aah."

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:05.218
And I was like, dude,
this guy's not getting down.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:10.389
And he's just singing.
And this is his voice (singing),

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:14.627
And he's just on this amp.
"Oh shit!"

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.828
Stuck.
Yeah, it was great.

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.029
I love it. Just stuck.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:19.699
And you watch him after
the song be like, okay, alright

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.234
and then just
slowly back down.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.935
Dude, my first
Marilyn Manson concert

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:27.173
ever, he came out
on the stilts.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.808
He has this thing
where he comes out with stilts

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.509
and big crutch handles.

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.777
Yeah.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.981
And he's got a helmet on.
Like a weird leathery helmet

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.716
with a microphone
attached to it.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.651
And he's coming up
to sing this song ...

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.220
That does sounds also like
very 1800's circusy.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.488
Oh you can find videos
of the stilts.

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.789
Just 'cause helmet with stilts.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.024
Yeah. It's supposed
to look bizarre.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.225
And ...

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:47.460
The world's tallest man!

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.329
And he usually sings.
The mic just wasn't working.

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:53.032
And watching him
try at one point ...

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.234
watching someone scream rock

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.270
when you can't hear a word
they're saying.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:04:00.139
You just see like,
wide open mouths.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.775
Can I ask the question of,
if we don't have video of it,

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.877
was he walking around on the
stilts in like an evil way?

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.212
Yes.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.446
Was he trying to do a creepy ...

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.914
'Cause that takes ...
you have to be in character ...

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.216
And the mic wasn't working.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.984
So when you have a technical
failure your like,

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:15.087
"I'm coming ...
oh god damn it, guys!

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.723
I'm coming for your soul
and I'm coming ... ah man!"

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:22.094
So what he does is he just
ends up going like even funnier.

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:23.829
He gets angry.
He realizes it's not working.

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:25.064
Yeah.

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.833
And he throws
the crutch handles away.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.135
Mm-hmm.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:32.772
And watching somebody huff off
in three foot high stilts

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:35.107
is one of the funniest ...
'cause he throws the things,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.142
you see he's yelling
at somebody offstage,

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.913
and then has to go (singing)

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.114
Ah dude!

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:45.451
Like an old Uncle Sam.
"Hey everybody!"

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.055
I bet it does blunt the blow
to watch the person

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.956 line:76%
that's about to yell at you
walk over in cirus fashion.

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.224 line:71%
Yeah.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.193
Where you're like, I'm about to
get yelled at by a guy on stilts

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:56.395
so this won't be as bad
as if he was grounded.

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:58.731
Yeah. Guys sorry,
quick little technical issue.

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:00.533
I have to go back stage.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:06.872
Just a stilt walk.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:09.542
Everyone just enjoy this balloon
animal twister

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:11.577
while I go over here and get
this technical problem handled.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.014
Sometimes evil doesn't work
with it's microphone.

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:18.884
Sometimes people, the circus
brings you live entertainment

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:20.619
that goes awry.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.655
If we could just take
a quick intermission right now,

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.357
watch this bear
running on a ball!

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.160
Back when the circus
meant something!

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:29.662
Yeah, that's right,
animal rights' activists!

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.097
Before we cared about elephants.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.732
Before we started thinking
about how elephants take it.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.066
Stupid ass elephants.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.736
How many people do elephants
kill a year Christine?

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.003
Let's get those numbers!

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:39.638
No one's talking
about those numbers!

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:43.976
You gotta ... it's funny
to think like, a subject

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.345
that no one's been provocative
about, but you're like,

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:47.847
I'm gonna be provocative
about that.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.215
Like, bring back the circus.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:50.449
And they're like,
why is this your

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.717
hill to die on?

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.952
Because I miss it.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.587
Because the circus use
to do cool shit.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.188
I want an excuse to wear
a glow necklace.

00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:57.390
Yeah, oh man.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.758
There'd be so many animal
rights' activists

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.093
that be like, this is the enemy
we've always wanted.

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:02.294
Hell yeah.
This is the guy ...

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:04.363
Let's do it.
Bring back the circus.

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:05.631
The Bonfire circus.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:07.366
The Bonfire ...
hashtag bring back the circus.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.269
Where's the circus?
Everyone likes the circus!

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:13.672
Extra animal cruelty!
I don't want no more accidents!

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.341
I'm talking about ...
let's go Roman.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:16.675
You fucking whip these animals
into shape.

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:17.910
Whatever it takes!

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:19.779
Let's go Roman.
Humans versus animals.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:22.014
Let's make it count
for something.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:25.317
Bring back the circus.
Lions fight prisoners.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.120
And Catholics.
Specifically Catholics.

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:29.321
Catholic prisoners.

00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:32.625
We go weird, odd one thing.
Oh man.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.760
We lure them in the fighting
religion in prison,

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:36.128
and then we feed them
to lions.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.364
Shout out to Marilyn Manson
for sponsoring us.

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.633
He's going to be
our dark overlord.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.002
Do walking off ...

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.804
do you have a picture
of him on those stilts?

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.338
There's probably
a video of it going,

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.808
but I assume it was the first
and only time it ever happened.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.142
What that he had
technical issues on ...

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:51.377
Stilts.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.711
Stilts
Yeah.

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:55.381
'Cause stilt walking is
such a ridiculous thing ...

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:56.749
Yeah but without the stilts

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.884
doing like the creepy
spider thing,

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:01.687
and you just angrily ...
it's just a clunky ...

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.055
Yeah, you have to clunk off.

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:05.524
Yeah, 'cause here he's like,
"I'll kill you and ..."

00:07:05.557 --> 00:07:07.260
Oh, look at it.
It looks fun!

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.263
Yeah with the crutch handles
it looks super fun!

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:14.934
Can you imagine just coming out
and just scaring someone?

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.669
Just coming around the corner
like,

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:19.071
if you could move
on that fucking thing!

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:20.272
Answer your door with it.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:21.507
Yeah.
And ...

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.743
And then you go,
"Oh, I'll just take that."

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:27.313
Holy shit!

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.948
Why do you have that!
You go, "hey!"

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.816
Soders moving like
a giant spider!

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.585
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.054
What's up guys? I'm here
for the fantasy football draft.

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:40.159
"Hey guys. Table for two."
Walk through and come down.

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:42.361
"Do you guys have two?
High tops would be preferable."

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:45.531
Two tickets for The Hate
You Give. We'll take the stairs.

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.601
Oh, no need. Just trying to be
on an escalator

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.002
all fucking tight
in those things.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:51.604
But you can even picture
watching this.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.673
He throws those crutches away,
he looks like a doofus.

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:59.845
Yeah. Evil rock and roll
goes corny real quick.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.514
Yeah. As soon as you
get back stage

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.682
and went into a brightly
lit dressing room.

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.017
Yeah. And you like ...

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.919
And you're just sweaty
and covered in makeup.

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:09.121
Yeah, that's why
I was always ...

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:11.757
And you have to go,
"Isaac, can you get me a towel?"

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:13.926
That's where our age difference
is,

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:16.562
it's because like Motley Cru
and the hair rock

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:19.565
and like the glam metal
of the 80's to me was ridiculous

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:21.433
'cause I was young enough
that it was over

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.735
by the time
I was into music.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:23.936
Yeah.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:25.604
So I was like, oh these guys
are just wearing makeup?

00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:27.640
But they're like,
it was so cool at the time.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.375
And I'm like, okay.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.378
It was just cool in like,
a place.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.180
Because no one
in my neighborhood

00:08:35.213 --> 00:08:36.982
at that time went ...

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:39.618
Here's what they would do,
the goofy hair for sure.

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:40.920
Yeah.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.621
A half top tank top.

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:44.023
Great.
Without a doubt.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.524
That's what I think
we should bring back.

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:49.895
But no one went full blown like,
makeup and

00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:51.130
Glam metal.
It's a shame dude.

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.331
Yeah.

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:54.066
"Look What the Cat Dragged In"?
Killer tune.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:55.634
Got some good fucking tunes
those hair bands,

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:56.835
but man it was such a ...

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:58.203
But do you know what I'm saying?
Like it's ...

00:08:58.236 --> 00:08:59.438
Such a genre of music.

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:02.007
It's always funny to me
that also the satanic rock,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.743 line:76%
when you look back at it,
you're like, this isn't scary.

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.579 line:71%
Like Guar maybe holds up.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:09.014
It's like, well, that's pretty
fucking terrifying and weird,

00:09:09.047 --> 00:09:10.916
but when you see
Marilyn Manson ...

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:12.785
like teenagers now wouldn't be
like, oh that guy's evil.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.119
They'd be like ...

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:15.354
Oh, Marilyn Manson
being dangerous now?

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:16.622
Yeah.
It's like, no.

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:17.890
Yeah, that's what I mean.
You know what I mean?

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.558
If you say that fat neck guy
who fucked Juice

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.794
on Son's of Anarchy?
And you'd be right.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.262
Yeah. But like Ozzy!

00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:25.931
Ozzy's like another one
where in the '70s there like,

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:27.199
he bit heads of bats.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:28.634
He was just crazy.
And now he's like ...

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.403
Oh, forget even that.
How about when he went and ...

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:32.871
In hair metal
you gotta remember,

00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:35.207
Ozzy was famous
through hair metal.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.508
Yeah!

00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.110
So ...
I mean, Ozzy's a legend.

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:39.311
So Ozzy went ...

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:40.579
But I'm saying, the whole evil
thing ...

00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:41.847
Ozzy went hair metal at a point.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.416
No, I'm saying
he dropped evil quick ...

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:45.718
The way that Kiss went disco?

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.919
And went ...

00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:48.520
Dude, bring up the Shot
in The Dark video of Ozzy.

00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:49.754
Its' the the funniest ...

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:51.523
It'll make you be like, was
this guy really looked at ...

00:09:51.556 --> 00:09:52.791
Yeah.

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:53.993
Like that dangerous?

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:55.227
Well you know what's ...

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.230
as a wrestling fan,
Hogan Knows Best

00:09:58.263 --> 00:10:00.265
like completely ruined
Hulk-a-mania because I was ...

00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.533
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.636
You just see him get yelled
at by his wife.

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.838
And she's like, "Terry,
you didn't do this right!"

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.140
And you're like,
Hulks kicked out of the ...

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:09.875
That takes that away too,
and I get what you're saying

00:10:09.908 --> 00:10:11.877
about Ozzy seeing him
on The Osborne Show.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.112
That's what I mean!

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.881
It's killed ... you just have
to enjoy his music

00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:19.451
because before that,
watching a guy be evil ...

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:21.587
Yeah.
Being glam evil ...

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.322
Glam evil, glam evil's ...

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.590
Is one of the gayest
things ever.

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.858
Yeah.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.793
I mean with teased
Chip and Dale's hair.

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.061
Is this the video?

00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:30.529
We're just going through
some technical issues.

00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:32.931
Listen guys, here at
The Bonfire, we're human.

00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:34.700
We have technical issues,
we start late sometimes because
it doesn't work.

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:35.934
That's what happens.

00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:38.871
Sometimes our Ozzy videos
don't load properly,

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:43.008
but you can change this
by Go Funding my ...

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.276
Bring back the circus.

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:48.447
Jimmy, bring back the circus
and Dan Soder's Jimmy G tour.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.582
I leave the show, Shane comes
in.

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:51.917
Potato, potato.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.919
I'm following that
handsome son of a bitch,

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:55.655
racking up
W's next season.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.158
You're gonna be his motivator?
His personal motivator?

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.360
Yeah. In a poncho.
It'll all come together.

00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:02.828
Oh, what's wrong?
We can't watch the video?

00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:04.563
I'm not getting an official
for Shot In The Dark.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:05.798
Really?

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.266
There's live performances ...

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.500
That upsets me.

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:11.804
It's such a ridiculous video.
Try to find it on something.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.138
Yeah.
It's a ridiculous video.

00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.175
But Marilyn Manson never went,
he didn't change.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.010
You know? Like I was trying
to think what would be the ...

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:19.211
What?

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:22.281
But I'm saying Marilyn Manson,
what did he change to?

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.817
He went that ...
he did all the goth shit.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.218
Yeah.

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.187
It was like the goth
Willy Wonka shit.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.355
Then it was the goth,
more like Nine Inch Nails,

00:11:30.388 --> 00:11:31.623
leather straps and evil ...

00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:32.891
Oh.

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.260
No, but then the next album
he went like glam rock.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:36.729
Like The Dope Show
and all that shit.

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:37.996
like completely changed.
Really?

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:41.133
Yeah, he followed David
Bowie's trajectory in like,

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.302
you know a much
less accessible way.

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:45.738
I'm not gonna lie,
I did not know

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:46.972
Marilyn Manson went that deep.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.207
You don't remember that whole,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.908
when he wore the tits
on the album cover?

00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.277
That when I was like,
being introduced to him.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.213
Like, by the time I caught
wind of Marilyn Manson ...

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:55.447
But you've seen ...
Yeah.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.649
Before that it was all like the
gothic and ...

00:11:57.682 --> 00:11:58.984
I saw all that, but ...

00:11:59.017 --> 00:12:00.819
And then he went back
to the goth thing.

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:02.688
To me that was like, oh yeah,
that's Marilyn Manson.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:03.956
Yeah.

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.324
That's how I learned
about Marilyn Manson.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.525
Yeah but that whole thing ...

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:07.726
It was Mechanical Animals.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.994
When you see him
when he's young,

00:12:09.027 --> 00:12:11.296
I mean, he's just a goofy,
skinny, ugly kid

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.531 line:71%
with straggly long hair.

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:13.766 line:71%
Yeah.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.367
And then he became
a beautiful piece of art.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.568
Yeah.

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.170
And I mean that,
but I have to say it like

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:19.371
I'm just joking when I say it.

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:20.606
Yeah, but you really do.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.840
I really do.
You hold on to that.

00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:23.776
You go, "aah,
I really do love you."

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.644
You beautiful piece of art.

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:29.581
I should have fucking had the
cheek of dick when I said that.

00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:32.117
Yeah, hold on. Or just stroke
one out of your mouth.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.853
You're like, "aah,
beautiful piece of art."

00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:36.655
He became a beautiful
piece of art.

00:12:37.622 --> 00:12:39.658
The second picture down
in the second row,

00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:40.893
the second to the left.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.194
Yeah, him having a regular
conversation

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:45.264
outside of a brick wall in
that outfit is pure buffoonery.

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:47.433
He looks like a hooker
pushed to the point.

00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:52.271
You know what, I'm just gonna
go back and sell Cut Co.

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:53.505
Knives for the summer

00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:54.940
and then I'm gonna go
back to beauty school.

00:12:54.973 --> 00:12:57.176
Yeah, the Johns like it
when I dress a little weird.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.944
They like to call me,
they call me Mad Max.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:00.312
A lot of people don't know is

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:02.615
that I could take out
six of my front teeth.

00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:05.484
I'm like a snake.
I can unbuckle.

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:07.286
Oh, the video does not exist?

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:09.454
That's why everywhere
I'm finding it on weird sites,

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:11.223 line:68%
when you play it it says
the video doesn't exist.

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:13.392 line:68%
Did Sharon Osborne flex
that fucking disappearing power?

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.660
Oh, no.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:17.696
Was she like, "I want it gone,
and I want it gone yesterday!"

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:21.133
Ask why you can't find
the Shot in The Dark video.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:22.701
'Cause Ozzy knows
what's out there.

00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:24.436
"Sharon, before I die,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.405
Clean all of my glam?

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.073
please take down
the Shot In The Dark video."

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:31.076
"I didn't know
what I was doing."

00:13:31.643 --> 00:13:35.280
I like all of his glam.
He wants his glam submerged.

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:37.649
I didn't know he went glam.
I mean ...

00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:40.185
This is the song.
This is his hair rock for sure.

00:13:40.218 --> 00:13:41.486
That video ...

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.255
You like this song?

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:44.623
This is not my favorite
Ozzy song

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.726
but I probably because the video
he looks so stupid that I ....

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:48.994 line:71%
You remember it?

00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:50.195 line:71%
Oh, yeah! It's burned in my ...

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:52.297 line:76%
He's wearing like
a Liberace wizard cape.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.132
Bing it! Go to Bing!
Jacob how ...

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:57.169
You can get a still of
just his hair poofed out.

00:13:57.202 --> 00:13:58.437
And his hair ...

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.738
I'm finding ...
I'm still searching.

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.807
He's got Swasey Chip
and Dale's hair.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.075
Oh man. By the way ...

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:04.576
He looks like an idiot!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.579
Can I just say the first time
like, this is the first time I
felt like 

00:14:07.612 --> 00:14:08.747
this radio show is like a
submarine.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.349
'Cause I'm like, "Christine,
you can just Bing it."

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:12.517
She's like,
"I'm trying everything I got.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.386
I'm getting nothing on this."

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:17.289
He goes, the powers out.
The whole thing. I dunno.

00:14:17.322 --> 00:14:19.358
Our backup generators
all fucked up.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.659
The whole grids blown.

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:22.227
I don't know what's going on.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.196
Yeah, there's a link
on VH1 Classics,

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:27.232
but then the videos
not actually there.

00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:28.533
It's not a classic?

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:29.735
I thought it was a classic.

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:30.936
VH1 doesn't think
it's a classic?

00:14:30.969 --> 00:14:33.906
What if I told you the video
was never filmed?

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:35.207
Did you Bing it?

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.942
Yeah.

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:39.445
Type in the word
'tit fuck' also.

00:14:39.978 --> 00:14:41.947
Oh dude, should we take a break
and then come back

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.783
for that clip?
We gotta start with that clip.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.053
Let's also see in the break
if we can find this Ozzy

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:50.122
Osbourne video because it's
worth putting it out there.

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:53.359
I mean, he looks ridiculous.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.527
Yeah, I wanna see it.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.429
Is this ...
would this be the video here?

00:14:57.462 --> 00:14:59.732
Yes! That would be
the video for sure.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.969
Why did they have it scrubbed?
I always find it interesting

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:05.370
when shit's scrubbed
from the internet ...

00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:07.539
Chris Rock's first pitch
and this.

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:10.409
That's what been scrubbed.

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:17.316
And now my favorite worst
comic ever video from YouTube.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.617
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.818
Your favorite bomb.

00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.754
I know, it was my favorite.
But whatever. No one cares.

00:15:22.787 --> 00:15:24.356
Shot in the dark.

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:25.958
Shane already made me feel
pretty good about it.

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.526
What did you just say?

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.894
What? I didn't say
anything dude.

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.662
I love you so much.
Let's take a break.

00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:31.930
It's "The Bonfire."

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:33.666
Poncho dance coming.
