00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.470
- There's something really appealing

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.540
with anything, to taking it apart,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.750
and finding out how it works.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.790
It's like seeing the world
through the eyes of a kid.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.623
How does this work?

00:00:08.623 --> 00:00:09.900
You take it apart and figure it out,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.370
and we don't get to do that with

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.160
phones and computers because

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.993
they're inscrutable.

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:14.826
They're black boxes.

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:16.980
But something that's got gears and metal

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.720
and screws and things in it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.490
that is fully powered by a little spring

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.480
that's inside of it,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080
that you can take apart and
figure out how it works.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.440
I'm Samir Patel, Deputy
Editor of Atlas Obscura,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.620
and we're in mid-town Manhattan at the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.570
Horological Society of New York.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.403
- [Nick] Hello welcome.

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:34.236
- Hey, Samir.

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:35.110
- Samir, nice to meet you.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.943
I'm Nick.

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:38.320
- [Samir] I'm about to take
a class in watchmaking.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.730
So I think we're gonna take
a mechanical watch movement,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.580
and take the entire thing apart,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.020
and put the entire thing back together.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.580
I think it's going to go super poorly,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.900
but I'm gonna do my best,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.870
and we'll see if I can not completely

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270
destroy this watch movement.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.090
- [Nick] My name is Nicholas Manousos.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
I'm the President of the
Horological Society of New York.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.170
We're housed in the General
Society building on 44th Street.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.550
The Horological Society
was founded in 1866

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.100
and is one of the world's
oldest continuously

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.380
operating watchmaking associations.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.210
Today, we are a 501c3 non-profit

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.510
and we focus on education.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.750
Education for the public.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.390
Our mission is to teach
as many people as possible

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.600
everything about horology.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.860
We're going to teach horology 101,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.730
then we teach the basics of what makes

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.060
a mechanical watch tick.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.550
So now we're gonna take
a look at the tools

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.420
that you have in front of you.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.253
- [Samir] Yeah.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.930
- [Nick] So the correct way
to use these screwdrivers

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410
is to hold them like this
and put your pointer finger

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.334
on the top.

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.810
So, what this does is it
stabilizes the screwdriver.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.643
[Samir] Yup.

00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:37.440
[Nick] And the tweezers are
pretty similar to the ones

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.310
you probably have at home
except that they're very sharp.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.010
I have stabbed myself with them before.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.843
It's not fun.

00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:44.540
Anytime you want to touch something,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.210
hold something down, push
something in the movements,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.410
instead of using your finger,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.120
we use the plastic point instead.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.260
And of course the loupe.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.140
So, the loupe is a magnifying glass

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.810
you wear over one of your eyes.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.060
Okay, so let's get into it.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
- [Nick] So the first step
before taking apart the watch is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.010
letting the power down.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.020
It's kinda like a car.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.170
If you're gonna work on
the engine of the car,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.647
you would turn the
engine off first, right?

00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:10.570
So you're kinda gonna wanna
brace using your pinky,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.590
and then also get the
pointer in your hand.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.280
- My fingers have never felt
so fat than they do right now.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.890
I knew basically how timekeeping works,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.390
but just to understand when you
look at the back of a watch,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.120
or the inside of a movement,
what all these pieces are,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.250
and how they work in harmony,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.450
that's something I
don't feel like you feel

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.790
until you actually take it apart

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.190
and try and put it back together.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.140
So I was trying to watch where

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.460
you were putting your fingers

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.340
because holding the
thing is not necessarily

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.070
the most intuitive thing

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.670
to hold multiple things at once.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.400
- [Nick] There are certain
parts in watch movements

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.060
that require coordination,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.890
like putting a train-wheeled
bridge back into place,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.719
you need to line up three
different wheels at the same time.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.800
Each of those wheels
has a pivot that needs

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.360
to be in the exactly same place,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.400
and so watchmaking is not just

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.290
putting things together.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.320
It's also practicing focusing

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.590
and kinda meditating and
getting into the right zone

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.420
to be able to get things
back together again

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.680
inside of the mechanical movement.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.513
[Samir] They're all right there,

00:03:08.513 --> 00:03:09.346
they're all like

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:11.860
kissing the purple from the jewels but...

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.470
[Nick] You're very, very
close at this point.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.483
There you go.

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:16.316
[Samir] That did it.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:17.149
- [Nick] That's it.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.982
- [Samir] I just felt it click into place.

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:18.815
- [Nick] That was it, yup.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:19.648
- [Samir] The experience
of learning from Nick

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:22.960
was great because every time
something wasn't working

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.690
he would come in
immediate and diagnose it.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.990
It was often something simple like

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.630
I wasn't holding the screwdriver straight.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.450
He would say, tilt the screwdriver towards

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.283
your head a little bit,

00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:31.480
and then the screw would fall into place,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.020
and I would stop slipping
all over the place.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.440
It's clear he knows what he's doing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.700
and he knows what the pitfalls are

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.410
that people run into when they're

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.610
learning how to do this.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.156
- [Samir] My favorite
part was when you take

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:45.020
the balance wheel and the
balance spring and you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.100
dangle it, and it's
trembling in your fingers,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.930
and you set it down and
you bring your hand around,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.160
and drop it with your tweezers,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.910
and the watch just springs to life.

00:04:00.142 --> 00:04:00.975
[Nick] Perfect.

00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:01.808
Good job.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:02.641
You did it.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:03.474
[Samir] That's it, thank you.

00:04:03.474 --> 00:04:05.009
- [Nick] Congratulations.

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.842
You did a great job.

00:04:05.842 --> 00:04:07.820
You've got a second career in watchmaking

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.410
if you ever wanna make the switch.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.327
[Samir] Don't tempt me.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.670
- [Nick] I love teaching
new students because

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.220
the students come into the class

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.490
and they may be nervous,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.890
or they may not know exactly
what they're going to be doing,

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.870
and getting them through the entire class

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.730
to the very last step when they put the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.580
balance wheel back into the watch,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.930
and they see the watch come to life,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.260
it's magical.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.490
I see a smile come across their face

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.870
and it makes me feel good knowing that

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.130
I've taught them a little
something about horology,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.820
about mechanical watches,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.710
and it's just a good feeling
at the end of the day.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.253
I really enjoy teaching.
