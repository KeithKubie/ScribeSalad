00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:01.691
- [Instructor] So I have a curve here

00:00:01.691 --> 00:00:05.284
that represents y is equal to f of x,

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:06.682
and there's a classic problem

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.394
that mathematicians
have long thought about.

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:12.492
How do we find the area under this curve?

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.372
Maybe under the curve
and above the x-axis,

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:16.837
and let's say between two boundaries.

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:21.251
Let's say between x is equal
to a and x is equal to b.

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.246
So let me draw these
boundaries right over here.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:24.526
That's our left boundary.

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:27.342
This is our right boundary.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:31.538
And we want to think about
this area right over here.

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:33.793
Well, without calculus, you could actually

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:36.298
get better and better
approximations for it.

00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:37.639
How would you do it?

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.702
Well, you could divide this section

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:42.839
into a bunch of delta
x's that go from a to b.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.603
They could be equal sections or not,

00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:46.748
but let's just say, for
the sake of visualizations,

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:48.640
I'm gonna draw roughly
equal sections here.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.228
So that's the first.

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:52.494
That's the second.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:54.320
This is the third.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.134
This is the fourth.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:57.699
This is the fifth.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.861
And then we have the
sixth right over here.

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.944
And so each of these, this is delta x,

00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:04.992
let's just call that delta x one.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.813
This is delta x two.

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:10.567
This width right over here,
this is delta x three,

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.900
all the way to delta x n.

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:15.744
I'll try to be general here.

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:18.216
And so what we could do is,
let's try to sum up the area

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:19.898
of the rectangles defined here.

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:21.286
And we could make the height,

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:23.838
maybe we make the height

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:25.961
based on the value of the
function at the right bound.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:26.794
It doesn't have to be.

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.518
It could be the value of the function

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:30.503
someplace in this delta x.

00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:31.419
But that's one solution.

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:33.068
We're gonna go into a
lot more depth into it

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:34.522
in future videos.

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:35.978
And so

00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:37.414
we do that.

00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:40.231
And so now we have an
approximation, where we could say,

00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:42.528
look, the area of each of these rectangles

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:45.645
are going to be f of x sub i,

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:47.963
where maybe x sub i is the right boundary,

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:51.463
the way I've drawn it, times delta x i.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.535
That's each of these rectangles.

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:57.206
And then we can sum them up,

00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:01.623
and that would give us an
approximation for the area.

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:03.929
But as long as we use a finite number,

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.145
we might say, well, we
can always get better by

00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.124
making our delta x's smaller

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:12.211
and then by having more
of these rectangles,

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:15.131
or get to a situation
here we're going from

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:16.830
i is equal to one

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.240
to i is equal to n.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.962
But what happens is delta x

00:02:20.962 --> 00:02:23.428
gets thinner and thinner and thinner,

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:25.575
and n gets larger and larger and larger,

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.733
as delta x gets infinitesimally small

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:31.719
and then as n approaches infinity.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.778
And so you're probably sensing something,

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.858
that maybe we could think about the limit

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.844
as we could say as n approaches infinity

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:41.809
or the limit as delta x

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.269
becomes very, very, very, very small.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.603
And this notion of getting
better and better approximations

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:50.531
as we take the limit as
n approaches infinity,

00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:54.114
this is the core idea
of integral calculus.

00:02:57.253 --> 00:02:59.743
And it's called integral calculus

00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:03.189
because the central operation we use,

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.517
the summing up of an infinite number

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.978
of infinitesimally thin things
is one way to visualize it,

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:10.253
is the integral,

00:03:10.253 --> 00:03:12.242
that this is going to be the integral,

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:14.686
in this case, from a to b.

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:15.983
And we're gonna learn in a lot more depth,

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:20.150
in this case, it is a
definite integral of f of x,

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:22.080
f of x, dx.

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.030
But you can already
see the parallels here.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.374
You can view the integral
sign as like a sigma notation,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.679
as a summation sign, but
instead of taking the sum

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.196
of a discrete number of things

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.544
you're taking the sum of an infinitely,

00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:37.907
an infinite number,
infinitely thin things.

00:03:37.907 --> 00:03:40.691
Instead of delta x, you now have dx,

00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.600
infinitesimally small things.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.454
And this is a notion of an integral.

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.177
So this right over here is an integral.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:50.141
Now what makes it interesting to calculus,

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.039
it is using this notion of a limit,

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.087
but what makes it even more powerful

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.602
is it's connected to the
notion of a derivative,

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.449
which is one of these beautiful
things in mathematics.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.747
As we will see in the
fundamental theorem of calculus,

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:05.194
that integration, the
notion of an integral,

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:08.681
is closely, tied closely to
the notion of a derivative,

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.076
in fact, the notion of an antiderivative.

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:14.100
In differential calculus,
we looked at the problem of,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.407
hey, if I have some function,
I can take its derivative,

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:20.160
and I can get the
derivative of the function.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.189
Integral calculus, we're
going to be doing a lot of,

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.327
well, what if we start
with the derivative,

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:26.744
can we figure out

00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:29.909
through integration,

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.322
can we figure out its antiderivative

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:34.917
or the function whose derivative it is?

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:37.420
As we will see, all of these are related.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.874
The idea of the area under a curve,

00:04:39.874 --> 00:04:41.041
the idea of a limit

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.500
of summing an infinite
number of infinitely things,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.827
thin things, and the notion
of an antiderivative,

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:50.994
they all come together in our
journey in integral calculus.
