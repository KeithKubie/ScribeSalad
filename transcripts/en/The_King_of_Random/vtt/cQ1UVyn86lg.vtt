00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.520
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.400
Today we are trying something out that hundreds of you have asked for down in the comments.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.640
We're going to see what happens when we put soda in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.200
We're gonna try this bunch of different ways. We're gonna put whole cans in the vacuum chamber still closed.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.720
We're gonna try warming up some cans and then putting them in the vacuum chamber.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.220
Weâ€™re gonna try putting open cans in and then we're also gonna try pouring soda into a different cup

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.740
and putting that in and learn all about what happens with soda in a vacuum. Let's get started

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.460
First off, we're gonna go with what I think might be the least exciting version of this experiment,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.400
we're just gonna open a can of soda put the whole thing down into the vacuum chamber and then pull out all the air

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.560
There we go got our can right in the center of our vacuum chamber

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.349
Pop the top on take out all the air

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.610
Here we go turning on the vacuum and pulling out the air. 3, 2, 1!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.390
So far nothing it's not even bubbling in the can yet.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.079
Oh now it's bubbling in the can a lot!

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.469
And out of the can... and off onto the bottom of the chamber.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.189
Just pouring out.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.780
I wonder how much of the soda will actually manage to pull out of the can and put on the bottom of the vacuum chamber

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.400
We've lost about a quarter of it out of the cans so far now.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.760
Now it's just bubbling a lot, it kind of looks like it's boiling inside the can.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.570
So something is still happening. Our pressure got to about 25 inches of mercury and then leveled off for a minute and now it is

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.239
Very slowly starting to pass that as it pulls all the excess gas out of our liquid

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.629
Now at some point and we may already be at that point it is just going to start boiling the water in the soda.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.700
Of course it won't be heating it up.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.189
It's just that with the lower pressure the boiling temperature of the water drops way down.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.909
While the bubbling is slowing down. It is still bubbling clearly, but there's less of it. Let's see what happens we turn off the vacuum.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.980
Just bubbling for just a minute. It is still

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639
Almost a perfect vacuum inside this chamber at this point.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.219
All right reintroducing some pressure. 3, 2, 1.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.840
Smells like soda. This vaporised soda alright, let's see how much of this can is lost.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.039
So we are down to about right here.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.769
So I think we lost almost a third of the contents of this can of soda as it bubbled out at the top.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.220
It's got soda floating around at the bottom of our chamber.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.439
Now I think the real test might be to see if there is any carbonation left in this or if it's just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.700
Flavored water at this point.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Cheers!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.180
It's about as flat as if you'd left it open for a couple of days on the counter.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.780
There's no fizz in it. It just pulled it right out. There you go! If you really like flat soda

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.069
Here's a way to make that happen very quickly. I don't recommend it.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.360
It's worse.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.269
Alright, that was pretty cool. Now the next one

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.078
I was gonna try was pouring some of our soda into a glass and putting that in the container

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.809
But you know what? I think it'll be more fun if I just pour it straight

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.199
Into our vacuum chamber with no glass in the middle get in the way

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.569
So I'm gonna pour in like four cans of it, and we'll see how much bubbling action we can get

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.199
Changed my mind I'm doing more than four I just hope it doesn't bubble so much that it gets all the way to the top.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200
I don't think it will.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.409
Well we've got some bubbling actions starting that's for sure.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.998
Now we've got lots of bubbling action starting. It looks like a pot of boiling soda.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.529
Gotta admit, I thought it would get a little bit more violent than that.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.229
I thought we'd have bigger bubble action with the bubbles climbing higher and sort of sticking together almost a foam.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.448
Pressure is still dropping a little bit. You can see we're getting slightly larger bubbles at this point.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.220
There's no longer any pressure outside of the bubbles to poke them and pop them.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.620
We now have considerably less surface bubbles, they're definitely dissipating.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.160
I think that means we've pulled most of the gas out of our soda.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.570
It's funny. How once you get down to almost a complete vacuum.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.709
The bubbles really occasionally start to get way bigger. You never have huge bubbles while there's still pressure in there.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.370
But once there's no pressure

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.840
Sometimes the bubbles get giant. It does look like some sort of mad scientist potion almost a glowing orange.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.020
Just bubbling even though. There's no heat source to it.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.789
There we go. I think we have fully deep pressurized these five cans worth of soda.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.559
So let's add the pressure back in and see what it's like. I'm guessing it's completely flat.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.340
Okay.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.249
Yeah, yeah, that's completely flat. So I guess it's more like Mountain Dew.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.660
Drink not soda.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.910
Just drink. If that's your thing. I guess that's fine. Not really mine

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.140
Let's move on to the next experiment!

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.779
So now we know what happens if we just put a whole bunch of soda into the container at once and suck all the air out.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.019
So now let's see what happens if we put a sealed can.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:58.190
Down into our chamber and pull all the air out. Will the pressure inside the can be enough to make it explode? Let's try it!

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.239
Very close to a complete vacuum at this point. Not a whole lot going on

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.630
That I'm seeing. We're not getting anywhere like this, so let's try something else.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.549
First thing I want to try is this same can at the same temperature, but I'm gonna shake it up a lot.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.410
Alright so in theory that should now have higher internal pressure to compete with a vacuum.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.500
Coming up on 26 and still nothing. :(

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.480
All right, not getting anywhere at this can let's try the next idea. :(

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.299
The YouTube channel Action Lab did a very similar experiment recently.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.650
And they had best results when they heated up their soda in a bath of warm water.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:06.419
So we're gonna try that. There we have it a nice big bowl full of hot water. It should get our soda nice and toasty.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.239
That's what everyone wants. Hot soda.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.230
Oh, they budged, I don't know what that means, but it budged.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.009
Hmm :/

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.109
Well even with the warm soda we are not getting much of a result. ;(

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:37.669
I've now tried just about everything I can think of to get this can to explode in the vacuum chamber

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.720
Short of boiling it. Since that's not really what we're going for

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.420
We're gonna try something else we're gonna switch to a different soda and see if this flavor

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.820
Has more carbonation in it and therefore more internal pressure than the Mountain Dew does.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.700
We're gonna combine all of our tricks together and see if we can get a good result.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.420
We're gonna heat one of these cans up in warm water.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.700
We'll shake it up a little bit

00:07:56.719 --> 00:08:01.519
And then we'll put it in our smaller vacuum chamber and see if we can finally get one of these cans to explode. :)

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.139
Oh! The bottom just distended so uh pretty sure this thing's gonna explode nicely.

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:19.849
Wow! :o

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:21.849
(lols)

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.449
It was at like!

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:31.818
Maybe 10 inches of mercury nowhere near a pullback. Like it escaped! It got out of the container! (omg)

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.239
That's how quickly that exploded, alright.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.219
So maybe

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.578
Shaking it wasn't terribly necessary.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.459
I've gots

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.639
Warm soda all over the place.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.820
Let's try it again with one that I don't shake that much see if just being warm is enough with this stuff.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.880
Apparently it needs a little shaking.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.839
Alright just being warm didn't do it. :( Let's try shaking it a little bit. Not as much as before.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.420
I thought I didn't shake it as much as before but apparently I shook it too much.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.139
Hmm that's kind of interesting look at how this broke.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.730
Just this one tiny little pinprick now all the pressures going against.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.430
It's just full warm flat soda at this point.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.219
But that tiny little spot is what broke open initially. Hurt my hand with how hard it hit.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.579
I'm gonna get another can I'm gonna shake it only like seriously just kind of like a back and forth see what that does.

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.900
Just the tiniest little bit.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:51.329
Now let's see how this goes.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.949
The bottom got expanded. Still waiting for that top to blow

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.470
Boom! :D

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.770
There it is! :D

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:25.980
Ha! It stood the can back up. The can fell over when the bottom popped down and then when it exploded it popped back up

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.270
That's hilarious!

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.249
It landed upright. All right. Let's let some pressure back in

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.900
It's got lemon-lime soda

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.829
Sprayed all over everything this is gonna be sticky

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.510
It's interesting to me how this breaks so the bottom

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:56.100
Expands a lot when the pressure starts building up too much, and then what actually comes off the top gets popped off of these cans

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.670
It just sort of tears through the sides of the metal

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.390
There you have it soda in a vacuum chamber in a number of different ways

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:09.000
We use the mountain dew with the cans cracked open and watched it erupted out of there is the pressure drop down we poured a

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.239
Whole bunch of our orange soda down into the vacuum chamber and just watch that

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.059
Bubble a whole lot as we reduce the pressure and then we tried to get our soda cans to explode while they were sealed and

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.740
We couldn't get it to work with the mountain dew

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.840
But I guess the lemon-lime soda has more

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.179
Carbonation in it because when we heated that up and shook it gently we were able to get that to explode in the vacuum chamber

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.940
I don't even know if the shaking was completely necessary

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.020
I think it just sped things up a little bit, and then on this can I shook it

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.770
And it just burst open without any vacuum pressure at all this tiny

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.189
Tiny little hole put out enough pressure that I actually hurt my hand

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.069
Where the jet of soda hit it this has been a lot of fun

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.090
Thanks for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with hats shirts and other cool merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.090
See you there

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.979
Can can't even handle it right now

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.760
I'm not funny
